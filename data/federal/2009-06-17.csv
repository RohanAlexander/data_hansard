3,Ms GILLARD,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (9.02 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Introduction The building and construction industry is a critical sector of our economy with immediate and direct impacts on jobs, growth and productivity. Its importance is demonstrated by the scale and scope of construction funding the Australian government has committed through the Nation Building and Jobs Plan which will result in 35,000 construction sites around the country, building the infrastructure we need for tomorrow and supporting jobs today. This construction activity is the direct result of the government's $29.9 billion investment in schools, housing, energy efficiency, community infrastructure, roads and support to small businesses. As our budget set out, a central feature of our economic recovery plans is our Nation Building for the Future package, which builds on our earlier economic stimulus plans and delivers: - $8.4 billion in new road, rail and ports infrastructure; - $4.7 billion for the National Broadband Network; - $3.1 billion for new hospitals and medical facilities; - $2.6 billion for education infrastructure; and - $3.5 billion for clean energy developments. A total additional spend of over $22 billion to see the nation through the current global recession to a stronger future by boosting our long-term productive capacity through investing in skills, education and human capital. While we can design these nation-building initiatives, our capacity to deliver on them is dependent on having a safe, productive and harmonious construction sector. Prior to the 2007 election, the Labor Party promised that it would retain the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner (the ABCC) until 31 January 2010, when it would be replaced by a specialist Fair Work inspectorate. Labor also committed to consult extensively with industry stakeholders to ensure the transition to the new arrangements would be orderly and effective. On this basis, in June 2008 I appointed the Hon. Justice Murray Wilcox QC, a retired Federal Court judge, to consult and report on matters related to the creation of the specialist Fair Work inspectorate. Mr Wilcox provided his report in March this year having consulted very widely via face-to-face meetings around the country, by receiving written submissions and through public debate forums and industry events. Mr Wilcox undertook a considerable amount of work and I take this opportunity to thank him for his efforts and his thoughtful and balanced report. Since receiving Mr Wilcox's report the government has undertaken further consultations on the report's recommendations with stakeholders, including with my state and territory workplace relations ministerial colleagues, in finalising the government's response. I thank all stakeholders for their contributions and submissions to the consultations with Mr Wilcox and the government. The bill before us today delivers on the Rudd government's election commitment to the Australian people. The government understands that the building and construction industry stakeholders do not agree on all matters but we must agree, as I am sure that every decent Australian agrees, that there is no place in any industry for people choosing which laws to obey and which ones to ignore; for underpayment of wages or sham contracting or violence and intimidation in the workplace. Labor is committed to implementing a strong set of compliance arrangements for the building industry, a strong ‘cop on the beat', and the Rudd government has consistently stated that anyone who breaks a law will feel the full force of the law. Description of the bill The principal object of the bill recognises the government's intention to provide a balanced framework for cooperative and productive workplace relations in the building and construction industry. A key objective of this bill is compliance with workplace relations law in the industry by all building industry participants including employers, employees and their respective associations. This bill aims to provide fairness in the industry by ensuring that information, advice and assistance is available to all building industry participants in connection with their rights and obligations under relevant laws. The bill provides effective means for investigation and enforcement of relevant laws while balancing the rights of building industry participants through the provision of appropriate safeguards in relation to the use of enforcement powers. This bill seeks to improve the level of occupational health and safety in the building industry. The bill retains the Office of the Federal Safety Commissioner (OFSC) and its related accreditation scheme, which have resulted in demonstrated improvements in the occupational health and safety practices and records of accredited companies and related projects. ABCC to be replaced This bill gives effect to the government's election commitment to abolish the ABCC and transfer its responsibilities to a specialist fair work inspectorate from 1 February 2010. The bill creates the new Office of the Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate (the building inspectorate) and provides that this new agency will ensure compliance with the general workplace relations laws, as prescribed in the Fair Work Act 2009 by all building industry participants. The creation of the building inspectorate creates certainty for industry participants, and it meets our election commitment to keep a strong ‘cop on the beat' for the benefit of the industry and the economy. The Independent Building Inspectorate The building inspectorate created by this bill will be headed by an independent director appointed by the minister. The director will manage the operations of the building inspectorate and will not be subject to oversight or control by other statutory office holders. This model gives best effect to Mr Wilcox' recommendation that the director have ‘operational autonomy' and reflects various stakeholder consultations on this point. This structure also gives the best possible effect to Mr Wilcox' recommendations to provide identified funding to the inspectorate and its own dedicated operational staff, including inspectors. Consistent with Mr Wilcox' recommendations the bill also creates an advisory board to make recommendations to the director on the policies and priorities of the building inspectorate. While the advisory board will not determine the inspectorate's policies and priorities, the director will consider their recommendations when determining the policies and priorities of the building inspectorate. Mr Wilcox noted that, across the nation, there exist different levels of unlawfulness within the building and construction industry. The government believes that it is important to ensure that every effort should be made to focus compliance activities where those activities are most needed. Consequently, today I will issue a ministerial direction to the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner, under section 12 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act, to provide a report to me which maps out the ABCC's resources allocation and placement compared to locations with high levels of unlawfulness as evidenced by allegations, investigations, prosecutions, audits and the like. This report will be required by 27 July 2009. I will consider this report in the context of ensuring that the resources of the ABCC and from 1 February 2010 the building inspectorate are focused on those areas that have a demonstrated culture of unlawful behaviour. Scope and Penalties Consistent with Mr Wilcox' recommendations, the definition of ‘building work' is amended to remove its coverage of off-site work; thereby focusing the scope of the inspectorate's operations on work on sites. The building inspectorate will be charged with enforcing the building industry's compliance with the general law as prescribed in the Fair Work Act. As recommended by Mr Wilcox, the bill removes: - higher penalties for building industry participants for breaches of industrial law, and - broader circumstances under which industrial action attracts penalties in relation to the building industry. The retention of coercive interrogation powers While building participants will be subject to the same penalties as other workers, Mr Wilcox found that the need to retain the existing coercive interrogation powers was proven. Mr Wilcox describes the ongoing need for coercive powers in the report as follows. It is understandable that workers in the building industry resent being subject to an interrogation process that does not apply to other workers, designed to extract from them information for use in penalty proceedings against their workmates and/or union. I sympathise with that feeling and would gladly recommend against grant of the power. However, that would not be a responsible course. I am satisfied there is still such a level of industrial unlawfulness in the building and construction industry, especially in Victoria and Western Australia, that it would be inadvisable not to empower the [Specialist Division] to undertake compulsory interrogation. The reality is that, without such a power, some types of contravention would be almost impossible to prove. I have reached the opinion that it would be unwise not to endow [Specialist Division] (at least for now) with a coercive interrogation power. Although conduct in the industry has improved in recent years, I believe the job is not yet done. The government accepts the need to retain these powers. In retaining the coercive interrogation powers this bill also includes the following safeguards, including all of the safeguards recommended by Mr Wilcox, in relation to the use of the power: - use of the powers is dependent on a presidential member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal being satisfied a case has been made for their use, - persons required to attend an interview may be represented by a lawyer of their choice and their right to claim legal privilege and public interest immunity will be recognised, - persons required to attend an interview will be reimbursed for their reasonable expenses, - all interviews are to be videotaped and undertaken by the director or their deputy, - the Commonwealth Ombudsman will monitor and review all interviews and provide reports to the parliament on the exercise of this power, and - the powers will be subject to a five-year sunset clause. The bill contains a sunset clause for the coercive powers at the end of five years from 1 February 2010. A review will occur prior to the sunset clause on all matters relating to compliance in the building and construction industry. Such a review would be inclusive of all stakeholders. With respect to the issuing of an examination notice the presidential member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal must be satisfied that: - all other methods of obtaining the material or evidence have been tried or were not appropriate; - the information or evidence would be likely to be of assistance to the investigation; and - it would be appropriate, having regard to all of the circumstances, to issue the examination notice. As detailed in the bill's explanatory memorandum, it is intended that the presidential member takes into account all of the relevant circumstances when making a decision as to whether the issue of an examination notice is warranted. The relevant circumstances include whether the alleged breach is sufficiently serious or whether being required to comply with a notice would have an undue impact on the person. Relevantly in his report Mr Wilcox says: … I am confident the safeguards I have recommended, if implemented, will minimise the unnecessary use, and potential misuse, of the power; without impeding, or significantly delaying, investigations… The government agrees with this assessment and sees these measures as providing appropriate safeguards to the use of these powers. It is appropriate at this time that I also inform the House that today I will be issuing a ministerial direction under the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act to the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner concerning the application of coercive powers and the conduct of compulsory interviews. This direction will require that the following safeguards be implemented: - the legal representative permitted to attend with a person who is the subject of a coercive powers hearing may sit and speak with their client at all times, speak on behalf of the client and be given the time and privacy to consult and advise the client; - the ABC Commissioner must comply with the model litigant policy of the Commonwealth; - the ABC Commissioner must provide a reasonable opportunity for an objection to be raised to a particular exercise of the coercive power and allow any such objection to be tested in an appropriate court or tribunal; - before exercising the coercive power, the ABC Commissioner must provide a nominated person who is a Presidential Member of the AAT, acting in their personal capacity, with a report describing the person against whom the power is to be exercised, the purpose of the exercise of power, the urgency, the likely effect on the person and whether the purpose can be achieved in another way; and - having provided the report the ABC Commissioner must consult with the nominated person and receive written advice from the nominated person on their opinion in respect of the proposed exercise of power. This direction will take effect from 3 August 2009 in order to allow the ABC Commissioner to put the necessary mechanisms in place and for me to appoint the nominated person. Coercive interrogation powers and the Independent Assessor The government is heartened by the fact that Mr Wilcox is not of the view that there are widespread and broad problems for the industry across the country. We agree and note that the vast majority of participants in the industry are hard working and law abiding men and women. But the reality is there are also problems in this vital sector. There is a clear and immediate need to drive cultural change in some key areas of the industry. Accordingly, the legislation is aimed at driving cultural change in the industry and focusing compliance activities where those activities are most needed. On this basis the bill creates an office, the Independent Assessor-Special Building Industry Powers, who may, on application from stakeholders, make a determination that the coercive interrogation powers will not apply. It is important to explain how this ‘switch off' power will work. From 1 February 2010 the increased safeguards on the use of coercive powers will apply to all existing and new projects. All projects that commenced prior to 1 February 2010 will remain covered by coercive powers. All projects that commence on or after 1 February 2010 will start with the coercive powers ‘switched on'. On projects that commenced on or after 1 February 2010 an interested person will be able to make an application to the Independent Assessor to have coercive powers switched off in relation to a specific project. In determining whether to switch off the coercive powers, the Independent Assessor must be satisfied that: (a) it would be appropriate to make the determination, having regard to: (i) the object of this act; and (ii) any matters prescribed by the regulations; and (b) it would not be contrary to the public interest to make the determination. In the event that a project where the coercive powers have been switched off experiences industrial unlawfulness the Independent Assessor may rescind or revoke the original decision, thereby switching the powers back on. Additionally, the Director of the Building Inspectorate may request the Independent Assessor reconsider the decision at any time based on changes in circumstances on a specific project. These provisions ensure that the powers are focused where they are needed most. The government is determined to encourage lawful behaviour and a change in the industry's culture. These arrangements provide the industry with the opportunity to demonstrate that the requisite lawful culture is in place and the opportunity for the law-abiding majority to not be tarred with the same brush as the unlawful rogue elements. The Office of the Federal Safety Commissioner Finally, the government knows the importance of safety at work in the building and construction industry. This bill retains the provisions of the BCII Act that relate to the Office of the Federal Safety Commissioner (OFSC) and its related OHS Accreditation Scheme. The government's review of existing regulatory arrangements for the building and construction industry never intended to address the OFSC and the scheme as it has always been the government's intention to retain the OFSC and the scheme. These issues were deliberately not included in Mr Wilcox's terms of reference on this basis. The OFSC and the scheme are strongly supported in the industry and retention of the OFSC and the scheme reflects the government's commitment to OHS compliance in this vital industry. Conclusion This bill ensures balance and fairness for all participants in the Australian building construction industry. There are those who will be critical of the government's reforms on both sides of the industry. We accept that differences in views and perspectives make this criticism almost inevitable and that some may be disappointed in some parts of this bill. I am also disappointed; disappointed that there are still pockets of the industry where people think they are above the law, where people engage in intimidation and violence. Having said that, the government believes that the safeguards that are being introduced achieve the balance required to ensure compliance with the law and the fair treatment of individuals. Law abiding industry participants have nothing to fear from the existence of these strong powers to deal with rogue elements in the industry. Ultimately, whether or not the powers are used is in the hands of all building industry participants themselves. If the law is abided by then the powers will not be used. The Rudd Labor government is resolute in honouring its election commitment to abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission and replace it on 1 February 2010 with a new specialist Fair Work inspectorate. The Rudd Labor government believes in making this nation stronger and fairer. The government understands that only considered, fair and balanced laws will create the sort of long-term change Australia's building and construction industry needs if it is to flourish, create jobs and make a positive contribution to national productivity and prosperity. This is what this bill does. I commend the bill to the House. In doing so, I record my personal thanks to Michael Maynard of my department and to Peter Cully for their efforts on this bill, to the draftspeople in the and Office of Parliamentary Counsel and, particularly, to Craig Carmody in my office. I also record my thanks to my caucus colleagues for the debates on this bill yesterday. Debate (on motion by Mr Haase) adjourned.

4,Mr COMBET,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"Charlton-Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science and Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change) (9.24 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Australia is increasingly faced with compelling evidence of the effects of climate change and the risks of not acting to reduce carbon pollution. We know that new data and scientific understanding compiled since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2007 report are painting an even more worrying picture of climate change for the whole world. The Australian people have clearly indicated that they expect our government to take decisive action on climate change and the government is committed to introducing the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. So it is important to set foundations that will stand Australia in good stead to position us to take advantage of opportunities in a carbon-constrained world. We must provide our future generations with an economic and environmental legacy that matches the one that we enjoy. The world's attention is focused on securing a post-2012 agreement at Copenhagen. And it is in Australia's national interest to secure an ambitious deal that stabilises greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere at 450 ppm carbon dioxide equivalent or lower. What matters most as we try to secure a global deal is what we do at home. Our domestic agenda is our platform for Copenhagen in helping to shape a global solution. BILL 2009 In order to discharge our obligations to address climate change, the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme was recently introduced into the House of Representatives in May. In introducing this bill today, the government is laying the second foundation of its highly significant institutional set of changes in environmental and economic policy in this country. Renewable Energy Target scheme - part of a comprehensive approach The government's commitment to a renewable energy target of 20 per cent of our electricity supply to come from renewable sources by the year 2020 is a key measure within the government's comprehensive approach to tackling climate change. The expanded renewable energy target will complement the proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme now before the parliament and will accelerate the development and deployment of renewable energy technologies. The Council of Australian Governments agreed to the design of the Renewable Energy Target Scheme on 30 April 2009, following extensive community consultation. As the Prime Minister observed at the time, that agreement represents a major step towards Australia's low-pollution future. Today, in introducing legislation to give effect to the renewable energy target, we move closer towards that low-pollution future. The Renewable Energy Target Scheme will bring the mandatory renewable energy target and existing and proposed state and territory schemes into one national scheme, avoiding the inefficiencies, and administration and compliance costs, of multiple schemes operating around the nation. The legislative framework will ensure a smooth transition into the national scheme for the only existing state-based scheme, the Victorian renewable energy target. Electricity generation accounts for more than one-third of Australia's current greenhouse gas emissions, so Australia's transition to a low-pollution future will require a significant transformation in this sector. The Renewable Energy Target Scheme will accelerate deployment of a range of renewable energy technologies like wind power, solar, biomass and geothermal power over the next two decades. Over the longer-term the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will be the main driver of renewable energy deployment. As a transitional measure, the Renewable Energy Target Scheme will help transform the electricity sector and drive the lowpollution electricity generation that we need to tackle climate change. It will deliver on the government's commitment that 20 per cent of Australia's electricity supply will come from renewable sources by 2020. The Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 amends the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 to increase the existing mandatory renewable energy target from 9,500 gigawatt hours to reach 45,000 gigawatt hours in 2020. This change will increase the existing target by more than four times. Building on the existing mandatory renewable energy target framework, the new Renewable Energy Target Scheme will create a guaranteed market for additional renewable energy deployment, using the mechanism of tradeable renewable energy certificates that are created by renewable energy generators. And this in turn will attract additional investment and create additional jobs in renewable energy in Australia. The Renewable Energy Target Scheme is part of the government's economically responsible approach to tackling climate change. It focuses on providing support for the most cost-effective renewable energy technologies. The expanded renewable energy target will accelerate green jobs and together with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will drive around $19 billion in investment in the renewable energy sector in the period to 2020. Key design features of the Renewable Energy Target Scheme Higher annual targets under the expanded Renewable Energy Target Scheme will apply from 1 January 2010 and will reach 45,000 gigawatt hours in 2020. To provide renewable energy investors with even greater legislative certainty, the 45,000 gigawatt hour target will be maintained until 2030. The Renewable Energy Target Scheme includes many of the features of the current mandatory renewable energy target, including eligible sources and banking of renewable energy certificates to promote smoother investment over time. It is a broad based incentive which provides a significant platform for accelerating the deployment of a range of renewable energy technologies. The government recognises that households are keen to do their bit in the fight against climate change. The renewable energy target will assist with the upfront costs of installing small-scale renewable energy systems, including household solar photovoltaic systems, by introducing a ‘solar credits' mechanism. Solar credits work by allowing owners of small-scale renewable energy systems to earn multiple renewable energy certificates for renewable energy produced by these systems. Solar credits, which take effect for systems installed from 9 June 2009, will provide the solar industry with certainty and a solid platform for future growth. A related bill, the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2009, increases the level of the shortfall charge under the Renewable Energy Target Scheme from $40 per megawatt hour to $65 per megawatt hour. The shortfall charge encourages compliance with the Renewable Energy Target Scheme as liable parties who do not meet their obligations to purchase renewable energy certificates will need to pay this charge. Increasing the shortfall charge to this level will allow the price of renewable energy certificates to be sufficient to drive investment in renewable energy in order to meet the government's significantly increased renewable energy targets. The level of the shortfall penalty will be monitored to ensure it remains effective as an incentive investment in renewable energy. The government recognises the impact of the renewable energy target on emissionsintensive trade-exposed industries in the text of the proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the additional pressures these firms are experiencing as a result of the global recession. As part of the consultation process, stakeholders suggested that assistance under the renewable energy target should take account of the cumulative impact of the renewable energy target and the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The government listened to industry, particularly industries such as the aluminium smelting sector, and has therefore decided to provide assistance under the renewable energy target, reflecting the cumulative impact of the renewable energy target and the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The bill provides for regulations to be made to provide partial exemptions from liability under the expanded renewable energy target. As agreed by COAG, the Coalition of Australian Governments, on 30 April 2009, partial exemptions will apply to those activities that are emissions-intensive tradeexposed activities under the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Exemptions will apply to 90 per cent or 60 per cent of an entity's liability under the renewable energy target, according to the respective category of assistance provided under the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme framework. All businesses will contribute to supporting renewable energy as the exemptions will only apply for liability above the existing 9,500 gigawatt hour target. The bill also provides for a review of the operation of the Renewable Energy Target Scheme to be undertaken in 2014 to coincide with the strategic review of the proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The for review will allow the government to ensure that the expanded national Renewable Energy Target Scheme remains effective as a measure to increase the deployment of recon- newable energy generation in Australia. Government funding for renewable energy The renewable energy target measure is complemented by significant direct support that the government is providing to the renewable energy industry through a range of other initiatives. As part of the 2009-10 budget, the government announced the $4.5 billion clean energy initiative, which will kick-start a range of critical low-emission energy technologies in the marketplace. As part of the clean energy initiative, the government will invest $1.6 billion in solar technologies, including $1.5 billion for the Solar Flagships program and $100 million for the Australian Solar Institute, which supports research into solar thermal, solar photovoltaic and other solar energy technology. The Solar Flagships program will aim to create an additional 1,000 megawatts of solar generation capacity. This ambitious target is three times the size of the largest solar energy project currently operating anywhere in the world and may demonstrate both solar thermal and solar photovoltaic technologies. The clean energy initiative also includes $465 million to establish Renewables Australia, to support leading-edge technology research and bring it to the marketplace. In addition, the $480 million National lar Schools Program is giving Australian schools a head start in tackling climate change and conserving our precious water supplies. Over 4,000 schools have registered to participate and more than $10 million in grants have already been approved. The government recognises that we need to take action to tackle climate change with a comprehensive set of measures. Expansion of renewable energy generation represents a significant opportunity to reduce Australia's energy sector emissions while driving $19 billion of investment and creating the green jobs of the future as part of an estimated thirtyfold increase in the renewable electricity sector by 2050. The implementation of the expanded national Renewable Energy Target Scheme as outlined in this bill represents a major step towards transforming the electricity sector and the Australian economy to contribute to a low-pollution future. But, even with complementary measures like the expanded renewable energy target in place, Australia's emissions will still be around 20 per cent higher in 2020 than they were in 2000, as opposed to as much as 25 per cent less with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in place. That is why these are two key institutional measures-the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the expanded Renewable Energy Target Scheme-to address climate change. Without the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, we certainly cannot halt climate change or substantially reduce emissions. Without the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, the fact is we will keep making climate change worse. And, further, the simple fact is that without the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme we will have no means to deliver our emissions reductions targets, which are ambitious So- but necessary and responsible.

5,Mr COMBET,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"Charlton-Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science and Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change) (9.37 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2009 amends the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Act 2000 and, together with the related Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009, implements the expanded national Renewable Energy Target Scheme to deliver on the government's commitment to ensure that 20 per cent of Australia's electricity is supplied from renewable sources by 2020. This bill increases the level of the shortfall charge under the expanded Renewable Energy Target Scheme from $40 per megawatthour to $65 per megawatt-hour. The shortfall charge encourages compliance with the Renewable Energy Target Scheme, as liable parties who do not meet their obligations to purchase renewable energy certificates will need to pay this charge. Increasing the shortfall charge to this level will therefore act as an incentive for investment in renewable energy in order to meet the government's significantly increased renewable energy targets. The level of the shortfall penalty will be monitored to ensure it remains effective as an incentive for investment in renewable energy. According to data published by the Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator, there has been a consistently high level of compliance with the mandatory renewable energy target since the scheme began in 2001, which means that very few liable parties have, in fact, needed to pay the shortfall charge. The new shortfall charge seeks to encourage affordable deployment of renewable energy through continued high levels of compliance, while taking into account the significant increase in annual targets under the expanded scheme. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Haase) adjourned. NA (ABOLISHING DETENTION DEBT) BILL 2009 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Laurie Ferguson. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",30
6,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"ReidParliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services) (9.41 am)I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Migration Amendment (Abolishing Detention Debt) Bill 2009 amends the Migration Act 1958 to remove the liability for detention and related costs for certain persons, and liable third parties, and extinguishes all outstanding immigration detention debts. The Rudd government is committed to establishing a fairer and more humane and effective system of immigration detention. This bill represents the first legislative step in the government's reform of immigration detention. Further reforms, to give legislative effect to the government's New Directions in Detention policy announced in July last year, will be introduced shortly. The government considers that fairer and effective immigration detention policies and strong border security measures are not incompatible. This bill reflects that conviction: striking an appropriate balance by abolishing an ineffective system that penalises former detainees with enormous debt burdens, while ensuring that liability for detention costs remains a deterrent in relation to convicted illegal foreign fishers and people smugglers. This bill contains four key measures to reform the system of detention debt. The bill will, firstly, repeal provisions in division 10 of part 2 of the act in relation to the liability of a noncitizen who is detained in immigration detention, and third parties in certain circumstances to pay the Commonwealth the costs of a detainee's transport between a place where the noncitizen is detained and another place within Australia as well as the daily maintenance amount for each day of the noncitizen's detention. Liability for costs associated with the removal or deportation of unlawful noncitizens under division 10 of part 2 to the act will remain unchanged. Secondly, this bill will retain and clarify provisions in division 14 of part 2 of the act which relate to the liability of convicted illegal foreign fishers and convicted people smugglers for detention and transport costs. These provisions are being retained in response to the serious nature of the offences covered by section 262 and in recognition of the need for a significant deterrent to apply to these offences. Together, these amendments will mean that the detention debt regime will be prospectively abolished for all classes of detainees other than convicted illegal foreign fishers and convicted people smugglers. Thirdly, the bill will provide for the extinguishment of all outstanding detention debt for noncitizens who are in immigration detention, or persons who have been in immigration detention, and liable third parties at the time of commencement of the legislation. Finally, the bill will make consequential amendments to: - clarify in subdivision B and C of division 4 of part 2 to the act (that relate to criminal justice certificates) that the of keeping a noncitizen in Australia under these provisions does not include the cost of immigration detention; and - ensure that the regulations can no longer prescribe sponsorship undertakings or obligations that include paying the Commonwealth an amount relating to the cost of a person's immigration detention. The bill also ensures that the element of undertakings or obligations made by a sponsor prior to commencement of this bill that relate to paying tention costs of a visa holder sponsored by the sponsor will cease to have effect. As the House may be aware the government introduced this bill in identical form in the Senate on 18 March 2009. We have taken the unusual step of re-introducing the same bill in the House today to try and progress the bill's passage through the parliament in this sitting fortnight. I would like to emphasise, however, that it is exactly the same bill as was introduced in the Senate on 18 March 2009. In pursuing these amendments the government has considered the findings and recommendations of three recent reviews of the detention debt regime under division 10 of part 2 of the act. In 2006 the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, in its report Administration and operation of the Migration Act 1958, noted that ‘The evidence clearly indicates that the imposition of detention costs is an extremely harsh policy and one that is likely to cause significant hardship to a large number of people. The imposition of a blanket policy without regard to individual circumstances is inherently unreasonable and may be so punitive in some cases as to effectively amount to a fine.' The committee agreed that it was a serious injustice to cost charge people for the cost of detention. In an own motion report published in April 2008, the Commonwealth Ombudsman examined the Department of Immigration and Citizenship's administrative processes and procedures in relation to the detention debt policy. The report, Department of Immigration and Citizenship: administration of detention debt waiver and write-off, noted that while the department was administering the debt de- waiver and write-off of detention debt according to legislative and policy requirements, there was scope for improvement. In particular, the Ombudsman noted that the department could improve the information it provides to people, timeliness and prioritisation in processing cases, and the consistency and reasonableness of decisions on debt waiver and write-off. Although the Ombudsman's report focused on the administration of the policy, the report also commented upon the burden of detention debt, noting that ‘Complaints to the Ombudsman's office indicate that the size of some debts cause stress, anxiety and financial hardship to many individuals who are now living lawfully in the Australian community, as well as for those who have left Australia.' In introducing this legislation the government has accepted the unanimous recommendation of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration (JSCM) that the Australian government, as a priority, introduce legislation to repeal the liability for immigration detention costs, and immediately waive all existing detention debts for all current and former detainees. I stress again the points that this was a unanimous report and that there was a call for priority. A degree of gency was given in that committee report. In the first of three reports in its current inquiry, Immigration detention in Australia: a new beginning, released in December last year, the JSCM commented on the administrative inefficiencies of the policy. Noting that less than 2.5 per cent of the detention debt invoiced since 2004-05 had been recovered, with the vast majority of debts incurred under this system waived or written off, the JSCM concluded that, ‘The practice of applying detention charges would not appear to provide any substantial revenue or contribute in any way to offsetting the costs of the detention policy. Further, it is likely that the administrative costs outweigh or are approximately equal to debts recovered.' The JSCM focused on the adverse impact of detention debt on those who either remained in Australia or had connections to the country, citing concerns about ‘the burden on mental well-being, the ability to repay the debt, and the restrictions a debt could place on options for returning to Australia on a substantive visa'. Like the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the JSCM noted concerns raised with the committee that ‘detention debts are a source of substantial anxiety to ex-detainees, and may impede the capacity of the ex-detainees to establish a productive life, either in Australia or elsewhere'. The JSCM's report made particular reference to the adverse impact detention debt often had on the mental health of former detainees, noting that the imposition of a significant debt often prolonged or exacerbated mental health problems relating to immigration detention, particularly where there was a history of torture and trauma. The JSCM referred to the limited earning capacity of many people on their release ur- from detention, and the financial hardship that substantial debts caused. The committee also acknowledged the detrimental flow-on effect for families and dependants in these situations. I will turn to each of the measures in this bill. Part 1 of schedule 1 to the bill will provide for the general amendments to the act. Part 1 will repeal provisions in division 10 of part 2 of the act in relation to the liability of detainees and third parties for the cost of detention and the costs of transporting a detainee between places of detention. As demonstrated most recently by the JSCM, the original objective behind the detention debt policy-to minimise the costs to the Australian community of the detention, maintenance and removal or deportation of unlawful noncitizen by ensuring all unlawful noncitizens bore primary responsibility for these costs-is simply not being met. While the cost of immigration detention is significant, debt recovery under the existing system is so low as to be virtually ineffective. The majority of those persons with an immigration detention debt have their debts written off as uneconomical to pursue, while persons without an accurate forwarding address or with ongoing non-response are also not pursued by DIAC for practical and administrative reasons. A small proportion of debts are waived, where special circumstances are established and the Commonwealth considers that it has a moral, rather than a legal, obligation to extinguish the debt. Recent figures provide an apt demonstration of the ineffectiveness of this policy. ing 2006-07 and 2007-08 immigration detention debt raised was $54.3 million of which $1.8 million (or 3.3 per cent) was recovered. $48.2 million was written off by the department as uneconomical to pursue and $4 million was waived. For the 2006-07 and 200708 financial years the balance of $0.3 million is under active debt management. Making immigration detainees primarily responsible for the costs associated with their detention, has not, in any significant way, contributed to minimising costs to the Australian community. And in the meantime, the department is required to meet the high cost of administering a debt that it is largely unable to collect. These debts are not insignificant. The current daily maintenance amount of $125.40 can see a person in immigration detention for a year incur a debt of more than $45, 000. As the JSCM report detailed, detention debts in the hundreds of thousands of dollars are not uncommon. These debts have little effect on those with sufficient funds to repay, and no effect on those (the majority) who cannot readily be contacted. It is only the minority with a genuine desire to seek legal stay in Australia who are directly affected. Departmental operational policy provides that detainees, once repatriated, must repay their debt in full or make satisfactory arrangements for repayment, before they can meet eligibility criteria for a visa. This requirement can act as a barrier to a person returning to Australia (even when partners or family members are Australian citizens), impede the transition from a temporary to permanent visa (as in the case of spouses), and prevent former detainees from sponsoring and being reunited with their family members (even, on occasions, when the former detainee has been found to be a refugee). As Dursuch, this requirement inequitably affects those who seek to remain and settle in Australia, while the majority of people released from immigration detention are removed from Australia and are therefore under no obligation to repay their debts to the Commonwealth. It is significant that no other country with immigration detention facilities holds people liable for their detention debts. In terminating the detention debt regime under division 10, this bill not only prospectively abolishes a harsh and inequitable system which adversely impacts on the ability of former detainees to settle in Australia, but also brings to an end a system that has been demonstrated to be ineffective and inefficient. For many seeking to start a new life in Australia, the bill removes an onerous burden of debt that is selectively harsh in its effects on the most vulnerable. It is important to note that liability for costs associated with the removal or deportation of unlawful noncitizens under division 10 of part 2 of the act will remain unchanged. People deported or removed from Australia will continue to be subject to the costs incurred. This government recognises that the policy in relation to removal costs provides a deterrent against noncitizens electing to be removed from Australia to avoid payment of travel costs. The government has no intention of encouraging visitors to this country to become destitute and then rely on the Australian government-and thereby the Australian taxpayers-to pay for their return. Part 1 of schedule 1 to the bill will also clarify the operation of provisions under division 14 of part 2 of the act. The Australian government recognises that there are cases where the deterrent effect of detention debt is appropriate: persons convicted of illegal foreign fishing or of people-smuggling offences under the act. The Australian government remains very concerned with illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in our northern waters and the abhorrent and despicable trade of people smuggling. Unlike many people who enter Australia, convicted illegal foreign fishers and people smugglers have no interest or intent to live in or contribute to Australian society. In fact, the actions resulting in their convictions are in direct conflict with the interests of the Australian community. The nature of these offences calls for a significant deterrent. While the government maintains rigorous ongoing surveillance and enforcement measures to tackle illegal foreign fishers and people smugglers, we recognise that we must use all measures available to preserve the integrity and security of our borders. For these reasons this bill will retain and clarify the provisions in division 14 of part 2 of the act, to continue the liability of convicted illegal foreign fishers and convicted people smugglers for the costs of their detention. The retention of detention debt liabilities for persons convicted of illegal foreign fishing and people smuggling will act as an adjunct to penalties already in place, strengthen the government's operational and national security response to illegal foreign fishing and people smuggling, and support the integrity of Australia's border security regime. Section 262 in division 14 of part 2 of the act will be amended to enable the minister to make a legislative instrument determining the daily amount for keeping and maintaining a person in immigration detention at a specified place in a specified period. This measure will ensure that the detention costs payable by convicted illegal foreign fishers and convicted people smugglers and liable third parties are clearly specified. A new system for the management of detention debts incurred by convicted illegal foreign fishers and convicted people smugglers under amended division 14 of part 2 of the act will be established by DIAC to ensure that it operates as intended. Part 1 of schedule 1 to the bill will also provide for the extinguishment of all outstanding debt for noncitizens who are in immigration detention, or persons who have been in immigration detention, and liable third parties, in relation to the costs of detention payable at the time of commencement of the bill. The bill extinguishes all existing debts incurred under the detention debt regime. The amendment to extinguish all outstanding immigration detention debt is necessary to provide a one-off blanket removal of a whole class of debts. After discussions with the Department of Finance and Deregulation it was determined that the extinguishment mechanism was more appropriate to use than either a waiver or a write-off of existing debts. A waiver approach (as recommended by the joint committee) would require that consideration should be given to the individual circumstances of each debt, which would be administratively cumbersome; while a writeoff approach is not appropriate because even when a debt is written off, it may be reinstated and pursued at a later date. The total of the detention debt to be guished by this bill is the amount owed to the Commonwealth at the time of commencement including amounts written off and debts under active debt management. Given that such debt arrangements have been in place for many years, the unavailability of comprehensive records over that time and payment of debt by some persons, a precise total figure is not available. However, based on the annual financial statements the estimated total of the debt to be extinguished is in the order of $350 million, of which less than five per cent is recoverable and the majority has been written off already. The extinguishment is not retrospective and therefore will only apply to debts that exist at the commencement of the legislation. There will be no refunds of any debts that have been paid in part or full before the commencement of the legislation. It is recognised that such payments were made in the discharge of a legal liability existing at the time of payment. However, existing frameworks will continue to be available to allow for the recovery by an individual of an amount paid to the Commonwealth where there has been a mistake or illegality involved. For example, is found that a person was unlawfully detained, any immigration detention debt paid in relation to the unlawful detention may be recoverable through legal action, settlement, the compensation for detriment caused by defective administration scheme or act-ofgrace payments through section 33 of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. This may also extend to third parties who were liable and previously paid for the costs in relation to immigration detention. All former detainees currently under active debt management will be notified of the changes through individual letters to their extinlast known address. General information about the extinguishment will also be provided to community groups and placed on the department's website. By extinguishing existing debt for all detainees, this bill will allow people to move on in their lives without the weight of detention debt holding them back. Parts 2 and 3 of schedule 1 to this bill amend the act to ensure that regulations made for the purposes of subsection 140H(1) of the act cannot prescribe a sponsorship undertaking, or if the Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Act 2008 has commenced cannot prescribe a sponsorship obligation to pay the cost of a person's immigration detention. These parts further provide that an undertaking prescribed by the Migration Regulations 1994 (the ‘regulations') made for the purposes of subsection 140H(1) of the act (that relates to paying the Commonwealth an amount relating to the cost of a person's immigration detention), will cease to have effect on the commencement of this bill. As I noted earlier, in introducing this legislation the government took into account the unanimous recommendation of the Joint if it Standing Committee on Migration that the Australian government, as a priority, introduce legislation to repeal the liability of immigration detention costs, and immediately-I stress, immediately-waive all existing detention debts for all current and former detainees. The committee members at the time of the December report included a number of members opposite. Danna Vale, MP (member for Hughes), Petro Georgiou, MP (member for Kooyong), Senator Alan Eggleston andmost notably-the shadow minister for immigration and citizenship, Dr Sharman Stone, MP (member for Murray). I note that on releasing the report the deputy chair of the committee, the member for Hughes, stated that the committee found the policy-and I underline this-‘harsh and without reasonable rationale'. This is indeed strong language by the member, reached after committee processes. One would assume that such a tone was not lightly taken. So it is now surprising and disappointing that the opposition has signalled that it is now intending to oppose this bill, after that joint committee report involving the opposition spokesperson. There can be no rational explanation for the Liberal Party's backflip other than politithe cal opportunism. The members opposite would rather stand ready with dog whistles to support the continuation of clearly not achieving its objectives than acknowledge that this is a sensible policy change. If the opposition are to now argue that we have to do this in light of the number of boats arriving in Australia, and if they that to a change of government policy in detention, one would have to ask why they did not realise that was going to happen at the time when they jointly signed this report. If there is this direct connection between the number of boats and a lightening of policy, why didn't they oppose the abolition of these detention costs at that time? This is a sensible policy change that abolishes a system which adversely impacts on the ability of former detainees to lawfully settle in Australia and brings to an end a system that has been demonstrated to be inefficient and has no deterrent effect. So what we now have is the Liberal Party-the self-professed champions of economic management-supporting a policy where the administrative costs outweigh the debts recovered by the government, to the detriment of the Australian taxpayer. For the 2008-09 financial year the department have estimated that the cost of administering detention debt bills will be approximately $709,000. Year to date receipts to 30 April 2009, from repayment of detention costs for 2008-09, is $477,613. If this figure is extrapolated to the full year, it appears that the department will recover approximately $573,000 in detention debt. I talked earlier about the cost of going after this money. Not only do these recent figures demonstrate what an inefficient policy this is but they also highlight what a ridiculous position opposition is adopting after the shadow minister and her colleagues wholeheartedly endorsed the abolition of detention debt just a policy that is six months ago. In conclusion, can I reiterate that the government expects that people who come to Australia enter and leave in accordance with their visa conditions. Immigration detention tie will continue to be used as an appropriate tool to manage compliance and the prompt removal of those who have no legal right to remain in Australia. In short, immigration detention will continue to support the orderly processing of migration to our country. However, the government considers that fair and effective immigration detention policies and strong border security measures are not incompatible. This legislation will strike an appropriate balance. The bill marks an important change in the treatment of persons who have been subject to immigration detention. I hope it will have the support of members, most particularly those opposition members of the JSCM who were part of the unanimous recommendation that we abolish this system, who analysed the problem, came up with the report and unanimously endorsed the motivations of this legislation. I commend the bill to the chamber. Debate (on motion by Mr Abbott) adjourned. NA Rearrangement",31

8,Mr ABBOTT,FAMILY ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"Warringah) (10.06 am)This legislation, the Family Assistance Amendment (Further 2008 Budget Measures) Bill 2009, implements some significant and, nevertheless, not especially contentious housekeeping measures that should make our social security system work better. The first aspect of this legislation is provision to reduce the frequency of family tax benefit overpayments and consequently social security debt. Family tax benefit is based on annual income. Claimants provide an estimate of their annual income to Centrelink and on the basis of that estimate family tax benefit is paid. Of course family tax benefit is paid in the vast majority of cases fortnightly on the base of annual income. This is not a problem for the vast majority of people who are in steady full-time employment, but it can produce some difficulties for people with variable incomes, such as people who are working part time or who are self-employed. It has long been the case that claimants are required to provide further estimates of their income and update their income estimates if their circumstances materially change. On the basis of these updated estimates, the claimant's family tax benefit payments would be adjusted by Centrelink. As things stand, it is also the case that claimants could be paid at a rate that would leave them with a significant social security debt at the end of the financial year. This legislation provides that, once new estimates of annual income are submitted, Centrelink will adjust family tax benefit payments to ensure that claimants will have no social security debt at the end of the financial year. It seems to be a sensible enough measure. It will mean that some claimants will be paid less than would currently be the case, but as things currently stand those higher payments will produce a debt that has to be repaid. As I said, it seems to be a sensible enough measure, although the opposition will be keen to monitor how it works in practice. The second aspect of this bill is also designed to try to ensure that, as far as is reasonably possible, we do not have extensive social security debts. I stress that entitlement to family tax benefit is determined on the basis of annual income, and annual income can be finally determined only after the lodgement of a tax return. As we know, many people are somewhat dilatory when it comes to lodging these returns. At present, if a family tax benefit claimant does not submit a tax return within 18 months of the end of the financial year, a letter is dispatched to the claimant indicating that a debt is about to be raised against them. This is designed to ensure that tax returns are lodged where they are necessary. This legislation provides that after 18 months the claimants will not be entitled to be paid family benefit on a fortnightly basis if they have not lodged a tax return. It seems a sensible enough measure, but the opposition will want to monitor how this works out in practice to ensure that no unreasonable hardship is imposed on people. With those two minor caveats, I indicate that the opposition will support this legislation and I look forward to subsequent debate.",38
9,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FAMILY ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"It might help the process of the House if I just confirm that, in accordance with the resolution adopted, the orders of the day were altered. The bill that we are now discussing is, as the member for Warringah correctly spoke to, the Family Assistance Amendment (Further 2008 Budget Measures) Bill 2009. The member for Warringah was in order. There was just an error in the way the bill was originally presented.",39
10,Ms REA,FAMILY ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"I rise to support the Family Assistance Amendment (Further 2008 Budget Measures) Bill 2009. I do so because I understand that this bill will go some way to assisting families, particularly for those on low and middle incomes and who are reliant on family tax benefit, to manage their household budgets a little bit better. Hopefully, it will avoid a number of families inadvertently running up debts with Centrelink. I know that the some 10,300 families who are recipients of family tax benefit in my own electorate of Bonner will certainly feel much easier about managing their incomes when they see these measures being introduced. Family tax benefit is the third largest expenditure item of this government. After the states and territories grants program and the age pension, the next highest item of expenditure is family tax benefit, at a total of some $17 billion. It supports more than 2.2 million Australian families. This is therefore a sizeable chunk of the government's budget. Indeed, it is why this House should support measures to see that the management of that fairly significant expenditure supports families and makes sure that we are accountable to the taxpayers, who are ultimately the people who provide that funding. We know that there are many families doing it tough. We are going through the most severe global financial crisis since the Great Depression. Whilst many economists and treasurers are struggling with that issue, the real people who will be most significantly affected by this crisis will be many of the families out there in the electorates we represent. Any measure that enables those families to manage their incomes better and to reduce the debt incurred as a result of them inadvertently not being able to have their income correctly assessed is not only a very important measure to support those families but also a very responsible and accountable measure when it comes to that expenditure This money is actually acknowledging that over the period of the financial year there are some families receiving family tax benefit who indeed do receive more income during that year than was originally forecast. As the previous speaker, the shadow minister for families, community services and Indigenous affairs, indicated, family tax benefit is calculated on annual income. Although many receive fortnightly payments, it can often be the case that, as a result of an increase in income, those payments then become overpayments. Then, at the end of that financial year, a family is faced with a debt. Whilst an income increase is a good thing, we all know that it is not very pleasant to enjoy the fruits of that increased income over a financial year only to be faced with a debt at the end that you did not realise you had incurred. So this is a way of enabling families to continue to manage their incomes, to enjoy a modest increase if they receive it and to make sure that it is not curtailed or that they are not disadvantaged by incurring a debt at the end of the year. Three measures all lead to that outcome. The first one is the mandatory continuous adjustment of family tax benefit payments. This has been voluntary since 2002 and now it is becoming mandatory. It is, as I said, a way in which the government has proposed to reduce any debt incurred, through overpayments because of an increase of income, at the end of the financial year. It is significant when you look at the figures. In fact, there is some $15 million worth of debt affecting 28,500 families across the country. This measure will help and support those families. Whilst many families we know are out there doing the right thing, they might inadvertently, unaware of the rules and because other events in their lives take over, breach those rules. We all know that there are many things that occupy families other than just making sure that their FTB payments are correct each fortnight. It is important that we as a government provide all of the assistance that we can. Through mandatory continuous adjustment, we will do so. I guess it is important to note at this point that we know that, unfortunately, there are a very small minority of people out there who do actively find ways in which they can exploit the system. Unfortunately, that means that there must be rules and parameters around the way these payments are made. There must be continuous monitoring to make sure that that expenditure is targeted at the right people and is expended fairly. So, unfortunately, because of those few who will always try and flout the rules, there are many families who will inadvertently, because they do not declare an increase in income, end up with a debt. The mandatory continuous adjustment will enable that to be, hopefully, eradicated. Those families will no longer suffer a debt that they did not expect at the end of the year. The second measure also moves to do the same thing, through dealing with the issue of non-lodger debt, as it is called. This is the case where, for whatever reason, a family eligible for FTB has not lodged a tax return 18 months after the financial year. Currently their fortnightly FTB payments continue to be paid, despite the fact that they have not lodged that tax return. This, again, can mean that a debt is incurred as a result of overpayment. First of all, can I encourage all families out there who do depend on this increased income, this government support, to be diligent about lodging their tax returns. It is the best way to ensure that they will receive all of the benefits that they as a family are entitled to. It will certainly ensure that they do not incur unnecessary debts. Basically, the way that this will work is that if they have not lodged their tax return the family tax benefit payment will cease. This means that families will not continue to incur a debt as a result of overpayment because that money is being automatically paid to them, regardless of the fact that they have not lodged their tax return. Of course, once they do, as soon as the situation is rectified and as soon as they do lodge the tax return and their income is assessed, it will then mean that that family will receive all of the tax benefits that they were entitled to, even though the payment had ceased. They will receive it in the form of a lump sum at the end of the financial year. They will not receive it as fortnightly instalments. The government appreciates that that is a change. It is a way of making sure that household debt is not necessarily increased, but, at the same time, it ensures that when the situation is rectified those families have not missed out on payments that they would otherwise have been entitled to. This is actually quite a significant measure when you look at the dollars involved. In September 2008, debts as a result of nonlodgement amounted to around $460 million. If we do not do anything, by September 2011 that debt will rise to $680 million. Not only is that a significant issue for the government in terms of being accountable to taxpayers for the way that we expend money but it is also significant because, as you can imagine, numbers that high obviously indicate that there will be tens of thousands of families affected by this. They, unfortunately, will see any benefit they have derived from an increase of income going towards a debt repayment that they were not necessarily aware of. This also responds to a recommendation from the Australian National Audit Office, who, looking at the possible increase in debt levels if we did not do anything, suggested that this was one way that the government could manage these payments a little bit better. The third measure extends the period of time in which the tax office and Centrelink communicate with each other in providing information around tax file numbers and other information regarding payments to ensure that the measures that are put forward in this bill can in fact be initiated, because rently they only talk to each other for some 12 months. This will extend that out further. So particularly people who are in the nonlodger category can be assured that their payments are made and made correctly. This third measure, I guess, indicates the need to always be vigilant about the level of communication between government departments. It is often a case of shock and horror to many people out there when they realise that government departments do not necessarily talk to each other in the way that they would expect them to. But at least we are able to monitor that and put it into legislation to ensure that that communication is there and that it is conducted in a way that will benefit the recipients of payments. By way of conclusion, once again we see the government supporting lowand middleincome families and targeting government expenditure to those families who most need that support. It is important to see these particular measures in the context of so many other areas of reform that have come as a result of the election of the Rudd Labor government and indeed as a result, I think, of the very diligent care that Minister Macklin takes in making sure, through her portfolio, that those most in need receive the greatest support from our government. As we know, pensioners and carers have certainly benefited from the recent budget. We have seen the introduction of 50 per cent education tax refunds to support families. We have increased the childcare rebate to 50 per cent. There is the Teen Dental Health Plan. There are tax cuts. And of course there is the an initiative that I am particularly proud of, the announcement by the Treasurer of the introduction of paid parental leave to support families who, obviously, are deprived of an income when a parent is at home caring for a newborn child. This will make sure that they curare financially supported and able to give the best care to their family and the newborn but also able to move back into the workforce when it is needed. As someone who has been a working mother since I was 21 years of age I want to put on the record how proud I am to be part of the government that has put in place that particular policy. With these measures we once again see a government that cares about supporting families, particularly in harsh economic times. We see a government that targets that expenditure to the people we know are most in need. We also know that just providing payments is not enough to support families, particularly those on low and fixed incomes; enabling them to manage their household budgets better and avoid incurring unnecessary debts is just as important as the payments that we make. This is done in a way that is also sustainable and certainly accountable to the taxpayers who provide the revenue to ensure we support these families in an ongoing manner. I commend the bill to the House.",39
11,Mr OAKESHOTT,FAMILY ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"I rise certainly not to oppose this legislation but to flag several concerns I have with regard to several aspects of the bill, in particuexample lar the ongoing reforms to CDEP. I would also like to make some comments about the Northern Territory intervention generally and about the importance of considering in this place the poor policy for all aspects of discrimination, including something that is not talked about-geographic discrimination. I will come back to that. This legislation is a continuation of the government's reform agenda. It does seem to be a morphing of the previous government's reform agenda and therefore there do seem to be some similarities in policy between each side of this House. In light of that, there are some sensible aspects to the bill. The move to remove the ATO as a place where FTB claims can be lodged is essentially a streamlining of the claim processes and an administrative cost-cutting measure and therefore, I would have thought, eminently sensible. Ninety per cent of FTB claimants currently claim through Centrelink anyway either by way of fortnightly payments or as a lump sum at the end of the year. The move to allow IMR-affected welfare recipients residing in designated areas access to external review through the SSAT and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal again looks like a minor administrative change and sensible in the reform context. Then there is the phasing-out of the CDEP wages payment arrangements. Payment arrangements for those on CDEP on 1 July will continue; new CDEP participants from 1 July onwards will be required to individually qualify for an income support payment. So it is a more gradual phasing-out of CDEP scheme payment arrangements than envisaged by the previous, Howard government. Mind you, it is still a phasing-out, and that is where a morphing of policy from both sides of the chamber is clearly occurring. On that last point, I put on the table a clear of success in a regional community, a practical example of how CDEP is delivering. Only last Thursday, I revisited a site in the Port Macquarie CBD-a so-called developed regional economy-where we are now seeing the final stages of completion of 12 two-bedroom affordable housing units. Affordable housing is much needed on the midNorth Coast. This has all been done by a Port Macquarie business, with links throughout the mid-North Coast, called Aboriginal Connections that has a very high strike rate for tendering well in a fully contestable market and delivering good building product. In addition, over 50 per cent of its employees are Indigenous, and it has been able to turn a lot of raw, young, unemployed talent into success stories in an open employment market. That has been done as part of the CDEP scheme and has largely occurred because of it. There has been plenty of debate in this chamber in which people have generally been dishing out criticism on the CDEP and viewing it in a negative way. But there are success stories for CDEP. In relation to regional communities such as the mid-North Coast, I would ask people to consider some of the success stories as well as the negative stories when thinking about reform programs and Indigenous policy generally, including the ongoing changes to CDEP. If anyone wants to come and have a look at a local success story, there is Aboriginal Connections. It is doing everything that governments of both persuasions have required-that is, high employment of Indigenous people in a company that is competing in an open market and doing it very successfully. It is ering product such as affordable housing for communities in need. It ticks all the boxes. Therefore, it is of concern to me that we are seeing the scrapping of the CDEP scheme and that the general consensus on both sides of this chamber is that that is okay to happen in the future. I accept the government's point of view that CDEP will be replaced with a universal employment service. That will be a watching brief for the future, and it is where I am flagging concern rather than raising direct opposition. I want to start to make some noise about the language that the government uses in putting forward this reform program.",42
12,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FAMILY ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"Order! I am reluctant to intervene but I suspect that the member for Lyne may be wishing to speak on the social security and other legislation bill, which is listed next, rather than the family assistance bill.",43
13,Mr OAKESHOTT,FAMILY ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"Incorrect. It is the Family Assistance Amendment (Further 2008 Budget Measures) Bill 2009. Mr Deputy Speaker, part of this involves changes to the CDEP scheme welfare payments.",43
14,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FAMILY ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"I am happy to provide some latitude on that, but I am not sure that the remarks that you are making actually do go to the bill. I am happy for you to have some latitude about it; but, if that is the focus of your contribution, you may just consider whether or not the next bill is the one that you wish to address. Continue.",43
15,Mr OAKESHOTT,FAMILY ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I will take your ruling. I assure you that I am focusing very much on changes to family assistance payments, including reforms to the way that the CDEP scheme will be administered. An important point with regard to the context of this bill is that, while CDEP will cease from 1 July and will be replaced by the new arrangements contained in this delivbill, the language of the government has been about new community support programs being introduced into urban and regional locations-such as the mid-North Coast of New South Wales, with its significant Indigenous population-to increase social inclusion and community cohesion. The program would function as a vital link in supporting Indigenous community members in accessing information and services, including through Centrelink, Mr Deputy Speaker. This would be a separate program from CDEP. It is on this front that I want to start making some noise, and I hope that members on both sides will want to make some noise too and begin to flush out some detail on where, when and how that community support program will be delivered. Will it sit alongside a universal employment service and turn the reform program that we are seeing through this legislation-the dropping of the CDEP-into a universal employment service that basically blends Indigenous policy with mainstream policy? This is accepted by both sides of this House. But where is this community support program? It is time that we started to see the detail of this proposal. We are not far away from seeing very real changes on the ground that will effect some very real outcomes in many people's lives. I ask the government to start spelling out in detail where, when and how this community support program will fall into place. How is it going to be accessible to communities such as those on the mid-North Coast? It is of great concern that we are involved in geographic discrimination-and this will be my final point-and it does link into the concept of the intervention, which is also referred to in the family assistance bill. We talk a lot about discrimination in this place but we do not talk a lot about geographic discrimination. If we go back to why the Northern Territory was picked for the intervention, it was for constitutional reasons as much as for any other reason. In a lot of cases, we are seeing government resourcing and funding drifting away from regions such as the mid-North Coast of New South Wales, with its high Indigenous population. It is concerning to see the development of geographic discrimination, where some people are being treated differently from others in Australia. That is a concern held by me and I hope it is held by many members of this chamber. There should be some underlying principles in this chamber that we are all shoulder to shoulder on. For example, retrospective legislation in all its forms should be one issue that we are all shoulder to shoulder on in trying to avoid and stamp out. Likewise, we should be shoulder to shoulder on stamping out all forms of discriminatory policy. This is not soft; it is not wet; it is damental principle that we should all uphold. We should work as hard as we possibly can to make sure that, where policy is concerned, everyone in this country is treated the same. I would hope that is something that is considered when we are talking in the future about interventions into the Northern Territory and when we are talking about Indigenous and non-Indigenous reconciliation. I hope that they are principles that are not only important to the mid-North Coast of New South Wales but also to every single member in this chamber. So I certainly do not oppose this legislation but I do flag that the changes on the ground on the mid-North Coast are causing concern with regard to the CDEP scheme. Unless we see the new horizon soon it is going to be a point of criticism, because the language of government in this reform program has been good; we are now starting to look for the practical delivery and the detail. Likewise, with regard to the intervention it looks as if both sides of this chamber are now starting to form a common view that aspects of discrimination are okay. I would hope that that is something that pricks the conscience of every single member of this chamber when they think about the intervention into the future. Why is it in the Northern Territory in particular and how can we best develop policy for the future that achieves outcomes that we all want: better statistics, closing the gap and reconciliation? But how do we do that for all Australians, not just for those who can be picked off due to constitutional arrangements?",43
16,Mr LINDSAY,FAMILY ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"I find myself not completely agreeing with the member for Lyne. I certainly have a very significant Indigenous population in my electorate-much bigger than he would have in his electorate. Over so many years now I have been very closely associated with Ina fundigenous Australia. I have formed a view that perhaps it is time in Australia when we should be calling a spade a spade, in that the world is not black and white; there are shades of grey. When it comes to having a non-discriminatory policy across Australia, that is a fine aspiration but in practice perhaps it is not the right way to go. I was at Challenger mine two weeks ago, 740 kilometres north-west of Adelaide in the desert. The mine pays Indigenous Australian landowners one million bucks a year. I said to the company, ‘Where does the money go?' And they said, ‘We don't ask.' What actually happens is that it disappears and the terrible plight of some of our Indigenous brothers and sisters never improves. That is wrong. Perhaps under a non-discriminatory policy nothing will ever change. It needs to change. People need to be uplifted from the conditions that they are in. So I do not find myself in complete agreement with my colleague and corridor neighbour the member for Lyne. In relation to CDEP I think it has been an abject failure, in the main. Where CDEP has been used on Palm Island, a lot of money goes into CDEP but, again, nothing changes. You do not see improvements in the community. The government spends its moneyvery significant amounts of money-in the Palm Island community but the community does not benefit from it. The participants do not benefit from it. That surely is a waste of taxpayer resources-but, more than that, it is not uplifting the people of Palm Island. It is not getting them a job. Mr Oakeshott interjecting",44
17,Mr LINDSAY,FAMILY ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,What is your intervention? Mr Oakeshott-Come and look at my housing development!,45
18,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FAMILY ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,Order! Members will keep their comments through the chair.,45
19,Mr LINDSAY,FAMILY ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"I am sorry. I concedeand I said this in my contribution-that not all CDEP programs are abject failures. Clearly, the member for Lyne has a good program in his electorate. I would love to have it in Townsville but we need to look very closely at these sorts of things and see that they do deliver outcomes and that taxpayers' money is spent doing what the object of the exercise really is-and that is to and to help our Indigenous Australians. The Family Assistance Amendment (Further 2008 Budget Measures) Bill 2009 has a wonderful ideal. It is supported by both sides of the parliament. It wants to help the customers of Centrelink rather than complicating and frustrating their lives with certain overpayment systems. You could not disagree with that. Centrelink just gets better and better. Those of us who have been around a little while would remember the old Department of Social Security. What a bureaucratic nightmare that was! Centrelink is now so customer focused, and this measure is just another example of doing better by the customers. It deserves our unqualified support. Last week, I had occasion to go to Centrelink. No, it was not to seek an income payment! I went to the families processing centre. Centrelink Townsville-and probably Centrelink North Queensland-constantly wins awards for the best Centrelink service in Australia. And I am really proud of our people and what they do in relation to that. When I visited quite unannounced-because I was just there on a routine matter-I stood in the line with every other customer. It was truly remarkable. There was line of about seven people waiting to be looked after and there were three or four Centrelink staff buzzing around, coming to people in the line and saying: ‘What is it that you need to do?' or, ‘You shouldn't be in this line; you should be over there,' or, ‘You can get the information you need by going immediately to this officer.' So the line quickly processed through. There was no waiting, no delay. The point was that the customer service element was outstanding. I want to thank Tracy Bruce, who looked after me in the families processing centre. I had a particular form that I was submitting to Centrelink on behalf of one of my family, uplift and she quickly knew and understood exactly what I was asking and what had to be done. She checked with somebody else, the matter got resolved and I was away. Thank you to the staff of Centrelink in Townsville for the wonderful work that you do for my community. It is very much appreciated. I want to indicate my support for the Family Assistance Amendment (Further 2008 Budget Measures) Bill 2009 that we are debating now and I thank the parliament for the time.",45
20,Mr MARLES,FAMILY ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"Corio-Parliamentary Secretary for Innovation and Industry) (10.45 am)-In the 2008-09 budget, the government introduced a number of measures aimed at reducing family assistance debts and assisting families to avoid accumulating debts into the future. For many years we have been concerned about how the family tax benefit system can create unnecessary debts for families which can in turn complicate and frustrate a family's life. Government assistance should make people's lives easier, not create uncertainty and financial difficulties. Family tax benefits support more than 2.2 million Australian families, with an annual expenditure of around $17 billion. Families need and rely on this assistance, and the measures in the Family Assistance Amendment (Further 2008 Budget Measures) Bill 2009 will help families receive their correct entitlement and reduce cycles of overpayment and debt. There are three measures in this bill. The first provides for continuous adjustment of customers' family tax benefit rate. This allows Centrelink to automatically adjust a customer's family tax benefit rate following an increase in the customer's income estimate. The intention is to help prevent reconciliation debts. For people who fail to lodge tax returns, the second measure precludes certain payments. Again, the intended aim of the measure is to reduce the number of existing and newly accrued family tax benefit debts. These debts are known as non-lodger debts. These measures respond to a 2006 report by the Auditor-General on the management of family tax benefit overpayments. The third measure makes minor amendments to the tax file number provisions in the family assistance law to help keep an ongoing and up-to-date link between the Australian tax office and Centrelink. I note the opposition's support for this and I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",45

22,Mr NEUMANN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Last night I was talking about the Liberal and National parties' neglect for pensioners during the 12 years of their reign. They did nothing about the single rate of pension. In fact, the member for Higgins, on 16 April 2002 said: And we know that there are big demographic changes going on in Australia. The population is aging and we have got to think about how we are going to cope with that. … … … We have probably got a window during the course of this decade but we have to start planning a long-term basis. They lost power on 24 November 2007, but nothing had been done with regard to the single rate of pension. In fact, last year the current Leader of the Opposition finally admitted that the pension was inadequate, and he wanted two million couple pensioners, disability pensioners and carers to miss out on a pension increase. His proposal actually covered only single pensions. He said that on bill 21 September 2008. Even the member for Warringah, the shadow spokesperson for this area, has been equivocal about this issue on a number of occasions. Earlier this year, on 11 March, he said that increasing pensions would be a generous measure but that the ability of the government to cover this sort of thing was ‘under enormous question'. That followed what he had said earlier, on 24 February 2009, about the fact that economic circumstances were very different from what they had been 12 months before. He said he wanted to see a fair go for pensioners but: … you can only give pensioners a fair go if the overall economic condition of the country is sound … So we have had equivocation, ambiguity, procrastination and idleness from the coalition in relation to ensuring a secure and sustainable pension system in this country. Now, we are pleased that finally, on the road to Damascus, they have seen the light and they support what we are doing in this regard. We did commission the Harmer review to look into the adequacy of our 100-year-old pension system. The review found that the full rate of single pension was simply inadequate and it resulted in gross poverty, neglect and hardship for single pensioners and challenges for couple pensioners. It recommended that the ratio of full-rate payments between single and couple pensioners be lifted from about 60 per cent to between 64 and 67 per cent. We are responding to what the Harmer review had to say. The government is providing in this legislation a signifito cant increase of $32.49 for full-rate single aged, disability and carer pensioners. Couple pensioners are also being helped, with $10.14 for full-rate couples combined. Now, why is that important? It is important for my electorate of Blair, in South-East Queensland. The statistics really are quite stark. I have in my electorate, according to the latest figures, 7,940 people on the aged partnered rate and 6,478 people on the nonpartnered rate. In terms of the carer payment, we are doing a lot for carers as well. I have in my electorate 867 people on the partnered rate and 422 on the non-partnered rate. With the carer allowance, the figures are 3,075 people on the partnered rate and 1,302 people on the non-partnered carer allowance. That is 23,490 people in my constituency, which has, according to the latest figures, about 93,500 voters and about 150,000 men, women and children. So you can see what a difference this change will make for the economic security and the lifestyles and futures of so many people in my electorate in Queensland. But it is Labor governments that have made a big difference. The Whitlam government, when Bill Hayden was social security minister, increased the percentage of the pension vis-a-vis what we now call MTAWE. The Hawke-Keating government did the same when they got in. And it has been left to the Rudd Labor government to do the same. So it is Labor governments that make significant pension reform and lift the standards, lift the economic circumstances of pensioners. To ensure the pension remains at adequate levels the Rudd Labor government is legislating a new MTAWE benchmark of 27.7 per cent for singles. That is up from 25 per cent. That will make a significant difference to people in my constituency. We know that most Australians are going have to rely on a pension-we know that. We know our parents and grandparents and those before them have had to rely on pensions. It is a mark of our compassion, our decency and our humanity as a society that we have an adequate pension system-and we should have one. A strong safety net is needed simply because it is fair and equitable. Despite the global recession we need to ensure that our senior citizens, those with disabilities, those people who are carers, have the kind of financial support that will get them through the difficult times. We know that the demographic changes in this country will be enormous, and we know that the cost of pensions will double as a centage of GDP by 2050. But that does not mean to say that we cannot tackle the challenges in relation to this. To ensure we have a strong safety net it is crucial for what we hope to be as a country in the decades ahead. I support lifting-gradually, of course-the age pension qualifying age from 65 to 67 from 2017 and an increase in the income test from 40c to 50c with respect to the tapering. These reforms reflect the Harmer report's findings. We are responding to the independent advice. There are other changes that are being made as well. But I am pleased so much for those pensioners who have come to see me, who see me at my many mobile offices around my electorate-places like Brassall shopping centre and Riverlink, Yamanto Village and Winstone Glades shopping centres, and at the many country shows I go to. I will be going to the Kalbar show this weekend, as well as Ipswich home show. I can guarantee there will be pensioners who will come and talk to me in relation to challenges they face each and every day. I am very pleased also that we are simplifying and increasing flexibility with respect to the new supplement. The four existing add-ons to the pension-the GST supplement, the pharmaceutical allowance, the telephone allowance and the utilities allowance-are being combined in a single pension supplement. That supplement will be paid fortnightly. I think that is a very imporper tant factor, because pensioners will get the money when they need it, every fortnight, rather than monthly and quarterly. Singles will receive an extra $2.49 per week in the supplement; couples combined, an extra $10.14 per week. That equates to the utilities allowance for couples with the single seniors concession allowance for self-funded retirees. We think that is important. We think it is also important that we roll this increase in perthe pension out. So this pension reform will operate from 20 September 2009. On top of that there is the regular indexation. We have new indexation arrangements introduced that more appropriately and better reflect the cost of living increases for pensioners. As part of the government's reform packages a new pensioner and beneficiary living cost index will be calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. We think it is important to respond to the real cost of living pressures that pensioners have. But we are not forgetting, and we are not neglecting, our self-funded retirees, who had the commitment, the determination and the wisdom to put aside money to ensure their financial security in the future. They will benefit from these reforms as well. A new seniors supplement for holders of a Commonwealth seniors healthcare card will be introduced from 20 September 2009. The seniors supplement will replace the senators concession allowance and telephone allowance at the higher internet rate for eligible recipients. That will continue to be paid in a quarterly payment. The seniors supplement for a single person will be 66.33 per cent of the seniors supplement for a couple combined. That is important, because that is a good add-on for them. So we are making changes that we feel are important. I mentioned the taper rate earlier, because I think that is important as well. From 20 September 2009 the pension income test tarate will increase from 40c to 50c for each dollar of income over the income-testfree area. I think that is important as well in terms of the reforms that we are undertaking. The work bonus is also an important reform that we are undertaking. To improve incentives for paid employment-we need to value our senior citizens and those who can make a financial contribution to our economic prosperity and development in the future-the government is introducing a work bonus. Employment income will be treated concessionally as part of the changes to the income test. Fifty per cent of the $500 of fortnightly employment income will not be assessed as part of the income test. That means that those people who are receiving the work bonus will receive a maximum benefit of up to $125 per fortnight. Earlier, I mentioned the age pension age increase. I know that it is a challenge for those who work in manual labour. But we have got to accept that our longevity is very different from 1909. People live longer and that is great. They want to live active, healthy lives and we need to acknowledge the fact that if we want a sustainable system in the future we need to face these challenges. It has been faced overseas in Europe and other places, where the pension age is increasing. So all we are doing here is meeting that challenge to secure a sustainable pension system. There is going to be an increase in the age pension age from 65 to 67 at a rate of six months every two years, beginning in 2017 and reaching 67 by 2023. The first individuals affected will be 57 on 1 July 2009. They will have to wait an extra six months to qualify for the age pension. People aged 52½ on 1 July 2009 will be the first to have an age pension age of 67 years. These are important changes. My electorate of Blair has many challengeschallenges of growth with young people coming to the area but also older people who have worked in industries such as coal mines, railway workshops, woollen mills and other areas of manufacturing. There are also people who have worked on farms and people who have given their lives to small businesses. They face big challenges. We ought to give them what they deserve. We need to do it. It is important to sustain our pension system in the future if we are to be a fair and just society, a society that believes not just in prosperity but in equity. We need to do this first and I commend the bill to the House.",46
23,Ms BURKE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to support the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Reform and Other 2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009, which is before the House today. The 200910 budget contains many significant measures aimed at pulling Australia out of the global recession and securing our long-term prosperity. It is one of the toughest and most important budgets in a generation. The global recession, combined with the increase in middle-class welfare under the previous government, has meant that we have had to make hard decisions-many difficult decisions to ensure the long-term integrity of the Australian economy. This budget also provides an opportunity to address important and long-overdue social reforms enabling the establishment of a paid parental leave scheme and the reform of our pension system. The secure and sustainable pension reform package prepares Australia for the difficult social and economic challenges of the future, including the issue of our ageing population. In delivering these reforms we are seeking to address three key issues with the current pension system: the inadequacy of pension payments, particularly for single pensioners; the overly complex and restrictive nature of supplementary payments and allowances; and the unsustainable structure of the system for the long term. My electorate of Chisholm is home to about 20,000 age pensioners, disability pensioners, carers, special needs pensioners and veteran income support recipients. These reforms will make a genuine difference to the lives of each and every one of these pensioners. They will benefit not only from the increased payments but also from the fact that these reforms make the system simpler, fairer and more flexible. Of course, in delivering these reforms we are picking up the slack from the Liberal and National parties, whose chronic neglect of pensioners over 12 years is there for all to see. It has been left to the Rudd government to implement the necessary reform and provide relief to pensioners during the global recession. Only a Labor government can appreciate that tough economic conditions are not an excuse for ignoring the plight of Australia's 3.3 million pensioners. The conservatives have proven that they lack the understanding and ability to deliver such reforms. In raising pension payments and reforming the system the government are directly assisting those in need, but we are doing so in a way that is sustainable; we are doing so in a way that deals with the challenges of an ageing population; and we are doing so in a way that will secure the integrity of Australia's pension systems now and into the future. The centrepiece to our secure and sustainable pension reform is the biggest increase in the single pension ever seen in Australia, an additional $32.49 per week for age, disability and carers pensioners on the full single rate. This is in addition to the assistance being provided to pensioner couples, who will be receiving an extra $10.14 for the full rate couples combined. This is an important increase that will ease the financial stress for single pensioners rights across Australia. In line with the Harmer review it lifts the ratio between singles and couples pensions from 60 per cent to 66.33 per cent combined-that is, two-thirds of the combined couples rate. To many of us $32.49 per week may not sound like a lot of money. It is, however, a significant investment by the government and its impact on the lives of single pensioners cannot be underestimated. To assume that a single can live half as well as a couple has been the basis of the pension for a long time. But ask any pensioner who is living on their own out there and they will tell you that they are not doing it a lot cheaper than a couple. This measure has picked up recognition of that fact. Just last week I had the pleasure of hosting a morning tea for a wonderful bunch of seniors from the suburb of Glen Waverley in my electorate. I have been staggering these morning teas around my electorate. Like the Deputy Speaker, I have got a fairly ageing community in my electorate so I cannot invite them all at once because there would just be too many people coming along. So we had about 100 people turn up to a morning tea and it was a fantastic day, full of interest. We discussed many, many things, from the international implications of climate change to local planning issues. You do not get to specify in these environments what is and is not the bailiwick of a federal member, and you discuss everything. Naturally the pension system was one of the more prominent issues discussed on the day. To quote one constituent, a woman who I have never met before-she has been in contact with my office but she is not a party member and certainly was not put there as a plant by me: ‘This government have provided more in their first term to pensioners than the other mob did for 10 years.' She went on and gave some more flattering praise and I was pretty happy she had come. But, on the whole, for most of the day this sentiment was echoed by the majority of people in attendance on the day. Several were quite vocal in thanking the government for permanent increases in their pension as well as the additional stimulus money provided in December last year. It was terrific to see these people concerned not just about themselves but about future generations. We had quite a long discussion about the Building the Education Revolution and the issue of providing more money for education as well. It is important to note that these payment increases are supported by the findings of the government's Harmer review. It is a responsible measure and above all a considered increase that will alleviate some of the dayto-day financial stresses facing our pensioners. It is delivering reform in an area where our predecessors stalled for 12 years, fully aware of the challenges facing the pension system but failing to implement any serious reform. As a fiscally responsible government, we have to ensure there is a mechanism to pay for the increase in pension payments. That is why we have to ensure payments within the pension system are financially sustainable. In doing so, we need to be mindful of the challenges Australia faces as a result of our changing demographics, particularly the fact that we are an ageing population. Indeed, by 2050, the balance between old and young Australians will have changed significantly. One in four Australians will be 65 or older compared to around one in eight today. Our life expectancy will be somewhere in the 90s. These factors are why the government is taking the tough but responsible decision to progressively increase the age pension qualifying rate to 67 years from 2017. This is, indeed, a tough decision but a necessary thing to do. Even the opposition agree that the qualifying age needs to be increased, although they failed to take action while they were in government, despite conducting two comprehensive intergenerational reports on the very subject. This is an issue not confined to tralia. Many other countries have increased or are planning to increase the pension age in light of their ageing population, including United States, Germany and the United Kingdom. This is a vital reform that ensures the pension, while providing an adequate standard of living for pensioners, can be afforded by taxpayers into the future. The gradual introduction will allow affected individuals time to plan for their retirement. As the financial adviser Noel Whittaker has put it: All theythe governmentare doing is raising the age at which you can apply for a pension from 65 to 67. As it affects only people born after January 1, 1957, they have at least 15 years to prepare for it. In other words, these reforms are not dictating the time at which a person is able to retire, as some in the media would have us believe. Additionally, by 2023, when the new age pension is implemented in its entirety, working Australians will have had 30 years of the superannuation guarantee, introduced under a Labor government, to build our own private retirement savings. So it is incumbent upon us as government to ensure the integrity of the super system over time so we are not putting a double impost upon people seeking to retire. There are around 20,000 pensioners in Chisholm who will immediately benefit from the increased payments legislated for in this bill. Aside from that fact, an objective observer looking over the data for my electorate may come to the conclusion that many of my constituents may not benefit from the pension system as much as those in other electorates across Australia. This is true to an extent. Chisholm covers suburbs in the east of Melbourne that have certainly grown in affluence over the past decade or so. Many Aus- seniors in Chisholm have built up strong earnings over the years and are classified as self-funded retirees. One of the stark realities the of the global financial crisis, however, has been that the superannuation investments of this group have taken a huge hit. This was an area of discussion at my seniors morning tea, as I do have many people who are self-funded retirees in my electorate who have sacrificed over the years to ensure that they have a substantial retirement investment to live off. They are finding it harder and harder and they are finding that they are dipping into capital more and more to make ends meet. The Australian newspaper reported on Tuesday that, despite staging a remarkable recovery in April of 3.06 per cent, the strongest monthly return this century, most super funds are expected to post a financial year loss for the second year. At the end of April the returns of balanced super options for this financial year were down an average of 13.71 per cent. This is a savaging of the retirement savings of many self-funded retirees. Indeed, my office has received a large amount of correspondence from self-funded retirees who are understandably quite disturbed to see their investments spiralling downwards as a result of the global recession. This highlights the importance of there being a strong safety net underlying our income support system both now and into the future. This safety net comes in the form of our pension system. Every Australian knows that they could one day be forced to rely on a pension, a fact that has been made all too obvious by the global financial crisis. Again, many people are coming into my office quite perplexed and distressed at actually having to go into a Centrelink office for the first time in their life to seek a part pension. am certainly encouraging people to continually look at their retirement statements, their investment statements, because they may be entitled to some part pension, which goes part of the way to assisting predominantly with a reduction in utility bills. But everything helps at this point in time. This means that introducing the reforms outlined in this bill before the House today is essential. We all know that carers make significant sacrifices looking after those who are incapable of caring for themselves. The parliament has just recently handed down a pretty seminal report into carers. I want to commend the committee for doing that work. We often do not hear of the great work of the committee system. This demonstrates the parliamentary committee system working in action. The carers report is a terrific document. One of the most important and widely welcomed measures in the Secure and Sustainable Pension Reform package is the introduction of an annual $600 care supplement payment. This payment replaces the previous ad hoc carer bonuses and will allow carers to manage their own financial circumstances. Within my electorate, like many others across the country, I have many groups that come together under the banner of carers. One group that meets regularly in my electorate is a stroke support group. The stroke support group was started up by an amazing person within my electorate, Helene. Helene for the past 20 years has been caring for her best friend, Diane. She is not a family member-not a relative, not a child, not a husband. Her best friend, Diane, had a stroke at a very early age which left her completely incapable of looking after herself. The only option for Diane was to go into a nursing home. Helene would not hear of this and changed her home, which has But I accommodated this amazing duo over these years. It was an interesting exercise at the beginning of this experiment, because it was quite unusual that someone with no relative relationship whatsoever to an individual had taken on the primary care role of that individual. Helene has suffered through cancer herself, and Di has had ongoing medical issues, but the two of them have managed to stay in the home all this time, managing to continue to see their children and grandchildren. My hat has always gone off to this remarkable woman-indeed, this remarkable pair of individuals, who have demonstrated that you can do it, but it does come at a rather large cost. This payment will be of great assistance to those sorts of people. This payment will ensure that people can maintain their dignity within the home and it will not be this ‘will or won't I' experience each year. It means they will be able to budget more effectively and plan their household finances and expenditure with an added sense of certainty. In Chisholm there are over 2,000 carers who will benefit from the annual supplement payment. Nationwide there are approximately 500,000 eligible for the payment. Through this reform the government is recognising the selfless contribution carers make to the lives of the most vulnerable in our community and the fact that many are under significant financial pressure. Just outside my electorate, in the adjoining electorate of Deakin, there is another terrific institution. The MS Society is housed there and so is BrainLink. Again, a big part of these two organisations is caring for the carers. People with an acquired brain injury fall into a fairly stressful category of people in need and are often young people who will need care for a very long time. BrainLink provides an amazing array of services and support. I have had the privilege of meeting some of the most dedicated and phenomenal carers through that group. I know that this assistance has been greatly welcomed by that group. This bill implements key elements of our Secure and Sustainable Pension Reform package. These are long overdue reforms. They are reforms that improve the adequacy of the pension system, make its operation simpler and more responsive and secure its long-term sustainability. Age pensions, disability pensions, carers, wife pensioners and veteran income support recipients will all benefit from increases in their pension payments. Just as importantly, this bill ensures Australia will be in a position to meet future demographic challenges, including our ageing population. It introduces reform that will ensure the long-term durability and integrity I of our pension system. I commend the bill to the House.",49
24,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"It is great to be able to rise in this place and speak on legislation that is well and truly overdue and that is going to assist people in need both now and into the future. It is a genuine reform, and I congratulate the government and, in particular, the minister responsible. The Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Reform and Other 2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009 implements key elements of the government's Secure and Sustainable Pension Reform package, announced recently in the 2009 budget. The reform package improves the adequacy of the pension system-long needed-makes its operation simpler and more responsive to pensioner needs and, importantly, secures its long-term sustainability. It is in every sense of the word needed and it is very much a reform. It prepares Australia to meet our future challenges, including the ageing population. That is something often spoken about, particularly in this place, but in reality something we have done very little in substance to prepare for. In addition to providing a significant increase in payments-again, much neededthe reforms will make the pension system simpler, fairer and more flexible. Australia's 3.3 million age pensioners, disability pensioners, carers, wife pensioners and veteran income support recipients will benefit from increases in their pension payments. This government has acted to introduce long overdue reforms to make the pension system simpler and fairer. Finally, the reforms guarantee an adequate and sustainable standard of living for the aged, carers, veterans and people with disability who rely on the pension to survive. As I say, it has been long coming and much needed. For the record, the age pension was first paid in 1909 and this year marks the centenary. The age pension is the largest-spending Commonwealth own-purpose program. The Australian government spends, for the record, around $28 billion per annum on the aged population. I think it is important to these reforms into context, and I think it is worth noting again for the record some of the demographic changes we have experienced and will experience into the future. It makes for not just interesting but very sobering reading. By 2047, some 7.2 million Australians will be aged over 65. That will represent 25 per cent of the expected population, which is almost double the current 13 per cent. Unless we act now, the demands-both economic and social-on this nation will be even more extraordinary. Currently there are around five people of working age to support every person aged 65 and over. This will more than have to 2.4 people by 2047. That has considerable implications-again, both socially and economically. Increasing longevity, whilst good, in the main, personally, means that people are receiving the age pension for far longer than in the past. Demographic change means that the costs of a given pension increase today will almost double as a share of gross domestic product by 2050. So reform is much needed. It is needed now so that we can have a sustainable system into the future. The government has made important reformative decisions. In some instances, they were tough decisions and have not been greeted universally with acclaim. But they are needed. One reform is progressively increasing the age pension qualifying age to 67 years from 2017. We are not alone in this. A number of countries in Europe as well as the United States and others have progressively moved their pension age to 67 and even beyond. That is in recognition not so much of the economic issues associated with it but the fact of life that people are living longer. They are healthier and their demands on services will increase as they age. Also the reform package will ensure that the pension increases are targeted to those put who most need them. Again, this is a vexatious issue because there will always be people who will miss out. That is a fact of life and a fact of economic life. This package seeks to introduce what will be for some an unpalatable element of reform. We want to support ongoing workforce participation by aged pensioners. Turning 65 does not mean you either want to cease to work or are incapable of working. We need incentives built into keep people participating in the workforce for a variety of reasons but not to their detriment in terms of entitled economic return. We did not need to be told that something needed to be done about preparing for the future and looking after our pensioners. I do not want to try to score political points too much on this, but I must raise it, seeing as it has been so ungraciously thrown at us while we are introducing this reform. Those opposite have only recently come to the conclusion that pensioners need an increase in the pension. It took us 18 months to realise it; it took them 12 years to dream it up. I find it extraordinary that those opposite beat their breasts, wring their hands and carry on with this unctuousness when in actual fact we have decided to do something about it. We are doing something about it and we are doing it in a considered way. The Harmer report looked at this in the short term, the intermediate term and the long term, and we have come up with this package of reforms. I congratulate this government and the minister. It is quite extraordinary for posite to be pointing the finger and saying, ‘It isn't enough. It doesn't go far enough. What about these people? What about that?' I know they will be on their feet very soon saying what a fantastic package this is and that they are going to support it. They ought to support it because they talked long and hard about it but did nothing about it. are doing something about it. Let us get onto the good news about this package. First and foremost it is going to increase the pension. Single pensioners will receive an increase of $32.49 per week, comprising a $30 per week increase in the maximum basic pension rate and a $2.49 per week increase in the pension supplement. The effective MTAWE benchmark for the single rate of pension will increase from 25 per cent to 27.7 per cent. The single pension rate will increase as a proportion of the comfortnightly. bined couple rate from 60 per cent to 66.33 per cent of MTAWE. That was a recommendation of the Harmer report. Couples will receive an increase of $10.14 per week for a pensioner couple combined, comprising no increase in the maximum basic pension rate and a $10.14 per week increase in the pension supplement. How have we gone about ensuring the long-term sustainability of the pension system? First and foremost, income test rules will change to better target pension increases. The rate at which the pension is withdrawn for each dollar of additional private income will be increased from 40c to 50c in the dollar for income above the free area, which is currently $138 per fortnight for a single pensioner and $240 for a couple. All existing pensioners will have existing entitlements retained in real terms. The qualifying age for the age pension will progressively increase at the rate of six months every two years, beginning in 2017 and that mob op- reaching 67 in 2023. How will we ensure that pensioners benefit from paid work? A work bonus for older Australians who continue to work past age pension age will be introduced. Fifty per cent of the first $500 a fortnight of employment income will be disregarded when calculating assessable income for pensioners over age But we pension age. The Pension Bonus Scheme will be closed to new entrants from 20 September 2009. Existing members of the scheme will continue to accrue entitlements under the existing rules. Finally, what about simplifying the payments? The government will combine the GST supplement, the pharmaceutical allowance, the utilities allowance, the telephone allowance at the higher internet rate and increased assistance into a single, easily understood pension supplement that will be paid That is the nub of the reform package that this government has put before the Australian people and this parliament. I am very pleased that we have been able to do that and that we have addressed the short-term need, particularly for single pensioners but also for all pensioners, by increasing the pension. We have also set out a system which will index it fairly at a higher rate than currently exists, and we will continue to look at the indexing methods. There are 20,098 pensioners in my electorate. I have an ageing population in my electorate. It is one of the oldest in Australia. I know that this increase in the pension has been gratefully accepted and acknowledged. I know that it would be great if we could have paid even more, but we have put the system on a sure footing for the future so that people can be certain of not only what they are going to receive but how they are going to receive it, and we will continue to work at providing this system in a much more flexible way. So it is with pleasure that I support this legislation. I look forward to its implementation and its hasty and speedy passage through this House and the other place.",53
25,Mr ADAMS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"It is a pleasure to follow my colleague from Braddon. I congratulate him on his speech and on representing the pensioners of his electorate. It is marvellous that it is this side of the House, the government side, that is supporting this Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Reform and Other 2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009 and people from the other side have dropped off from speaking on it. My colleague pointed out that for 12 long years people in the pensioners area were promised things like little bonuses here and there, but really there was nothing of substance done to increase the pension. It has taken a Labor government to do that in a real way, and in a lot of depth, with some reforms that will continue for a long time and be substantial for many people that have reached the time in their life when they need to retire and access a pension from government. This legislation is a part of that reform package which will certainly improve the accuracy of the pension scheme, make its operations simpler and more responsive to pensioner needs, and secure long-term sustainability. This comes as a result of Harmer review, which developed 30 findings across five major areas. They were: the adequacy of the rate of the pension; the amount paid; indexation arrangements for pensions, and we have increased that in this bill; the design and the delivery of the pension payments, how they are delivered et cetera; the concessions and the services that support the pension system; and the targeting and long-term sustainability of the pension scheme, the generational changes, the changes that we need to look at as a nation. We know the other side squibbed that back in their time in government. There is a need to prepare Australia to meet future challenges. That includes our ageing population. We know that many other parts of the world are looking at this as well and having to come to grips with this. I will touch on a bit of that later. Currently we have in Australia 3.3 million age pensioners, disability pensioners, carers, wife pensioners and veteran income support recipients. In the electorate of Lyons in that great state of Tasmania I have 19,112 people on pensions. They are broken up according to age partnered rates, age unpartnered rates, carers, non-partnered carers, people with disabilities and people with disabilities who are not partnered. There is a whole range of different groupings. The pension reforms in this bill implement reforms in the social security and aged-care area. A further bill will be introduced later, I understand, with pensioner reform measures for veterans and their dependants. So we look forward to that bill coming in as well. These reforms are really necessary to try and tackle the reality of our ageing population and the challenges that this presents, but we need to try and maintain the system's enduring strengths. It has been around a long time. It is interesting to note that the age pension was first paid in 1909. This year marks its centenary. So it is quite an anniversary to have this bill in the parliament this year. The Department of Social Security noted in the Australian yearbook in 1988 that at the turn of the century there was no social security system in Australia. Charitable relief was provided to needy persons by voluntary organisations, in some cases with the assistance of government grants. These were the people of Dickensian times, of poorhouses and charity workers who often hindered rather than helped social disadvantage. You had to be the right sort of needy person or reach a certain standard or whatever to receive some help. People made judgments about other people in a social way about whether they were entitled to some help. I guess that is what drove some reforms in that area. The main areas of need which attracted charitable assistance were the sick, poor, neglected children, old people who were destitute and women who had become deserted or had fallen pregnant. The unemployed were assisted by grants of wages or rations in return for relief work provided by government. The Commonwealth of Australia was formed on 1 January 1901, with the Federation of our six states under a written Constitution-which was basically written by a Tasmanian-which, among other things, authorised the new Commonwealth parliament to legislate in respect of age and invalid pensions. In the event, the Commonwealth did not exercise this power until June 1908, when legislation providing for the introduction of means tested, flat rate, age and invalid pensions was passed. The new pensions, which were financed from general revenue, came into operation in July 1909 and in December 1910 respectively. This superseded state age pension schemes which had been introduced in New South Wales and Victoria in 1900 and in Queensland in 1908. It also superseded the invalid pension scheme introduced in New South Wales in 1908. The new pension was paid to men at the age of 65 and it was paid to women at the age of 60-but not until December 1910. The age pension was also subject to a residential qualification of 25 years, which was reduced to 20 years shortly after its introduction. A residential qualification of five years applied to the invalid pension. The pension age has been set at 65 for the last 100 years. For 100 years we have had a retirement age of 65. Now, 100 years later, we are looking at it in possibly another way. When the age pension was introduced, a man was expected to spend an average of 11 years in retirement. By 2017 it is projected that the average number of years in retirement for a 65-year-old man will have increased to 19.5 years. By 2017 a woman of the same age is expected to spend 23½ years in retirement. This is a changing situation which we need to give consideration to as we look at policy in this area. To ensure that our pension scheme can maintain strong sustainability into the future, we need to increase the age pension. The government has picked the year 2017 as the start of this new pension age eligibility, and it will increase by six months every two years after that until it reaches 67 years of age by 2023. The changes will not affect current age pensioners. Only new entrants to the pension scheme from 1 July 2017 will be affected. This will allow those who will be seniors by that time to plan for the future. It helps us look at many things that have to be looked at in coming up to that. Nowadays it is the largest Commonwealth program and we spend something like $28 billion per annum on the age pension. There have been some changes to the income test rules to better target pension increases to ensure the long-term sustainability of the pension scheme. From 20 September the new package will deliver a total increase of $32.49 a week for singles on the full rate and $10.14 a week for couples combined. The increase will be delivered via a $30 increase in the base singles pension and the addition of $2.49 per week in a new pension supplement. This includes the value of the following payments: the GST supplement, the pharmaceutical allowance, the combined telephone and internet allowance and the utilities allowance. For couples the extra is a part of the pension supplement. I have to talk about how there seems to be the view that it might be hard on couples. The Harmer pension review found that the pensioners most in need of additional assistance were single pensioners. They had similar costs to those faced by couples but they only had one income to pay the bills and meet their needs. The report found that the pension rates do not fully recognise the costs faced by single pensioners living alone and the approach of paying ad hoc bonuses did not provide the financial security that it should. From September 2009, single pensioners will receive two-thirds of the rate for couples. Bringing it up to that level is a very good achievement. On the same date there will be a cost of living index rise which will also help the base rate. These new index arrangements will be introduced to better reflect the cost of living increases for pensioners. As part of the government's reform package a new pensioner and beneficiary living cost index will be calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The new index will measure increases in the living costs faced by pensioners and beneficiary households, which can be different from those faced by other households. It is a very interesting piece of work that is now being put into these reforms. This index will be more responsive to change experienced by the recipient householders, where the out-of-pocket living costs have moved faster than the rate of changes measured by the consumer price index in the living costs of all households. Pension rates will also continue to be benchmarked to the male total average weekly earnings from 20 March 2010. A new pension benchmark for the maximum combined couple rate of the pension will be introduced. It will be 41.76 per cent of the annualised amount of the male total average weekly earnings rate. The single rate will be set at 66.33 per cent of the maximum rate payable to the combined couple, an increase of 2.7 per cent on the current benchmark. For those who choose to undertake paid work to supplement their pension, a new work bonus will be introduced to help age pensioners keep more of the money they earn from work. That is another really good reform by this government. The work bonus will provide concessional treatment of employment income under the income test for pensioners over the age pension age. Incomes will be assessed fortnightly for those pensioners, then half of the employment income, up to a maximum of $500 per fortnight, will be disregarded in the income test. So only $250 will be taken into account and therefore the pensioner will be $125 better off per fortnight. There are a number of other critical changes and some of these will be the subject of other bills. But these major changes will take us into the future. We still need to ensure that those who want to work can do so and that those who have put aside for their self-funded retirement can survive on their income, possibly with some assistance from government. Of course, as we look at an ageing population, there will be other needs as well. There are a large number of pensioners and people on lower incomes in the electorate of Lyons, by the very nature of the constituency, being rural and relatively short of services, like other regional areas of Australia. I heard the member for Lyne talking about regional Australia earlier. He focused on some of the problems that we face in some of our constituencies with regard to services and the feeling of being left out. Being ‘left' in the country is one of our problems. In my constituency people have been left as they age because they cannot really afford to sell up. They cannot get a return from their house in a country town that would allow them to move to a bigger regional centre where maybe their children have moved to. So you end up with a shrinking population base and therefore shrinking service delivery from health and other services. This is an issue that always needs some consideration. There is little public transport in my electorate. Many pensioners have to rely on an assortment of community cars to get them to the city for medical appointments. They more often make up the public hospital waiting lists for surgery or dentistry because they cannot afford private health insurance or they gave it up when they finished their employment. Though many of the pensioners in my electorate keep a good garden, there is still a difficulty in buying meat and fish, as it is expensive when you go to the smaller retail sector. There is also the problem of isolation. As I said, once the children move away, people are often left in their own areas, with a lack of available transport and an inability to drive themselves. Many families have moved away as well. When the time comes to go to the local nursing home, there are some disappointments because there seems to be pressure on many of the smaller nursing homes, which are apparently not viable according to Treasury models. Modelling on regional difficulties done by Treasury and other departments says that unless a facility is at a certain size then it is not economically viable. This is a problem for the nursing home sector and of course for people of pension age. Many of these issues were echoed in the Harmer report findings. I would like to congratulate the minister and my government for what they have done here. The minister has achieved these changes. I am very pleased to support this legislation and the work that has been done following the Harmer inquiry. This is a great piece of legislation. It will certainly assist many pensioners. It lays down a lot of opportunity for the future. I support the bill. (Time expired)",56
26,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I do not have the honourable member for Lyne on the list, but it is the opposition side of the chamber's call, so I call the honourable member for Lyne. I apologise to the member for Werriwa. He will get the call next.",59
27,Mr OAKESHOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Lyne) (11.51 am)Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will be very brief. I also thank the member for Werriwa for the opportunity to speak on the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Reform and Other 2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009. I know he has some very fine students here to listen to his very fine words, so I will be brief. I really just want to alert the government to the ongoing conversation with regard to pensioner reform. I, like the previous speaker, the member for Lyons, certainly welcomed the Harmer review process and welcomed the announcement by the government of some of the changes in the budget. Many of them, I thought, were sensible and logical. The streamlining of the various utilities allowances and supplements into one payment is a sensible reform by government and will assist a lot. There is also the addition in some of the funding to the base pension rates and supplements, and no-one can say that is not a welcome reflection of government recognising the needs and wants of the pensioner community. On the mid-North Coast of New South Wales, roughly one in three people are pension recipients. Of all 150 electorates around Australia, ours would have one of the highest proportions of people receiving some sort of pension allowance, and therefore this is something that is being watched very closely by many in my electorate. The point I want to make in this debate, whilst not opposing the legislation, is that I sincerely hope that the $10.14 and the $30-odd provided in the budget for various pension rates, and the embedding of the care allowances, which was sensible, are not the end of the discussion by the government, by the executive and in particular by the Treasurer. There are two examples I just want to put on the table. Firstly, in the next couple of weeks I will be talking with the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association from the mid-North Coast, and they have made it very clear that there is disquiet the levels of funding that were allocated in the budget. The $10.14 supplementary allowance for utilities for pensioner couples has been described as ‘disgraceful' by the president of the Manning Valley branch of the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association. That is one example of postbudget, post Harmer review feedback from a significant lobby group on the ground. Hopefully, therefore, the government's conversation with the pensioner community will continue. Secondly, one of the things that all of us here do at various times is radio interviews really odd hours. Last Friday week I did ABC Radio National at 4.30 in the morning, and one of the calls that came through was from someone who wanted a private member's bill linking the pensioner rate to parliamentary salaries. Without passing comment on the rights and wrongs of that proposal, I do think it is an example of continuing disquiet about pension rates in Australia. That should once again emphasise to the government the fact that any announcements that were in the budget, nearly a month ago now, should not be the end of the conversation but hopefully the start of a conversation with the very large pensioner community in Australia. Now, I know there are many people in this chamber who might see that position as the continuation of a hand being put out by a disgruntled community of pensioners. There may be some who argue that there is this emerging bubble of an aged population and, for economic reasons, any increase in rates cannot happen. But I would hope that the majority of people in this chamber, of all political persuasions, are like me and will argue the case strongly through legislation such as this and conversations with the executive government that it is not a good reflection on Australia or on this chamber that about we have any members of our community who are in survival mode. The whole reason that there was so much angst leading up to the election, the Harmer review and the budget was that we were having a conversation with a pensioner community that was on the poverty line, if not below it-and that does not reflect well on any of us. Once again, I say that I hope that the conversation can continue between government and pensioner communities throughout Australia-and particularly, my direct interest, on the mid-North Coast of New South Wales-so that we can continue to see reat form that is not only in the interests of the pensioner community but in the interests of the broader community as well and therefore, by logical extension, in the interests of Australia generally.",59
28,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Before calling the next speaker, the honourable member for Werriwa, I would like to welcome to the House three students from Sarah Redfern High School in Minto, in the honourable member's electorate: Tevita Maola, school captain; Lynette Peterson, school captain; and James Papalii, school vice-captain. Welcome, and I hope that you enjoy your visit to the Australian parliament.",60
29,Mr HAYES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Werriwa) (11.57 am)Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Slipper, and thank you for acknowledging those three fine students from Sarah Redfern High School. As you indicated, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sarah Redfern High School is in Minto, which is right in the middle of my electorate, and these three students are showing great leadership in the school and great leadership in the community. I think that where members have the opportunity-and I am very fortunate in Canberra not being that far from my electorate-we should invite our future leaders to visit this place and encourage their participation in community leadership. Today I take the opportunity to lend my support to the Social Security and Other islation Amendment (Pension Reform and Other 2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009. This bill provides crucial changes in the tralian pension system in order to provide financial security as well as a sustainable standard of living for our aged, our carers, our veterans and those on disability support pensions. For far too long these members of our community have been neglected. They have been part of a previous government's system that was inflexible and certainly very complex. These members of our community have always been and always will be an incredible asset to their communities generally and they make a significant contribution to our society, yet the former government repeatedly ignored their needs. I mean that. A minister under the previous government even put up a recommendation that the pension scheme be adjusted, and that was rejected. I know from members opposite-and it is not just from this bill but from what occurs elsewhere-that fixing the pension scheme was something they were going to get to after the next election. So, in the 13th yearMr Baldwin-You've had 18 months.",61
30,Mr HAYES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Their 13th year would have been a hell of a time for the Howard government if they had survived. They had lots to do in their 13th year-all the things they did not do between the first and the 12th year that they were in government. Australia does face becoming an ageing population; there is no question about that. Although the opposition have been aware of this problem-as much as we have been aware of it for some time-they maintained the current pension system. They failed to act on it. They absolutely refused to act on it. While various measures were taken to prop up the system, such as one-off bonus payments-the application of bandaids-the thing that they constantly refused to do in the whole time of their administration was to fix Leg- the pension system. What the current government is doing is in stark contrast to what occurred under the Howard government. We Ausare in the midst of a financial crisis and many are concerned about their financial future-I readily accept that-and this government is taking decisive action to strengthen the Australian economy. As the very structure of our nation changes, it is imperative that these measures are taken to strengthen the financial security of the recipients of pension payments. The bill before the House today highlights just how serious the government is about pension reform and how committed it is to it. Given the challenges that the country faces with the world financial crisis, we are still committed to doing something for those of our community on aged, veteran's affairs or disability support pensions. The proof is in the pudding. I take the interjection from the member for Paterson. I think it is 18 months since the last election. But do not forget that last year the government actually did something that the opposition refused to do: we commissioned a thorough report into the adequacy of the pension system. We did not just put it off for another group to do and then reject their recommendations later. We committed ourselves to the Harmer review, which was to look into the adequacy of the pension system. It is the recommendations of that very review which we are acting on. The year 2009 is the centenary of the age pension. When you look back to 1909-and it is not all that long ago-and to what was occurring on the world stage then, the age pension was not necessarily unique. However, it was significant that a government had the foresight to do something about looking after the long-term welfare of those who were contributing to the nation. As I said, the age pension is 100 years old. It is a Labor government that is now moving that system forward; it was also a Labor government that, back in 1909, under Andrew Fisher, introduced the age pension. We are continuing the tradition of ensuring that we lay the path for the financial and sustainable future of those who contribute to our community. The Harmer review analysed the basic structure of Australia's pension scheme, with particular focus on the necessity for effective reform to alleviate poverty and to improve community living standards. The Harmer review emphasised that, at the current rate, pensions did not fully recognise the cost borne by single age pensioners living alone. It went on to note that, even in these difficult financial circumstances, we are required to act-and that is precisely what we are doing with the bill before the House today. It is not a matter of just another inconsistent approach to another ad hoc payment or another bandaid being applied to the system. We committed ourselves to a thorough review of the system and to look at its long-term sustainability. The existing system needs to have improved transparency; pensions need to be linked to community living standards, because obviously pensioners are affected by price changes. I think that is what the member for Lyne was indicating in his contribution a little earlier. He said that this was a significant position to take in rectifying the pension system. He is still in dialogue-and appropriately so-with the pensioner groups in his area. I am glad that he is in dialogue with them because he represents my mum and dad, who reside on the North Coast of New South Wales. By 2047-I know that that is a little way down the track-we will have 7.2 million Australians over the age of 65. That represents 25 per cent of the expected population. That is quite a contrast to the current position, which is that those who are over the age of 65 represent 13 per cent of the population. So, in light of that demographic change alone, these reforms are necessary to make the pension scheme simpler, fairer and also to ensure that the pension changes are targeted at those who need them most. I want to focus in particular on the bill's inclusion of the increase in the pension rate. Throughout the Australian government's current spend, which is about $28 billion per annum on age pensions, we recognise the need for improved pension payments while also ensuring that those reforms are affordable. The Harmer review found that, as it stands, the full rate of the single pension is inadequate. The ratio of a full-rate payment between single and couple pensioners needs to be lifted from its existing rate, which is calculated at 60 per cent to somewhere between 64 and 67 per cent. That was the recommendation by Jeff Harmer in his review. This bill picks up that recommendation and ensures that the corrections are made. Through this legislation the government has ensured a substantial increase of $32.49 per week to the full-rate single pension, which lifts the ratio between single and couple pensioners from an existing 60 per cent to 66.3 per cent. The couple pensioners will also benefit from additional assistance of $10.14 per week. These increased provisions will take place along with the regular indexation. The regular indexation will ensure that the value is maintained. It is important to note that these changes to increase pension rates are a direct result of the recommendations made by Dr Jeff Harmer. As I said, the member for Paterson wanted to downplay that aspect but quite frankly that is something that we were committed to. We not only received the Harmer report but are acting on it. The bill will also further assist less individuals in our community who every day make that significant sacrifice in caring for others. Many of them are under significant financial pressure. As a consequence of previous legislation passed in the parliament a supplement payment of $600 will commence today. After the discussions I have had I know that this will be seen as very significant to carers across our nation. I am sure the member for Shortland has had similar discussions with carers in her community as well. I know about that because one of the regular things that we do as members of parliament-and not just on this side of parliament, as the member for Lyne indicated-is to maintain contact with those people who undertake the selfless work of caring for others. In the outer metropolitan area of Sydney we have a heck of a lot of carers-certainly a lot of people involved in caring for the disabled. That is being recognised. It is something that needs to be recognised because these people do an absolutely fantastic job. Without their contribution, their love and support of the people they care for, society would be much worse off. I would like to take the opportunity during this debate to acknowledge the magnitude of the impact these pension support changes will have on individuals. There are approximately 3.3 million age pensioners, disability pensioners, carers, wife pensioners and veteran income support recipients who will directly benefit from these changes across the country. In my electorate of Werriwa aloneSarah Redfern High School is in the middle of that electorate-I can, with the assistance of the member for Shortland, tell you that there is a total of 17,357 people who will benefit from these reforms. Of those, 10,260 are single age pensioners. I am not sure how that demographic translates across the nation but that is quite a significant part of the those selfpopulation of Werriwa. To better target these pension increases new income tests will have to be applied. I know-I have read the commentary in the newspapers-that there is some disquiet about that. The member for Lyne talked about some aspects of that as well. To give greater flexibility and ensure that we have a sustainable application of the pensioner scheme into the future we have had to look at targeting those who need it. So from September this year the tapering rate for income above the free area will be increased from 40c to 50c in the dollar. Before people jump up and down and point the finger about that, one of the things we did through this legislation was to look at the transitional arrangements that will protect existing pensioners who would otherwise be adversely affected by the change. Under the provisions that are to apply, people who would be adversely affected by that change will be protected under their existing entitlements, including any increase, until they would be better off under the new entitlement. So people cannot be worse off under those changes. However, this measure is setting the platform for the sustainable application of this scheme into the future. As I said at the outset, this legislative package provides extensive changes to the Social Security Act which are long overdue and, more importantly, it is about protecting many of the most vulnerable members of our community. We owe those members a great deal. This government has rectified the failings of the former government in that respect. We have not applied another bandaid; we have set out to achieve a proper structural reform of the system. Following 12 years of covering up the fact that the single pension was severely inadequate, by using ad hoc bonuses or other means, the proposed amendments in this legislation move to rectify the structure of the pension scheme so that it will benefit all Australians. Everyone, including the students here from Sarah Redfern High School, is aware that one day they may need to rely on our pension scheme. Therefore, this bill sets the safety net to ensure there is confidence in that scheme and that the structure of the scheme will be sound for now and into the future. I support the bill.",61
31,Ms HALL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"It gives me great pleasure to rise to speak in support of the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Reform and Other 2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009. This legislation will support pensioners and benefit an enormous number of people throughout Australia. The bill introduces a range of measures from the 2009 budget, including measures for the government's secure and sustainable pension reforms package. The measures in the bill include an increase to the age pension rate; the closure of the Pension Bonus Scheme to new applicants; changes to advance payments; structural reforms and simplification such as providing a new pension supplement and a new seniors supplement to replace a variety of current entitlements; revised pension indexation and benchmarking arrangements, using in part a new pension and beneficiary living cost index to complement the consumer price index-and I will be talking a little bit about that later; revised pension income test arrangements and transitional arrangements to ensure pensioners affected by the income test changes will not be any worse off, which I think is very important; revised indexation and benchmarking arrangements for certain family tax benefit rates and maternity immunisation allowance; exclusion from social security and veterans' entitlements income tests of amounts received under the Western Australian cost of living rebate scheme and the value of benefits received under the Western Australia country age pension fuel card scheme; changes in regard to aged-care fees; the introduction of new supplement for aged-care providers; and the addition of a new operational area to give individuals allotted for service ‘qualifying service', entitling them to full benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. This reform package improves the adequacy of the pension system, making it operate in a simpler way that is more responsive to pensioners' needs, and it ensures the long term sustainability of the pension in this country. It prepares Australia to meet future challenges, including the ageing population. I have to acknowledge the work that was done by former Treasurer Peter Costello in bringing down the Intergenerational report, because that was the first serious consideration of the impact that the ageing of our population will have in Australia. This is the next step in that process. Also outlined by the government are further steps to constantly review and adapt to the changing demographic within this country. Australia has 3.3 million age pensioners, disability pensioners, carers, wife pensioners and veteran income support recipients, and they will all benefit from these increases in the pension payment. On many occasions I have stood in this parliament and highlighted the fact that the Shortland electorate is one of the oldest in the country. It has the eighth highest number of pensioners in Australia. I believe that, for the first time in a very long time, we have a government that is seriously looking at the needs of those pensioners. In the Shortland electorate we have 26,592 pensioners. That includes 11,176 pensioners that live in a partnership, 786 single pensioners, 814 carer payment recipients living in a partnership, 441 single carer payment recipients, 3,659 partnered carer allowance recipients, 938 single carer allowance recipients, over 3,000 disability support pensioners living in a nership and nearly 3,000 disability support pensioners that are living alone. That is a significant number of people that I represent in this parliament. For a very long time. I have been being approached by pensioners telling me just how hard it is for them. They were particularly impacted by the GST, and every little cost of living change following that has also impacted on them-to a greater extent than they have impacted on working Australians. Their level of disposable income is lower and they are more vulnerable when there are changes. For the first time, we have a government that has reviewed the system. It has been 100 years since the age pension was introduced in Australia. The Harmer review, which this legislation stems from, was very much overdue. The pension reform measures in this bill implement the reforms of that review in social security and aged care. The bill really does reflect the recommendations made by Dr Harmer. The government has acted to introduce long-overdue reforms to make the pension system simpler and fairer. As I mentioned, the age pension was introduced in 1909. I think it is also important to mention that the age pension is the largest-spending Commonwealth own-purpose program. The Australian government is currently spending $28 billion per annum on the age pension. That is why, when you make changes, you must make sure they are the right changes. I know at the time of the Howard government there was a lot of talk about the need for change, but there was no action. What we have in this legislation is action. We do not have ministers going to cabinet and being rejected when they suggest that pensioners be given an increase. We have a very transparent review process, and culminating from that review process we have the recommendations. I should go over the Harmer review a litparttle, for the benefit of the House. It commenced on 15 May 2008. If we look back to last year's budget, we had the then Leader of the Opposition, Dr Nelson, clamouring for a $30 increase for single pensioners-no thought whatsoever for married pensioners or partnered pensioners. There was just this flat $30 for pensioners. In February this year Dr Harmer handed down his report. As I have already mentioned, it was really critical in the development of this legislation. During the review process there were public hearings in every capital city and in regional centres. There was a hearing held in my own area, in the Hunter and on the Central Coast, and it received over 2,000 written submissions. In fact, I had pensioners come to my office and we forwarded their submissions on to the review. Dr Harmer was supported by a reference group comprising representatives from seniors groups, disability groups and carer groups; experts in the area of pensioners; academics; and the ACTU. So you can see that it was a very holistic approach to reviewing the pension. I think that, for the first time, we have before us legislation that is looking at the issues that have been facing pensioners. There are some challenges in relation to the pension. Going back to the review, it was found that for a very long time pension rates have not fully recognised the costs facing single pensioners, that the indexation rates for pensions need to be more transparent, that there is a complexity of needs that needs to be reviewed and reduced as it undermines the financial security of pensioners and that services that are essential to complement the pension system need to be diverse and respond to pensioners' needs. Looking at workforce participation, as I have mentioned already, we have an ageing population, so there needs to be incentives to encourage people to work a little bit longer and make it worth pensioners' while to decide that they will remain in the workforce. So there are very complex issues. The review found that it was desirable to increase the age pension qualifying age to 67 from 2017. This will be done incrementally, and it will increase by six months over a period of four years. So from 2017 the eligibility age will be increased by six months every two years until it reaches 67 years of age in 2023. So there is quite a long lead-in time; it will not affect anyone who is actually receiving the pension at this time. I would like to go to the core of this lation. The bill will be increasing the maximum single rate of pension by $30 a week, or $1,560 a year, from 20 September this year. I must say that, from the phone calls I have received in my office, pensioners are very appreciative of the change. These increases are on top of indexation and any increase in the male average weekly earnings, which would have already been taken into account on 20 September this year. The increase brings the single pension rate up to two-thirds, or 66.3 per cent, of the combined couple rate. Looking at overseas examples and models, that really seems to be the level it needs to be at. But there is another aspect to the changes that I think is fairly important, and that is the pension supplement. The bill introduces a new pension supplement to simplify the number of supplementary pension payments that are currently available and to provide pensioners with a more flexible way of managing their budgets. Currently, there is the GST supplement, the pharmaceutical allowance, the utilities allowance and the telephone allowance. They will all be incorporated into a pension supplement. The consolidation of these payments will really help pensioners, because they will be paid initially on a fortnightly basis. The pension supplement for a single pensioner will be $2.49, on top of the combination of all those supplements I have already mentioned. For married pensioners the supplement will be $10.14. I come to the issue of married and partnered pensioners. There has been considerable misinformation put out into the community about the benefits of pension changes to married and partnered pensioners. A local newspaper on the Central Coast has been running articles that actually claim that partnered pensioners will be worse off, and this legishas developed a life of its own. Partnered and married pensioners will not be worse off; they will be better off. Whilst they do not receive the same level of increase as single pensioners, they will be receiving a $10.14 a week increase and will not have any reduction in their pension supplement. So the very strong message that I would like to get out, not only to pensioners in the Shortland electorate but to pensioners everywhere, is that married and partnered pensioners will not be worse off but will be better off. In addition to the increases and the change in the way the supplements are paid, there will be other benefits to pensioners, such as the seniors supplement, a payment that replaces the seniors concession allowance and telephone allowance currently available to holders of the Commonwealth seniors health card. It will deliver benefits to that group of seniors in our community. There will be some changes to the pension income test. The test changes from 20 September this year. This is looking at ensuring that the pension system remains sustainable in the long term. This is also looking to make sure that increases go to those who most need them. Existing pensioners will be protected. As the member for Werriwa pointed out, no pensioner will be worse off. The income test taper rate will increase from 40c to 50c per dollar of income over the income-test-free area. I reiterate that no current pensioner will be worse off. A new work bonus will be introduced for age and service pensioners. This will provide concessional income test treatment of employment income for pensioners over the pension age. This will replace the previous pension bonus scheme. I think it will really benefit people greatly as 50 per cent of a pensioner's employment income, up to a maximum of $500 a fortnight, will be disregarded from the income test. That will have a long-term benefit for pensioners. The previous pension bonus scheme was quite rigid and there were a number of problems associated with it. I have had people come to see me because they were excluded from that scheme when they should have actually been receiving its benefits. The final thing that I would like to touch on is indexation. The Australian Bureau of Statistics will develop a new index that will specifically reflect cost of living changes for pensioners and other income support recipients. It will be known as the pensioner and beneficiary living cost index. This will ensure that future increases in the pension will really reflect the needs of pensioners. If the CPI is greater than that index, pensioners and beneficiaries will be given an increase. The legislative benchmark will be set at 41.76 per cent of male total average weekly earnings for couples and at 27.7 per cent of MTAWE for singles. I wholly support this legislation. I think it is good legislation that really benefits Australia's seniors and pensioners. It is looking to the future to ensure the long-term sustainability of our pension scheme.",64
32,Mr ZAPPIA,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak in support of the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Reform and Other 2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009. This bill represents the most significant pension reform that we have seen in this country since pensions were introduced in 1909, 100 years ago. Whilst there is no question at all that over the years there have been some changes made to the way pensions are paid in this country, there would be little doubt that there has never been a single bill that proposes as much reform as this bill does. The reforms are very much long overdue and they are necessary reforms to ensure that Australia's pension system remains sustainable into the future. I say that because, as most members of this House would know, we face in the future an increase in the number of Australians who will be living beyond pension age. In fact, if I can quote some statistics on coming decades, by the year 2047 some 7.2 million Australians will be aged over 65, representing 25 per cent of the expected population. That will be almost double the current rate of 13 per cent. Currently there are around five people of working age to support every person aged 65 and over. By 2047 this will have halved to 2.4 people of working age supporting pensioners in this country. So we can see that there are going to be significant changes in the demographics of this nation and that is why we need to adopt now a pension reform package that will be sustainable into the future. When the Rudd government was elected, it committed to a review of pensions throughout this country. That review was announced by the minister in May 2008 and conducted by Dr Jeff Harmer, and the report was handed to the government in February this year. It is interesting that that very ough review of pensions attracted over 2,000 written submissions. Hearings were conducted throughout the country, and I think it would be fair to say that almost every organisation, institution and pensioner group around the country made representations and submissions in respect of pensions. I suspect they did so not just because there was an opportunity for them to comment about pensions but because this was one issue that for years and years had been raised with governments and for years and years had been neglected. It came to a head when the Harmer review was commissioned by the Rudd government. The Rudd government is now responding to that review and implementing its key recommendations. It was interesting to hear some of the contributions from members opposite, with a number of them wanting to take credit for the increases proposed in this bill. I say two things to those members opposite who want to take credit when, quite clearly, they do not deserve to take credit. Firstly, with respect to the increase to the single pension payment in this bill, opposition members had 12 years to do something about that. They had 12 years wherein they conducted their own Intergenerational report-and I understand that they conducted two of those. A proposition was put by Mal Brough in 2007 which was rejected at the time by the Howard-Costello government. They presided over a periodand I quote from figures between 2001 and 2006-when one in three elderly people living alone spent their years in poverty. One in three single pensioners living alone lived their lives in poverty. That is a very damning statistic. Again between 2001 and 2006, 20 per cent of the poor were people aged over 65. Not surprisingly, there was a huge response to the parliamentary inquiry because of the magnitude of the problem and the difficulties faced by pensioners around this thorcountry. But members opposite did absolutely nothing for 12 years, other than talk about it. And when they did have a proposition from one of their members, Mal Brough, they rejected it. The second point I make about their claim to credit for this bill is that this bill goes far beyond just simply increasing pensions for single pensioners. It has a raft of measures in it which will totally reform the way pensions will be managed in this country for years into the future. Whilst I will not have the time to speak about each and every one of those reforms, I do want to speak about some of the critical elements of the bill. Importantly, Australia's 3.3 million age pensioners-disability pensioners, carers, wife pensioners and veterans income support recipients-will benefit from an increase in their pension payment. That is 3.3 million Australians who will benefit from payments as a result of this bill. That is a huge commitment by the government at a time when we are going through the worse economic downturn since the 1930s. In contrast, when you look at what the previous government did not do, they were going through a mining boom when they were in government. In my electorate of Makin, 20,700 pensioners will benefit from this increase. Roughly one in five of the voting population in Makin will benefit from these measures. That is a huge number. I have no doubt that this measure will be very much welcomed by the people I represent in Makin. The key elements of this bill and of the increases, as other members have quite rightly highlighted, are that there will be an increase of $32.49 per week for the single pension and an increase of $10.14 per week for couples combined. I also point out that $2.49 of the singles payment will be paid as an increase in the pension supplement and that the full $10.14 for the combined pension will also be paid in the form of a pension supplement. What is important about this increase is that, in line with the Harmer review on pensions, the single pension rate will increase a proportion of the combined couple rate, from 60 per cent to 66.33 per cent of the male total average weekly earnings-that is, the discrepancy in the ratio between the single pension and the couples pension has been adjusted in accordance with the Harmer review. That is significant because one of the critical bones of contention throughout my electorate over the years has been that single pensioners have found it much more difficult to survive on the single pension. That was reflected in the figures I referred to earlier that, between 2001 and 2006, one in three elderly people lived in poverty. But it has also been reflected certainly in the representations that I have received since being elected as the member for Makin and prior to that, in a different capacity, when I was the Mayor of Salisbury and dealing with pension issues on a regular basis. I hear the argument from some people who say that a couple living together also have increased costs but, again, the ratios have now been appropriately adjusted, and this is indeed a significant reform. There are a number of other significant improvements to pension payments under this legislation. One of those is that a new pension index measure will be introduced which will better reflect the cost of living increases faced by pensioners. Under this change, a new pensioner and beneficiary living cost index will be calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. We know that pensioners are not affected by CPI increases to the same degree as society generally and that CPI increases do not necessarily reflect the cost of living increases faced by pensioners. The CPI is based on a whole range of expenditures which, in many cases, do not pick up on the majority area of expense that pensioners face. I have frequently been approached by pensioners in the past who have said: ‘Yes, as our pension has increased by the CPI. However, the CPI has no bearing on the real costs of living increases that we are faced with.' I accept that argument, and so did the Harmer inquiry and so did the government. That is why we have introduced this new cost index to increase pensions. Under the new provisions, the higher of the CPI or the new pensioner living cost index will be used to determine pension increase. If by some chance the CPI comes out higher than the new index, it will be the measure that will be used. A third significant change to pensions is that from 20 March 2010 the maximum combined couple rate of the pension will be 41.76 per cent of the annualised male total average weekly earnings. That is important because it changes what the pension should be in comparison to average male weekly earnings. Under this bill, there will also be important reforms relating to pension payments and aged-care providers caring for pension recipients. This is another matter that over the years I have heard representations about from both pensioners and aged-care providers on a regular basis. It has been an area which has been a real bone of contention for both sides. Pensioners quite rightly argue against all of their pension payment going to the aged-care providers once they are in an aged-care facility. The aged-care providers, quite rightly-I believe-have argued that the aged-care pension, because it has not been increased sufficiently over the years, is today not adequate to meet the daily expenses incurred by them in caring for the pensioners under their care. Both sides, as a result of the pensions not having been increased sufficiently, have been struggling and both sides have, I believe, legitimate cases to make. Many pensioners in age care facilities have their entire pension go to the aged-care provider. What the government was very conscious of was that if there was going to be an increase in the aged-pension-as there was-that it should not all go to the agedcare provider but that some of it should also go to pensioners. So in the case of single pensioners, of the $32.49 that will be given to them as an increase, $10.09 will be paid directly to the pensioner and $22.40 will go to the aged-care provider if the pensioner is in an aged-care facility. That is a fair sharing of the increase to the pension. It is acknowledged that others may be affected by the measure that increases the daily bed allowance for single pensioners. People like self-funded retirees or part-rate single pensioners who do not benefit from the pension increase may also be faced with that additional increase of $22.40 that is paid to aged-care providers. The government, in recognition of that, has made a provision of some $713 million over the next four years to ensure that those self-funded retirees or part-rate single pensioners are protected from the increase in the daily fees that they would otherwise be charged. For any person who is in an aged-care facility as at 19 September this year, that shortfall will be met by the government. That money paid by the government will ensure that the aged-care providers throughout this country will receive an additional $713 million over four years. I stress that point because I am sure that other members of this House have also been approached by the aged-care sector seeking to have their daily fees increased and the daily subsidies provided by the government increased. As I said earlier on, many of the aged-care providers are struggling under the current payment arrangements to provide the level of service that they would like to. That $713 million will be welcomed, I am sure, by the aged-care sector. I am sure that it will go a long way to ensuring that they will be able to continue to provide the high level of care that many of them pride themselves on. Without that kind of money, one of these outcomes is inevitable: firstly, either the aged-care providers would have to provide a lower standard of care; secondly, they would have to try and cut costs in some other way; or, thirdly, they would have to increase the fees that they charge the people in their care. I welcome this measure because it will go a long way in assisting the two sides of what I call the pensioner argument that I have been presented with since being elected to this place. The last measure that I want to talk about specifically in respect to this bill is that relating to carers. The bill provides for an annual carer supplement payment of $600 for around half-a-million carers across Australia. When I look at the figures, about 850 of these people are in my electorate of Makin. This is not just a single one-off payment but an ongoing annual $600 payment. Unlike the previous government, who would make single one-off payments in response to pressures coming from the community, we are making an ongoing commitment and one that I am sure will be welcomed by carers throughout the country. A new supplement will also provide recipients of the carer allowance with a $600 annual payment for each person who they care for. In my electorate of Makin, that will affect about 3,000 people. Quite a substantial number of people will get a very real benefit from these reforms. In fact, more than 95 per cent of carer payment recipients also receive the carer allowance. The last point I make about these reforms is that these reforms, amongst other things, cover the pension supplement that is proposed as a mechanism to pay for increased householder costs as a result of the introduction of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, which-as we all know-the opposition is opposing. Under that scheme, the government is proposing to set aside some $6 billion in the form of a household assistance package. That package is aimed predominantly at assisting low-income households with any increases in the costs of living that they incur as a result of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme being introduced. Interestingly, those low-income households will include pensioners because most pensioners are the ones that will be put into the low-income category. For them, the assistance that is provided under the proposal in schedule 5 of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme would mean that all of their cost of living increases occurring as a result of that scheme will be met by the government. In fact, 120 per cent of their cost of living increases are expected to be covered by this proposal. That is an important aspect of the scheme, even though that bill is still to pass through parliament. One of the concerns that I have is that part of the scare campaign being run by the opposition about the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation is that householders will be faced with an increased cost of living. If you are a lower-income householder, that scare campaign will resonate even more because, if you already struggling, an increase in the cost of living is something that you do not want. I want to make it absolutely clear that those people, particularly those at the lower-income end, will be protected under that scheme by the $6 billion household package. This legislation already makes provision for that. I conclude by saying, as I said at the outset, that the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Reform and Other 2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009 makes the most significant reform to pension payments in Australia since 1909. I have not covered all of the changes that are proposed in it, but it is certainly an attempt-and, I think, a very constructive and well-thoughtthrough attempt-to ensure that pensions are sustainable into the future and to respond to all the dominant issues that are raised on a regular basis with members of this parliament about the support required for pensioners. I commend the bill to the House.  Before I commence, I congratulate the member for Corio, Richard Marles, on his elevation to the position of Parliamentary Secretary for Innovation and Industry and wish him well in that role. On behalf of the 13,900 pensioners in my electorate and the 3.3 million pensioners in Australia, I am pleased to rise in support of the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Reform and Other 2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009. For the benefit of the House, I will not name each of the pensioners in my electorate! This bill implements the Rudd government's commitment to delivering lasting reform to the pension and to supporting our beloved pensioners. It delivers an increase of $32.49 week for single pensioners and $10 a week for couples from 20 September this year. As all 13,900 pensioners in Moreton could attest, over the tenure of the Howard government we saw the cost of living skyrocket. The cost of utilities, health care, groceries, housing and the other necessities of life more than doubled-and tripled, in some cases. Shamefully, the pension has simply not kept pace with this, leaving many pensioners wondering how to pay their bills. In fact, according to the latest Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey, between 2001 and 2006 the rates of income poverty were consistently highest among the elderly, particularly single elderly households. It was painfully obvious to the Rudd government that pension reform was needed to guarantee an adequate and sustainable standard of living for our elderly and our disabled and their carers. This side of the House cares about dignity. That is a Labor social contract that will never be broken. This is why the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Jenny Macklin, instigated the Harmer pension review-because of our relentless pursuit of dignity for all senior Australians. This comprehensive review recognised that pension rates, particularly for single pensioners, were insufficient. The Harmer review recommended that the government concentrate our increase on those who are worse off-that is, people who are single and living alone, whether they are age pensioners, disability support pensioners or carers. The review estimated that we need to provide around $30 a week extra in order to make sure that single pensioners have sufficient income, and that is exactly what this bill before the House delivers. I stress that this is not a vote-buying cise. It is a budgeted and sustainable approach to reforming the pension for the long term. No right thinking Australian would try to argue that our pensioners are not worth this commitment. The Rudd Labor government does not believe in leaving pensioners guessing on budget night about whether they will get a one-off sweetener-that transitory sugar hit-because that way lies diabetes; the Rudd government is much more responsible. Instead, every single pensioner knows that every week they will receive an extra $32 from the government. Every pension couple knows that they will receive an extra $10 per week. This applies to age pensioners, disability pensioners, carers, wife pensioners and veterans' income support recipients. It is obvious that we are not making this reform at the best of times; some might say that it is the worse of times. In fact, these are very tough economic times. They are challenging times. They are, I think, referred to as character-building times. Most governments would have trotted out the convenient line that this pension reform is too hard in the current economic environment. The coalition could not bring themselves to increase the pension in the best of boom times, when gold bars were raining down upon them. But we and they know that the pension is grossly inadequate and we and they know that a pension increase is needed now. Those opposite, including the opposition spokesperson, the member for Warringah, continue to speak against these necessary reforms. How does he live with himself? He says: … you can only give pensioners a fair go if the overall economic condition of the country is sound. But we on this side of the House, we who believe in dignity, say that now more than ever pensioners need and deserve a fair go. exerSometimes you have to have the guts to make the tough decisions in tough times, and I know that the pensioners and seniors groups in my electorate agree. Neil Couch, secretary of the Annerley-Moorooka Senior Citizens Association says: The pension increases have been greatly received by all our members. Norm Bullen, a well-respected senior resident in Tarragindi, says: It's a long overdue recognition of the value of Australia's senior citizens. And Joan MCGRATH, a Moorooka resident, a well-respected member of my local St Brendan's parish and a long-term St Vincent de Paul volunteer, says: Working closely with St Vincent de Paul, I see that it's much needed as there are a lot of struggling at the moment. This bill also amends the qualifying age for the age pension. The age will increase by six months every two years from 2017, reaching 67 for males and females in 2023. I hope everybody currently 57 or younger is able to reorganise their lives around this tough decision that the government has had to make. However, the reality is that the pension age has not changed since the age pension was introduced 100 years ago. Back then, you were lucky to make it to 65, but I am pleased to say that we are all living and working a lot longer these days. Many other countries, including the United States and Germany, are already increasing their pension age to 67. This change not only reflects the fact that we are living and working longer; it ensures that the age pension will be sustainable into the future. To this end, the bill will introduce a new indexation to better reflect cost-ofliving increases for pensioners. The Australian Bureau of Statistics will measure increases in the living costs of pensioners. This will ensure that the value of the pension will be more responsive to pensioner out-ofpocket living costs. This bill also tightens the pension income test. From 20 September 2009, the income test taper rate will increase from 40c to 50c for each dollar of income over the income test free areas. I welcome the transitional arrangements, which will ensure that existing pensioners do not face a reduction in payments because of the income test. A new work bonus will also be introduced to help age pensioners keep more of the money they earn from work. I do not wish to dishonour Brian Mannix and the Uncanny X-Men, but, unfortunately, it is not true that ‘everybody wants to work'. However, for those seniors who do, this is obviously good news. Income will be assessed fortnightly and half of emseniors ployment income, up to a maximum of $500, will be disregarded in the income test. This is good policy to provide an incentive for those who are able to work to do so. We all know that, for many people, with work comes additional dignity. Governments should be judged by how they treat the elderly and how they treat people with a disability and those noble people who sacrifice so much to care for them. I am proud to be part of a government that is truly listening and responding to the needs of pensioners. This bill delivers a simpler, fairer pension system that is long overdue. I thank the Treasurer and the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Jenny Macklin, for having the courage to rise above the current economic circumstances and argue at the cabinet table why we should do the right thing by Australian pensioners. I worked briefly in Ms Macklin's office many years ago and it is reassuring to see that the compassion I saw then has not been in any way diminished by the trappings of ministerial office. I commend the bill to the House. Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (1.02 pm)-I rise to speak in support of the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Reform and Other 2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009. This bill will introduce a number of key measures from the 2009 budget. With over 21,250 pensioners and carers and another over 4,100 veteran income support recipients in my electorate of Petrie, the increase to the pension rate is a long-awaited and welcome initiative. I note that the changes to veterans payments will be dealt with in a different bill, but I believe that important in this debate to acknowledge the benefit that comes not just to age pensioners and carers but also to veterans from the budget initiatives. Well before the election of the Rudd Labor government in 2007, pensioners were calling out for reform. They were calling out for a significant change in the base rate of the pension. Those members on the other side of the chamber have questioned why it has taken so long to increase the base rate of the pension. There is a clear distinction between the previous, Howard government and the Rudd Labor government on this issue. In 12 years the Howard government failed to do anything to support pensioners. It is true that, come election time each term, pensioners would find themselves the recipients of oneoff bonus payments. However, those pensioners were never told that the one-off payments were not budgeted for in future estimates. They only came along in election time. Despite any reviews or inquiries the previous government may have undertaken during its long 12 years in office, no long term reform or any beneficial reform to pension rates was ever introduced. The Rudd Labor government heard that call from pensioners loud and clear. This government did not sit back and pay lip service to pensioners the way the previous government did. Within its first six months in office, the Rudd Labor government took action. On 15 May 2008, the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the Hon. Jenny Macklin MP, announced that the secretary of her department, Dr Jeff Harmer, would lead a review into measures to strengthen the financial security of seniors, carers and people with disability. This investigation was to include a review of the age pension, the carer payment and the disability support pension. The minister asked Dr Harmer to report to it is the government on the outcomes of the pension review by 28 February 2009. The terms of reference directed the review to consider the appropriate levels of income support and allowances, including the base rate of the pension, with reference to the stated purpose of the payment; the frequency of payments, including the efficacy of lump sums versus ongoing support; and the structure and payment of concessions or other entitlements that would improve the financial circumstances and security of carers and older Australians. The pension review has been undertaken in the context of the wider inquiry into Australia's future tax system, which is considering the tax structure needed to position Australia to deal with the social, economic and environmental challenges of the 21st century. The terms of reference for the inquiry into Australia's future tax system require it to consider improvements to the tax and transfer payment system for individuals, including retirees, and for working families. While the panel overseeing the tax system review is due to report by the end of 2009, the government asked the chair of the review, Dr Ken Henry AC, to bring forward his report on the retirement income system to March 2009 to allow that report to be considered in conjunction with the pension review report. The pension review report was completed by Dr Jeff Harmer in February 2009. The government's secure and sustainable pension package, which was developed with the assistance of Dr Harmer's report, was announced in the 2009 budget, which was handed down by the Treasurer on 12 May this year. This means that, within the first five weeks of this new government's parliamentary sittings, the review was announced and, within one year from that announcement, the government introduced the changes through the 2009 budget. This is a far cry from the inaction of the previous Howard government. The Labor government recognised and acknowledged that pensioners were finding it very difficult through 2008 while awaiting the Harmer review's report. With the global economic crisis really starting to show its effects and to have a flow-on effect in Australia's communitiesinto our households; into our businesses-in late 2008, this government acted decisively to stimulate the economy in the way they best believed it could be done. At the same time, the government provided interim financial assistance to pensioners by providing pensioners with a one-off payment delivered to them in December through the stimulus package. This payment not only provided an immediate financial benefit to those pensionsee ers but also was equivalent to a $35 a week increase in their pension between the delivery of that payment and June this year. So basically was able to fill a gap until such time as the Harmer report came down. The government's 2009-10 budget delivers for pensioners a permanent shift to the base rate of the pension. The single pension base rate will increase by $30 per week. In addition, a further supplementary payment of $2.49 per week for single pensioners will be paid and there will be an additional $10.14 per week supplementary payment for couple pensioners. We should not underestimate that supplementary payment. Previously, under the Howard government, we saw many payments being provided on an annual basis. Very shortly after coming to government, the Rudd Labor government provided that many payments, such as the utilities allowance the telephone allowance, would be paid quarterly-recognising that, as with all of our costs of living, those bills do not sit there and wait until the end of the financial year before they have to be paid, that these are ongoing expenses, and it is best to provide that financial assistance as those bills are coming in. This budget takes that initiative one step further and, in my submission, makes a significant change to the way in which we ensure that pensioners in our community are getting the financial assistance they need when they need it. This initiative ensures that, from 20 September 2009, these payments will be paid as a single supplementary payment on a fortnightly basis. It rolls together a range of payments that are already being provided to pensioners, which will see them not have to wait annually or quarterly but in fact get those supplementary payments when they need them most. Those supplementary payments in addition to the $2.49 per week for single pensioners and the $10.14 per week for couple pensioners will their GST supplement, their pharmaceutical allowance, their utilities allowance and their telephone allowance being received at it the same time as they are getting their normal base rate pension payments. This will see a significant benefit flowing to these pensioners. As I have said before in this chamber, over 30 per cent of pensioners on the north side of Brisbane are renting. It is important when you are in the private rental market that you can pay your rent on time. If you cannot, there can be very serious consequences. Pensioners do not necessarily have the means to supplement their income when times are tough, and they, more than anyone, need to make sure that they can meet those payments when they are due. This initiative not only improves the base rate of the pension payment-an improvement long over and due-but also rolls up those supplementary payments in a much more simplified way by having a single supplementary payment that incorporates all those allowances paid fortnightly to benefit those people. For a single pensioner, in addition to their $30 increase, will mean a $25.39 increase to their weekly entitlement, and of course that will be adjusted with indexation on 20 September as well. So it is at least $25.39 on top of their $30 base rate increase. For couple pensioners, there will be an increase of over $30 per week in their entitlements. What is even better is that next year these pensioners will have the flexibility to decide how that supplementary payment will be paid and whether they want to go back to quarterly payments. Everyone has their own way of budgeting. Some would rather receive that payment quarterly when those bills are coming in. This government is providing flexibility to pensioners in relation to their payments-flexibility which they have never had before. They have not had the luxury of choosing when to get that payment. It was either ‘That's when you get it or you don't.' This measure empowers pensioners to decide how they want to budget and how they want to manage their expenses. That is another very important initiative as a consequence of this budget measure and the commitment this government made not only to undertake a review but also, more importantly, to act on the recommendations that came out of that review. Too often we have reviews that do not necessarily get acted on. We have seen action by this government to deliver for pensioners and to take on board the recommendations that have come out of the Harmer report. Another very important initiative which has been spoken about in this House, in the media and out in the community is the increase to the pension age. I support the increase to the pension age. I believe it is what a responsible government would do. It is a necessary measure that will ensure the long term sustainability of the pension system in this country and that is what we have to address. It is our responsibility to ensure that it people have financial support well into the future. We all know that we are living longer and that the initiatives, the research and the changes in the health sector are fantastic. We are able to move forward to ensure that illnesses, chronic diseases and a range of medical conditions which previously would see someone's life cut short are much more manageable and will continue to be more manageable in future because of innovation in the medical field. People are going to live longer. If we are going to live longer we have to stand up and say: how are we going to make the pension system sustainable for the long term? This is one of those initiatives. Prior to the budget coming down, many retirees out in the community, certainly in my electorate, were taking notice of the Harmer review. They were looking at submissions by various organisations and bodies and were interested in having some input in the inquiry. Many retirees came to me saying, ‘We understand that the pension age may need to be increased. What we ask, for those of us who are due to retire in the next five or six years, is that we have a reasonable, sensible and fair lead-in time for that change.' That is what this government is doing with this initiative. That increase will not begin until 2017 and it will be gradual, increasing by six months every two years until it reaches 67 years of age in 2023. When this announcement was made in the budget, there were those on the other side of this House who scoffed at the idea. There were jokes about why we should wait so long; 2023 is years away; why have that long a lead-in? That is what a sensible, responsible government does. The pension age cannot be increased overnight. Yes, those on the other side may say-as the Leader of the Opposition has said-'I recognise that there must be an increase in the pension age to make the pension system sustainable for the long term.' But he has not said when he would introduce it. They were certainly keen to scoff at the concept and at the proposed time line when this budget initiative was introduced. This is a proper time line. It is sonable. It ensures that those who are in the work force right now, who have already planned to retire over the next five or six years, can continue with that plan and will not be disadvantaged as a consequence of this initiative. People who will not retire fore 2017, and particularly by 2023, will have more than adequate time to prepare for the change to the pension age. Of course, as we have said, this does not stop people retiring at an earlier age. This is not retirement age; it is the age at which people will access the pension. It is important to make that distinction and to clarify that point. We have control of our own destiny as to when we retire. If we want to retire early we can, but we have the responsibility to ensure that we have the financial security to do that. If we are going to rely on the pension system, we have to accept that the pension system must be sustainable. That is why 67 years of age is reasonable, sensible and fair. I will deal briefly with the argument we have heard about people who do hard labouring work. I looked after construction for many years in my previous job. I know the strain it has on people's bodies. I accept that, as people get older, physically they struggle to do labouring work. The federal government needs to work with state governments to ensure that we have initiatives in place to retrain people. It is not only when people hit 65 that their bodies are telling them that they cannot continue hard labouring work; in their 40s and early 50s their bodies tell them, ‘You cannot continue doing very physical labouring work.' We need to help those people to retrain and reskill. I know that the state government has a range of initiatives about retraining and reskilling mature age workers. We also need to encourage businesses to say to workers, ‘You have the skills, you have the knowledge. Instead of doing hard labourreaing work, you can be a role model and help apprentices and those who are learning by imparting your knowledge, working with them as a transition to your retirement, so that others can gain from your experience and knowledge.' That would be much better be- than workers pushing their bodies until they can no longer cope. I am keen to work on initiatives with this government and with state governments to help mature age workers reskill so that at 65 years of age they are not wondering how they are going to do two more years of hard labouring work. These are extremely important budget initiatives. I have spoken in this House about the important infrastructure initiatives that are so significant in supporting jobs now and growing our nation into the future. Equally, we must look after those most in need in our community and that is what this bill does. I support it and commend it to the House.",67
33,Mr SULLIVAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Longman) (1.22 pm)It is wonderful for me to stand here and represent my constituency as we debate the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Reform and Other 2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009. If I may, at the beginning I will join the Dutch auction that seems to have been carried out in the chamber today on the number of pensioners that each member represents in their electorate. There are 23,216 age pension, disability support pension and carer payment recipients in the electorate of Longman. Part of the reason for that is that the electorate contains the most beautiful parts of Moreton Bay, Bribie Island and Deception Bay, which is a very popular retirement area. A large number of retirees come to the coast where I am and there is an increasing number of retirement communities as well as aged-care facilities. I was with the Minister for Ageing just last week as we opened a new aged-care facility at Deception Bay, Eden on the Avenue. There is a rich life provided for retirees in our area. There are active senior citizens clubs, the University of the Third Age, bowls clubs and the wonderful retirement activities of boating and fishing, which we offer in great abundance. Not only does our area provide for senior citizens or older Australians but they contribute thoroughly to the kind of community that we have, particularly through volunteering. I was very pleased to recently acknowledge the contribution of a large number of senior Australians from our area through the Longman Volunteer Awards, which were given out during Volunteer Week. I was very pleased that last Friday one of our more active seniors, Ces Conte, who is 82 years old, received a special award from the Minister for Ageing. The reforms that this bill encompassesand there are many; lack of time today means that I cannot cover them all in my speech-include flexibility, fairness and simplicity. Those are key elements of this bill. In fact, I have written down here: ‘This is the most significant reform to the pension system for 100 years.' The reform that took place 100 years ago was, of course, the introduction of the pension system. That is saying quite a bit but I believe it is true: is a series of very significant reforms. The review that was undertaken by Jeff Harmer, the secretary of the minister's department, came forward with a number of key findings. I think it is important that they are enunciated here. The first finding is that the single full-rate pension should be a priority-that the relativity of that rate to the ple pension is too low. The second finding we should highlight is that the payment of existing supplements and allowances should be integrated by including them in a single pension supplement or the base rate. We all know the dangers of putting them in the base rate, given the proclivities of some of our state colleagues. The pension supplement was the way to go. Another finding is that the pension changes should be tied to the actual cost of living faced by pensioners. I can tell you that many of the items that appear on the consumer price index calculations are not items that pensioners buy regularly and are items that decline in price over time. In fact, their cost of living is well above the CPI. The new measure that is being introduced is important. The last finding that I think is really important for us to be well aware of is that pension increases should be targeted to those who have little or no private means. So the less you have for yourself the better it ought to be for you through the pension system. There has been an amount of toing and froing across the chamber during the course of this debate. In fact, we have been accused of taking too long to make these changes and that they are long overdue. I had to sit through a number of speeches that told us that the member for Higgins, Mr Costello, was a man of great vision. Such was his vision that we are now dealing with matters that those opposite believe are well overdue and have taken too long. Importantly, I say this this: I commend the member for Warringah on his contribution with regard to the increase of the age at which pensions will be paid for some years into the future. I thought that he was quite well informed with regard to that. Part of what we have done is split the payments that individual people will get into cou- two. In my own mind I call them part A and part B-joined together you get ‘araldite', which is hopefully stronger income support for people of pension age. The base rate fortnightly pension is to be increased and a pension supplement is the gathering of a number of payments that people get. This will make it not only simpler for Centrelink to administer on our behalf but simpler for people to understand what they are going to receive. It will be indexed twice yearly. The pensioner and beneficiary living cost index is a magnificent new measure. I am sure that, once it is put in place, a great deal of benefit will flow through in indexation measures to pensioners as a consequence. The pension rates have, importantly, established two things. The first is that the single age pension is being set at two-thirds of the pension rate for couples. I know this because all of them are represented in my community. I know that all of the organisations that represent senior Australians and pensioners have been calling for it for some time. The second matter is the increase of the benchmarking against male total average weekly earnings to 27.7 per cent. I would like to talk very briefly about how I believe that the new work bonus system will be of great benefit to those people who take on pensions from 20 September and also to indicate that there has been, through the transitional arrangement provisions, a great deal of concern about the fact that they might have been better off under the old system and were being forced onto a new system. The transitional arrangements have reduced that concern as expressed by people in my electorate. I think that it is important that I say at time that, try as we may as a government and as members of parliament to get out correct information about what is happening here, we are sometimes prevented from doing so by the media. I would like to give a gong to an ABC journalist in Brisbane who used her time on the airwaves to tell all the pensioners in my electorate that we were removing the utilities allowance from them forthwith, which of course meant that my office had to do a great deal of work in relation to that. Mindful of the time and the need that we have to move this bill through this chamber so that it can go to the other place, I will restrict my comments to those above, other than to mention what I thought was probably one of the most telling comments about what is being done here by our government. It is from Ian Yates of the Council on the Ageing. He said: … years of unfair treatment for single age pensioners had been recognised and large steps taken to rectify it. … … … The new pension system is simpler, which is most welcome … I am more than happy to commend this new system to the House.",77
34,Mr GEORGANAS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I too am very pleased to rise to speak today on the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Reform and Other 2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009. I am also very pleased that the minister who brought this piece of legislation to this House is here in the chamber. These are the most significant reforms to the pension since it was introduced 100 years ago. It is a very vital investment in preparing Australia for the future. This bill implements key elements of the government's secure and sustainable pension reform package that was announced at the this 2009-10 budget. The bill prepares Australia to meet the future challenges of an ageing population. As the member for an electorate that has one of the oldest populations in the country, the electorate of Hindmarsh, I welcome these changes. I must say that they have been a long time coming. The Rudd government reforms deliver a stronger and fairer pension system that will serve pensioners and Australia well into the future. Pensioners in my electorate of Hindmarsh can look forward to increases from 20 September 2009. In my electorate, that involves 19,693 age pensioners, 5,540 disability support pensioners and 750 people who receive the carer payment. This bill will sure that single pensioners will receive the increased support that they deserve. Single pensioners in the electorate of Hindmarsh will receive increases of up to $32.49 a as part of these reforms. We all know that pensioners thoroughly deserve this extra support. Even in the hardest of economic times the Rudd government has delivered on crucial reforms for pensioners. These reforms will also improve the pension system by making it simpler and more sustainable into the future as the population ages. The reforms will provide long-term security and certainty and will also ensure that over time the pension system will remain both adequate and sustainable. The bill introduces a new pension supplement to simplify the number of supplementary pension payments currently available. The existing GST supplement, the pharmaceutical allowance, the utilities allowance and the telephone allowance will be incorporated into the one pension supplement. Also, the new pension supplement for singles will increase by $2.49 a week to enable the supplement to match the 66.33 per cent single to couple pension ratio. For counight ples combined it will increase by $10.14 a week. At 20 September 2009 it is estimated that the pension supplement will be worth up to $1,462.70 a year for singles, which is a weekly figure of $28.13. For couples it will be $2,199.60 a year or $42.30 per week. Also, from 20 September 2009 the pension supplement will be paid fortnightly with the pension and from July 2010 pensioners will be able to choose to take the minimum amount of the pension supplement in quarterly instalments. The bill also introduces the new seniors supplement-a payment that replaces the seniors concessional allowance and teleenphone allowance currently available to holders of the Commonwealth seniors health card. The seniors supplement will be available as a quarterly payment and will be paid week at the same rate as the minimum amount of the pension supplement. The seniors supplement for a single person will be 66.33 per cent of the seniors supplement for a couple combined. A new work bonus will be introduced for age and service pensioners. Employment income will be assessed fortnightly for pensioners over age pension age, and 50 per cent of a pensioner's employment income up to a maximum of $500 a fortnight will be disregarded in the income test. This is designed to replace the Pension Bonus Scheme and provide a mechanism for supporting pensioners over age pension age who choose to work to supplement their existing pension. For example, a single pensioner who works part-time with a fortnightly income of around $500 a fortnight will benefit from the work bonus under the new income test arrangements and only half of the income will be assessed under the pension income test. This means that the pension will be $125 per fortbetter off just as a result of the new work bonus, even after taking into account the tightening of pension income test rules. Pension rates will continue to be adjusted in March and September each year in line with cost of living increases. The Australian Bureau of Statistics will develop a new index that will specifically reflect cost of living changes for pensioners and other income support recipients to be known as the pensioner and beneficiary living cost index. The bill will provide for pension rates to be adjusted each March and September by whichever is the greater of the CPI or the PBLCIthe pensioner and beneficiary living cost index. The amendments also ensure that the base pension rate will continue to be benchmarked to community living standards as measured by wages using male total average weekly earnings. A new legislative benchmark will be set at 41.76 per cent of male total average weekly earnings for the combined couple rate of pension. The bill sets the rate for single pensioners at 66.33 per cent of the combined couple rate, which is equivalent to 27.7 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. This new measure will commence on 20 September 2009. Like all of us on this side of the House, I am very proud to be part of a Rudd Labor government that has delivered on a long overdue increase in the pension. As I said earlier, these are the most significant reforms to the pension since it was introduced 100 years ago and are a vital investment in preparing Australia for the future. All 3.3 million age pensioners, disability pensioners, carers, wife pensioners and veteran income support recipients will benefit from the increases in their pension payments. Being a member of an electorate with one of the highest numbers of people aged over 65 years in Australia-over 20 per cent of my constituents in Hindmarsh are aged over 65-I have been advocating long and hard for improvement to the income of pensioners in my electorate. My constituents have been telling me, not just in the last couple of but for years-at street corner meetings, at seniors forums that we hold, at functions and at meetings in my office-that they needed an increase in their pension. They have not been telling me this just in the last 18 months since we have been in government; they were telling me this for the years that I was the member in opposition as well. We know that the former government in 11 long years did nothing to address the inequity for single pensioners. For 11 long years the former government allowed the pension rate to stay low and squandered the opportunity to support pensioners in an entirely different economic climate. Yet this Rudd Labor government in tough economic times has done it. I am proud to be part of that government, as all of us are on this side. The government has taken this tough decision and it has delivered for pensioners.",79
35,Mr WINDSOR,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I would like to take a few minutes if I could-and I promised the minister that it would only take a few minutes-to congratulate the government in taking this fairly momentous step in relation to the increase in pensions. It is something that, as the former speaker said, has been long overdue and something that has been required for many years now. Obviously the pensioners in my electorate are very, very pleased. They recognise that it does not solve all their problems, but I think at least they recognise now that government is taking them seriously in terms of the level of the pension. I would also particularly like to thank a woman called Betty Moore, who is a resident of Inverell. She is a former councillor on the Inverell council. She has led a campaign in that part of the world to increase the pension, and she was instrumental in me organising a number of rallies across the electorate, where she spoke. She was also one of the invitees at years the 2020 Summit, where this issue was raised. I know that she is delighted that the government has actually listened to the voices that have been out there, and there have been many of them-champions at a whole range of levels that have been campaigning for the increase in the pension. I know there has been an amount of politics played in relation to this issue, but I think it is tremendous that we do see that those people-people that in the main were working very hard when the hard yards were on in terms of this nation-are at least being recognised by the government with a relatively small increase in terms of the global economy, but nonetheless a significant increase and in many cases I think an unexpected increase given the activities of the last 10 or 15 years in terms of pension increases. I will conclude at that point and thank the minister on behalf of the pensioners of New England and elsewhere because of the changes that have been made.",81
36,Ms MACKLIN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (1.44 pm)-in replyCould I first of all thank all members for their contributions to the second reading debate on the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Reform and Other 2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009 and for their advocacy on behalf of their constituents, in particular recognising those who have been working hard to bring this to a conclusion. Before I sum up the debate, I would also like to add my congratulations to Dr Jeff Harmer, the secretary of my department, who conducted the major review of the pension system over the last year. That was critical to the shape of the debate we are having now. It was critical to making sure that pensioners were able to come to many of the public meetings around the country. There was a reference group established advising Dr Harmer. On behalf of the government, I extend my sincere thanks to him and to a very dedicated team of officials from the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs-some of whom are here today. They are an outstanding group of people who worked extremely hard on behalf of Australia's pensioners, especially over the last few months as the budget was being put together. They are an extraordinary group of people with a very detailed knowledge of the social security system, and they all have my very sincere thanks. These are the most significant reforms in the 100-year history of the pension system in this country. I do not think we can overestimate just how significant they are. They are reforms that deliver a fair go for pensioners. That is really what it has been all about. They are reforms that, as a government, we are very pleased to be able to deliver. They fundamentally and most importantly improve the adequacy of the base rate of the pension, which was our primary objective. We also are making the operation of the system simpler and much more responsive to pensioner needs. One thing that was hard but absolutely necessary in this pension reform package was securing the long-term sustainability of the pension system. It was necessary because we are an ageing population. We have a lot of challenges in addressing the needs of the ageing population. One is making sure that our pension system is sustainable. The centrepiece is the much-needed increase in the pension payments. From 20 September this year single pensioners will receive an increase of $32.49 a week and pensioner couples will receive $10.14 a week. The pensioner couples increase will be delivered through the new pension supplement. I will say a little bit more about the supplement in a minute. This is delivering to 3.3 million pensioners around the countrythat is, age pensioners, disability pensioners, those on the carer payment, wife and widow B pensioners, those on the bereavement allowance, special needs pensioners and veteran income support recipients. All of these people will benefit from the major reforms being delivered as part of this legislation. One very significant change we are delivering is the significant increase in the proportion of the pension paid for singles as compared to couples. At the moment the ratio is 60 per cent. We are increasing that proportion to 66.33 per cent, recognising that single pensioners-especially those who live alone-have a higher cost of living. This is a very significant reform and one that we hope will help those single pensioners. One other critical change is that we are creasing the benchmark of the pension compared to wage increases. A number of members today have commented on the changes we are making to the indexation arrangements, and I am sure they are going to be welcomed by pensioners. But we are also increasing the proportion that the single age pension will be benchmarked against. At the moment, the single rate of the increase is benchmarked to 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. As a result of these reforms, that will be increased to 27.7 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. That is an increase of 10 per cent. We will not only have pensions benchmarked against wages, to make sure that pensioners can continue to maintain their standard of living relative to other Australians, but also have improvements to the arrangements for the way pensions are indexed against prices. Following these reforms-and I think these numbers are right at the heart of it all-the new total weekly pension plus supplement will be an estimated $336.68 for singles and $507.50 for couples combined. This amounts to $17,507.36 a year for singles and $26,390 for couples combined. We have to wait until 20 September before we get final figures, because on 20 September-as usual-the pension will be indexed and we do not know yet what the final inflation or wages figures will be. We are introducing another very significant change-and a number of members have made contributions on this issue-that is, to simplify the pension. We are improving the adequacy of the pension. That has been central to our considerations. But we have also decided to make major changes to simplify the pension arrangements so that all the additional allowances and supplements that are paid currently will be put together. Their value will be maintained and increased in the innew pension supplement. We are also making sure that this reform flows through to benefit self-funded retirees. There will be a new senior supplement introduced, and that will be available to those who hold a Commonwealth seniors health card. For the first time there will be an index that actually measures the cost of living for pensioners. Many pensioners have raised with me their concern that the consumer price index does not reflect their cost of living adequately. We have listened to this concern and have agreed that the Australian Bureau of Statistics will independently develop a new pensioner and beneficiary cost of living index. That will start as well on 20 September. To make sure that pensioners get the best out of these changes, we will index the pension by whichever is the higher-either the consumer price index or this new pensioner and beneficiary cost of living indexto make sure that the value of the pension keeps up with the cost of living. We are making the arrangements for pensioner advance payments more flexible. That will be very important in helping pensioners who need to buy things that cost more than they can afford out of any particular fortnight's pension payment. We are making some very tough decisions to be able to afford this pension rise. We are better targeting the pension by changing the income test withdrawal rate. To make sure that that does not discourage pensioners who want to work, we are introducing a new work bonus. We are making a few other amendments to support changes being made by the Western Australian government. We are making another very difficult decision-a difficult decision which the former government talked a lot about but never had the guts to do-and that is to raise the age pension age. The age pension was introduced 100 years ago, when life expectancy was very different from that which it is today. It is only Labor governments that have been prepared to take the difficult decisions to make the pension sustainable. The previous Labor government increased the age pension age for women. This Labor government is making sure that long-term sustainability of the pension system is delivered, by increasing the age pension age for men and women to 67. We are phasing this in very slowly so that people have time to plan for their retirement. This will make sure that we are both maintaining an adequate age pension but guaranteeing that it is sustainable as we confront the demographic challenges of the future. The previous government were very good at writing reports about this issue. There were two comprehensive intergenerational reports prepared by Treasury for the former government. Unfortunately, the former government ignored the findings of these intergenerational reports. For 12 years they knew we were confronting the significant ageing of our population but they refused to increase the adequacy of the age pension, let alone do anything about the sustainability of the system. Extraordinarily, the shadow minister for community services, the member for Warringah, said in his contribution to this debate that there should be more public debate about increasing the age pension age but said at the same time that we should do it sooner. I cannot make an ounce of sense out of anything that the member for Warringah said. I would have thought that he would realise that the previous government had conducted two major intergenerational reviews and Dr Harmer conducted a major review of the pension system for this government over the last 12 months. It took around 2,000 written submissions. We had an excellent reference group. There were a number of senior groups on that pension reference group and all of them understood that difficult decisions would have to be made. It has been extraordinary to listen to those on the other side, who did nothing to address either the adequacy or the sustainability of the pension and who now seem to think they can claim some credit for what is being done. That said, we are very pleased to be delivering this much-needed pension reform. I commend this bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading",82
37,Ms MACKLIN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (1.58 pm)-by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. NA",84
38,Mr HOCKEY,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"On indulgence, I will accommodate the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs-and I thank her for agreeing to continue up to two o'clock-and in these 60 seconds recognise a good guy who is in the gallery: Stephen Martin, a former Speaker in this place. I do believe that the former member for Cunningham is a good guy. He was in this place when I came in in 1996. I recall him being on the famous House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration briefly with Mark Latham, Greg Wilton, the now Leader of the House, Ralph Willis and Bob MCMullan, who is still in this place. It is wonderful to see Stephen Martin, a well-respected former member of this place and a wonderful former Speaker. Ironically, he was very balanced and very accommodating of the opposition. He was a balanced and genuine person, not unlike you, Mr Speaker.",84
39,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I thank the member for North Sydney for his cooperation. He gives me the opportunity to say that Speaker Martin was well served by a Deputy Speaker of great talent! I do recognise that former Speaker Martin is in the gallery. On behalf of members, I convey to him a warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Australian Business Investment Partnership Bill 2009",85
40,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. fer to the rejection of Ruddbank by the Senate. I ask the Prime Minister to detail to House the Labor Party's record in commercial property lending and advise honourable members how many thousands of jobs and billions of taxpayers' dollars were lost through the Labor government run state banks in Victoria and South Australia. When Labor turns banker, don't taxpayers always have to pick up the tab?",85
41,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Methinks he doth protest too much. The Leader of the Opposition knows that he is standing there as roadblock to many businesses in Australia having access to finance to support jobs in the construction industry. He knows full well there has been a line-up of people from business and the finance community who have been to see him, saying, ‘Will you please stand out of the road in order to provide decent Australian firms with finance to go out there and continue their projects and build jobs.' He knows he is under the spotlight on this, hence we have this great spray up the front today in order to try and take some pressure off him. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: this stands as one of the more reckless acts in which the Liberal Party has engaged in recent times. If you listen to the tenor of the questions put into the House of Representatives by the Leader of the Opposition over the last week or so, they have been along the lines of the availability of finance and the cost of finance. What does this team opposite then go around and do in the Senate? They block finance and its availability to business. This is a complete contradiction in the position they have sought to put forward in this House. Following this act of economic vandalism by those opposite to wreck projects and to wreck jobs at a time of global recession, could I draw to the attention of the Leader of I rethe Opposition comments this morning from the director of corporate affairs of Westfield, the who said, ‘Like the stimulus packages, this piece of legislation was very important for confidence and jobs.' I notice the Leader of the Opposition is having an objection to Westfield. Mr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order that goes to relevance. I know it is just the Prime Minister's modesty that is stopping him from talking about the Labor Party's record in commercial property lending, but I would encourage him to address the single living the question. Mr Crean-What about HIH?",85
42,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We will be coming on to HIH fairly soon, and the record, because I know the Leader of the Opposition had a particular interest in that matter. But let us just leave that for a time. Let us not rake over the coals just now. For that matter, so did the member for North Sydney, who presided over the implosion of a great Australian financial institution. The member for North Sydney was the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation at the time. What happened? We saw the implosion of a great institution in which apparently a current member of the Liberal Party sitting at a front seatMr Hockey-HIH was a great institution! Do you know what you just said?",86
43,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The great thing about the member for North Sydney is that the more he bellows the less the content is. The member for North Sydney was also interjecting about comments from Westfield. Yesterday or the day before Frank Lowy from Westfield was asked down there at the National Press Club about what actually was contributing to Australia's relatively better economic performance globally. What was his response? Frank Lowy from Westfield has businesses in the United States. He has businesses in the United Kingdom. He said there were three answers: government stimulus, government stimulus and government stimulus. That is what Westfield had to say. I draw that to the attention of the Leader of the Opposition because Westfield and a whole bunch of other companies are out there from the property sector saying to the Liberal Party, ‘Why don't you just get out of the road and do something constructive for the economy rather than always talking the economy down?' Similarly this morning, in answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question, we had the chief executive of the Property Council of Australia-another front for world socialism, apparently-say the following: You know, Australia was ahead of the pack here in recognising there was a potential problem with foreign banks in particular being directed to reinvest in home countries by their new owners' foreign governments, but, now the Japanese and Americans have recognised the same problem, they have put in contingency plans and we have not. So now we are behind the game. It was elegant, it was simple, it was transparent and we have missed an opportunity. Credit is still very difficult to get in Australia and this is totally different from the recession of the nineties. Foreign banks in particular play a crucial role in the way that they did not last time around in the recession. So says the chief executive of the Property Council of Australia. The truth is that the Leader of the Opposition knows this. His colleagues know that. They have had one representative of an industry association after another into them asking why they will not just get out of the road and allow this measure to pass the parliament so that finance can be delivered to real projects by real companies to create real jobs for Australia. Can I say to those opposite on this question as they reflect-and I am sure the member for North Sydney is reflecting on his stupendous achievements as minister for financial regulation back then, and of course on the Leader of the Opposition's achievements when he was the member for Goldman Sachs-is that what this goes to is a very simple question of politics versus economics. We are saying we need to get out there and support businesses to create jobs and to uncloud the lines of finance for businesses to get jobs and projects going. Those opposite have simply engaged on a negative political strategy to block everything in the Senate and to talk the economy down. The contrast is here for all to see: a government in the business of trying to boost the Australian economy up and lift us out this global recession and a leader of the Liberal Party determined to do everything he can to negatively talk the Australian economy down. On this day those in search of Australian jobs and those supporting Australian companies will hang their heads in disbelief that the so called party of business has left them marooned by this action. Economy",86
44,Ms OWENS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline for the House the possible consequences of the Senate's failure to pass the necessary legislation to establish the Australian Busithis ness Investment Partnership?,87
45,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. They think the whole topic of jobs in Australia is funny. They will not support any constructive measures in this House to support employment. They have consistently opposed in this House economic stimulus that is providing support to tens of thousands of Australian families who have breadwinners because this government had the courage to put in place economic stimulus. But what we saw in the Senate last night was perhaps the most brazen example of political opportunism that we have ever seen from the Leader of the Opposition-and we have seen many. We remember his statement that ‘not one job had been created by economic stimulus'. There have been tens of thousands of jobs supported by economic stimulus. We on this side of the House are absolutely determined to do everything that we can, in the face of a global recession, to support domestic employment. The Australian Business Investment Partnership is very important given the global recession. It is a common sense measure. As the Prime Minister was saying before, it is supported strongly by the business community. It is supported strongly by the small business community. They understand that if finance is withdrawn by international financiers then the jobs of tens of thousands of people are on the line. But those opposite simply want to play politics. The Leader of the Opposition would rather see the nation fail than the Rudd government succeed. That is their attitude to this particular proposition. It is the case that the business community strongly supports this measure. It is important that a measure like this should pass because it does have important and dramatic impacts upon confidence. As the CEO of the Property Council said morning, ‘The confidence dividend this would have delivered will now be lost.' It just goes to show how little the opposition understand about the challenge of this global recession and how little they understand about the need to support employment and small business that they could engage in such a reckless act. This is a measure that is required. It is a very important contingency measure. If worse comes to worse and they do not change their minds and projects fail and jobs are lost, it will be on their heads. It will be on their heads if jobs are lost. What we see from this mob is an enormous amount of cheap outrage and feigned indignation when they know we are doing the right thing by the country. There is not a conservative government anywhere else in the world that has not engaged in economic stimulus like we have and that has not put in place a measure similar to this. The only group that stand out in that debate are the Liberal and National parties of Australia, who have no comprehension of the nature of the challenge that we are facing. They are playing the politics of calculation; they are not playing the politics of conviction. They are sitting back and waiting to see people lose their jobs because they think that is to their political advantage. That will most certainly not be supported by the Australian people, who want governments to take action and to put in place decent, common sense initiatives such as ABIP-which is what we have done.",87
46,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Given that the Prime Minister informed the House that his government's borrowings would reach $315 billion, and given that recent state government budgets have revealed that total state government borrowings will reach at least $160 billion over the next three years, will the Treasurer now confirm that total Australian sovereign borrowing will rise to $475 billion or $21,800 for every man, woman and child in Australia?",88
47,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There we go: more opportunistic scare campaigns from those opposite-absolutely opportunistic scare campaigns with little basis in fact. He knows very well that the net debt of state governments is entirely manageable. He knows that-he has seen the figures-but he will come into this House and say and do anything to make a political point and he will distort any figure. This morning the whistle has been blown on the shadow treasurer, the member for North Sydney. This morning in the Sydney Morning Herald I think his approach was summed up appropriately by Ross Gittins. This was his conclusion: If the Opposition persists with such destructive and dishonest arguments it risks the public concluding it's willing to wreck the to govern. That is the conclusion of the scare campaign that is being run by those opposite over a long period of time. Let us go through the argument. This is what Ross Gittins had to say this morning in the Sydney Morning Herald: In seeking to capitalise on the Commonwealth's rate rise, Joe Hockey went beyond the pale … In his anxiety to score a point … Hockey was willing to reinforce the mistaken and damaging notion that interest rates are on the way up. And to convey the impression that this minor rise is just the first of many, Hockey was willing to bambooBudget zle the public with a patently false economic argument. He went on to say this, and the member for North Sydney should listen very closely to it: His argument about the effect of government borrowing on interest rates is simply wrong. He went on to say: If we lived in an economy cut off from the rest of the world, where the only money available to be borrowed was our own savings, then borrowing by governments would indeed put upward pressure on the interest rates you and I pay. He went on to say: But for at least the past 25 years, we've lived in a world of deregulated and globalised financial markets, in which our banks and big companies can and do borrow heavily overseas. In that vast, global market, our Government's borrowings are a flea bite … That is what he said. Then he went on to say: If the Opposition persists with such destructive and dishonest arguments it risks the public concluding it's willing to wreck the economy … Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. If the Treasurer wants to quote extensively from the Sydney Morning Herald, I seek leave to table the Economist.",88
48,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is not a point of order. The member for North Sydney will economy it seeks resume his seat. Employment,88
49,Ms GRIERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law. Will the minister outline to the House what plans have been pursued to support jobs in Australia as the global economic recession continues to impact upon the nation? What threats still exist to the provision of finance for major projects?",88
50,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Newcastle for her question. She convened a very good series of meetings with Newcastle business on my recent visit and she is a strong supporter of the need to protect and support Australian jobs. The global economic recession is continuing to impact on Australia and on jobs. While the worse of times may not be over by a long shot, the evidence clearly shows that the government's stimulus packages have been working. Without the stimulus packages, the economy would have contracted in the recent quarter rather than grown. We have seen a big boost in business and consumer confidence. Consumer confidence recorded its largest increase in 22 years in June and is at its highest level since January 2008. But last week's employment figures make it clear that, while we are in much better shape than the rest of the world, we still face a significant jobs challenge ahead-not least in the commercial property sector. We have seen continued volatility in that sector through commercial finance figures falling sharply in April after a sharp rise in March. This is a sector in which confidence and stability are paramount. As the Prime Minister and the Treasurer and other economic ministers and I talk to businesspeople around the country, we constantly hear them telling us that one of the biggest challenges facing them is the potential flight of foreign capital as banks return to their home markets. Is it any wonder, then, that the Australian business community is frustrated and angry at the naked opportunism of the Leader of the Opposition? The business community knows how important access to finance is in supporting jobs. But the supposed party of business is refusing to listen to business. Last night in the Senate, the coalition showed that it was willing to roll the dice and gamble with the jobs of 150,000 Australians involved in the commercial property sector. Australian business knows how important the Australian Business Investment Partnership is. Both the Master Builders Association and the Property Council have been calling for bipartisan support for ABIP. Remember bipartisanship? We used to hear a lot about it from the Leader of the Opposition. I would have thought that a good way to show bipartisanship would be to support an initiative supported by so much of Australian business. The Urban Taskforce perhaps best summarised the importance of the partnership for the Australian economy. They said: The economy will pay a heavy price if this legislation is blocked. Without this legislation we may see a further reduction in confidence, a deeper economic downturn and postponed economic recovery. We may see a deeper economic downturn and postponed recovery because of the recklessness and opportunism of the member for Wentworth. You might have thought that confidence and stability in the commercial property sector and all the jobs that go with it would be important to the Leader of the Opposition. But unfortunately it appears that it is not. We all see the Leader of the Opposition's relief and joy on Monday at the announcement from the member for Higgins that he was retiring from politics, an announcement which protected the Leader of the Opposition's job for a little while longer. But he is prepared to roll the dice for thousands of jobs of the Australian people. We saw joy from the Leader of the Opposition on Monday, while he votes down an initiative to support Australian jobs. And we have seen more of this. I saw the member for Mayo on Sky Agenda this morning, debating the Parliamentary Secretary for Employment. He said, ‘We're very pleased to have been able to stop it.' There is something unseemly about a member of parliament gloating that they have stopped an initiative to support Australian jobs. The other side rejoice in Australian jobs being put at risk. They would much rather protect their own jobs than the jobs of ordinary Australians. When John Howard was Prime Minister of Australia, he painted himself as the champion of battlers; of tradies; of tradespersons; of plumbers; of electricians; of carpenters. The Leader of the Opposition has thrown that mantle away. These are the very people whose jobs he is recklessly attacking-all in the name of political opportunism. Across Australia at boardroom tables there are businesspeople shaking their heads at the recklessness of the Leader of the Opposition. Across Australia at kitchen tables there are workers shaking their heads at the opportunism of the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition has become just as out of touch with the boardroom table as he has always been with the kitchen table. NA",89

55,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do thank the member for Longman for his question. The House might not be aware that the member for Longman, in the early 1990s, was instrumental in setting up the Business Enterprise Centre at Caboolture. I thank him on behalf of the small businesses on the Sunshine Coast of Australia for his ongoing interest-the ongoing interest of everyone on this side of the parliament in the future of small business in this country. I note yet again that my opponent, the shadow minister for small business, will not ask me a question about small business. Yet again the opposition leader has put his own base political interests ahead of the interests of the small businesses of Australia. We know that the Australian Business Investment Partnership is designed to support commercial property construction and development during the global financial crisis. We also know-and the opposition leader knows-that the commercial property sector employs around 150,000 people, including plumbers, electricians and carpenters. The advice of Treasury is that, without action, a combination of weak demand and tight credit conditions could result in up to 50,000 people losing their jobs in this sector. These ordinary people, these are small business people, these are tradies, these are independent contractors. The Liberal Party claim small business operators as their own core constituency, but last night the Liberal Party betrayed the small business people of Australia. Last night the Liberal Party and its cohorts in the National Party betrayed the tradies and independent contractors-our electricians, our plumbers and our carpenters. That is what the opposition did, and they are boasting about it today at the doors. They are proud of their achievement in betraying the small business community of this country. The opposition leader talks about jobs, jobs, jobs, but his actions and those of his party last night have taken jobs away. He has risked the jobs of up to 50,000 Australians. The opposition leader is saying to the tradies, to our plumbers, electricians and carpenters: ‘Pack up your tools in your old kit bag; it's goodbye, bye, bye.' You regard the small businesses of Australia as your core constituency. Well, why on earth would you betray them? Why would you betray them? And we know the answer to that question: because by your actions, by the opposition leader's actions",90

78,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the communications protocol for the $4.9 billion purchasing of employment services. The communications protocol specifically states: All persons, and in particular those who have been identified as being in positions of potential influence, are required to refer or direct any purchasing related enquiries or questions to the mentioned hotline, website or email address. Can the Prime Minister confirm that these probity guidelines were adhered to in the government's $4.9 billion purchasing of employment services?",92
79,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Those guidelines exist. My assumption is that they have been properly adhered to. Should there be anything contrary to that, I am sure that we will inform the House. Employment: Logging",92
80,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"2.30 pm)My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Will the minister outline to the House the policies taken by the government in relation to supporting Australian jobs by combating illegal and unsustainable logging. Can he provide examples of dangerous and reckless logging practices?",92
81,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Wills for the question. Illegal and unsustainable logging is often presented as being purely an environmental problem. It is of course also a very real threat to Australian jobs. You only have to visit a timber mill in the nation to see that people are perilously aware of the threat that can be posed by imports of illegal and unsustainable logging. To that end, the government is continuing to negotiate internationally to have methods of verification of and certification for timber in order to be able to ultimately prevent illegally logged timber from entering Australia. You need not only to be able to verify and certify what has been logged legally, which is the reason we have our agreements with both Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, but also to be able to have a level of cooperation where the processing itself occurs, which is why we have been having further discussions on that with China. The question from the member for Wills afore also invites me to provide examples of where some appalling logging practices have taken place. I am reminded of the example of Axiom Forest Resources, a company that engaged in logging in the Solomon Islands in the 1990s, at the same time that the Leader of the Opposition was both its chairman and a shareholder. I read with interest an article earlier this year in the Sunday Telegraph. The title of the article is: ‘Malcolm Turnbull linked to mass logging operation in Solomon Islands'. It went on to report about the island of Vangunu, home to just over 2,000 people in the Solomons. The Leader of the Opposition's company certainly left its mark on the island; it was never the same. A report provided by AusAID said: … more like a clear-felling operation and bearing little relation to an attempt at even retaining a token sample of future commercial crop on the site. Further: The degree of canopy removal and soil disturbance was the most extensive seen by the authors in any logging operation in tropical rainforest any country … The impact from the destruction of the resource was such that, instead of it being done in a sustainable way, the resource was essentially shot to pieces and that then had an ongoing impact on the soil. When rain went through, the water would take in the order of 24 hours to a week to clear and, in the rainy season, the plumes became a semipermanent feature. It was also revealed in March 2007 that the chairman of that company bought in at $200,000 and sold out one year later for $25 million. That is not a bad story for the Leader of the Opposition but a pretty shocking story for the residents of that island in the Solomon Islands. In a 1997 report into logging practices in the Solomon Islands, it was also revealed that complex corporate arrangements where consistently entered into to avoid tax. This is something that would be known fairly well by someone who has been willing to be an opportunist in this way-an opportunist who was also willing, as the minister for the environment, to describe rainforests as ‘the lungs of the world' some years after he had decided to be part of an operation that was clear-felling the lungs of the world. ",92
82,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have the Manager of Opposition Business wanting to talk about ‘Where is there a smear? Where is it grubby?' I tell you that it certainly was for the people living in the Solomons; it certainly was for them. They certainly had a resource shot to pieces. They certainly had to deal with something. What was the role, as the chairman of the company, that the Leader of the Opposition when this came to light described himself as having: My only involvement with the company was as a corporate doctor. in Well, a doctor that may well have made the company pretty healthy but left the Solomons feeling pretty sick. The people of this former island paradise do not thank the Leader of the Opposition, the doctor, for his prescription. They live with it every day. They live with the cash grab. They live with the resource destruction of a first-grade political opportunist-someone who might be willing to cover Australian farmland with trees while he is clear-felling the islands of the Pacific. Employment Services",93
83,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that the day after contracts were awarded in the $4.9 billion employment services contract there was an email exchange discussing the details of the tendering process between the Chief of Staff of the former Minister for Employment Participation and the Chief Executive Officer of Mission Australia in which the Chief Executive Officer of Mission Australia wrote: ‘Thanks for the time you and the minister have made available to us over the last few days.' Is the Prime Minister still satisfied that all probity guidelines were strictly adhered to in this $4.9 billion process? Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, is that a serious question under the standing orders?",93
84,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is not a point of order. The question was in order. The Prime Minister has the call.,94
85,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The first part of the answer to the honourable member's question is: no, I am not aware of that exchange. Secondly, as I listened carefully to the honourable member's question it referred to contact between Mission Australia and the minister's office. I omy. would have thought that such contact was a normal matter of discourse between a minister's office and an organisation like Mission Australia. As I said, I am unaware of the actual transaction which the honourable member refers to, but can I just say more broadly about the government's engagement with Mission Australia that we are dealing with Mission Australia all the time on questions of local jobs initiatives and on providing services to the homeless. I would regard this as being a normal exchange. I wait for further information on which I could base a further reply. Economy",94
86,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, my question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. How is the global recession affecting the Australian economy? Why is it important to recognise the threat that the global recession poses to Australian jobs?",94
87,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,94
88,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Several comments on my left I am ignoring but I will not ignore them all the time. The sort of remarks that were made are not helpful for the proper conduct of the chamber.,94
89,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the member for Dobell for his question. The global recession is a very serious threat to the Australian economy and to jobs in Australia. Around the world, economic activity, trade, jobs, credit provision and government finances have been plummeting as a result of the global recession and that is inevitably impacting directly on the Australian economy through lower mineral prices, changes in the terms of trade, less investment and lower confidence in the Australian economy, and therefore it constitutes an enormous threat to jobs in the Australian econThat is why the government has responded through bank guarantees, through stimulus packages and through longer-term investment in infrastructure-all directed towards sustaining activity and jobs in the Australian economy. I have to confess that none of that is really much news to most Australians because people have been seeing it night after night on their TV screens. Most people are well aware of the fact that the global recession constitutes an enormous threat to jobs in the Australian economy. It is not a secret for most Australians but it does appear that it is something of a secret to at least one group of Australians-namely, the Liberal Party and the National Party opposition, because they do not appear to be fully aware of the threat that the global recession is posing to the Australian economy. Like many other members of the House, I do not get a huge amount of leisure time up in Canberra. It is one of those circumstances where you do not get much chance to relax, but every now and then I manage to chill out a bit and have a cup of coffee or something like that. I admit it: I do that every now and then. Yesterday was one of those occasions when I managed to get an opportunity to relax for a bit, and I stumbled across a Liberal Party leaflet and had a bit of a read of it. I admit that some people could suggest that this behaviour is a little odd-that for entertainment and leisure I am reading Liberal Party leaflets-but I plead guilty. They are pretty exciting! They are pretty interesting things! It is a very interesting leaflet. It is headed Recovery for Australia. It has a nice picture of the Leader of the Opposition on it and it has a little survey that asks you questions like what you think are the most important things in the budget, including paying back ‘borrowed debt'. Borrowed debt! They make sure that you get the message about what kind of debt it is. There is an interesting thing about this leaflet and that is that all the way through there is not a single mention of the global recession. There is not one mention of the global recession, not one mention of the global financial crisis battering the Australian economy, not one mention of the collapse in government revenue that has flowed from the global recession, not one mention of the change in the terms of trade and not one mention to people of the massive threat to jobs that is constituted by the global recession. Sometimes some Australians claim that politicians are out of touch. This Liberal leaflet is exhibit A in the case for the prosecution of politicians for being out of touch, because those in the Liberal Party are just like their forebears in the 1930s-those characters with the bowler hats, the waist coasts and the canes and all that sort of stuff. You can just see the Leader of the Opposition being exactly the same-totally uncaring, totally unconcerned about jobs and in complete denial about the threat of the global recession-and in that case the threat of global depression to jobs. He is in complete denial, just like many of his colleagues are in complete denial about climate change. There are places you can go to get help for this problem of denial and I would recommend to the Leader of the Opposition that he might try that. You sit around in a circle and then you pop up and say, ‘I'm Malcolm and I'm an investment banker.' And then everybody gets together and has a chat about it all. The problem for the Australian community is that the Liberal Party today is exactly the same as the outfit in the 1930scompletely unconcerned about jobs, completely unconcerned about the impact on the small businesses of Australia of the collapse of economic activity around the world and its impact on the Australian economy. Well, the government does care about jobs in this country. The government does care about economic activity and livelihoods of businesses in this country. And that is why, like so many other governments around the world, we are acting decisively to stimulate economic activity in order to sustain jobs and sustain business activity in the Australian economy. Employment Services",94
90,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, my question is again to the Prime Minister. Given that the probity requirements in the communications protocol for the $4.9 billion tender, which involved 3,000 bids from over 400 organisations, specifically prohibits any discussions relating to the purchasing process, will the Prime Minister now advise the House what communications relating to the purchasing process took place between the former Minister for Employment Participation, his chief of staff, Mission Australia and any other tenderers during the probity period?",95
91,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the honourable member to the answer to his earlier question. I would draw his specific attention to the points that I raised there, and if he has any further information to raise with the House then of course we will look at it. Can I just say to the honourable member: the government has a strong relationship with the community sector and with community sector organisations like Mission Australia, who do a first-class job. Secondly of order in terms of relevance. The Prime Minister was asked a very specific question about whether he would advise the House of any potential breaches of the probity process involving the employment services contracts. We want to know whether he will come back and advise the House after the investigations he makes after question time today.",95
92,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. The Prime Minister is responding to the question.,96
93,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Again I refer the honourable member's attention to the answers I gave to the two earlier questions. On the question of Mission Australia, can I say the government has a good relationship with Mission Australia. They do an excellent job in the community on jobs and on homelessness. We work with them all the time. I always find it ing strange when those opposite stand up at the dispatch box and make statements like this without any point of reflection on their own engagement in something to do with the dispensing of projects to various National Party electorates in previous times, which is the subject of two Auditor-General's reports. I would suggest they reflect on that further. Dr Southcott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order",96

96,Ms PARKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. How will regional communities in Australia benefit from the Mr Randall interjecting,96
97,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Fremantle will resume her seat. I do not need running commentary from the member for Canning about who is not in their seat. That is now the member for Fremantle's seat. Mr Randall interjecting,96
98,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Canning.,96
99,Ms PARKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. How will regional communities in Australia benefit from the government's renewable energy target? Mr Truss interjecting,96
100,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. I notice the interjection from the Leader of the National Party that renewable energy equals people losing passtheir jobs. That is exactly what he interjected, and I would have it placed on the parliamentary record. Can I just say to the honourable member that, if that is his attitude to the future of solar, if that is his attitude to the future of wind, if that is his attitude to the future of tidal and wave and if that is his attitude to the future of the rest of the renewable energy sector, then it says everything about why in this House for the last three weeks we have not got a single question on climate change-not a single question on renewable energy, not a single question on the CPRS. Do we know why that is the case? Because those opposite are terminally divided on this question. As I said yesterday in the House, on the CPRS report which came out of the Senate on the future of climate change, we had the Liberals dividing against the Liberals. Then, of course, on the renewable energy target, we had the Nationals dividing against the Liberals. Then, of course, some of the Nationals divided against other Nationals and some of the Nationals divided against some of the Liberals. Can I just say to those opposite that matters before the Senate now equal the future of Australian industry and the future of Australian jobs. The honourable member mounted a campaign against his predecessor on the fact that he was going to be greener and cleaner than the member for BradfieldI think that was the case: greener and Brendan nods that that was the case: that was the campaign launched against the member for Bradfield. I have always said about the member for Bradfield: he always stood for what he believed in, as opposed to certain other members who have replaced him. Notwithstanding having rolled the member for Bradfield as the Leader of the Opposition on a clean, green approach to climate change, one which has singularly unified all members sitting opposite, we have of course the Climate Institute providing us with advice in their 2009 study about the employment impacts from wind, solar and bioenergy. That analysis shows that the implementation of clean energy projects across Australia would result in some 26,000 new jobs. Furthermore, what it says is that 2½ thousand new ongoing positions would occur in power stations and there would be 15,000 construction jobs and 8,600 indirect jobs in supporting sectors. But this is where it gets interesting in terms of where the jobs are concentrated. The report advises us that it will be focused in regional centres such as Wollongong-I am sure the member for Cunningham would be pleased about that. Yass-I am not sure whether the member for Hume would welcome additional jobs in Yass. Alby? Wagga Wagga-where does the member for Riverina stand in terms of new jobs in Wagga Wagga? I would suggest she reads this report as well. Cooma and Bega-I know for a fact that the member for Eden-Monaro would be supporting extra jobs in his electorate. these Scottsdale in Tasmania-I think the member for Bass supports jobs in her area. Portland in Victoria-I am sure the member will be supporting jobs there. Port Augusta in South Australia-what about the member for Grey? Where does the member for Grey stand on extra jobs in their area? And Albany in the cleaner. west, where the good old member for O'Connor comes from-the good old member for O'Connor, who is now up and running as the next candidate for the leadership of the opposition, out there, I am sure, supporting renewable energy jobs in his electorate. If we are going to act on climate change, a couple of things are necessary. We need to get a CPRS through the Senate. The Liberal Party and National parties are so divided they do not know what to do about it. We need to get renewable energy targets through the Senate-the Liberal Party and National parties are so divided they do not know what to do about it. Mr Hunt interjecting",96
101,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,But can I just say to the ever-interjecting member forA government member-Flinders.,97
102,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Flinders-thank you. I was going to say something else, but I will notthat the future of rebates for people wanting to buy solar panels in the future depends on the passage of the renewable energy target legislation",97
103,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You're talking about solar after last week's performance? You are a champion!,97
104,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Flinders again objects very loudly, as he is often given to do. The member for Flinders, a bit like the member for Curtin, has had ample opportunity to ask questions on a particular matter but they never seem to come. We have been having a debate about solar panels for how many days now? Quite a while. We have been having a debate about the CPRS for a few weeks and nothing seems to be coming. Why is it, member for Flinders, that the 26-member strong opposition tactics committee has not given you a single question yet on solar rebates? Not one! Why has the member for Flinders been neutered on this question? We may ask: why has he been neutered on this question? There is a reason: because they are terminally divided on what to do on the RET. This is where the rubber really hits the road. The future of working families' ability to get renewable tificates, to get a discount on future solar panels, depends on whether the Liberals and Nationals will block legislation in the Senate on the renewable energy target. It is as simple as that. That is the bottom line. Therefore, they are being consistent with what they have done in the past-blocked the CPRS; blocked the Australian Business Investment Partnership; threatened to block the renewable energy target, as the Nationals indicated yesterday-in this permanent cycle of negativity. But put politics to one side-jobs are at stake here. The ability of working families to get a discount for their solar panels is at stake here as well. So I say to the Leader of the Opposition, who is now freed of the spectre of the member for Higgins behind him taking over the leadership of the Liberal Party: it is time for the Leader of the Opposihave tion to stand up and be counted. Pass the CPRS legislation. Pass the renewable energy target legislation. And, on the way through, give the member for Flinders a question so he can ask one in the House. Building the Education Revolution Program  the Minister for Education. I refer the minister to the Grays Point Public School, in the electorate of Cook, which has been instructed to spend its $2½ million grant under the schools stimulus debacle on a school hall of a style that cost $900,000 a year ago. Why won't the minister do the right thing and refer the waste and mismanagement of this program to the Auditor-General?",97
105,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course I will look at the matter raised by the member for Sturt, but I will make the caveat that, in terms of questions raised by him and members opposite in this House, we are yet to see any of the facts being right. The facts are never as they are represented by them in this parliaenergy cer- ment. So I will check that. But what I will say to the member for Sturt, and what he may not realise-he obviously does not know much about this program, because of the continued misrepresentations he makes in relation to it-is that the expenditure on this program is calibrated so buildings are constructed and there is the fitout of them so that they are fit-for-purpose. I actually explained this to the member yesterday, during the MPI. He was wandering around a bit, so he may have missed this part of the explanation: when you are comparing quotes, it is very important that you are comparing them for the same purpose. ",98
106,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Sturt has asked his question.,98
107,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Many of the quotes that been used in the public debate around this have been the sort of per-metre construction quotes you get if you are putting up the building but not fitting it out. As I remarked during the MPI yesterday, and as anybody would know who has been a builder of a new home, or perhaps has done a renovation of their own home, there is a difference between the costs of the lock-up stage and it being completely fitted out. For example, if you were constructing a kitchen to lock-up stage, you would get a particular quote per metre. If you were doing all of the fit-out the sinks and the electrics that would go with it of order. The minister was asked why she would not refer this matter to the Auditor General. She has not yet cleared up why she will not refer this program to the Auditor General. Why won't she just do the right thing and have the Auditor-General look at it?",98
108,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Sturt will resume his seat. The Deputy Prime Minister is responding to the question.,99
109,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was asked about building costs at a specific school, and I am explaining the way the Building the Education Revolution program works, for the member to try and understand so he can stop the cycle of coming into this parliament and misrepresenting this program for base political advantage-while he refuses, of course, to generate anything that looks like an education policy for the opposition. So the simple point to the member for Sturt is: I will look at what he has raised, but the Building the Education Revolution program includes the cost of the building being fit-for-purpose, so it will include the cost of things like interactive whiteboards, seating, sound systems in halls and the like. Consequently, when you look at those, they are built into the project we will see whether or not the shadow minister is really making an appropriate comparison with those figures. But what I can also say to the member for Sturt, given he has asked me about Building the Education Revolution program-and this will be a matter that interests him a great deal I think-is that I have had a look today at the words in the East Torrens Messenger, a local newspaper in the member for Sturt's electorate. ",99
110,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He is yelling out, ‘A very good newspaper'. Well, I am glad he is of that view, because the East Torrens Messenger today records the words of Cathie Wilson, the principal of the Stradbroke school",99
111,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The shadow minister is agreeing with me that she is a very good principal, so I hope that he is going to agree mine!",99
112,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"A very good supporter of the shadow minister, and a woman whose counsel he should take, said the following with respect to the money coming to her school: This is the first time we've had a new building at the school in 30 years. The kids are thrilled. They've been asking for a larger gym for a long time, because we can't fit the whole school into our current one. That is a quote from a woman the shadow minister says he respects, who is a very good principal, who is a supporter of his-and what does that very good principal and woman he respects say? She says the Building the Education Revolution program is making such a difference for her school that costs and the kids are ‘thrilled'. But that is not the end of the words of wisdom in the East Torrens Messenger today, because the East Torrens Messenger today also contains an article headed ‘Funding gets a gold star'. It is referring to the Building the Education Revolution programs at Burnside Primary School. The principal of Burnside Primary School, Frank Mittiga, says, ‘This is something that will go a long way to supporting children in reception to year 5.' I say to the member for Sturt, if he would just stop giggling and squealing for one moment and think what his role is in this parliament, his role in this parliament is to come to it and represent the views of the community in Sturt. Through his own local newspaper today, the community in Sturt is speaking loudly to him about their support for Building the Education Revolution. The only thing I hope is that on his return to his electorate the member for Sturt has got the guts to go to the Stradbroke School and to the Burnside Primary School and look both principals in the eye",99
113,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, he can go back to it and have the guts to look the principal in the eye and say: ‘If I had my way you would not get one cent. If I had my way not one child in this school would benefit from Building the Education Revolution.' I suggest to the member that if he has got the guts to do that, between giggling and squealing, he should then come back to this parliament and report on exactly how those conversations went. Emissions Trading Scheme",100
114,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science and Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change. Would the minister outline any barriers that exist to Australia reducing its carbon emissions?",100
115,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Banks for the question. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is the most significant environmental reform that has been attempted in this country. It is the means by which we as a nation can reduce our carbon pollution and achieve the targets that the government has set out by 2020. It is such a significant environmental and economic reform that many, particularly in the business community, have called for a bipartisan approach to this issue to deliver a greater investment certainty environment for business. And yet what the government has encountered is nothing but obstruction by the opposition. The fact is that the biggest barrier at this point in time to the passage of this important environmental reform is the coalition. Importantly, we know that the Leader of the Opposition, on behalf of the coalition, has made a number of important statements. It appears from that commentary that it is accepted by the coalition that action on climate change is necessary. From the comments made it also appears that the coalition supports the government's targets for reducing emissions. And there has been a recognition by the Leader of the Opposition that there will be an emissions trading scheme in Australia at some point in time. These are important comments that have been made by the Leader of the Opposition on behalf of the coalition. It is therefore a legitimate question to ask: why has there been nothing but opposition and nothing constructive put forward by the coalition? All that we have seen are excuses for the delay. The underlying reason for this position, it is clear, is the division in the opposition ranks over this important issue and that, as we approach the debate in the Senate over the CPRS, is what is holding up such a fundamental environmental reform. We know that the coalition is peppered with climate change sceptics and others who are simply opposed to any action on this issue. Senator Bernardi, a member of the coalition, is on the record as saying that humans are not even responsible for climate change. Senator Abetz apparently believes that weeds are a greater threat than climate change. The National Party, as stated repeatedly by Senator Joyce, is flatly opposed to emissions trading. Further evidence of the division amongst the opposition is contained in the report released this week of the Senate Select Committee on Climate Policy, which is chaired by the coalition. Paragraph 2.36 of that report states: The balance of the evidence discussed above suggests that climate change is occurring, is driven by anthropogenic factors and is a grave threat to accustomed ways of life and natural systems. If this view is right, the calculations above make a virtually unarguable case for taking global action. But Senator Cash of the coalition issued a minority report choosing to differ. It stated the following: I do not believe that this properly reflects the balance of evidence in terms of the science of climate change. This is just further evidence of the division in the coalition over this important issue that is frustrating the passage of such a significant environmental reform. The fact is that with the CPRS due to be debated shortly in the Senate it is time for the coalition to take responsibility and to act in the interests of the Australian people in dealing with climate change. The coalition needs to support action on climate change. It is time to put aside the excuses for delay. It is time to listen to the business community, which wants investment certainty and which is arguing for the passage of this legislation. It is time to put positive suggestions forward and not excuses. It is time for the coalition to support the CPRS. It is time for the coalition to support the government's renewable energy legislation and to do what the Leader of the Opposition knows is right for this country: to take action on climate change and pass this important legislation as soon as possible. Building the Education Revolution Program",100
116,Mr BILSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education. I refer the minister to Langwarrin Primary School, in my electorate of Dunkley, which is being required by state government officials to accept the demolition of an existing building to be replaced by a new building of the same sort as opposed to the plans put forward by the school community to reuse and refurbish the existing building in a more sustainable way and to construct new facilities at a lesser cost. Given that state government education officials falsely claim that the school community is ‘eagerly looking forward to' the demolition and building works when this is clearly at odds with the school's public statements, will the minister intervene to help overcome this mismanagement and assist the local community in getting what they are looking for out of the funding available?",101
117,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question, which is a more responsible one than we are used to from the opposition. What I can say to the member is that, of course, if there is a concern by a school in his local community that he wants addressed then I am very happy to assist him with that. We have assisted many members of the opposition, in fact, who have come and raised individual issues, and I am happy to do that. Of course, we will work through the issues with him that are raised and assess the views of the school community. What we have always been very clear about with the Building the Education Revolution process and guidelines is that consultation does need to occur with school communities so that school communities can work their way through whether their preference is for a multipurpose hall or a library or whether their preference is for classroom refurbishments, and obviously they then work through project questions and issues. I am very happy to work with him on the Langwarrin Primary School. I understand that the primary school has been approved for $200,000 of National School Pride funding, and I do not understand the member to be raising any issues in relation to that. is going for an undercover learning area, which I am sure the school is very excited about getting. The school has been approved for $3 million of funding under the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program for the construction of a new library. If there is an issue about that new library that the member would like to pursue with me, I am very happy to help. Rail Infrastructure",101
118,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. Minister, how is the government investing to support jobs today to build the public transport infrastructure that Australia needs for tomorrow?",102
119,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly thank my colleague, who is a fine representative of the Geelong region, for that question. He along, with the member for Lalor, the member for Bendigo, the member for Ballarat, the member for Gellibrand and others, particularly in western Melbourne, have welcomed the government's commitment to public transport investment. Today, along with the Victorian Minister for Public Transport, I have announced that up to six new stations will be built as part the $4.3 billion Regional Rail Express. In addition to the construction of stations at Manor Lakes in Wyndham Vale and Rose Grange in Tarneit, land has also been put aside for station development at Dohertys Road in Truganina, Davis Road in Tarneit, Sewells Road in Tarneit and Black Forest Road in West Werribee. The full construction is scheduled to start next year-construction which will support literally thousands of jobs. Through our nation building for recovery plan we are investing today in the infrastructure that we need for tomorrow. This is all part of our sweeping investment in rail. That We are investing more in the next 12 months than the previous government did in 12 long years. This has been well received by people in the infrastructure sector. Brendan Lyon, Executive Director of the peak organisation Infrastructure Partnerships Australia, has said this: Urban rail has been neglected for too long. … … … This Budget marks the first time that a Commonwealth Government has recognised the importance of public transport to the mobility, liveability and productivity of Australia's cities. Don Henry from the ACF has said: … $4.6 billion for urban public transport will be good for the planet, good for cities and good for jobs. The Rudd government understands that a competitive, safe and reliable rail network is critical to lifting national productivity, critical to curbing the escalating cost of traffic congestion, and an important component of our whole-of-government approach to tackling climate change. National Education Standards",102
120,Mr OAKESHOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister in her capacity as the Minister for Educaof tion. Minister, in reference to the National Curriculum Board document titled Shape of the Australian curriculum-history, dated May 2009, can you clarify the discrepancy between page 8, which indicates primary students will learn about the world wars and, page 11, which indicates that secondary students will jump from World War I history to post-World War II immigration. Minister, if true, would you agree that this omission of World War II history at the secondary level leaves a significant hole in the story of Australia for students? If true, and if she shares concerns on this, will she undertake to review this decision and look to include World War II history at the secondary level as part of the national curriculum agenda?",102
121,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. The one thing I can say to him-and I want to assure every member of the House of this, and I think it is an important point-is: I am certainly not writing the curriculum and it is not my intention at any stage to intervene in the process of the development of the national curriculum. I know that the approach of the former government was to play these issues out for grand public debate in the hope that they could get some political advantage in relation to them. But the important thing out of all of the curriculum wars and history wars engaged in by the Howard government, after acres and acres of newsprint, is that they never managed to get a national curriculum in this country. We are substituting that track record of failure with a successful process to deliver a national curriculum. I am very happy to say to the member that if he would like to talk to the head of the National Curriculum Board, Barry MCGaw, we can facilitate that. I can also say to the member-and he has probably seen this through the history framing papers, through the consultations that have gone on in history; the same sorts of consultations that happened in English and other things-that Barry MCGaw has been very consultative and very clear that teaching the history of Australia will be a narrative of the principal events, obviously including World War II and all of the significant conflicts and engagements of this country. He has been interviewed extensively and that sort of framework for the curriculum is clear. The framing papers and discussions to date have received a lot of positive feedback. We want Australian students to get a feel for every part of the history of this nation andobviously, as students progress through school-to get a deeper and deeper understanding of events. I am very happy for the member to talk to Barry MCGaw. I am very happy to forward him all of the documents that have been made available publicly. I think he will find in those documents that it is very clear that all significant events, including World War II, will be covered in the history curriculum. People Trafficking",103
122,Ms GEORGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Housing and Minister for the Status of Women. Will the minister update the House on the government's progress in supporting victims of people trafficking?,103
123,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I want to thank the member for Throsby. I know she has had a very long history of interest, involvement and activism in this area. There is no-one in this House, I am sure, who underestimates the seriousness of the crime we are talking about today or dismisses the criminality of the people involved, whether that trafficking is for the purposes of sexual servitude or labour exploitation. Today the government announced changes to the support provided to victims of trafficking that will provide greater support to more victims of trafficking and support efforts to prosecute those who have trafficked these people. This issue crosses portfolios, and I want to acknowledge and thank my colleagues the Minister for Home Affairs, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the parliamentary secretary. I want to pay particular tribute to the previous Minister for Home Affairs for his efforts in setting up the round-table on people trafficking, which has resulted in so much good work and so many good outcomes over the last year in this area. Today's efforts will simplify the visa framework as it applies to people who have been trafficked. It will provide greater support to more victims of trafficking and support efforts to prosecute perpetrators of the crime. All victims will now be able to access support, irrespective of their current visa status. The immediate period of support will be extended from 30 days to 45 days and provided to all victims of people trafficking. We will also provide 90 days of support for victims who are willing to assist police but may be too traumatised to do so. There are a number of other changes as well. I recently appointed the Red Cross to manage the support program for victims of people trafficking, and I was very pleased with that appointment. The Red Cross have international and Australian experience in supporting very traumatised people, including refugees and asylum seekers, and are a very appropriate organisation to provide this support to very vulnerable and distressed people. Today's announcement has been widely welcomed and supported by individuals and organisations that have campaigned in this area. Professor Jennifer Burn, the Director of the University of Technology's Anti-Slavery Project, said: This amendment is in accordance with international best practice. These amendments will make an enormous difference to our clients. Nina Vallins, the Coordinator of Project Respect, said: Project Respect welcomes the changes announced by the government today, which will significantly advance the rights and protection of victims of trafficking in Australia. These Australia a world leader in this area. Sister Stancea Vichie, the Chair of Australian Catholic Religious Against Trafficking in Humans, said: The announcements made by the government today will enhance the protection and support for all people who have been trafficked into Australia. The President of the Australian Human Rights Commission, Catherine Branson, and the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Liz Broderick, praised the changes as humanitarian and compassionate improvements which will help people recover from appalling violations of their basic human rights. These changes are a very important measure to help victims of trafficking recover from the trauma of this horrific crime. At the same time as our treatment of victims becomes more flexible and compassionate, our resolve to prosecute the perpetrators of this dreadful crime is undiminished. I am sure that all members of this House agree that this crime must be prevented in Australia and around the world and that those who profit from it should bear the full force of the criminal law. Building the Education Revolution Program",103
124,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education. I refer the minister to reports that the Beechmont State School has been granted $1.8 million through the school stimulus debacle for a concrete undercover play area, instead of the school hall-including sports facility, kitchen, stage and toilet-they had planned for the same price. Does the minister agree with the Beechmont Hall Committee Treasurer, Greg MCKenzie, who said, ‘With no tender process, the school was never going to get a good deal'? Why won't the minister now do the right thing and refer the waste and mismanagement of this program to the changes will make Auditor-General?",104
125,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am happy to discuss the circumstances of that individual school with the member. I must admit I did not even quite catch the name of the school. Mr Bruce Scott-Beechmont.,104
126,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Beechmont. I think the member would be aware that he is an example of a member in this House who has from time to time raised issues about our Building the Education Revolution Program and we have responded. When he has asked us about individual matters, we have responded in a way that has met with his approval. Despite the fact that the opposition opposed the program holus-bolus, we have worked with individual opposition members-including the member who raises the question. What I want to explain to the honourable member in response to the question about tenders and costs-and I explained some things earlier in my answer to the member for Sturt-is the way the estimates end up being refined into project costs. It may depend at what stage of the process he has got the figure from. It may be from an early stage of the process and there has been some refinement of the costs. In Building the Education Revolution program initial estimates of costs are provided to the Commonwealth and they are based on the extensive experience of state and territory and block grant education authorities, and funding is approved based on those estimates. The people who run schools give us estimates that in their experience have proven to be correct estimates of costs. Then tenders are sought for managing contractors, who will then hire subcontractors in local areas to undertake work. They may project manage a number of projects across a region. Quotes or tenders are then sought for individual projects. In many cases, design and construction contracts are being used to fast-track the ess. This means that the builder works with the design team, architects and engineers on the job. Quotes will include some money allocated for contingencies, which may be things like unforeseen problems with the site or excavation problems. When quotes are finalised, schools may find they have funding available to do more than was originally envisaged. They can then seek an agreement for a project variation from the Commonwealth if what is planned was not within the scope of the original approved project. When buildings are progressed to a certain point and all concerns about contingencies have been addressed, decisions will then be made with school principals about how the contingency amount can be used either to enhance the existing approved project, or projects, or to add a second project if there was only one initial project approved. I think the member can see from that process that, in relation to the original cost estimates, we are relying on the historic experience of those who run schools, state and territory governments, and the block grant authorities in the Catholic and independent school system. Then we go through a tender process, which obviously refines costs. Then we go through a project delivery process, where of course some money is kept in reserve for contingencies because when you are building things, as people would know from home renovations and residential construction, you can hit contingencies. Then when you come to the actual costs, if there is a project variation, there is a way of dealing with the approval of that. If at the final stage the you have money left over then we can enter into an agreement with the school as to the use of the money that is left over. This is a considered and thoughtful process that has checks and balances at every proc- stage. I accept that the member of order. The minister was asked whether she would refer this debacle to the Auditor General. For some reason she refuses to answer that question. I draw",105
127,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Sturt will resume his seat! The question had a preamble and raised a matter of specificity. The Deputy Prime Minister has responded to that. I am not in the business of marking the correctness of answers, but I would have thought that the information that was being given was totally relevant to the question.",106
128,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have provided that comprehensive information because I know from my dealings with the member about the Building the Education Revolution program-notwithstanding the fact that he voted against it-that he is involved in helping his local schools. I have responded to it on the basis that it is an honest question. I understand that the tag line is part of the political campaign of the shadow minister for education, the member for Sturt, to besmirch this program. He might choose to do that, but the reality is-and members know it as they move around their local communities-that this is being seized by schools as an opportunity to deliver the infrastructure they need for tomorrow and it is being seized by local communities to deliver jobs today. Responsible members of the House know that and are responding to that. Unfortunately, those who squeal, wail and moan sitting on the opposition side here do not acknowledge that. Electronic Security",106
129,Mr GEORGANAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Attorney-General. Will the Attorney-General outline what the government is doing to protect Australia's e-security in light of a recent report which found that security breaches cost small and medium businesses $600 million in 2007?,106
130,Mr MCCLELLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh for his question. The threat of electronic security incidents was outlined recently in a report of the Australian Institute of Criminology entitled Australian business assessment of computer user security. It estimated that business sustained losses in the order of $595 million up to $649 million as a result of electronic security threats. The government believes that these identified threats are probably only the tip of the iceberg. The Prime Minister indicated in his National Security Statement last year that electronic security is indeed now a national security priority. Obviously, it is in the interests of the broader community and the economy for there to be complete faith and confidence in the viability of commercial transactions undertaken over the internet. That is why in the last budget we committed some $8.8 million in additional funding to initiatives in the civil area, as opposed to the defence area with high-end technologies, to deal with the threats posed by electronic security incidents. In particular, we have established a new computer emergency response team to act as the single point of contact for businesses, homes and schools to identify threats and vulnerabilities and of course to communicate information about strategies to protect electronic systems. This is in addition to the initiatives announced in the defence white paper to establish the Cyber Security Operations Centre. That centre will be staffed by representatives of the Australian Defence Force, my department and the Australian Federal Police. It will be a 24-hour, sevenday-a week watch centre. That watch centre will be able to provide better situational awareness of what is happening broadly on the internet and achieve better coordination. These initiatives build on activities that are already occurring. For instance, my department has provided briefings on electronic attack threats to some 460 companies. There is a regular exchange of information through the Trusted Information Sharing Network and the Australian Federal Police have developed sophisticated investigation techniques to identify and prosecute those engaged in electronic security incidents. Also, the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy engages in a number of programs to promote electronic security awareness to homes, small businesses and schools. Indeed, on a related topic I note that the Deputy Prime Minister indicated last week an outstanding program to address cyberbullying in schools. In summary, the government takes threats to electronic security very seriously. We are adopting a holistic approach to ensuring online security for the government, for critiattend cal infrastructure and for the broader community. Any member of the community, whether they be in a business, a school or a home, who has concerns about this area should refer to my department's website for details of relevant contacts, who will be able to provide assistance.

146,Ms MACKLIN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (3.35 pm)-by leaveToday the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare released its comprehensive report on children's well-being, A Picture of Australia's Children 2009. I congratulate the institute the excellent work that they have done on this report and their other very high-quality research. The positive news is that there has been a decline in child mortality rates, mostly due to a fall in deaths through injury. There are also favourable trends in some risk and protective factors, such as an increase in immunisation coverage, decline in teenage births and a reduction in smoking rates among older children. However, on a number of other fronts, the picture is sobering. The number of children subject to child abuse and neglect remains unacceptably high. Far too many children are homeless or at risk of homelessness, or are victims of assault. The report also shows that outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are far worse than for nonIndigenous children across a broad range of indicators. The mortality rate for Indigenous children is more than twice that of other Australian children. They are five times more likely to be born to teenage mothers and have low birth weight. As they grow up, they are 24 times more likely to be in juvenile justice supervision. It is the right of every Australian child to have a safe, healthy and happy childhood. This is what drives the Australian government's child centred family policy. The best interests of children are a national priority-from the day they are born. If children are to have the best start in life, they need the time and space to bond with their primary care giver. This is absolutely vital for their emotional, cognitive and physical development that is the foundation of lifelong resilience. And putting the best interests of Australian babies first, the Australian government has taken the landmark decision to commit $731 million over five years to Australia's first comprehensive, statutory paid parental leave scheme. Paid parental leave will be available to some for 148,000 mothers and primary carers each year so that they can spend time with their children in those critical early months. To provide ongoing support for families, we have introduced significant reforms to keep our children safe and well. Working collaboratively with the states and territories, the Australian government has reached agreement on the development of a national framework to address child abuse and neglect. We are investing $63 million over four years to establish the first National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children 2009-2020. The national framework represents an unprecedented level of cooperation and commitment between all levels of government and non-government organisations to protect our children. This includes developing ambitious national standards for outof-home care so children who cannot be cared for by their parents receive the quality care and support that they need. As part of the national framework we are also: - implementing national workforce development projects to improve the skills and capability of services working with families and children; - improving information sharing and data consistency so that vulnerable children and their families do not fall between the cracks; and - establishing a national research agenda for child protection. We are also establishing up to eight Communities for Children Plus sites across Australia. These will build on the successful Communities for Children model and they will provide intensive early intervention services to an additional 1,200 children and their families over four years. We intend to work with the states and territories, the local communities and of course, most importantly, families to prevent child abuse and neglect. We are committed to making sure that income support provided to families is spent in the best interests dren. Working with the Western Australian government, the Australian government has initiated a trial using income management in child protection cases. In partnership with the state government, local child protection officers can now refer cases to Centrelink where parents and children would benefit from income management. Voluntary income management is also operating for individuals and families in these trial locations and the early indicators are certainly positive. Families are purchasing more of the goods and services that are essential to improving their children's health and well-being. These are being supported by money management services to help get them back on track. In Cape York, under the Family Responsibilities Commission model, and also in prescribed communities in the Northern Territory, income management is also having positive results. The government does understand that non-government organisations working in the field are often best placed to build community resilience. Today I have announced 50 small-scale, innovative community based projects across each state and territory with an additional $3.1 million in Australian government funding. We certainly know that supporting children in their early years can make a significant difference to their learning outcomes and can establish the foundation for social and emotional well-being. That is why, through our National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children, we are providing $36.6 million over four years to give more vulnerable children access to quality child care through take-up of the special child care benefit. This special benefit covers the full cost of child care for children at serious risk of abuse or neglect, and enables these children to access care and development in a of chilsafe and supportive environment. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare data released today also shows that the prevalence of severe disability in children has significantly increased from 1.6 per cent in 1981 to 4.3 per cent in 2003 and this obviously places great strain on family carers. Last night, legislation was passed in the Senate to deliver long overdue reforms to the complex and overly restrictive eligibility requirements for financial support for people caring for children with severe disability or medical conditions. Over the years, the restrictive eligibility requirements for Carer Payment (child) meant carers were denied appropriate financial support; so restrictive that, when the review inquired into the effectiveness and fairness of the payment in 2007, only 3½ thousand families across Australia were benefiting. With these government reforms-which take into account the level of care required rather than a narrow set of medical and behavioural criteria-we now expect an additional 19,000 families will have access to Carer Payment (child) from 1 July 2009. To better meet these needs of children and their parents in local communities, the government is bringing together our wide range of existing children's, parenting and families programs into an integrated new Family Support Program. There will be three core service streams: - family and parenting services-and that will focus on early intervention and prevention services for families to strengthen relationships, develop skills and support parents and children, especially over important life transitions; - community and family partnershipsmore intensive and coordinated support targeted at significantly disadvantaged communities and children at risk and their families; and - family law services-with assistance to families to manage the process and impacts of separation in the best interests of children. Underpinning these is the government's recognition that early intervention is essential to build long-term capacity and resilience in our children and families. We are committed to intervening to prevent a crisis before it happens rather than trying to rebuild broken lives after abuse neglect, family breakdown or learning and health problems have occurred. The Australian government is determined to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian children. To meet our very ambitious close-the-gap targets, COAG has endorsed the National Partnership Agreement on Indigenous Early Childhood Development. Under this agreement, and with joint investment of $293 million, 36 child and family centres will be established. These child and family centres will co-locate the range of maternal and child health, parenting, child care, early learning and development services in the one location, making these important services easier for parents and their children to access. Many of the 36 children and family centres will be established in priority locations established under the government's Remote Service Delivery National Partnership, including all four Northern Territory remote centres. Over the last 18 months the government has made significant reforms to support children and families. Our continuing commitment to reform will focus on issues including the reduction of violence against women and children, housing and homelessness, disability and mental health. I will also work closely with my colleagues in the parliament in the crucial areas of health, early childhood care and education. The Australian government is committed to demonstrating national leadership on these vital issues putting the well-being and best interests of children at the heart of all we do. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Warringah to speak for 11 minutes. Leave granted.",108
147,Ms MACKLIN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I move: That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Warringah speaking for a period not exceeding 11 minutes. Question agreed to.,110
148,Mr ABBOTT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I thank the minister for the opportunity to respond to her statement. I acknowledge, as I so often do in this place, the abundant goodwill and decency which the minister brings to these very difficult issues. The minister's statement demonstrates that the Rudd government is concerned that some Australian children, too many Australian children, are in dysfunctional or disadvantaged families and can suffer as a result. There are too many, and one child in danger is one too many. But I should say that the government's compassion credentials are not in question here. I am not the government's greatest admirer, as you would expect, but I would not for a moment suggest that the government lacked goodwill or common decency. My problem with the minister's statement is not the undeniable worthiness of the cause; it is the apparent assumption that government run or government funded services can eliminate the consequences of human frailty or cure its roots. Government services are important and necessary, but as long as there are parents with substance abuse or mental health problems or prone to certain sorts of criminal conduct there will be children at risk. This is always a tragedy. It is sometimes a crime. But let us not pretend that it is easy to fix. Government services can try to tackle problems but what is necessary, all too often, in the first instance is law enforcement and what is often needed is individual personal transformation-the kind of spiritual rebirth or moral rearmament that is not normally the field of government. Then there is the fact that government services in this area are mostly the principal responsibility of the states. To the extent the plight of some Australian children is the result of inadequate services, that is the fault of the state governments. To the extent that the Commonwealth is proposing to help improve state government services, it is yet again the federal Labor government bailing out state Labor governments. If the states' failures are sufficiently monumental then of course the Commonwealth should act. But let us be open about the failures that are being addressed. Plainly, there are various state government services in this area which are not working well. The New South Wales Department of Community Services, for instance, is a disaster area. The papers are full of terrible instances of avoidable neglect. But none of this has been covered in the statement that we have heard today. If I may say so-and I say it with respect-the minister's statement would have been more valuable if it had detailed how the existing services would be improved by the new Commonwealth initiatives that she went through today. For instance, how many extra staff will be deployed as a result of the various measures that she outlined? How many additional troubled families and their children will have how many additional contacts from offices of various services as a result of the measures outlined today? How many troubled children will be at school, for instance, rather than truanting as a result of these changes? The minister's statement referred to the Western Australian trial of quarantining welfare payments for the families of children at risk. It would have helped the statement, I suggest, if the minister had told the House in how many instances family income management has been imposed; how many truancy prosecutions have been launched by the states since the Rudd government's drive to improve the welfare of children; and what states are now providing truancy information that to Centrelink for the purposes of family income management quarantine as a result of the Rudd government's efforts. The minister may have that information; I hope she does. It should be provided to the House, but I suspect it will not be because governments have a tendency not to want their goodwill to be judged by objective standards. I fear, in short, that the measures announced today will turn out to be less than they sound, less than they seem. The minister talked about a new national framework for protecting children, and as part of that there are millions to be spent here, millions to be spent there. There are new programs, there are new partnerships, there are new trials-all extremely worthy. But, as someone who has been in government and has heard the language of public servants dealing as best they can with these problems, it sounded to me more like a charter for bureaucracy than for children. If I may say so, respectfully, Madam Deputy Speaker, notwithstanding the abundant concern of the minister and, I am sure, her offiing cials to make a better world, I suspect that young person in trouble or a parent grieving for a young person in trouble and hoping to find better services for such a young person would have got a sense of ministerial and governmental goodwill from this statement but not necessarily much sense of a change in the offing. I am not saying that any of the measures that the minister outlined should not be and I am not saying that they will not help, but I fear that the next time the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare produces another of its excellent reports it will show much the same problems to much the same extent, because human nature, sadly, is very hard to change, and government often finds it much easier to do things than to really change things.

149,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-I am pleased to present this inaugural report of the Anti-People Trafficking Interdepartmental Committee to the parliament. This report reflects the hard work of the former Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon. Bob Debus, and I thank him for his commitment to bringing traffickers to justice, whilst protecting the victims of these offences. The former minister worked closely with the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator the Hon. Chris Evans; the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Stephen Smith MP; and the Minister for the Status of Women, the Hon. Tanya Plibersek MP, on the government's response to trafficking in persons, and I acknowledge today their great efforts. People trafficking is a crime which may have a traumatic and lasting impact on victims and the government is committed to combating it. The extent of people traffickis hard to measure but it is clear that it a affects almost every country in the world. Men, women and children are trafficked for a range of exploitative purposes including sexual servitude, forced labour and the harvesting of organs. In Australia, most-but by no means all-identified victims of trafficking have been women trafficked for exploitation in the sex industry. The Minister for Home Affairs has retaken sponsibility for the whole-of-government anti-people-trafficking strategy as well as the way in which the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service deals with people smuggling across Australia's maritime borders. It is important at the outset to note the distinction between these two crimes. People trafficking is the physical movement of people across borders through deceptive means, coercion or force. The motivation for peopletraffickers is the prospect of exploiting their victims once they reach the destination country. People smuggling, on the other hand, is the organised, illegal movement of people across borders, usually on a payment-forservice basis. Australia ratified the United Nations vention against Transnational Organised Crime in 2004 and its supplementary Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children in 2005. The government's anti-peopletrafficking strategy was established in 2003 and implements Australia's obligations under the people-trafficking protocol. The strategy has three equally important needs: to do as much as we can to prevent people trafficking; to prosecute offenders; and to provide support to victims of trafficking, including by protecting their human rights. The Australian National Audit Office, ANAO, recently undertook a review of the management of the anti-trafficking strategy. The government welcomed this review: it provided us with an opportunity to assess the progress of the strategy. Given the reprehensible nature of the crime, we welcome any input that may enhance the government's response to trafficking in persons. One of the recommendations arising from the ANAO's review was that there should be a more systematic annual reporting of outcomes under the anti-trafficking strategy. The government recognised that there would be considerable benefit in the production of single, consolidated annual report. This first report of the Anti-People Trafficking Interdepartmental Committee captures the period from the implementation of the strategy in January 2004 up to April this year. In the future, the committee will report on outcomes annually. This first report on the achievements of the anti-people-trafficking strategy will also serve as a response to a Senate motion moved by my colleague Senator Stephens, Parliamentary Secretary for Social Inclusion and Parliamentary Secretary for the Voluntary Sector, on 19 June 2007. The Office for Women has already implemented a number of the enhancements Con- suggested by the ANAO in relation to its administration of the Support for Victims of People Trafficking Program. This has included the negotiation of a new contract for the provision of case management services with the well-known humanitarian organisation, the Australian Red Cross. The revised administrative arrangements ensure that the provider appreciates the high standard of service required for victims of trafficking. My colleague the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator the Hon. Chris Evans, has announced changes to the People Trafficking Visa Framework that will simplify the framework and, importantly, give victims and their immediate family members greater certainty about their immigration status. These changes are the result of consultations with a range of stakeholders. The Department of Immigration and Citizenship, DIAC, has also addressed the ANAO's recommendations relating to visa cancellation procedures, and is working with partner agencies to improve referral processes following the ANAO's comments regarding the professionalism and sensitive conduct of its compliance teams. In response to recommendations from the a ANAO report, the Australian Federal Police, AFP, has reviewed and expanded investigation guidelines for the Transnational Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking Teams. These guidelines complement the existing AFP specialist training to further support investigators in this complex type of crime. Government has recently taken a number of steps to strengthen the national response to trafficking in persons. This week, my colleagues and I were pleased to announce changes to the government's anti-peopletrafficking strategy, which will provide enhanced support for victims of this crime. We have also strengthened partnerships with non-governmental organisations. NGOs and industry bodies have access to information about the situation on the ground particularly in relation to victims, and their sights can help inform government policy. In June last year, the government convened the inaugural National Roundtable on People Trafficking and today we convened the second of these meetings. The round-table brings together anti-people-trafficking NGOs, service providers, support organisations for tims of crime as well as the legal, employer and union sectors to implement a whole-ofcommunity approach to fighting this crime. The meeting of the round-table in 2008 has led to practical outcomes for Australia's response to trafficking. For example, the round-table identified as a priority improving the experience of victims of trafficking in criminal justice process. In response to this, the Attorney-General's Department has been working with the National Judicial College of Australia to develop education resources for judicial officers on people trafficking. The Judicial College hosted the first seminar for the judiciary on Monday in Sydney. In March of this year the then Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon. Bob Debus MP, launched the guidelines for NGOs working with trafficked people in Sydney along with the President of the Australian Human Rights Commission, the Hon. Catherine Branson QC and the Director of the NGO AntiSlavery Project, Jennifer Burn. A working group established by the round-table and chaired by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Ms Elizabeth Broderick, developed the guidelines. The guidelines are a practical resource to assist community organisations to protect the rights of victims of trafficking and, in the words of one key anti-peopletrafficking advocate, ‘provide the gold standard for ethical ways of working with trafficked people'. People trafficking is a complex transnational crime. It is therefore imperative that inwe collaborate closely with our neighbours to prevent this crime in source countries, take complementary approaches to criminal justice, and provide effective support to victims of trafficking whether they remain in Australia or return to their countries of origin. Specialist anti-people-trafficking offivic- cers within the AFP and DIAC are posted overseas to facilitate this type of regional cooperation to combat trafficking. Australia has taken an active role in international efforts to combat people trafficking. Australia, with Indonesia, co-founded and co-chairs the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related the Transnational Crime. Addressing factors that make people vulnerable to trafficking is an important part of Australia's national and international strategies to prevent trafficking. The Bali Regional Ministerial Conference in April re-focused regional attention on people smuggling and trafficking in persons, and Bali Process member states' ministers agreed to convene an ad hoc group mechanism to develop a regional response to current challenges in the region, including, any specific people-trafficking challenges. To further our international engagement in this area, the AFP is hosting an International Conference on Trafficking in Persons later this month. This conference will bring together law enforcement agencies from source and destination countries, specifically South Korea, China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Australia. They will discuss proactive strategies to combat people trafficking, as well as opportunities for more effective international cooperation and information exchange. In 2009-10, Australia will provide A$3.8 billion in official development assistance though AusAID, to help reduce poverty and promote sustainable development. The aid program also addresses violence against women and children, and includes a number of activities that specifically work to combat trafficking in persons at the regional level. My colleagues and I look forward to presenting the next report of the Anti-PeopleTrafficking IDC. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Farrer to speak for 10 minutes. Leave granted.",112
150,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I move: That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Farrer speaking in reply to the ministerial ment for a period not exceeding 10 minutes. Question agreed to.,115
151,Ms LEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"It gives me pleasure to respond to the ministerial statement from the Minister for Home Affairs. I thank him and the government and his predecessor for the opportunity. Broadly, the coalition welcomes what this statement contains. It certainly builds on strong work that started under the previous government, particularly, I think, in 2003, when the then coalition government announced a $20 million package of measures to combat trafficking in persons. An important part of that package was a thorough legislative review. The review carefully analysed Australia's anti-trafficking laws to identify what changes were needed to fully and comprehensively criminalise trafficking in persons. That package included a new AFP unit, the Transnational Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking Team; new visa arrangements for trafficking victims-I note in the minister's statement today that there will be further expansion of those visa arrangements-victim support measures, including counselling and legal and medical support to be administered by the Office for Women; proposed improvements to legislation making people trafficking punishable by up to 20 years jail; and a promise to ratify the UN protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children, which was completed in 2004. Since these initiatives-five years on-we are looking at a report that covers those five years. We are undertaking to make annual reports and we also have an Audit Office inquiry into the management of the Australian government's action plan to eradicate trafficking in persons. So we are really starting to see how the initiatives that were put in place a few years ago are hitting the ground and how we can make changes for the better. stateGlobally, over 21,400 victims of trafficking were identified in 2006, although it is considered that many victims are not identified. People trafficking takes place for a variety of reasons, including sexual servitude, domestic labour, forced marriage and sweat shop labour. Women, men and children are victims. While there is limited hard information on the number of persons trafficked and the target industries into which they are trafficked, evidence suggests that the trafficking of women into prostitution is the major and certainly the most visible form of trafficking taking place. As a citizen of this country you cannot help but be profoundly affected and insulted by the examples of trafficking into sexual servitude that we have seen. We have had good results in the courts-noticeably, the 2008 High Court decision in R v Tang. I want to quote women, through Project Respect, who have been trafficked into prostitution and who spoke out after that decision: What happened to us was a nightmare. We can never forget. It comes back to us in dreams. This will affect us til we die. It has changed us. We were treated very badly. We worked from 11 am to 3 or 4 am. We slept only three or four hours a night. Sometimes some of us worked for 24 hours. For four or five months, all we did was prostitution. Even when we had our period, we had to work. Sometimes we worked until we couldn't walk. We had to work until we were very very sick and the customers refused to take us. Only then were we allowed to rest, for one day. Some owners were not so cruel, but even when they were friendly, they still treated us as slaves. We were made to feel like animals. Customers were violent. Some of the customers were crazy. They treated us like animals. We were sexually abused, we were dragged, we were hit. Some of us were given drugs so we could work all the time. Some of the women we know have become drug addicts and now they have to keep doing prostitution to pay for drugs. … … … I felt like we survived and died at the same time. We had to keep doing what the traffickers said, for ourselves, and for the people we loved. The traffickers threatened us-we were scared they would hurt us and our families. Some of us thought we could be killed. We blamed ourselves for what happened, because we had wanted to come to Australia. This changed our lives. When we have so many people talking, consulting, legislating through roundtables and conferences, we do need to hear from the victims who are affected. We must keep in mind the victims when deciding what help we need to offer. I read with interest the Auditor-General's report into the action plan and noted some of the recommendations that the Audit Office has made. I want to just run through a couple of those because they are important, and I know they have been accepted. This is a whole-of-government approach, and when that happens sometimes there is a little bit of silo operation between the agencies, but the ANAO did conclude: … the whole-of-government oversight arrangements are broadly effective in sharing information and making decisions. However, the necessary performance information framework, including baseline measures to monitor contributions … has not been established. Each agency has implemented their respective new measures, although management effectiveness varies from agency to agency. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission expressed concerns as to the effectiveness of the coordination and accountability arrangements for the overall government effort. One thing that concerned me was that the key baseline measure of the effectiveness of the measures outlined in the action plan-that is, the trend in the numbers of victims being traffickedis not being measured. Arriving at such estimates is clearly a challenge, but we have to do that. We have to find out whether our measures are being successful and if not how we can improve on them. The AFP's transnational sexual exploitation and trafficking teams are at the frontline of combating this problem and I want to pay tribute to them and to the men and women of those teams who work so hard in such difficult circumstances investigating trafficking cases, bringing them to court and sometimes being terribly disappointed when some brothel owners, as we saw in Sydney not that long ago, get let off with a slap on the wrist. The AFP was mentioned in the Audit Office report and comments made were that some of the people-trafficking resources had been directed to non-trafficking crime types. I want to very strenuously say that the AFP has probably suffered a cut of about $13 million in its budget recently. It is continually being expected to stretch that thin blue line further and further. Even a couple of days ago we heard through the media that the AFP will be carbon cops, having to police the forthcoming carbon regime with no additional resources. It makes no sense at all. We must remember that where you find this type of crime you find other types of crime, so if the AFP is combating crime it may well be incorporating people trafficking. I ask the government to resource the AFP properly to do its job, because we can have roundtables, meetings and Bali conferences-all of these are good and are conducted by both sides of politics-but when you hear from the victims of trafficking you realise that you want people on the front line: state police, the AFP and the Australian Crime Commission, which has also had cuts of at least seven per cent to its budget. Those are the people who can take action against these dreadful individuals that are involved in the trafficking. That is so important. The ANAO made six recommendations aimed at strengthening whole-of-government arrangements and they are being picked up on. I want to speak briefly about the Office for Women's management of the victim support services post trafficking and say that I was not convinced by figures I heard from the Audit Office that, I think, $9 million was taken up in the administration of the program-the contract management function by OFW and then the contract management by the person who provides those services. I know that the service provider has recently changed to the Red Cross, and I have the highest opinion of them, but I would ask the Minister for the Status of Women to maintain a watching brief on the dollars administer this and to recognise that a small allocation of money to support the victims has not really gone very far. When you consider that, as of August 2008, 107 victims had been assisted under the various phases of support-a substantial shortfall in the catered-for demand of up to 90 victims a year, which would now be a total of 450 victims-something is not right there. We must not forget that after a court case the victims who testified may need particular assistance. My colleague the shadow minister for immigration will shortly, I am sure, discuss the possible changed visa arrangements, and we look forward to working with the government on getting the balance right. But I recognise the courage of a woman who has been trafficked into sexual servitude in coming forward to testify, not knowing what the outcome of the court case will be and possibly not knowing what her own fate will be should the case not be successful. We must remember that cases fail for a number of reasons, and victims continue to need support. But we must balance any possible mischief related to applying for visas in particular instances with the need to protect victims. As I said, my colleagues will have more to say on that. Broadly, I welcome the statement. I look forward to the ongoing annual reports. I applaud and thank the previous coalition government for the work that they kicked off in this area in 2003, added to in 2004 and allocated further funds to in early 2007. We have made this recognised and appreciated. (Time expired) NA Workplace Relations",115
152,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Stirling proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for that it costs to discussion, namely: The job destroying nature of the Government's industrial relations changes I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",117
153,Mr KEENAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Stirling) (4.16 pm)What are we to make of this government that talks about jobs as its highest priority then goes about doing everything in a policy sense to destroy people's employment prospects? This is a government that are now so out of control with spin that they seem to believe that if they just talk about jobs then suddenly these jobs will materialise. It is like their approach to debt: if you do not mention it, it does not exist. It is like the Prime ter's approach to factions: if he does not say the factions have any influence, if he pretends they do not exist, then people will just tend to believe him. This government is now out of control with spin. This time last year in the House everybody on the government side would have been talking about inflation. Of course, we have come to see what that policy means for the Australian community. Now, if they talk about anything, they will talk about its effect on employment. To every government policy they attach the number of jobs it will create, without providing one shred of evidence. We see it today with the Ruddbank proposal. I have heard different figures today in the House-between 75,000 and 150,000 jobs were apparently going to be protected, supported or created by the Ruddbank proposal-without anyone providing one shred of evidence. But it is much worse than that, because, particularly in the industrial relations area, we see a government that goes about destroying the job prospects of Australians. We have seen them re-regulate the labour market-the biggest re-regulation of the labour market in Australia's history and the first time that a major economic reform had actually been undone in this country. It was done, despite repeated calls from the opposition not to do so. It was done without any thought for the effect that it would have on people's employment prospects. We had this major reform done without anybody knowing what it was going to do to people's prospects of finding a job. I want to talk about two policy areas today where the government has gone about destroying people's job prospects. The first is award modernisation and the second is the abolition of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Members will Minisrecall that the award modernisation process was done to simplify what is a very complicated awards structure in Australia. That itself is a very laudable aim and it is an aim that is supported by the opposition. Indeed, we promised to do it when we were in government and, if we had been successful at the election, of course we would have followed through with that. What happened, though, was that the Deputy Prime Minister made a reference to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to simplify the award structure in Australia and in it she said that the commission needed to go about this task without increasing the cost to employers or decreasing the take-home pay of employees. Clearly that was impossible for the commission to adhere to. It is a zero-sum game. If you take from one to give to the other then clearly you are going to disadvantage either the employer or the employee. So the commission is faced with this impossible task. It needs to go around the country-and of course we have different award structures in different states and different industries-and basically find the gold standard, wherever it exists in Australia, and apply that as the new national award. There is ample evidence that, if this policy is followed through, if the government does not change tack, they will directly destroy the jobs of tens of thousands of Australians. As we debated the transitional bill in the other place today, the opposition gave the government a chance to change course, to save the jobs that they are going to destroy through their award modernisation, by moving sensible amendments that would have alleviated the concerns of small and large business in Australia and given the people who are going to lose their jobs under this process a fighting chance. Extraordinarily, of our amendments were voted down by the government. I would like to go through these amendments. This is very important because it shows the pig-headedness of this government. When faced with irrefutable evidence that what they were doing was going to damage the nation and damage people's employment prospects, they refused to change course and refused to accept the sensible amendments that we put up. Those amendments would have provided Australian business with the ability to seek the assistance of understand. the commission if their labour costs were going to go up due to the application of a new modern award and they could show Fair Work Australia that that was going to damage the interests of their business. We were going to require the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, who is undertaking the award modernisation process, to allow a default five-year period over which state based differences could be phased out. This is something that the minister often refers to-she says, ‘We'll phase in these changes over five years.' But she has left that up to the discretion of the commission; she has no power to actually control that. So we moved amendments that would make the five-year transitional period the starting point to give business some certainty when dealing with these cost increases. But, astonishingly, that was voted down. We also moved some other sensible amendments that would have limited industrial disputation in our workplaces, particularly in relation to union demarcation disputes, which are surely some of the most pointless industrial disputes that we find within our system. So what we find is that the coalition moves what are very sensible amendments to try and stop the worse aspects of the governall ment's new policy, and what we get from this government is stonewalling and opposition for the sake of opposition. There is ample evidence that this policy will directly destroy jobs. Clearly, if you increase the cost base for business, that is going to result in increased unemployment. It is not a very difficult concept to understand. Indeed, there is a great quote from former Labor Treasurer Frank Crean: ‘One man's wage increase is another man's job.' That is something this minister does not understand, and it is something this government does not I want to go through some real-life examples from people at the coalface about what this award modernisation is actually going to do when it comes into effect. The Australian Retailers Association has said: Smaller retailers will not cope with the collective pressure of increased labour and compliance costs in the modern retail award … They go on to say that 82 per cent of smaller retailers say they will restructure their workforce while 65 per cent of them say they will shed staff. Costings by the Australian Retailers Association indicate that the average wage bill for a retailer will go up by $28½ thousand. They said that the financial impact of the new so-called modern retail award will hit the bottom line of the retail industry ‘like a Mack truck driving through their shop window'. The Pharmacy Guild did some analysis based on three pharmacies in Western Australia who employ a total of 31 staff. In these three pharmacies employing 31 people the combined wages bill increase from the so called modern award would be $228,700 per annum, which is a 13.8 per cent increase. They say that the proprietors of these businesses advise that they would have to sack almost four people were this to go ahead. So from 31 people employed in these three businesses, because of this new retail modern award, they will need to sack over 10 per cent of that workforce. If we were to extrapolate these figures just across Western Australia alone this would result in a loss of 680 jobs. That is in one state, in one sectorlet alone all the other states and all the sectors where this new modern award is going to wreak havoc. There are other industries that will be adversely affected by this. The aged-care sector indicate that their costs will rise between 10 and 20 per cent. Newsagents, particularly in Queensland, say that they will face a 14 per cent increase in labour costs. One of the independent supermarkets, just outside of my electorate in Shenton Park, said that they cannot afford to pay their casual employees $40 on a Sunday and what they will do is either not open on a Sunday or get rid of staff. Hotels in Western Australia said that the new modern award will result in almost 10 per cent increases in labour costs, with the resulting massive job losses. The horticultural industry estimate that their costs will rise by 30 per cent under these new arrangements-30 per cent. And the government just shrugs its shoulders and has no response to how these businesses are supposed to alleviate these extra costs. Finally, can I refer to the example of the fast-food industry. Everyone in this place will know that the fast-food industry employs a lot of young people, it employs a lot of single mothers, it employs people who cannot work regular hours. What they say is that, if the so-called modern retail industry award goes ahead, the additional costs facing fast-food retailers would be $625 million per annum. They translated that into what it will mean for their business. Once they extrapolated it across the whole country they said that it will cost almost 18,000 jobs. So the fast-food industry are saying that if this new modern award goes ahead they will be forced to sack 18,000 people-and, as we know, they will be some of the most vulnerable workers within our society. The government has absolutely no answer to this. When you raise these questions with the minister she basically just shrugs her other shoulders, says it is up to the commission and then talks about the transitional period, a transitional period that she cannot control. Of course, this is a pattern with this government-talking about jobs and then doing things that destroy people's job prospects. We have had another example of this today, with the introduction into the House of legislation abolishing the Australian Building and Construction Commission. This was a commission that was established after the Cole royal commission. It was established by the Howard government in 2005. It has been extraordinarily successful in controlling lawlessness within the building and construction industry. Anyone familiar with the industry knows that building and construction in Australia is plagued by serial lawlessness, militant unionism and the resulting violence and thuggery. For two decades prior to the Cole royal commission this was an industry with a culture that could only be described as completely and utterly crook. There were laws that were supposed to enforce law and order within that industry, but they were not working because the cop on the beat did not have the powers that it needed to do that job properly. We have had some theatre in the lead-up to this legislation being tabled in the parliament, where the government have pretended that they are going to be tough on the militant building unions. They come in here and say, ‘No, we're going maintain a tough cop on the beat. Sure, we're abolishing the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Sure, that's been incredibly successful in enforcing law and order within that industry, but we're going to abolish it and replace it with something that is'-allegedly-'a tough cop on the beat.' But what we find is that this ‘tough' cop will not have the powers that it requires to do its job properly. So, spite all the theatre, despite all the sound fury about how Julia Gillard was being tough on the union movement, this new body is not going to have the powers that it requires to actually control law and order within what is an exceptionally difficult industry. The ABCC has been around since 2005 and its results have been measured by independent analysis done by KPMG. What that analysis said was that, because of the ABCC, within those four short years since its establishment there has been a 10 per cent increase in productivity within the building and construction industry and industrial disputation has been reduced by 92 per cent to record lows. During this time the workers have benefited. Increases in their average weekly earnings within that industry in the three years from 2004 to 2007 were 25½ per cent in real terms. The economic gain to the community of the creation of this commission has been estimated at over $5 billion. It has improved levels of health and safety within the building industry and there has been almost a 7.5 per cent productivity gain in commercial building relative to residential building since it was established. The results for the community of this improvement within that one industry across the whole of Australia are very impressive. GDP is 1.5 per cent higher than it otherwise would be. Inflation has been lowered because of the improvements within the construction industry. And as I said before, there has been a gain of over $5 billion to the whole community. What we find with this government is a particular pattern of behaviour. They say things but then their actions belie the sincerity of their words. The award modernisation process is going to directly destroy tens of thousands of Australian jobs and the government has no plan to alleviate the cost indecreases that will result from that process. and Similarly, we see it with the Australian Building and Construction Commission. We have had a tough cop on the beat, it has enforced law and order and it has contained those militant unions, but now the government, protesting that it cares about people's jobs in that industry, is going to come along and abolish it. It is going to institute a toothless tiger that will not have the power to do the job. We will see in that industry a return to the bad old days of union thuggery and lawlessness. This is a government with which you must look at what they do rather than what they say. You cannot believe what they say about jobs. Clearly, the examples of the award modernisation process and the Australian Building and Construction Commission are proof of that. (Time expired)",117
154,Mr CLARE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If there was any doubting before that Work Choices is still alive and well in the coalition you heard it then. Peter Costello, the member for Higgins, might be going but Work Choices is still alive and well. It was a great day here in the parliament last year when we buried Work Choices. It was a bit of a celebration for those of us on this side of the House, but I know it was a day of mourning on the other side of the chamber. It was not a debate; it was more like a wake. It was like burying a member of the family, and it is a member of the family that they want to dig up and bring to life whenever they can. The contribution from the member for Stirling just proves that it is still alive and well. It is like that zombie policy that wants to rear head again and get out of the coffin and get back to life as soon as you get a chance. Mr Keenan-What about award modernisation?",121
155,Mr CLARE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will get to that in a second; don't you worry about that. But if we are going to have a debate about industrial relations you have got to start where it all begins-that is, where you stand when it comes to Work Choices, that zombie policy. The member for Stirling knows this all too well because he is one of the Dr Frankensteins who helped build the monster that killed John Howard. They forget that at their peril. So they play a game around this chamber a bit like Weekend at Bernie's. Do you remember that movie? They used to wander around pretending that Bernie was still alive, taking him to the moviesMr Hartsuyker interjecting",122
156,Mr CLARE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You have not seen that one? It is worth watching. Go and grab it at the video store. In Weekend at Bernie's they pretended that Bernie was still alive. Those opposite are going to try to pretend that Work Choices is dead. But I will tell you this: Peter Costello might be gone but it is still alive and well in the hearts and the minds of those opposite. The shadow minister talked about award modernisation. Let me say this: the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is part way through a two-year award modernisation process. He knows this because he voted for the legislation that introduced it: the Work- multiple place Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Act, which was passed in March 2008 with the support of the Liberal opposition. It provides for an award modernisation process that commences for a transition period of up to five years. That the legislation that was introduced last year and passed with the support of both sides of its this House. Since then, 44 modern awards have been made and 50 draft awards have been published for consultation. I should mention and place on the record of the House the view of the Master Plumbers and Mechanical Services Association of Australia, which welcomed the Australian Industrial Relations Commission decision on award modernisation on 23 January 2009 that recognised the wider plumbing, mechanical services and fire services as a separate industry through one modern award. Mr Ebejer stated: … this historical decision will particularly assist small business contractors/employers in better managing their employment responsibilities by removing the confusion of the many existing separate awards, providing one focused national award for Plumbing, Mechanical Servicing and Fire Sprinkler Contracting businesses and employees. There you have it; that is an example of this process at work. We started the last century-at the beginning of Federation-with different rail gauges and we understood the necessity of moving to a standard rail gauge. And in the 21st century I think most people in this chamber understand the importance of standardised national awards. Certainly, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry think that this is an important process. They said: Workplace relations policy is too important for horse and buggy era approaches to persist. … … … … many businesses are subject to overlapping, sets of regulation (both state and federal) within the one workplace. When did they say that? They said it in 2005. But there was not a lot of award modernisation going on in 2005 because those opposite, who were then sitting on the Treasury is bench, were too busy creating the monster. Mr Briggs-That is not true.",122
157,Mr CLARE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Mayo knows this because he is the original Dr Frankenstein-he is the architect-and he bears more responsibility than most in this chamber for what the monster did to his boss John Howard. The opposition spokesman for workplace relations had this to say on ABC radio on 3 June: … what the government is saying is that they're just going to implement these new awards holusbolus on January 1, 2010. That is what you said. Is that your view? Mr Keenan-Can you guarantee that that will not happen?",123
158,Mr CLARE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Well, listen and you might get educated. I will continue to quote the member for Stirling, who is the shadow minister: Now what that means if you're in a state which has a lower award based than another state, you're going to face a massive increase in your operating costs from the 1st of January. This is the sort of scare campaign that we are starting to get used to over here. Actually, we have been used to it for a while, going back to Tampa, children overboard and the scare campaigns that were run at the last election. There is the dodgy scare campaign that you are running on debt. Obviously this is another dodgy scare campaign on award modernisation. He knows it is not true, because he voted for the legislation that allows for a five-year transition period. The shadow minister also spoke about the Australian Building and Construction Commission and argued that its replacement would be a ‘toothless tiger'. He said that getting rid of the ABCC was going to create a toothless tiger. Let's add a little bit of to the debate. The fact is that the Labor Party in opposition made a commitment to get rid of the ABCC and to replace it with a specialist division of Fair Work Australia starting in January of next year. That was our commitment and that is what we are doing. We are a party that adopts policy based on an evidence based approach. I take you to the report that Justice Wilcox did. Have a look at what Justice Wilcox said. He said: I am satisfied there is still such a level of industrial unlawfulness in the building and construction industry, especially in Victoria and Western Australia, that it would be inadvisable not to empower the [Specialist Division] to undertake compulsory interrogation. The reality is that, without such a power, some types of contravention would be almost impossible to prove. He continues to say: I have reached the opinion that it would be unwise not to endow [Specialist Division] (at least for now) with a coercive interrogation power. Although conduct in the industry has improved in recent years, I believe the job is not yet done. So what has this government done? It is implementing those recommendations, maintaining those coercive powers but doing something that those opposite failed to do, and that is provide proper oversight for those coercive powers, making sure that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has to approve the use of those coercive powers and also make sure that if those coercive powers are used then they are videotaped and they are reviewed on a regular basis by the ombudsman and reported to this parliament. My question for the opposition is: what have you got against that? What do you think is wrong about that? Are you going to vote against that legislation because you think that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal should not have oversight or that the ombudsman should not have a role? This is ostensibly what the opposition are saying. This truth is what they call a toothless tiger. This is what they call watering down the powers that will be established in Fair Work Australia. It doesn't really add up. This debate is ostensibly one about jobs. The opposition talk about the destruction of jobs. If you want to talk about the destruction of jobs, have a look at what the opposition did in the Senate last night. What the opposition did in the Senate last night is put jobs of people that they say they are worried about in the construction industry at risk. They did that for political purposes. If you go back to 26 January this year and open up the newspaper-actually, you do not even have to open it up; have a look at the front page of the Australian on 26 January. When most Australians were thinking about what it means to be an Australian, we found out what it means to be a Liberal. On the front page of that newspaper Malcolm Turnbull said he was going to oppose the Australian Business Investment Partnership because he thinks, and continues to think, that the market should be allowed to take its coursethat the proper process is to let the market take its course, and if that means jobs sacrificed on the altar of Liberal ideology, then so be it. That is the consequence of their actions. When you are in the middle of a storm, you do not cancel your flood insurance policy, but that is ostensibly what the Liberal Party are asking this parliament and asking the people of Australia to do by voting against this legislation in the Senate. The other thing that is worthy of pointing out is having a look at the budget. If you go to Budget Paper No. 1 and you turn to page 1-7, it makes for some pretty interesting reading. It says this: In the absence of Government action, the level GDP would be 2¾ per cent lower in 2009 10 and 1½ per cent lower in 2010 11. Government action is expected to support up to 210,000 jobs and, without it, the forecast unemployment rate would reach 10 per cent. So who are the real job destroyers here? Without government action, without stimulating the economy there would be 210,000 extra jobs sacrificed on the altar of Liberal ideology and unemployment would reach a rate of 10 per cent. Who are the real job destroyers here? There are 210,000 reasons in this budget why the government is taking action to protect jobs. There are 210,000 extra reasons why this government thinks it is responsible to borrow to protect their jobs. A job is important for these 210,000 people and it is also important for their families. But I tell you what: it is also important for the economy, because those 210,000 people have the skills, the experience and the energy that we need to build a more productive economy, a more competitive economy and a more efficient economy in the world that lies beyond the global recession. That is why what we are doing is the right and appropriate thing. The irony of this, of course, is that, if you were to adopt the Liberal Party's strategy, you would find that we would lose up to 210,000 extra jobs and that the economy would now be in a technical recession. That is what Treasury modelling showed when the national accounts came out. It showed that in the absence of a stimulus to the economy, the economy would now be negative 0.2 per cent for the March quarter and debt would be almost exactly the same. That is the great irony of the proposition that is being put here in an MPI about destroying jobs. Effectively, Liberal Party policy, as espoused by the Leader of the Opposition, is to ensure that 210,000 extra people lose their jobs, that the deficit is almost exactly the same-$275 billion-and of that this economy would go into recession. That is the outcome of Liberal Party policy. I tell you what: those 210,000 people are important. Malcolm Turnbull, the Leader of the Opposition, talks about jobs, jobs, jobs. He says that is the most important priority for the government, and I agree: it is. It is and it should be the priority of this government. That is why the government is building classrooms around the country; it is why it is building roads, why it is building rail, why it is building ports, why it is rolling out broadband. It is why 35,000 different projects are rolling out around the country over the next 12 months. I spoke to a bloke called Kev, who is the builder in my electorate-‘Kev the builder'. He builds hallsMr Tanner-Does he have blond hair?",123
159,Mr CLARE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He doesn't have blond hair! But, I tell you what, he is building halls around the country just like Kevin Rudd is. This is a bloke who told me that building a hall on any given job site would employ 300 to 400 people over the course of the project and that, as a consequence of the government's actions, he has been able to buy a bobcat with the small business tax breaks that we have provided and that two of his apprentices have been able to get their first home through the first home owner boost. That is a small example of the effect of what we are doing. But, of course, there is a multiplier effect because all the products to build the hall have to be bought and all the money that goes in the pockets of those workers and those apprentices means they are spending more money at the petrol station, buying a bunch of flowers for their wife or buying food for their family. But there is a bigger multiplier than that. What many members may not be aware of is that the construction industry actually spends more money on IT in a year than it does on steel and spends more money on legal, accounting and financial services than it does on steel. By building an education revolution, we are building strength into this economy. By building an education revolution, we are effectively permeating the whole economy. We are making sure that we support families, whether they happen to be construction workers or whether they are working in all different sorts of jobs around the country. We are in for some tough times ahead. Unemployment is projected to get to 8½ per cent, and that means that we need to act together. We need to work constructively, and that needs the opposition's support. I would hope that they would support the work that we are doing-support 200,000 jobs-but I do not think that we are going to see much of that. Now that the member for Higgins has left, I would hope that the Leader of the Opposition would start to show some real leadership instead of adopting the policies of the member for HigginsMrs Hull-He hasn't left yet!",125
160,Mr CLARE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Well, he is on his way out the door. Now that he is on his way out the door, we would hope that the Leader of the Opposition would show some real leadership and have some policies of his own. Instead of worrying about his own job, he could start worrying about the jobs of ordinary working Australians.",125
161,Mr HARTSUYKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter of public importance. I note the member for Blaxland's preoccupation with the member for Higgins, the former Treasurer. There is a very stark difference between the contribution that was made by Peter Costello, as Treasurer, and the contribution that is being made by those members opposite. On the former Treasurer's watch our government was focused on putting in place the settings that were going to make this country prosper and grow. Treasurer Costello oversaw one of the strongest economic expansions in this nation's history. On his watch we saw a country that was confident. On his watch we saw incomes grow. On his watch we saw unemployment fall. On his watch we saw a self-assured Australia. I note the comments by Paul Kelly in today's Australian where he said of Peter Costello that Australia avoided three recessions-the Asian financial crisis, the 2002 US recession and the potential recession from the housing boom in the third term of the Howard government. On his watch we saw the implementation of policies that increased the prosperity of this country. On his watch we saw the implementation of policies that increased income, reduced unemployment and gave Australia a bright futurepolicies, I might say, that were opposed every inch of the way by the members opposite. Everything that our government tried to do they opposed every inch of the way. They had to be dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century-and they have not changed much, I might say. They are now in power. When we look at the policy settings of the members opposite and when we look at the impact they are going to have on this nation's prosperity, it very concerning scenario. What is Labor's response to the current challenges that this nation faces? Their first response is to blame everyone but themselves. It is to blame the global financial crisis, to blame the economic lottery that they allegedly inherited. They blame everyone but themselves. Their second response is to implement policies that make this country's situation worse, that reduce economic growth, that reduce prosperity and that adversely impact on employment and opportunity in this country. We have seen their industrial relations agenda. What is their industrial relations agenda going to do? It is quite clear that basically every economist around the world agrees that a more flexible labour relations policy produces better outcomes for employees, for employers and for nations. It produces lower unemployment; it produces higher growth. But what are we seeing from this government? We are seeing a government that want to reregulate the labour market. They want to produce worse outcomes for employees and worse outcomes for employers, in pursuit of Labor dogma. At a time when unemployment is rising, at a time when this country faces great challenges, they are actually going to reduce flexibility in the labour market. The government are increasing regulation. The government are in the process of condemning thousands upon thousands of Australians to the dole queue because they are putting their political agenda ahead of good policy. We see this government paying back its union mates rather than putting in place the policies that this nation needs. There is no more glaring example of this than its decision to put down the industry watchdog. It is not reform of the situation. Let us see it for what it is. This government is basically putting down the industry watchdog step by step. Yes, we see the stage-managed theatre is a of the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister allegedly muscling up to the unions, talking tough, but the cold reality is that in private they are rolling over. They are just towing the line, playing out the script, and at the end of the day they are going to get rid of this watchdog because it is a watchdog that is not a favoured family pet of the Labor Party. It is certainly not a treasured pet and it is one the Labor Party is very keen to put down. When you look at its results, you would have to wonder how anyone could wind back this organisation. Econtech have estimated that the results of the ABCC are an increase in GDP of 1½ per cent and CPI being 1.2 per cent lower than it would otherwise be. The existence of the ABCC would result in real consumption increases of 0.8 per cent and a higher standard of living for the Australian people. What is wrong with that? Why would you change it? Why wouldn't you recognise the fact that the lawless, outrageous behaviour, particularly in Western Australia, of construction unions has been reigned in by this organisation? It has resulted in an economic benefit and one that has helped to set up Australia for the future. We note that the ABCC resulted in improved efficiency in the residential sector of 5.3 per cent and reductions in the cost of housing of three per cent. In the non-residential sector the figures are even more compelling: labour efficiency is up 12.2 per cent and there are reduced costs for business investment. Is that a bad thing for the country? Is that a bad thing? I think not. It may be a bad thing for the vested interests of the building unions, but it is tainly not a bad thing for this country. I would like to move now to what the Labor Party calls award modernisation, which I think is very much a misnomer. Mr Keenan-‘So-called'.",125
162,Mr HARTSUYKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, the ‘so called' modernisation. It is dragging back the very worse features of all the awards ting them in one package that does not seem to benefit anyone. That is what award modernisation is all about. We have the Deputy Prime Minister using this weapon at her disposal to destroy jobs. She claims that no employee will be worse off but that no employer will pay more. The question I have for the Deputy Prime Minister is: how is that going to be achieved? How is no employee going to be worse off and no employer going to be paying more? I am certainly waiting for an explanation. I know the shadow minister for employment is waiting for an explanation. We are yet to hear it. All we hear is incredible silence. This is just another case of the Rudd government economic policy magic pudding. No-one believes it, but the spin masters keep spinning it. I would like to quote a letter I received from industry. This is not this side of the House speaking; it is industry speaking. It is very much a call to members opposite to hear the concerns of industry. BerryExchange, a major employer in my electorate, said: … any increases in labour costs imposed through the modern award will make the industry less competitive against overseas farmers and growers. Their General Manager, Peter MCPherson, goes on to say: Initial data gathered in the sector indicates that these changes will increase labour costs by … 30%. cer- What happened to the Deputy Prime Minister's claim that no employer would pay more? It is going to cost this organisation 30 per cent more in labour costs. He goes on to say: Also given the minimum hourly rate is guaranteed under a modern award, employers will no longer be able to employ certain groups of employees that are currently being paid according to and put- the volume of fruit they pick. Alarmingly, Mr MCPherson goes on to say: … the increase in costs will impact on our decision to invest in the electorate … the existence of our operation at Corindi is under threat. There we have one of the largest private sector employers in my electorate saying that the very existence of their operation is under threat. Here we have a decision by this government which may reduce the viability of a major employer in my electorate to the point where it would close. How does that benefit the economy locally? How does that benefit the economy nationally? We are waiting for an explanation, and all we get is silence. How does a local producer explain to his customers on a Monday that, because he has to pay a 200 per cent labour premium for picking on Sunday, he will no longer have any goods to provide for Monday markets? Does that mean that Monday retail produce markets will be a thing of the past? Does that mean that we will be missing a whole day's productivity purely because of this ridiculous, allegedly modern, award situation? The Pharmacy Guild said: With almost 5,000 community pharmacies in Australia, many of these small businesses will be forced to change the way they operate, especially on weekends and after hours, withdraw some services, and shed jobs in a time of worsening unemployment. The Pharmacy Guild calculates that 1,390 jobs will be lost across the state of New South Wales alone. How does that benefit community health? How does that benefit those employees? It is absolutely outrageous. The Nambucca River Co-Op said: If this award becomes operative it will have a serious and damaging effect on my business. We provide an important service to our local community but we may be unable to do that in the if we are required to pay these large increases. John Cummings, Chairman of NARGA, said: Gillard guaranteed that there would be no disadvantage to the employer or employee under Labor's new laws but how can this be when she has introduced two new penalties. An increase from 20 to 25% for casual employees and an extra 10% penalty after 6 pm and all day Saturday. We have the outrageous situation where this new award is taking Australia down the low road to lower growth, higher unemployment and poorer outcomes for all Australians. All Australians will pay the price for this alleged award modernisation and Labor's industrial relations policy.",127
163,Mr SYMON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is my pleasure to speak on this matter of public importance. It is interesting to hear the member for Cowper talk about flexibility in industrial relations. Flexibility is more than a one-way street, which is what we got with Work Choices-no choice. Labor delivered the Fair Work Act, and that delivers on promises that we took to the people at the last election. We promised to rip up Work Choices if elected with our Forward with Fairness policy statement. We did and, in two weeks time when it finally comes in, working people will be able to have a job with fair pay and fair conditions, and so they should. They will not be ripped off under the rotten Work Choices system, which is what happened year after year, and we still have those stories coming out now. One thing we should be talking about is jobs, employment. What do we hear from the other side about creating employment? We do not hear positive stories about how to create employment. We only hear gloom and doom. We see hands up in the air but there is no actual response-there is no plan or idea. Unlike the opposition, the Rudd government future has put in place economic stimuluses. The point of these is to create jobs in the economy and not just in certain sectors. As the member for Blaxland said, a job in construction flows right through to other areas of the economy where those services are needed. Many people do not even see those jobs on a day-today basis. I would like to go through some of the projects that are out there right now creating real jobs that will have fair pay and fair conditions for workers. The recent federal budget marked the third phase of the Rudd government's stimulus plan, investing $22 billion in our nation's infrastructure. That is on top of the $28 billion of investment in infrastructure in the economic security plan of February. That comes on top of further investment in last year's Economic Security Strategy. There is the energy efficiency program, where householders can install insulation in their houses if they do not already have it. That is an Australia wide program. It is enormous. So many households that do not have insulation now will be able to have it. There will be $1,600 worth going into their roof. How does it get into their roof? People come out to their house and install it. These are real jobs and they are ongoing because this is going to run for a number of years. With that, you have to manufacture insulation. What do we hear from Bradford? Bradford in Brisbane are working 24 hours round the clock now to try to keep up with demand. They have put on another 70 staff. So far only 27 houses up to the end of last month have actually had insulation installed. There is a huge number to go beyond that. Let us have a look at infrastructure in terms of road and rail and the number of jobs that that can create and is creating right We have work on the Geelong Ring Road in my state of Victoria, worth $125 million and 60 construction jobs. There is work happening on the final stage of the F5 Freeway upgrade in Campbelltown, New South Wales. That is starting very soon and is worth 130 full-time jobs and 70 part-time jobs. We have construction on the Alstonville bypass which is happening now, with 140 jobs. The Brighton bypass and transport hub means 380 jobs. And the Mandurah Entrance Road has 80 jobs on-site and more supported off-site. And then there is rail. We hear a little bit about rail these days because the Rudd federal government is investing in rail-not just in interstate freight rail but in urban public transport as well. That has not happened from the federal government level in a very long time. More than 200 jobs have been supported by the increased demand for concrete rail sleepers by the Australian government's $1.2 billion interstate rail network program. Fifty people are employed at Austrak's Geelong factory, more than 65 at their Wagga Wagga factory. Sixty people are employed at Rocla Sleepers Mittagong factory and another 60 or so are employed at Rocla Sleepers in Grafton. Talking about rail, right in the middle of my electorate is a road and rail project happening right now. That of course is the Springvale Road underpass. That is a $140 million project to relieve a huge bottleneck through the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Like most grade separation projects, it takes a lot of planning, it takes a lot of work to get it done and it employs a lot of labour whilst it is happening. This job has already started. You can go down there today and you can see people working on the job. They were not there a month ago. The thing about this particular project is that those opposite tried to block this project only last week when now. they tried to amend the nation-building and jobs program. They did not manage it, fortunately because the 100 people that will soon be working on that project might otherwise not have actually been employed. The most astounding thing about this is that those opposite actually campaigned for this project for years on end. They did not deliver it and then when the money came through they tried to put it down. That is typical of what we hear from the other side time after time. Many people over there do not understand infrastructure. I am certain of that. We hear it time after time, day after day. Social housing is another one of our programs under the economic stimulus which is employing people right now, and that is a wonderful thing. In my own particular electorate of Deakin there are 66 houses under the maintenance program that are happening right now. When you go out and visit them and you talk to the tradesmen who are out there, the builders and their teams of people they have doing it, they tell you, ‘We've had to put on extra people because of the demand.' This is a very good thing. It is not just maintenance. It is also building of new houses-20,000 across the country. That is a program that is estimated to create 15,000 jobs over the next two years. Defence housing is another one. My electorate does not have any defence housing, but many others do, and at the moment work is underway on 233 defence houses-brand new ones. Three hundred and forty-seven contracts have been awarded, and the contract for the 400th house is expected to be awarded around now. My favourite part of the stimulus package, because I know how much those on the other side do not like talking about it, is the Buildwith ing the Education Revolution. We have the National School Pride Program which is rolling out right now, which is employing people not only in my electorate but in the electorates of those opposite as well. It is a wonderful thing for their local economies, and a wonderful thing for Australia's economy, that people are out there working. That is a great thing. As part of the stimulus, employers like Spotless Group recruited 40 full-time positions and now have 569 workers, including apprentices, working on school and housing maintenance projects under the stimulus in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and here in the ACT. The school maintenance program, the National School Pride Program, is one thing, but of course to me the enduring thing about Building the Education Revolution is the infrastructure build which is known as Primary Schools for the 21st Century. They are substantial jobs. They are long-term. They will take up to a year-in some cases more-to be built. And they are, again, in every electorate. These are real jobs. Some are just at the starting stage. Some have still got their applications in. In my electorate of Deakin alone so far there is $39 million invested in jobs, projects, and infrastructure our local schools. These are schools that have not had money put into them by those opposite. They have been left alone year after year. Why is that? They just do not care about it. When it comes to the House they vote against it. Creating jobs is something that those opposite like to talk about, but creating jobs is not something that those opposite actually do. They do not have any positive things to say about the subject. They cannot understand why investment and why stimulus are actually connected to jobs. It is about time that those opposite woke up and actually understood that they are.",128
164,Mr BRIGGS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is great pleasure that I rise to speak on this very important matter of public importance proposed by the member for Stirling, who is doing an excellent job at exposing the flawed policies being pursued by the Deputy Prime Minister, who is the part-time minister for industrial relations also. The matter of public importance-and I have just had to check, following the member for Deakin's speechis about the job-destroying nature of the government's industrial relations changes. It appears that the member for Deakin might have grabbed the wrong speech on the way in as he has talked about the stimulus package for the whole time, which is a surprise, given the member for Deakin's history as an ETU official. He did spend yesterday, as I understand, in the caucus. A good Labor colleague over there contacted me yesterday and mentioned that during the Labor caucus meeting, which went for some three hours yesterday, there were a couple of items on the agenda. The first one was the ABCC changes, the backdown on the ABCC the Deputy Prime Minister is instigating. The second item was the briefing on the most important matter we are facing in the history of the world, according to those on the other side-climate change. for They did not quite get to the matter of climate change, as I understand it. They had three hours of blood-letting about union power. We know what drives those on the other side. We know what will always drive those on the other side and it is union power. So it did strike me as passing strange that member for Deakin, a former ETU official, very well associated with Dean Mile and Kevin Harkins, was not able to address the terms of the MPI which is: The job destroying nature of the Government's industrial relations changes. They are job destroying. We will talk about two",130
165,Mr BRIGGS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We do not know that actually, Member for Moreton. We understand there was some quite aggressive discussion. I do not know where the member for Deakin ended up. I know the member for Moreton would have been with the Deputy Prime Minister. He is tactically smart. Where the member for Deakin ended up, I do not know. I suspect he was against where they were going with it, but I was not there, obviously. I will have to check with my Labor source. Back on the matter of public importance, the member for Stirling is right in saying this government has engaged in the biggest re-regulation of Australia's labour market in the history of our country. What it has done is wind back the economic reform cycle, which is disappointing, particularly coming from the member for Blaxland, who follows a great reformer. Two members ago, the then member for Blaxland did instigate some great economic reforms in this country. I will pay him credit for that. Some of them were labour market reforms. In fact, in 1993 he did make very small steps to move away from the centralised award system to the enterprise bargaining system. So it is disappointing that the new member for Blaxland-a former senior advisor to Bob Carr from the failed state of New South Waleswould participate in backing away from such important reforms. The member for Blaxland mentioned the award modernisation issue, which has just the turned into a complete debacle. The Deputy Prime Minister would have known it would be a complete debacle because this report, done in 2006 in her department, tells her that if you go ahead and say that you will not make employees and employers worse off it will end up as a disaster; it will destroy jobs. It says it in the report. But what did she go and do? She goes and issues an instruction to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission which says that neither employers nor employees shall be worse off. It says very clearly in here that, if you do that, you will destroy jobs. So there is the Deputy Prime Minister not thinking it through and playing, as she has to, to her union mates in the Labor Party. She ‘has to' because they ran the biggest scare campaign in the history of this country to get the Labor Party elected. She has to play this game of implementing the reforms that the unions want. The member for Blaxland quoted the ACCI in talking about award modernisation. that Let me put something else on the record from ACCI from 11 June 2009: The Government's award modernisation process should not come at the expense of increasing employers' costs or introducing new or additional inflexibilities. If it does, the Government should have no hesitation in directing the tribunal to have another go. ‘Have another go' is exactly what the Deputy Prime Minister should do, but she is too stubborn. She has got this wrong. She is going to cost jobs. The reforms that these people are implementing are going to make a lot of Australians worse off. The one thing we did not see in the introduction of their reregulation bills, the union sponsored bills, was an analysis of how many jobs would be created-because they will not create jobs. This is not a policy to create jobs. This is a policy to protect the jobs of those- (Time expired)  Whilst I would like to congratulate the member for Blaxland on his promotion, I do need to correct him on something that he stated in his speech on this matter of public importance. He incorrectly stated that the member for Mayo was like Dr Frankenstein in trying to resurrect the Work Choices monster. I think the member for Mayo is more like Mary Shelley, the author of the process rather than the actual character in it. When it comes to matters of public importance in this House, the issue of job creation and jobs is about as important as they come. We know that on this side of the House. That is why we are investing $30 billion in our nation building for recovery plan. We care about infrastructure. We care about making sure that every dollar we spend goes into ports, road and rail, education, social housing construction, energy efficiency and a national broadband network so that every dollar is supporting Australian jobs. Every stimulus dollar is targeted to create new jobs and protect existing jobs. More importantly, in a way, for small business-that area that the Liberal Party has deserted-we make sure that every tax break and every cash flow initiative helps keep those small businesses afloat. As a result of the government's stimulus package, 35,000 construction sites are emerging around Australia. Those 35,000 construction sites are emerging in every electorate, in every community, in Labor electorates, in Liberal electorates, in National electrates torates and in Independent electorates. Each and every one of them is emerging without fear or favour and with allocations based on policy, not polls, unlike the former policies of those opposite-the ‘Investing in our Flagpoles,' regional rorts and all those dodgy practices. All the way along what have the opposition said? They have opposed everything. They said no. For the benefit of those multicultural listeners, they said ‘nyet', they said ‘non', they said ‘lo', they said ‘la', they said ‘tidak', they said ‘nein', they said ‘okhi'-they said no to everything when it came to creating jobs. That is all they said. What did they turn to? Hypocrisy and trickery, that is all. This is the same opposition who voted against the stimulus and the jobs plan, the same opposition that voted down the Rudd government's job-protecting Australian Business Investment Partnership. The opposition's decision leaves commercial property developers and their employees in the lurch amidst an atmosphere of foreign commercial banks withdrawing from Australia. We understand the situation the world is in today, where foreign capital has unfortunately scuttled back to its home base in some places. But are we talking about the top end of town? No. We are talking about people like plumbers, carpenters, plasterers, crane drivers-all these sorts of people who have suffered because of this. Their jobs have been put in peril by those opposite. Maybe the Leader of the Opposition was a bit drunk on the news of the member for Higgins's impending retirement, or maybe now that his job is secure the Leader of the Opposition no longer cares about the jobs of other Australians. Either way, the Hon. Malcolm Bligh Turnbull must take full responsibility for failing to protect Australian jobs. As a result of the global economic fallout, unemployment is forecast to rise, yet the Leader of the Opposition consistently opposes and frusgovernment efforts to support the Australian economy. This sort of dole queue schadenfreude is unforgivable. The government's stimulus is expected to support more than 200,000 jobs and reduce the peak in the unemployment by 1½ percentage points from what it would otherwise have been. We are talking about real people being helped; real misery being averted. The government knows that, sadly, many Australians will lose their jobs as a result of this global financial crisis, so we are putting money into training places. We have a plan, and we are sick and tired of the negative opportunism, whingeing and carping coming from those opposite. I am not normally a fan of the Darth Vader school of performance management, but the Leader of the Opposition obviously needed to do something in the coalition party room-to grab that rabble and do something. Now that the lame-duck status of the member for Higgins has been downgraded, he has an opportunity to show some leadership. It is time he stopped whingeing and got on board with the government's efforts to support Australian businesses and to keep Australians working. He needs to show that he is fair dinkum about supporting jobs. (Time expired)",131

169,Mr HOCKEY,TERRITORY BORROWING,"I stand on behalf of the coalition to indicate our support for this legislation and also indicate that we will at the appropriate time be moving an amendment, which I will talk about a bit later. The Guarantee of State and Territory Borrowing Appropriation Bill 2009 provides for a standing appropriation to pay for any future claims should any state or territory government default on loans that are guaranteed by the Australian government's guarantee of state and territory borrowing. Money is to be appropriated from the consolidated fund and if there is insufficient money in the fund then the bill provides authority for the Commonwealth to borrow money to pay claims to creditors. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would hope that there is going to be a default in very, very unlikely circumstances. Therefore, this bill is more procedural in that it provides substance to the guarantee which has already been announced by the government and which the market is already, I might say, pricing into the issuance of government bonds. Even though state governments have declared that they will access the government guarantee, it is my understanding that the guarantee has no effect until this bill is passed, because there would be no standing appropriation for that guarantee. But the fact of the matter is that the market, quite understandably and appropriately, is pricing into the cost of semi-government issuance a AAA federal government guarantee. It is estimated the states will increase borrowings from the existing $100 billion outstanding to $160 billion in the next three years. At this stage, I understand, only New South Wales has indicated they will be using the Commonwealth guarantee, although I do recollect that Queensland announced it would be doing so yesterday. The pricing of the guarantee is an issue that we are in dispute with the government about. This bill of course makes no provision for specific pricing of the guarantee, but currently the pricing of the guarantee is 15 basis points for AAA rated issuance and 20 basis points for AAplus on existing loans, and 30 basis points for AAA and 35 basis points for AA-plus on new issuance. So there is only a small spread of five basis points between AAA and AAplus, which was a massive concession by this government to the Queensland government, which has had its rating downgraded. Now, the problem, as we stated at the time, is that there is not sufficient incentive for the state governments to do everything they can to preserve their AAA rating if there is not a sufficient penalty involved in the difference between having a rating of AAA and one of AA-plus. I outlined that in a press release issued on 25 March 2009, where I noted: The price for less than a AAA issuance provides no incentive for States to exercise fiscal discipline, that is that States can spend all they want, lose their AAA credit rating and it costs them far less than what the market is charging. Having said that, New South Wales yesterday had Moody's reaffirm its AAA rating, but Standard and Poor's expressed some level of concern about the state of New South Wales's budget-and in Australia S and P are seen as a more diligent and credible rating agency than Moody's, for a number of reasons. The interesting thing is that New South Wales won the support of Moody's because they were not taking their their budget into as substantial a deficit as had been expected. One of reasons for that is quite clear when you start to delve through the detail of state budgets: the windfall payments from the federal government are propping up state Labor budgets, and the net impact is that the states are in fact in some cases reducing and/or replacing their own capital expenditure with the money that is provided by the Commonwealth. That should be alarming in itself, but it also devalues the stimulatory impact of Commonwealth government expenditure because it simply substitutes state government expenditure with Commonwealth expenditure. The interesting thing is that it is the states that have traditionally always carried, and still do carry, the great bulk of infrastructure expenditure in Australia, as is appropriate. Roads, public transport, schools and hospitals are all, in the main, run by state governments. Therefore, not only new capital works programs and the integration of those capital works programs into existing infrastructure but also, significantly, the maintenance of those capital works programs are very much the domain of state governments. Given all of that, it is quite clear that the Australian government instituted a wholesale funding guarantee, when it introduced a guarantee of deposits in authorised deposit-taking institutions, that had a profound distortional impact on financial markets. And a lot of the pain at that particular time was felt by state governments in the semi-government market, where not only were they finding it difficult to price new issuance but it was also very hard to get away any new state government issuance. The net result was that the semi-government market dried up, or became illiquid. By becoming illiquid, it became a roadblock to the ongoing funding needs of the states. States, I might add, have traditionally run deficit budgets, primarily because they have those massive capital expenditure items on their balance sheets. It was arguably the Greiner government of New South Waleswhich not only reorganised the state budget but also changed the rules governing accounting procedures for state budgets-that for the first time started to run surplus budgets. In running surplus budgets, it managed to not only pay off state government debt but importantly reduce state liability, and the most profound way of doing that was through the sale of the State Bank of New South Wales. Obviously, there were also the sales of the State Bank of Victoria and latterly in South Australia. The Queensland government never quite had a state bank, although it had a shareholding interest in a financial institution. Western Australia has its own unique circumstances with the fabulous WA Inc.! That actually reminds me of the debate that we had in question time today, where the Prime Minister was asked about Labor's experience with banks and, naturally enough, refused to answer the question, because it is not an experience that perhaps the Prime Minister would willingly want to recall-the when State Bank of Victoria with its investment banking arm, Tricontinental; the State Bank of South Australia with its finance arm, Beneficial Finance; and WA Inc. and the very colourful relationship between state Labor and Rothwell's and Laurie Connell and some of the grand old names from the past that Minister Snowdon at the table would be well familiar with. In so many of those banking failures-and it was a very long time between those banking failures and previous banking failures where it was necessary to separate out the bad banks and the bad loans-much of the bad debt that became a massive burden for taxpayers in those states was linked to commercial property. This was most spectacularly seen in the case of the State Bank of South Australia. Despite expressed provisions of legislation in the parliament that prevented the State Bank of South Australia lending money against real estate outside of South Australia, through Beneficial Finance and through activities in New Zealand-from memory-the State Bank of South Australia engaged in one of the most audacious and free-wheeling loans of public moneys to property developers and commercial property owners that had ever occurred in Australia. That is a bold statement but it is real. I recall state treasury officials from South Australia coming to visit the New South Wales Treasury and asking us, ‘How do you separate out the bad bank from the good bank in South Australia?' We pointed out, correctly, that in New South Wales we had done everything we could to avoid going down that path, because of the massive impact on public confidence-as witnessed with the State Bank of Victoria issues and the separation of a good bank and bad bank. We emphasised that it depended on how big the bad bank was. I hope my memory is not failing me, but in the case of the State Bank of South Australia, which had around $19 billion of assets at that time, we were advised in absolute confidence that $13 billion was impaired. I suppose I have broken that confidence today but the passage of time maybe allows me to do this. Someone pointed out to me some years later that at one stage South Australia had the very best finances of any state in Australia. A premier who attended some of the premiers conferences in the mid-eighties reflected on that and said, ‘When you look at the balance sheets of all the states, South Australia was the most robust and fiscally the best managed state in Australia.' It went from being fiscally the best managed state in Australia to being a state with such an impaired balance sheet, with the collapse of the State Bank of South Australia and Beneficial Finance, that it was second only to Tasmania in diminution over the years. It was simply unforgivable for the people of South Australia. It ripped the heart out of the commercial sector of South Australia, and it denied a generation of South Australians the opportunity to live in South Australia and to compete with other parts of Australia, if not the rest of the world, in commerce. I was a commercial lawyer in a law firm that was, in part, responsible for mopping up Tricontinental, and I just marvel at the risks people were prepared to take with taxpayers' money. It was horrific. The deals were so complicated, running through so many offshore jurisdictions. They were so on-theedge, and it was taxpayers' money. The taxpayers were from Victoria in that case but this also applies to the taxpayers of South Australia. It was so risky. If the taxpayers of those states had fully understood the real impact of what their state banks were doing, they would have taken the decision that the former Premier of New South Wales Nick Greiner-and, after him, John Fahey-took, to his great credit, not only to privatise the State Bank of New South Wales but, significantly, to prevent it from opening up an investment arm. At this juncture, I want to pay tribute to John ONEILL, who was the Chief Executive of the State Bank of New South Wales-an A-grade banker, a damn good bloke and a good mate of mine. After identifying the risks to the balance sheets of New South Wales and the State Bank of New South Wales, John got the bank into a reasonable shape to allow it to be privatised. The irony is that, when we privatised GIO, we thought GIO was a more robust asset. It therefore had an initial public offering which was spectacularly successful and, in fact, massively broadened the insurance index of the Stock Exchange. At that time, QBE was really the only listed insurer. Again, I want to place on the record that Nick Greiner determinedly said that state taxpayers should not be involved with reinsurance. I do recall a vigorous conversation between Nick Greiner and Bill Jocelyn, the general manager of GIO at that time. Nick Greiner said: ‘If you do not get out of reinsurance, we will sell you. It is not something for the taxpayers of New South Wales to be involved with.' There was a heated argument between the two of them and Nick Greiner turned to me and said, ‘Get rid of it; sell it.' And thank God for the taxpayers of New South Wales that we did. We well recall AMP buying GIO and making a hash of that. In the end, GIO still remains an appropriately trusted brand for general insurance, but GIO Australia Holdings Ltd obviously no longer exists as a standalone entity because the reinsurance arm imploded-as it would. Why should taxpayers get involved in this sort of activity? It is this fear that has driven us on our vote in opposition to Ruddbank. We opposed Ruddbank because it is bad policy. We opposed Ruddbank because we look at what has happened in the past when Labor has been involved with financial institutions and commercial property and we say, ‘We will not allow that to happen again-no more taxpayers' money to be directly involved in individual commercial projects.' We will not support that. We cannot support that. It is bad policy. Quite frankly, there are better ways to do it if it is about helping commercial property-not in holding up values but in significantly preventing massive distortions in the market. We will talk a little about that at a future time. It is so important to have transparency in all of these financial dealings. Whether it be in relation to car financing programs, there must be transparency and accountability. Whether it be in relation to commercial property and Ruddbank, there must be total transparency and accountability. In relation to the use of the government guarantee, there must be total transparency and accountability. Day after day I am asking the Treasurer to explain to the Australian people exactly what the liability is of the taxpayers under all the guarantees and the financing requirements of the associated entities. On one occasion the Treasurer said, ‘You do not want to add it up; no-one adds it up.' I will tell who adds it up-the taxpayers of Australia add it up because ultimately they are on the hook for that amount of money. If it is a guarantee that delivers a contingent liability that cannot be quantified, then quantify it. Give us a number that would allow the Australian taxpayers to fully recognise that they are providing a guarantee to private sector interests of half a trillion dollars or a trillion dollars. Tell us and the Australian people what the number is. The total liability of the states remains unquantifiable. One of the reasons we have taken a different attitude to this compared with other initiatives of the government is that this is ultimately the same taxpayer. If New South Wales defaults and if Victoria defaults, the taxpayers of those states are ultimately taxpayers of Australia; therefore, there is unquestionably a common interest that supports this bill. I will be moving an amendment at the appropriate moment. The amendment will allow for the establishment of a register of government borrowings. I think this is very important for a number of reasons. It may not have been necessary to have a register of government borrowings when $55 billion was an issue-which is about the average from the Australian government over the last 10 years. We are now going down the path of $315 billion on issue. It is quite clear that with the semigovernments involved-that is, the state government issuance-there may well be at least an extra $160 billion. Australia should follow the lead of other countries, particularly the United States, and have a full disclosure of who the major lenders are to the Australian people. Some people in the markets will say, ‘Well, that is pretty complicated; these things are traded all the time.' So are shares. From the minister at the table to the backbenchers around the place, every member of parliament is required to disclose whether they you own shares. There are registers that are run by companies of their shareholders and the general public can go and check who the shareholders are. There is full disclosure in relation to millions of shareholders who own shares in Australia. But perhaps hundreds and maybe even thousands of major entities that own Australian government bonds are not currently required to have their details disclosed. I did go on a mission to try to find out. I asked the Australian Office of Financial Management. I must say that they were quite unhelpful. Given that the government keeps seeking bipartisan support, the AOFM were rather unhelpful. They said that they did not know, only that they had a suspicion about who owned Australian government bonds. But they did point out that the Australian Bureau of Statistics collects data. It goes to the custodians, of which there appear to be just six, and it conducts a survey. When I asked the Deputy Chief Statistician why the Australian Bureau of Statistics could not disclose the domicile of the ultimate holders, he said it would be too revealing and that they would therefore not be able to collect the data. I asked whether they could disclose it by country, and he said no. I asked whether he could disclose it by regions, to which he replied, ‘I'll get back to you.' I never heard back. This is meant to be the independent Australian Bureau of Statistics, of which I have previously had ministerial carriage. I have always held them in high regard, but I think they should be better than that. I would have thought they were more independent than that. I do not know what is going on. I rang a number of individual banks and asked, ‘Would you disclose the countries from which the ultimate buyers of the bonds come from?' They said, ‘We can't disclose them because perhaps it is the case that individual banks represent particular countries.' That is why it is all the more important for our nation and in our economic and political interests to find out who is the major holder of Australian government bonds. Is it the Chinese government? Is it major superannuation or fund management arms from Japan? Is it countries that have investment vehicles domiciled in Bermuda? Or is it just general investors from the United Kingdom? We need to find out. There is a political issue here. In the last 12 months, we saw the Chinese government-naturally and understandablyexpress very significant concern about the risk of their massive investment in the United States, particularly in US sovereign bonds. There is a risk not only to Chinese wealth of devaluation of the US dollar but also to Australians if those bonds become far more expensive or are mispriced in the interests and protection of the Chinese investors. Let us find out. What we do know is this: by the admission of the Treasurer in this place, more than 65 per cent of all Australian government bonds are borrowed by people and interests offshore. That is consistent, because Australia is a net importer of capital. My concern is that we are now doing it on a scale that Australia has not done before. I imagine that, if you go back to World War II, a lot of those bonds were bought by the Australian public in support of the war effort. It is a different equation now. We are borrowing on a scale that we have never borrowed on. It is not the private sector at risk but the taxpayers, particularly if the buyers are governments offshore. In the interests of transparency, in the interests of the nation and in the interests of taxpayers, we need to know who is lending all this money to the Australian government. I do not think there is any underlying inappropriate investor. I have no reason to believe that is the case, but there is a mutual interest here. The government may well use its numbers to defeat the amendment in this place, but I hope that it will be engaging in the debate on the amendment in the Senate, because common sense must prevail. This is in the national interest, as is our goodwill in supporting this bill.",133
170,Mr ZAPPIA,TERRITORY BORROWING,"I rise to speak in support of the Guarantee of State and Territory Borrowing Appropriation Bill 2009. I welcome the comments by the member for North Sydney. The opposition will be supporting this bill, albeit that there will be some amendments proposed. I am sure that the Treasurer will respond to those amendments in due course. We live in a period in which we are faced with the greatest economic downturn that any of us have probably seen in our lifetimes and certainly known since the Great Depression of the 1930s. We have seen something like eight of Australia's top 10 trading partners already go into recession. We have seen over 30 banks around the world either collapse or require governments to bail them out. In the last quarter, we saw almost all other OECD countries report a negative growth in their gross domestic product figures. We have seen just about all other OECD countries go into deficit in order to support their budgets and sustain their economies. The story is very clear, and it is one that is well understood by members on this side of the House, although I am not sure that it is so well understood by members opposite because they never seem to acknowledge the fact that we are going through a global economic downturn. This is an appropriate measure for the Commonwealth government to take in light of the global financial crisis and the constrained liquidity in semi-government bond markets. Under this measure, the Commonwealth will be guaranteeing state and territory borrowings under a deed of guarantee. The member for North Sydney quite rightly pointed out that the states and territories most infrastructure projects. The funds that will be borrowed under this measure will essentially be used for state and territory governments to raise funds for infrastructure projects for which they are responsible and which will be critical to Australia's recovery from the economic downturn and critical to supporting jobs around the country. They are funds that will be critical to building the foundations of a much more productive Australian economy. I said a moment ago that governments around the world have increased government spending and in doing so have entered into considerable debt in order to offset the downturn in private sector spending throughout the world. But even governments trying to raise funds are faced with tighter financial markets and even governments have to compete for whatever funds are available on the global market. The Commonwealth guarantee provisions contained within this measure will provide greater access to finance for state and territory governments, who as we know have far less capacity to raise funds than does the federal government. This bill has two main purposes. The first is to provide an appropriation to enable the Commonwealth to pay any claim made as a result of the Commonwealth's guarantee of state or territory borrowings. The second purpose is to enable the Commonwealth to borrow funds to meet any shortfall of funds in the consolidated revenue required to meet a guarantee if required. While it is right to provide this guarantee, it is highly unlikely that the guarantee will ever be called in. In reality, this measure creates minimal risk to the Commonwealth while providing a major boost to state and territory borrowing capacities. I will again repeat something that the member for North Sydney said, because again I entirely agree with him: ultimately, the state and territory governments are manfund aging affairs on behalf of the same Australian taxpayers as the Commonwealth government does. The Rudd government has at a national level acted quickly and decisively to cushion the Australian economy from the global economic downturn. We have done that through a $10.4 billion stimulus package in December and another $42 billion stimulus package earlier this year as well as through additional stimulus measures in the May budget, including a $22 billion nation-building infrastructure plan for Australia, the single biggest investment in nation-building infrastructure that the Commonwealth government has ever made in this country. But we have also done that by guaranteeing the bank deposits and bank wholesale funding. In his comments earlier on, the member for North Sydney made reference to the bank guarantees and suggested that they distorted the markets. What the bank guarantees didand there is no denying this-was stabilise the financial markets here in Australia. They also enable Australian banks to source funds on the global financial markets. The evidence for them being able to do that is very clear. As a result of them having done that, they were able to use those funds to support the Australian economy and in doing so support Australian jobs. We can criticise that if we want to. But the reality is that that was a measure that was needed, and it had the desired effect. The evidence is there for all to see. One of the outcomes from having done that, along with all of the other stimulus measures that the government has introduced, is that around the country around 35,000 construction sites are now underway. Those construction sites are supporting jobs for Australian people right across the country. We can perhaps disagree about the figures, but the reality is that on best estimates we are talking about in the order of 200,000 jobs across the country being supported as a result of the Rudd government's economic intervention during this economic downturn. While we are supporting those jobs we are doing two other things that are critical to country. We are investing in nation-building infrastructure, which had been neglected for years and certainly neglected by the previous coalition government. We are also investing in the future of this country by lifting the productivity of this nation. If we invest in infrastructure and if the states invest in infrastructure and we have to guarantee their borrowings, it is my view that that is the reasonable thing to do. Ultimately, there will be some tangible assets and some tangible productivity growth that will justify whatever level of risk might be attached to these measures. The Rudd government's national infrastructure investments will be complemented by state, territory and local government infrastructure spending. If you look at the $22 billion that the Rudd government is investing in nation-building infrastructure, much of that will be invested on the basis that there will be supporting funds from state, territory and local governments. Therefore, it is in the national interest to ensure that the projects that have been initiated by the federal government proceed. For that to happen, the states, the territories and local government may well have to also borrow. Assisting them with that borrowing is the right thing to do. From my observations, the state and territory governments are in fact not shirking their responsibilities on this matter and are doing the right thing by taking out the necessary borrowings in order to ensure that they can commit to their fair share of the funding for these major infrastructure projects. I was Mayor of the City of Salisbury and someone who was very much involved in local government-including in South Australia, having been an executive member of local government-and someone very much involved in discussions on local government managing its affairs. There was an inquiry this carried out about three or four years ago in South Australia on behalf of the local government sector. At the end of the inquiry, there was a very strong recommendation that local governments across Australia had the capacity to and should increase their borrowings in order to fund the necessary infrastructure shortfall that local governments were responsible for. It is interesting to note that many local governments across Australia have operated on borrowed funds for years. Yet there has never been a problem with that being done. But as soon as state or federal governments start borrowing and end up with deficit budgets, there is something wrong with it-at least if you listen to members opposite. If it is wrong for federal and state governments I would have thought it would be wrong for local governments. Yet we not only had independent advice to say that local governments ought to borrow but, if I recall correctly, we also had similar comments being made by ministers at both state and federal level at the time. There are two key benefits resulting from this guarantee of the borrowings of state and territory governments. The first is that the states and territories will be able to access funds for those important infrastructure projects that I referred to earlier-funds which they might not otherwise have been able to access. The second is that because of the Commonwealth government's guarantee they will be able to access those funds at a much better rate. If they can do that, there has to some real benefit to the taxpayers of Australia, for whom the states and territories govern. Firstly, if you can access the funds at much better rates it means that your net debt position will be lower. Secondly, if you are able to save money, you can use it for other purposes, again to benefit the people whom you represent. So it makes absolute senseand it makes good sense-for the Commonwealth to enable the states to access those funds and to access them at a better rate. Until the latter part of the last century-I believe it was in the 1990s-the Commonwealth government because of its greater borrowing capacity would borrow on behalf of the states. Then that practice ceased, to be replaced with states undertaking their own borrowings and establishing their own borrowing authorities. There was some sense in that. It enabled the states to source funds on the global markets as they saw fit without being constrained in any way by the Commonwealth. The option to this particular proposal could well have been to reintroduce the proposition whereby the Commonwealth borrows on behalf of the states. It is my view, however, that it is better for the Commonwealth to guarantee the borrowings than to borrow on behalf of the states because doing so ensures that the states and territories are still essentially responsible for their borrowings and accountable for them in every sense of the word. At the same time, it allows the states and territories the flexibility and freedom to use their respective finance authorities to source the funds that they require. It serves the purpose of the states and it serves the purpose of the Commonwealth. This measure to guarantee the borrowings of the states and the territories is somewhat similar to the bank wholesale funding guarantee provided to the banks by the Rudd government. It is a similar proposition-you be provide the guarantee to the banks and allow them to access funds. You do the same for the states-you allow them to access funds. The measure also complements the government's Australian Business Investment Partnership proposal, which the member for North Sydney also talked about. What the member for North Sydney did not say when he spoke about that proposal is that it is not purely a government proposition but a proposal whereby the four major banks will be putting funds on the table in order to create the funding facility required. The four major banks will also have a say in whether that funding is in fact loaned out. It is a proposianteeing tion that is needed across this country at the moment, because we do face unusual circumstances. The decision by the opposition not to support the Australian Business Investment Partnership proposition is, as was pointed out today in question time, a betrayal of so many of the small businesses in this country and so many of the Australian families that were depending on those small businesses for their employment. Mr Deputy Speaker, as a fellow South Australian, you may well know that there are over $1 billion in construction projects that have been put on hold in recent months as a result of companies being unable to source the funding to proceed with those projects. A billion dollars worth of projects would sustain a lot of jobs, and that is only in South Australia. Across the country, I am sure it would run into tens of billions of dollars. In fact, we know that the commercial property sector in Australia employs about 150,000 people and has debts totalling around $165 billion, of which about $30 billion is sourced from overseas banks. They now need support in accessing that $30 billion. Through the Australian Business Investment Partnership, they might have been able to do that.  Secker)-I remind the member for Makin that we are debating the Guarantee of State and Territory Borrowing Appropriation Bill 2009, not the bill that was defeated in the Senate last night.",139
171,Mr ZAPPIA,TERRITORY BORROWING,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for your ruling. I was simply responding to comments made by the member for North Sydney in his address to the chamber just prior to mine where he went to great lengths to speak about the Australian Business Investment Partnership Bill. I also draw the parallel between this bill and that proposition. I simply make the point that in guarfunding for the states I see a very strong parallel with the Australian Business Investment Partnership Bill, yet the opposition comes into this chamber and says that it will support one measure but not the other. I believe that the opposition is doing the Australian community a great disservice by not supporting the Australian Business Investment Partnership Bill and I know for a fact that there are jobs that would have been created as a result of that measure having gone through. We have certainly seen some real changes in the Australian financial systems since Federation in 1901. Things have moved a great deal since the Australian Constitution came into being. As a result of that, the Commonwealth has a much greater capacity to raise taxes and to raise revenue than have the states. We have seen in recent times a reduction in GST revenue, and this will be faced by the states as a result of the downturn in economic activity across the country. Similarly, a reduction of $210 billion in federal government revenue is predicted to occur over the next few years. However, even prior to the economic downturn it was clear that the states were having difficulty funding all their responsibilities. One of the reasons for that was that in the previous 12 years of the coalition government we saw a substantial reduction in funds to the states under the Commonwealthstate funding agreements. We saw about $1 billion cut from health and about $1 billion cut from housing during that period alone. For all those reasons, states were having difficulty through their own taxation systems raising the finances that they require in order to operate their governments. Not surprisingly, therefore, they will need to rely on overseas borrowings. If they have to rely on those overseas borrowings, it is my view that the Commonwealth should provide whatever assistance it can in order to ensure that those borrowings are sourced at the best possible rates in terms of both fees and interest. I will finish on this note. The member for North Sydney spoke about the fees that are being charged by the Commonwealth to guarantee these funds. He said that you should not need to use the fees in order to control the behaviour of the states-or words to that effect. I would have thought that there are much more powerful forces that would have controlled the behaviour of the state governments, whether Labor or Liberal, than the use of the fees. I commend the bill to the House. (Time expired)",142
172,Mr TUCKEY,TERRITORY BORROWING,"I take a great interest in this particular legislawhen tion for all the implications that it has as government goes on with its socialist agenda, some of which even the minor parties in the Senate are not prepared to agree to. I will speak more about that later in this speech. The Guarantee of State and Territory Borrowing Appropriation Bill 2009 is an appropriation bill. It is before the House because a government cannot give a guarantee for a debt without the approval of the parliament to expend the funds to pay out in the case of default. The arrogance of this government was such that it had become so used to writing cheques with a fork that it just decided to save the states. I will come back to why it has had to do that, but the reality is that it took the Leader of the Opposition, with his huge past experience in the world of finance, to say: ‘Hang on. Who's going to lend you, the government, money or lend on your guarantee when you have made no provision to pay if the debt is not repaid by the relevant entity?' It just shows the misunderstanding. As I think I have said in this place before, my mother's favourite saying was, ‘Put a beggar on horseback and he'll ride to the devil.' Of course, a mob of beggars got themselves elected to this place and they are off on the road to the devil because they have never seen so much money in all their lives. Anyway, on the advice of the Leader of the Opposition, the government has come to the decision that it needs the approval of this parliament to back this guarantee with real money. In his second reading speech, the minister went as far as to say, ‘If this dreadful and probably unlikely event occurs, we might also need the right to borrow the money to pay out on the debt.' Of course, in commerce it is known as a contingent liability. I strongly endorse the press release of our shadow Treasurer, in which he said that, this bill reaches the Senate, where justhis tice does not reside in the numbers, the opposition will be seeking amendments to have better identified the source of these funds that are borrowed by state and federal governments so as to make sure that the Australian people know how much other nations throughout the world own of the Australian government-because we will be in debt to them. Were they to withdraw the support they presently provide, that would leave this government in grave difficulty because, as was exposed in question time these last few days, the government is spending the money already. I note that the shadow Treasurer commented that he believes that the government, through the sale of Treasury notes, is currently borrowing at about $3 billion a week-$3,000 million a week. It is beyond comprehension. The background to this decision-and it flies in the face of other advice that was related to the parliament today-is that the Tasmanian government, our smallest state government, went confidently to the marketplace not that long ago with a $100 million bond tender, which is not a great deal of money in the context of parliament, and was only offered $80 million. Oops! Of course, our Treasurer had to rush out and say, ‘Oh, don't you worry about that'-a common Queenslander's phrase-‘I'll guarantee your debt.' The consequences were as I have already mentioned. The state government of Tasmania could not get the money. Don't worry about its credit rating, which, of course, forces up the cost it had to incur for it; there was either not enough money around because of the rate at which the Australian government was soaking it up or the institutions, both domestic and international, were happier just taking the Australian government debt instruments anyway. Money is a commodity. It will be priced according to demand. The reality is that the states could not get money and now we are virtually back to the old days when the Commonwealth borrowed all of the money for the states and the difficulties which arose under that system. It was called the Australian Loan Council. It became patently obvious to me that there is now massive competition for money in the Australian savings industry and I felt I should have a look at what was happening to interest rates. So I went to a logical place the internet-the Reserve Bank of Australia's daily statistical release. Having got the advice, I had to consult the member for Higgins, with his huge understanding, to better explain to me how I was to read their indicative mid rates of selected Commonwealth government debt. And on his explanation, I am now an expert. The table issued has three columns: ‘Coupon', in other words, the price at which it was offered in the market and the interest rate; ‘Maturity', the date at which the government had to buy back this piece of paper or recycle it in the present instance; and, ‘Yield'. When I look at the top line, I see a September 2009 security-imminent-for which the coupon value was 7.5 per cent, but now, in its dying days, it has a value of 2.95 per cent. Then we look at how the market is assessing long-term loans for which banks also borrow for the purpose of lending to homeowners. You cannot lend someone who has bought a house money for a couple of years and then say, ‘If you haven't paid it off, I'll take the house back.' You have to give those borrowers certainty of, say, a 20-year loan. It so happens and consequently this table tells me that the current yield for a coupon of 5.5 per cent is 5.67 per cent, for a bond with a maturity in 2020-21-a date which has other meaning because that is when this government thinks it might have the capacity to pay off its accumulated debt of $315-plus billion, particularly as it is now guaranteeing over $100 billion of state debt and that state debt is a contingent liability. Your bank manager would know all about that, if you went to borrow $100,000 when you had contingent liabilities of double that amount. The bank would probably say no. On a 5.5 per cent coupon maturing in May 2021, the current yield is 5.67 per cent. That on is how money is being priced; it is where the market expects the cost of money to go. That is the sort of money that banks are having to borrow and on-lend to homeowners. And we have squeals and rants because banks are starting to put up interest rates. We have lived under a farce in this place for so long that somehow or other the Reserve Bank sets interest rates. It was the Hawke-Keating government which deregulated the financial market. That circumstance did exist when the government said how much banks could charge in interest and the government said what the Aussie dollar was worth. A few of us could not convince Malcolm Fraser that that was a bad idea. Circumstances prevailed over the Hawke government-it was not all their economic brilliance or anything else. The hedge funds of the world, which actually had a bigger turnover than Australia, started to play ball with our currency. The only solution was to say, ‘You take it away and play with it,' because every time the government tried to adjust rates in one direction, hedge funds took them in the other direction. Anyhow, it was a silly idea and it is to the credit of the Hawke-Keating government that they deregulated the financial sector and the currency. Consequently, it is a farce to suggest that the Reserve Bank sets interest rates. It sets the overnight cash rate, which does have an influence on what banks are doing. But when they have to back a business for the construction of a 20-year mining venture or a householder in the ownership of a house, banks are borrowing on the basis of federal bonds maturing in 2021. Of course that is affecting interest rates within Australia. I have never been an admirer of Gittins, but he suggested that there is some relevance in the very small amount of money Australia collectively borrows. We are told one day that our international overseas debts are a tragedy. Until the election of this government, all overseas debts happened to be owed by the private sector, who just happened to borrow to build a liquefied natural gas plant or something of that nature. That is not a disaster because the private sector borrow against income-producing assets. It is when governments borrow overseas that you start worrying about foreign debt. The reality of it is that in this instance had every reason to know that we might be a flea bite but the effect is the same. Foreign lenders are starting to say, ‘We want a risk premium in lending money within Australia.' They might have bucketfuls of it, but I read the other day that industry and commerce, our banks and our big business, are also unable to borrow money out of these bucketloads that apparently exist, according to Gittens and the Treasurer today. In fact, they can only borrow within the Asian market because the other markets do not have any money either, or certainly do not want to lend it to Australian business. So anybody who thinks that a government going out into the marketplace and borrowing huge amounts of money for its own purposes is not affecting the interest rate on somebody's home should not be managing the economy of Australia or, in fact, even sitting in their party room. Reference was made in the second reading debate, by the shadow Treasurer and by the member for Makin, about the demise of Ruddbank. It was the Labor government who initiated the sale of the Commonwealth Bank; we were in government when the final sale was completed. There was good reason for governments to no longer own banks. There are a thousand examples of those sorts of banks, state banks particularly, going broke because governments told them to lend money. I stood in this House when the Holmes a Court empire collapsed, simply because of their negative pledge arrangements with the banks. In other words, if the value of their assets fell below 80 per cent of their debt then there was a margin call. The Holmes a Court empire at the time owned about halfsomewhere near that-of all the shares in BHP. The Western Australian government told one of its financial institutions-whose business was providing third-party insurance we to motorists throughout WA, a state government insurance commission-to buy all of Holmes a Court's shares and property at St Georges Terrace. I think it cost them about $800 million. They previously had reserves of 64. I made a suggestion that the Western Australian public would have to pay for that, just as they will have to pay off this borrowing-be it that it is guaranteed for state governments or the federal government. I predicted that there would be a huge cost. Two things came out of that. The payment and the purchase which saved the Holmes a Court empire was of course approved under the old WA Inc. principles and the Brian Burke Labor government. But of course that commission was still $800 million in debt when the Richard Court government was elected. They had to impose a $50 per vehicle licence surcharge to put enough money back into the commission so it could meet its commitments and gradually pay off the debt. Yes, it sold the shares and it sold other things for about half of what they had paid for them. When one looked at my electorate and saw farmers with 10, 15 or 20 licensed vehicles having to pay 50 bucks each on all of them-as well as hard working people and everyone else-to pay off the debts of someone who was previously Australia's wealthiest man, I was pretty angry about it. I raised it before all those circumstances, and what was the result? A little peanut called Norm Marlborough-a man who has had to resign a front-bench position in parliament due to his own corrupt activities since then; my wife always says, ‘What goes around comes around'-stood up in state parliament and attacked my son in retaliation for me raising appropriate issues in this place about one of Australia's richest people. This bloke had a safe Labor seat and was supposed to look after the workers. He destroyed my son's business with his allegations, which were all untrue. My son was not standing here, my son had nothing to do with what I was doing, but Norm Marlborough was prepared to do it and, as we know, he was a little crook. What I am saying is: these are the risks that government take the further they intrude into lending money to business. It should be honest and it should work, but there are always instructions being given by politicians to the managers of those banks. Let me say, and I have said it before: I am not overly impressed with the interference of the Future Fund and its one-time Commonwealth Bank manager in the decision making for the new board of Telstra. I do not think the shareholders will be the beneficiaries of that. I thought the previous management had it right: let government go and play with the telecommunications system; we will run our business; we will provide services that will be self-supporting for the shareholders. They would have been better off. We are talking today about a guarantee that the government did not think they needed-an appropriation-and they have got it, but it is time that they accepted that their borrowing program is costing homeowners and small business and it will cost them more.",143
173,Mr CHEESEMAN,TERRITORY BORROWING,"I rise to speak on the Guarantee of State and Territory Borrowing Appropriation Bill 2009. This is another example of a government acting with foresight. This is another bill that shows we are acting appropriately and in a timely way to address potential issues that flow as a result of the global financial crisis. This bill is about guaranteeing potential claims made under the government's guarantee of state and territory borrowings. The bill appropriates funds to enable claims to be paid under the deed of guarantee in accordance with the scheme rules. The bill also provides a borrowing power should there be insufficient funds in the Consolidated Revenue Fund at the time claims are to be paid. As I said, this is about being ahead of the game. It is about anticipating what may be ahead, even as a remote possibility, and putting in place the machinery to deal with it. This shows the Australian government is dealing with the global financial crisis admirably. What a tremendous effort it was to see the figures last month, to see Australia avoid a recession. Only a few countries in the world can boast this today. When countries around the world are seeing negative growth, Australia is growing. That is a great result. In context of a worldwide recession, it is a truly great result. According to the IMF, world output is projected to decline by 1.3 per cent in 2009 as a whole. The IMF said in a recent bulletin that the advanced economies experienced an unprecedented 7½ per cent decline in real GDP during the fourth quarter of 2008. Emerging economies too are suffering badly and have contracted by four per cent in the fourth quarter on an aggregate basis. Whilst all this mayhem in world trade and world markets was happening, Australia still managed to grow. That is a fantastic thing. During the worse financial crisis since the Second World War, in the three months leading to 31 March gross domestic product rose 0.4 per cent. That is a testament to the management of the Australian economy by the Rudd Labor government. The only conclusion that I can draw is that the Rudd Labor government have got things spot on in terms of economic management. As economic managers, the plain facts tell us that we have done better than nearly every other country in the world. This bill is another piece in building the wall that is holding back the tide of world economic recession in Australia. The global recession has severely constricted liquidity in semi-government bond markets. Our government, through this bill, is supporting and underpinning liquidity in these markets. It is very important to maintain the capacity of state and territory governments to deliver on nation-building investments. Pulling back on critical nationbuilding infrastructure investment now would hinder a recovery from the global recession, resulting in slower growth and of course higher unemployment into the future. The bill will provide investors with the assurance that Australian states and territories are, in their borrowings, supported by an Australian government guarantee and that the the payment of any potential claim under that guarantee will be timely. In defending Australia against economic recession the Australian government will leave no stone unturned. We are looking at every aspect of government, making sure we are secure in all areas so that confidence is maintained in our financial system. And confidence is now slowly returning to our economy. Confidence is returning precisely because the Australian people recognise that we have a very competent and decisive government to steer the ship through these difficult economic times. Australian exports and consumer spending increased recently and many stocks are rising as a consequence. That was a vote of confidence in the Rudd Labor government. The Australian currency also rose to its highest level in eight months against the US dollar. These figures have been achieved, as I said, in the deepest post World War II recession that we have seen to date. These growth figures have been achieved at a time when output per capita is projected to decline in countries representing three-quarters of the global economy. What do you conclude from this, Madam Deputy Speaker? That we are providing a little bit of inspiration to the rest of the world is my conclusion. I think that, with decisive leadership and good policy settings, we can beat this recession and provide some inspiration to the rest of the world along the way. An important aspect of this bill is the security it provides to the states and territories in these very difficult times. The ability of the government to make timely payments of potential claims is an important consideration of ratings agencies and investors in assessing the efficacy of the guarantee. The guarantee of state and territory borrowings will be established through a deed of guarantee and the supporting scheme rules attached to it. Expenditure would arise under the deed of guarantee only in the unlikely event that a state or territory fails to meet its obligations with respect to a commitment that is subject to the deed of guarantee, and of course the deed of guarantee is called upon. In this case, the government is likely to be able to recover any such expenditure through a claim on the relevant state or territory. The impact on the government's budget would depend on the extent of the state or territory's default and its ability to meet the government's claim. In simple layman's terms this bill joins gether state, territory and federal governments in a united front in the war on the recession. We recognise that should a state or territory become exposed it will reflect in a crisis of confidence for the whole system of government in this country. So the Rudd government is backing up the state and territory governments through this bill. I want to mention a couple of aspects of federal government policy that I think have been absolutely critical in terms of Australia's good economic performance. Firstly, of course, there is the decisiveness with which the Prime Minister and his cabinet have acted. The world and Australians have watched with some awe at the scale, speed and nature of the stimulus packages that we have rolled out. The schools packages provide infrastructure for the future and are providing jobs for tradies today. Millions of mums and dads and tradies have recognised that this is first class economic management and a major overhaul of public policy. It provides job security for tradies and an education for our youth for the future. It is great public policy, I contend. Also, the first home buyers grant has been rolled out. It also is great public policy as it enables many people to access the property market for the first time, and it puts a floor real estate prices. It is giving young families a unique opportunity to own their own home and, again, it is helping to shore up our vital building industry and providing spin-offs for retailers and manufacturers across Australia. Then there are the Community Infrastructure Program building projects: local sports fields, community building upgrades, walking trails and tourism infrastructure. It has all helped to keep Australians working and to keep Australia's economy ticking along. This bill pulls together both federal and state governments at the highest economic to- levels to help counter the economic recession. But we should not forget the contribution of local government and people working in our state and federal bureaucracies at all levels in fighting the economic recession. At the local level and at the state and federal bureaucracy level I have been amazed at how everybody has put their shoulder to the wheel to get these projects up and running and create employment to keep the economy going. I reckon more red tape has been cut in the last six months under Labor than probably in the last 60 years, and that is a very good thing. I would like to put on record my thanks to all those people who have worked and who are working in local, state and territory governments and the federal government to get these projects up and running. In conclusion, whilst this bill will provide some further confidence in the Australian economy and whilst I am upbeat about the policies of the Rudd Labor government and the recent economic outcomes, we have a long way to go and we are clearly not out of the woods yet. We know that recovery in Australia and worldwide will be a slow and difficult process. We know that there will be hiccups and economic potholes along the way. But we can have confidence that we have a government that is decisive, that is in hard-working and that is on the ball and creative. We will continue to look at all areas of government into the future to make sure we are doing our very best to keep Australia working and to keep the Australian economy strong. I commend the bill to the House.",146
174,Dr EMERSON,TERRITORY BORROWING,"Rankin-Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation and Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs) (6.41 pm)-I would like to thank those members who have participated in the debate on the Guarantee of State and Territory Borrowing Appropriation Bill 2009. As the government has said before, we face the worse global recession in 75 years and this has seen almost every advanced economy record a contraction in GDP in the March quarter of this year. Despite Australia being better placed than almost any other country and despite the success of our stimulus, there is a rocky road ahead, especially when it comes to unemployment. Australia's financial markets are strong but they have been affected by the global financial crisis. The market for state and territory bonds has also been affected by the turmoil in global markets and liquidity in semi-government bond markets has been severely constricted. This has threatened the capacity of state and territory governments to deliver critical infrastructure projects that will support jobs in the face of the global recession. It is crucial that states and territories are able to access the credit markets and the guarantee of state and territory borrowing recognises this. Indeed, supporting semi-government bond markets is critical to maintaining the capacity of state and territory governments to deliver critical nation-building infrastructure. Cancelling or delaying infrastructure investment would hamper the recovery from the global recession causing slower growth and higher unemployment into the future. State and territory government infrastructure spending supported by the guarantee will work hand in hand with the government's own infrastructure investment to build a stronger Australia, supporting jobs today by investing in the infrastructure that we need for tomorrow. This bill is essential to provide investors with the assurance that state and territory borrowing will be supported by an Australian government guarantee. To do this, the bill provides a standing appropriation so that in the unlikely event that claims are made under the guarantee they can be paid in a timely manner. A standing appropriation is also put in place to allow any borrowings made under this bill to be repaid. A borrowing power is also provided to enable timely payment of claims should there be insufficient funds in the consolidated revenue fund in the unlikely event that claims are to be paid. This will ensure that state and territory governments can raise the funds they need to support jobs today by investing in the infrastructure of tomorrow. This government's No. 1 priority is a nation-building recovery that supports employment and this bill is a key part of governments of all level and of all political persuasions pulling together to help the Australian community withstand these global conditions that are challenging our nation. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading",149

NA (NATIONAL JOINT REPLACEMENT REGISTER LEVY) BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 May, on motion by Ms Roxon: That this bill be now read a second time.",149
176,Mr DUTTON,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"I rise to speak on the Private Health Insurance (National Joint Replacement Register Levy) Bill 2009. By way of background, on 6 July 1998 the then health minister, Dr Michael Wooldridge, announced funding for the Australian Orthopaedic Association to establish the National Joint Replacement Registry. This was an important initiative, as the Australian Orthopaedic Association had recognised the need to establish a national joint replacement registry as far back as 1993. Until the registry was established, there was a lack of information regarding patients who were receiving prostheses, the types of prostheses and the surgical techniques used to implant them. The Australian Orthopaedic Association should be rightly proud of the growth, success and benefits that have been derived from the establishment of the registry. According to the Australian Orthopaedic Association, there are 70,000 hip and knee replacements undertaken each year in Australia, having increased from around 25,000 in 1998. This number will only continue to grow. Given the variability in joint replacement success, the registry has an important role in collating and analysing data regarding joint replacements. The registry collects data regarding patient characteristics, prostheses types and features, methods of prostheses fixation and surgical techniques used. The primary measure of outcome is revision surgery. The registry also monitors mortality rates, with the information being used by surgeons, other health care professionals, governments, prostheses sponsors, patients and the wider community. Armed with this information, real improvements can be made and have been made in joint replacement surgery. This bill sets out cost-recovery arrangements for the operation of the registry. Levies will be imposed by this legislation on sponsors of prosthetic devices and will be used for the funding of the registry. Sponsors will be levied according to the number of joint replacement prostheses they sponsor. Different levies will be imposed for different joint replacement prostheses and rates will vary between zero and $5,000 per financial year. This variation in levies is supposed to reflect the different benefits applying to prostheses listed on the Commonwealth Prostheses List. The explanatory memorandum identifies that the benefit applying to some joint replacement prosthetic devices ranges from less than $50 to as high as $67,000 per product. Whilst there is a legitimate debate to be had about cost-recovery measures, we know that this government clearly is not interested in a genuine policy debate on such issues; they are just looking for easy targets to cover the Treasurer's economic incompetence. We have seen blatant revenue grabs time and time again from this government, irrespective of the policy implications and outcomes for the Australian public. We have seen it with the alcopops legislation, we have seen it most recently with the private health insurance rebates, and we have certainly seen it with caps to the Medicare safety net. These recent measures are blatant revenue grabs by a reckless government that after just half a term in government have destroyed this country's hard earned wealth and good fortune. All Australians will pay a price for the government's ideologically driven changes, particularly in relation to the private health insurance rebate. Those who rely on public health treatment can expect waiting lists, with more people seeking treatment, and those with insurance will pay more through higher premiums. By the government's own admission, the government's recently introduced changes will affect some 1.7 million adult policyholders. It is inevitable that some of these people, especially given the current economic environment, will downgrade their cover and some drop it all together. This will place upward pressure on premiums, and so the spiral begins. The government would like us to believe that only the very rich and privileged have private health insurance. But the minister does not really address what effect the upward pressure she is putting on premiums will have on the one million Australians earning under $26,000 per annum who have private health insurance. The government continues to blame the current economic circumstances for the country's ballooning debt and deficit without taking any responsibility for their own poor economic management. The difficulty for this government is that the Australian public will soon tire of excuses. They will tire of the cuts to successful and carefully considered health policies. Sooner or later the Rudd government will have to stop cowering behind the global financial crisis and take responsibility for its actions plunging this country into unprecedented debt. There is no magic pudding. The Labor government's economic recklessness will have far-reaching consequences. And now we know that Mr Rudd has no hesitation in breaking key election promises, there is no certainty or stability for health policy in this country any longer. This government's list of broken promises is long. Their assurances regarding private health insurance are well documented in this House. As recently as 24 February this year, the health minister said to the Age newspaper: The government is firmly committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates. Yet this statement was made by the minister at the same time that officials from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet were providing formal advice regarding the proposed changes to the private health insurance rebate. So the minister is saying one thing to the public whilst PM&C and her own department are looking at policy options which would go in the exact opposite direction to that on which the minister has just given, on that same day, a firm commitment. Health is a portfolio that requires careful and considered long-term planning, not frequent, ill-considered, ideologically convenient changes driven by a broke and incompetent Treasurer. Health policy in this country should be administered by the health minister, not a panicked and desperate Treasurer. As I have stated previously, and on many occasions, there is a legitimate debate to be had on cost recovery. The coalition has engaged in that and is willing to further engage in that. Under any cost recovery measure, though, there needs to be genuine engagement with all affected stakeholders. There is no denying the significant benefit that has been derived from the joint replacement registry, and it is important that the good work in continues to be funded appropriately. Whilst the industry would acknowledge that as sponsors they derive benefit from the registry, they are by no means the sole beneficiaries, and government should adequately justify such cost recovery measures. The information collated by the registry is of benefit to many stakeholders, including surgeons, governments and private health insurers. The levies proposed in this legislation are in addition to the application and ongoing listing fees already incurred by sponsors of joint replacement prostheses. There has been a lack of consultation on this measure-no question-and a lack of evidence presented by the government on what other funding mechanisms were considered. Or have they just gone for another easy revenue grab, ignorant of the impacts and policy outcomes? Whilst the bill acknowledges the differing benefits applicable to prostheses, there is a reasonable expectation that in determining appropriate levies consideration will also be given to the frequency in which prostheses are utilised in procedures. A debate on health will unfold in the months before the next election. We know the government are desperate to go to an election before the next budget, before they release details of how much further debt they propose to go into-that is, how much more debt will be hung around the necks of all men, women and children in this country for decades to come. The important debate about health that is to be had will be crucial because the government promised at the time of the last election-only 18 months agothat they would fix public hospitals by 30 June 2009. So there is less than two weeks to go. Yet the government have not even released any detailed criteria or benchmark by which they will determine whether or not they have met that election promise. In the Main Committee last night I asked three questions of the Minister for Health and Ageing. I asked her to please detail even just one seen. criterion by which they could assess whether or not they had made sufficient gains over the last 12 months in public hospital management and outcomes to justify a claim that they would fix hospitals by mid-2009. The Prime Minister was very definite in the language that he used. Despite the fact that he has pulled down that wording from his website, we have printouts of the website that show the commitment he made during the election campaign that he would fix public hospitals. He has walked away from that statement, and I think most Australians would be amazed by that. Most Australians would be amazed that the Prime Minister looked down the camera during the election campaign in 2007 and said to Australians, ‘I will end the blame game and I will fix public hospitals by mid-2009.' He said that even though he had no interest or genuine concern in fulfilling that. We know that over the coming months the government will receive advice from various reports, studies and commissions they have had working on this very important issue. That advice will be returned to government and in due course the government will be required to reply. This is an amazing process, because the government will no longer have the opportunity to hide behind the commissions and reports that they have put into the field over the last 18 months. Crunch time is coming for the Rudd government in relation to health. Frankly, they can delay no longer. They need to recognise that it is going to be a big call for them to say that they will not live up to their election commitment to fix public hospitals. If the Prime Minister walks away from that commitment then there will be a strongly-held belief in the Australian community that the Prime Minister is a fraud, that he says one thing because focus groups dictate it but when it comes time to deliver on a promise he is nowhere to be",150

That was a hollow promise. I do not believe that the Prime Minister ever had any intention of fulfilling that promise to the Australian people. As I say, we are less than two weeks away from the end of this financial year. It is fast approachbe ing. The federal government, the Prime Minister, have not yet even put on the table the criteria they will use to determine whether or not public hospitals have been fixed. That is an amazing outcome. On three occasions in the Main Committee last night, when I directly asked the minister this very question, she looked at me blankly. She looked at me like she had no idea what I was talking about, like she was thinking: ‘What? You would put criteria in place to assess whether or not you had fixed public hospitals?' How else were the government going to determine whether or not they had fixed public hospitals by mid-2009? If Australians in either metropolitan or rural and regional areas have a public hospital in their area which has been fixed, I implore them to please contact my office to give me details of how the Rudd government has fixed even one of the 750 public hospitals over the course of the last 18 months. When this Prime Minister said 18 months ago that he would fix public hospitals, what did he mean? The Christine Bennett review, the Health and Hospitals Reform Commission review, is due to come back to the government by 30 June. The Prime Minister cannot say, ‘We can't declare that we have achieved our outcome of fixing public hospitals until we have seen the findings, the outcomes and the recommendations of that report.' The two are completely separate. The Bennett review will return a report to the government, and Professor Moody's preventative health task force will return some recommendations. Those people should be commended, as should the committees, for the work they have done in speaking to people and for the time and effort they have put into it. They will provide recommendations and considerations for government post 1 July this year. Their work is to look at how the system can constructed in the future. Their task is to look at how the provision of health care for Australians can be made better at both the federal and state levels over the coming years.",153
183,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"The member for Dickson should return to the bill before us. I have allowed him to wander quite substantially, and I understand the link he is making. The bill before us is the Private Health Insurance (National Joint Replacement Register Levy) Bill 2009. I ask him to return to the bill before us.",153
184,Mr DUTTON,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I know your long-held interest in the area of health, and you have been quite obliging. The point I make in relation to this bill cifically is that, as we go forward we have think about how our public hospitals provide services. There can be no more important services for people than those provided by the surgeons and skilled clinicians in the public hospitals, particularly in relation to the devices we are talking about in this bill. The way in which services are provided through public hospitals, particularly for devices we are talking about in this parliament tonight, is something the Prime Minister needs to examine. He could even use the successful delivery of prostheses over the last 12 or 18 months as justification for his claim that he has fixed public hospitals. It would be remarkable if we went forward with the Prime Minister trying to use the excuse that he has to wait for these reports. As I said, they have nothing to do with what has taken place over the last 12 or 18 months and whether the federal government has fixed public hospitals. I say to those members opposite who intend to contribute to this debate: please tell me as part of this debate exactly how it is that public hospitals in your community have been fixed over the last 12 months. I say to the member for Shortland, who always has great delight in following me in these debatesMs Hall-I love it. It makes my day.",154
185,Mr DUTTON,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"Such is her want in life that she finds great pleasure in following me in these debates. I always welcome her worthy, considered contributions. As part of your contribution tonight, member for Shortland, please say to this House how the public hospitals in your electorate have been fixed the last 18 months. Make the claim in the House tonight-this is the challenge to the Labor Party; meet this challenge-that even one public hospital anywhere in the country has been fixed over the last 18 months. Not only would I be astounded but I would take speup immediately the invitation from the to member for Shortland to visit that hospital. I would be very pleased to go to the hospital with the member for Shortland to discuss with the clinicians there, the doctors and nurses, exactly how that hospital has been fixed. That would be a revelation. If the Prime Minister can claim that he has fixed even one public hospital over the last 12 the months then I will visit that hospital.",154
186,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,Either the member for Dickson will come back to the bill or I will draw him to a conclusion.,154
187,Mr DUTTON,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"Madam Deputy Speaker, thank you for the House's indulgence tonight on this incredibly important issue. It goes without saying that the coalition have provided support and we have noted our concerns, concerns which are reflected by the stakeholders' very real concerns. We will be monitoring this very closely. We will be looking at the Senate process. We will see exactly how this government operates this cost-recovery regime. We remain very concerned that many of these measures are nothing more than desperate revenue grabs by a government that has lost control of the economy in such a short period of time. It is a remarkable feat that this government has been able to turn a $22 billion surplus, money in the bank, into such debt. To achieve this deficit after only two budgets is a remarkable feat even for a Labor government, and that is saying something when you look state by state. This conditional support has those reservations based on the concerns that have been raised by the industry. On that over basis, we do not oppose this bill.",154
188,Ms HALL,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"I was pleased to hear that the member for Dickson is actually supporting the Private Health Insurance (National Joint Replacement Register Levy) Bill 2009. I was a little doubtful whether he was going to support it, or even if he knew what was included in the legislation. Before I go to my contribution on this legislation, I would very much like to touch on some of the issues raised by the member for Dickson. It is easy to see why he is the master of fear and smear in the opposition. It is not surprising-and the Australian people will learn-that on numerous occasions in question time he has been asked to leave the chamber, because he tends to get involved in the fear and smear and the abuse that he is noted for in this House. The positions of health minister and shadow health minister are probably two of the most important positions within the parliament. It is beholden on the people in those offices to behave responsibly, to put forward their vision for health and to know what health is really about. It is important for those people that fill those offices to really know where they want the nation to go when it comes to health. There is more to being a shadow health minister than standing up and just opposing absolutely everything that comes before the parliament. I have yet to see that the shadow minister has any understanding of any of the real health issues within this country. I note he spent considerable time talking about the government's response to the global financial crisis without even acknowledging that a global financial crisis existed. It was his decision to use his speaking time. I hope he noted I did not get up and object; I allowed him full rein-to attack and oppose every health decision and every health direction that the government has taken. From that I assume that he opposes the very outstanding report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, which the member for Fairfax chaired in the last parliament, called The blame game. It identified most of the key health issues facing Australia. I have to say to the shadow minister that most of the policy decisions, the directions to the future of health in Australia, that the government has taken have been following on from that report. In lighter moments when I talk to the member for Fairfax, he will say to me, ‘You're implementing our report.' So he sees that the Rudd government has picked up and run with the report-which, I might add, we never received a response to from the former government-which created the blueprint for health in Australia. I know that the member for Dickson becomes very preoccupied with private health insurance. We have had that debate. There was a vote on it. He made very clear his position on the changes to private health insurance. But tonight I hear him putting up that old furphy that pensioners and people on low incomes are going to lose the 30 per cent rebate. That is what he insinuates. It is more of the fear and smear, more of being dishonest with the Australian people and more of not really understanding what health is about. One of the most important aspects of the health system is that we have confidence in our health system. During the inquiry into health that culminated in The blame game report, we had a quote which is at the start of one of the chapters. To listen to the member for Dickson, one would believe that our Australian health system is on the verge of collapse, that this has only happened since the Rudd government came to power. It is quite the contrary; there have been so many positive initiatives taken since the Rudd government has come to power that our health system is in a much better condition. This person who gave evidence to the inquiry stated, ‘Sure, there are some problems with the health system'-and this was under the Howard government, when it was in power-‘but if you get sick there is no place in the world that you would rather be than Australia, because the quality of the health services here is second to none.' The member for Dickson needs to be mindful of that fact. Health is a very important debate. We on this side of the House are ready to have that debate. The review that is taking place at the moment and the report that is due to be brought down at the end of this month will form a blueprint and be a very important part of where we on this side of the parliament go. But we are also very lucky that we have a health minister that does have a vision for health in Australia. She has very much made her mark in the area of health. Every minister that holds the health portfolio is able to influence the direction that we go in with health. She has made a very strong contribution in the area of community and preventative health. As a nation, if we can address a major health issue or a disease before it becomes critical, we are going to be in a much better position. Prevention is always better than needing to put all your resources into a cure. I have never once stood in this House and heard the member for Dickson give us a vision, give us an idea of what he believes in, as far as health goes. What he believes in as far as health goes is attacking the government. It is always ‘this Prime Minister' or ‘this minister for health'. It is never, ‘I think that this is the direction we should go in for health.'",154
189,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"Member for Shortland, I ask that you come back to the bill before the House. You've had a good reign.",156
190,Ms HALL,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"I am very happy to do so, but I felt that I needed to address the comments that were made by the previous speaker. I am very happy to make my contribution to the debate. So far I have been dealing with the issues that have been raised by the shadow minister and his vision for health, which revolves around private health insurance. If he was really honest with the Australian people, he would say that people should receive the kind of health care they can afford to pay for, not the kind of health care they need. The Private Health Insurance (National Joint Replacement Register Levy) Bill 2009 collects information about joint replacement surgery, such as for hips, knees, ankles, shoulders, wrists and spinal disc replacement procedures. It reports on the safety and the quality of and devices used in these surgeries to ensure that patients get the best outcomes. This register is extremely important, because it provides information on the types of procedures that are being undertaken, the effectiveness of the devices, whether or not the surgeries are successful and whether a particular device should continue to be on that register. This bill will impose a levy on sponsors for joint replacement prostheses to recover the cost of the National Joint Replacement Registry. I think this is a responsible way to go. I think it is very important that you have proper cost recovery procedures in place and I think it is important that something like this register be self-funded. That is exactly what will happen under this legislation. The bill defines a sponsor as a person who has had a joint replacement prostheses if the joint replacement prostheses is currently listed in the Private Health Insurance (Prostheses) Rules-and I point out here that the Howard government streamlined the register and put in place some limits on the type of prostheses that could be listed-either as a result of an application made by the person under the Private Health Insurance Act 2007 or is listed in accordance with the Private Health Insurance (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2007. It defines a joint replacement prosthesis as a prosthesis listed in the Private Health Insurance (Prostheses) Rules and which is used for joint replacements. It provides a rulemaking power for the rate of the national joint replacement register levy. Joint replacements are becoming more and more common within our society. We have an ageing population. Part of the consequences of people living longer is that sometimes joints wear out. When those joint replacements take place, we need to make sure that we have full and reliable details of the operations that are happening. Around 70,000 Australians have had joint replacement surgery in the last 12 months. The National Party Whip in this parliament has had double hip joint replacements and the whip's clerk has had hip replacements. They are quite young people. My mother has had a hip replacement. I am sure that each and every member of this parliament could identify a person close to them who has had a joint replacement. The register estimates that the information it has provided has improved surgical practices and changed the use of particular devices, reducing the number of unnecessary revision surgeries by 1,200 Australians a year. That is very important, because every time you have a joint replacement procedure that fails and you have to have it done again the chance of success is a lot lower and the outcome is a lot poorer. People need to have the confidence that that hip or knee replacement that they have will be effective. This register is a very important instrument and piece of health information. I think members of this House should be very supportive of the role that it plays in our health system. In addition to improving patient outcomes, it is estimated that the register has saved health sector and consumers around $44.6 million. That is a lot of money. The expenditure on hip and knee prostheses represents around 30 per cent of the total expenditure by private health insurers on prostheses. Insurers paid over $1 billion in benefits for prostheses in 2007-08, out of a total of $74 billion spent on hospital benefits that year. This means that prosthesis expenditure represents around 15 per cent of privately insured hospital benefits outlayed. The register assisted in ensuring this funding and that public hospital expenditure is directed to better-performing products with low revision rates. Once again, it is looking at the integrity of the prosthesis and looking to ensure that you can reduce the number of times that that procedure has to be revisited. It is therefore vital that the register continues to have a stable source of ongoing funding. How do you achieve that stable source of funding? I would argue very strongly that this legislation will do just that. Taxpayers have met the operating costs of the register for over 10 years, which is now around $1.6 million a year. It is appropriate that the manufacturers and the importers of the medical devices used in joint replacement surgery now fund the cost of the register. The new cost recovery arrangements will be similar to the funding arrangements of the United Kingdom's National Joint Registry, which is funded through a levy on joint replacement products. It is a sensible way to manage the register and it is a very sensible means of cost recovery. The register provides invaluable market surveillance of joint replacement prostheses and the monitoring of the safety and quality of devices provides considerable benefit to both the industry and the consumer-I think I have already touched on that-by improving consumer confidence in the safety and efficacy of joint the replacement devices. Any devices showing high failure rates can be identified quickly and promptly removed from the market. Health consumers need to know that the product that they are having inserted in their body is safe and that, if there is any problem with it, it will be picked up very quickly and removed from the register. The data produced by the register also assists the industry by informing the development of new prostheses, allowing manufacturers to draw on reliable performance information for existing products and designs. The introduction of cost recovery arrangements will produce budget savings of $5 million over four years. This is outstanding legislation. It delivers certainty to the Australian community and certainty to the users of the register. I strongly support the legislation before us tonight.",156
191,Mr CHEESEMAN,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"I commend the member for Shortland's assassination of the argument put forward by the member for Dickson and his continuing undermining of the public health system. I take the opportunity today to talk about the Private Health Insurance (National Joint Replacement Register Levy) Bill 2009 and to make some comments about our health system generally. This bill is another example of the strength of Australia's healthcare system. I will speak about the technical side of this bill in detail in a moment, but I would first like to set the context. As we know, due to the foresight and wisdom of previous Labor governments dating back to the Whitlam era, Australia has a health system that is the envy of the world. Representatives from countries around the world are regularly visiting Australia and asking us questions as to what is our secret, how we deliver such a quality health system and at such a cost. The answer, I believe, is twofold. First of all, we have a guarantee to a universal standard of health care through the Medicare system. This great principle was achieved by successive Labor governments and is now so popular amongst the Australian public that it can only be undermined by stealth from those on the other side of the House. The second part of the secret of the success of Australia's healthcare system is our vigilance on costs and the constant refinement of the system to ensure it is always delivering good value to the Australian consumer. That is, of course, what we are doing here today. The refinements we are putting in place through this bill are all about keeping costs down and improving our research and evidence base for care and the products we use to deliver that care. Whilst universal health care is the major principle of our healthcare system, we do of course have a mixed and balanced system. An important part of our healthcare system is the private health insurance component. This is what we are looking at today. This is another example at how Labor are running a very tight and controlled ship in relation to the Australian healthcare system. Unlike the opposition, we do not believe in just letting the market rip. We do not want an out-ofcontrol market in our health system like the one that has brought the international global economy to its knees. We do not want a healthcare market that has been allowed to operate unfettered and with a focus only on profits rather than the efficiency and effectiveness of the healthcare system. So we are doing a bit of intervention in the market. We are intervening in the healthcare market to ensure Australia has a good healthcare system and good value for our healthcare dollar. The National Joint Replacement Register-or the NJRR, as we call it-collects information about joint replacement surgeries such as hip, knee, ankle, shoulder, wrist and spinal disc replacement procedures. It reports on the safety and quality of these surgeries and the devices used in those surgeries to ensure patients get the best healthcare outcomes. This is about intervening to ensure that evidence based healthcare decisions and a transparency of the healthcare system are maintained. What will this bill do? It will, of course, impose a levy on sponsors for joint replacement prostheses to recover the costs. A sponsor is defined as a person who has a joint replacement prostheses listed in the Private Health Insurance (Prostheses) Rules or the person was the sponsor of that prosthesis immediately before the commencement of the National Health Act 1953 or is listed in the Private Health Insurance (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2007. Debate interrupted. NA",158
192,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Youth Allowance",159
193,Mr HAWKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Wannon) (7.30 pm)Tonight I want to bring to the attention of the House the really devastating effect the changes to Youth Allowance are going to have on students and potential students in my area and, I know, right across the nation, particularly in the country. The thing that is really making people in my area angry is the fact that the government is bringing in a rospective change, so that those who started to take a gap year in anticipation of qualifying for Youth Allowance are now finding that under the change in rules they will not qualify. For many, it is quite devastating. Just to give an idea of the anger that is around, there was a meeting held two weeks ago in Warrnambool to which 400 people turned up. Two petitions have been put around, and in a very short time nearly 2,000 signatures have been obtained-and I intend to table them next week. What this really highlights are the difficulties country students are facing in trying to go on to tertiary study. We start with the obvious problem, which is that for most country students leaving home is not a question of choice; it is a necessity. That in itself is not easy, but it means of course that it costs them a lot more to continue studying. Then we have the problem with deferring starting, because, under the proposal the government is putting forward, that deferral will now have to be for two years while a student is working. But universities generally do not hold the places for that long; so, even if a student has been accepted, that does not mean that they will be able to get into that university after they have deferred. And, of course, as one of the local principals of a big high school in my area said, if a student defers for two years and starts earning an income, it is very, very difficult to go back to study. So, when we look at the impact of this measure, we can see clearly that it is very much disadvantaging country students-and, as I said, it is a retrospective change. I can quote another principal from my area, who made the point: The tighter eligibility criteria served as a “double disincentive” to pursue higher education. That is what Hamilton and Alexandra Colret- lege principal Bruce Simons said. He went on to say: But if the changes were approved, parents of students starting secondary education now would have little choice but to discourage their plans to go to university … Without income assistance, many Hamilton district families would be forced to move to Melbourne to support their child while they studied. The article I am quoting from also says: According to data published yesterday, Mr Simons' school has the highest percentage of students across the state to defer their studies. The On Track Survey shows 64 per cent of those surveyed at the college had deferred their tertiary place. Clearly, not all those students are going to be able to go on and study under the changed rules. Another report, also in the Warrnambool Standard, said: SOUTH-WEST families with three children at university in Melbourne could be forced to fork out as much as $200,000 to support their studies under the new Youth Allowance criteria, according to South West Local Learning and Employment Network's (LLEN) chief executive officer. The chief executive officer, Toni Hancock, said: If you have three children at university, and I'm basing this on an actual case from the Warrnambool region, you will be paying about $60,000 a year for those three students to live outside this area to go to university … Clearly, this is targeting country students and making sure that they just do not have that opportunity. A report in the Portland Observer pointed out: RURAL students may be forced to put aside any plans to pursue tertiary studies as a result of changes to the youth allowance eligibility criteria announced in last week's federal budget. It goes on to give an example of a student who deferred and is currently working at Bakers Delight, but she is wondering what the point is. The other statistic that I thought should be stated is this: Warrnambool College careers advisor Peter Bollard said 39 per cent of the 2008 year 12 class deferred their university place to meet the eligibility requirements. And, as the Warrnambool Standard said at the time, in its editorial: The Federal Government's changes to the Youth Allowance criteria, announced in the Federal Budget, are an insult to regional Australian students. It concludes: For the sake of regional students, the Government must think again. The impact of this change is clearly disadvantaging people in the country. That is why I will be tabling those petitions and that is why the opposition is going to move to take out the retrospectivity of these changes to Youth Allowance. (Time expired) Building the Education Revolution Program",159
194,Mr DREYFUS,ADJOURNMENT,"I am proud to be part of a Labor government which is undertaking the largest school modernisation program in Australia's history to support local jobs, to stimulate every local economy and to invest in important long term infrastructure. I am proud to see the funds that are being rolled out through Building the Education Revolution. But it has been extraordinary over the last several sitting weeks to sit here and listen to not simply the dishonest scare campaign that has been run by those opposite in relation to debt and the stimulus package as a whole but, more particularly, the dishonest campaign that is being run by those opposite in relation to the Building the Education Revolution program. The misrepresentations that we have heard from those opposite about Building the Education Revolution over the last several weeks have been extraordinary. They have referred to discrepancies in pricing. They have made accusations about the way in which the state governments are cooperating with the federal government on this program. And it is apparent that they have not read the guidelines for Building the Education Revolution. They have not attempted in any serious way to find out what the state governments are doing in relation to government schools under this program and, indeed, they have not taken the trouble to find out the way in which the Catholic school system and the independent school system are dealing with the Building the Education Revolution funding. The accusations about underspending and, indeed, all of the other misrepresentations that have been made by those opposite are entirely without foundation. Most importantly, what needs to be borne in mind about this program is that those opposite voted against it. It is outrageous that they have come into this House, day after day, raising complaints about a program that they voted against in its entirety. They fail to recognise that this program is supporting jobs and providing employment. I can speak for my electorate in saying that, already under this program, some $62.7 million has been allocated to schools, and that is only in rounds 1 and 2 of the program. Apparently what those opposite want us to do, because they do not wish this program to be occurring at all, is to spend less. In saying that they wish us to spend less, those opposite are saying that they wish this government to emulate their record on education during their 11½ years in government. They want us to spend less on early childhood education. They want us to spend less on tertiary education. They want us to spend less in every sense on education because by doing that we would be emulating their record while in government. I know that the Rudd Labor government will not be doing less. We will be doing more in relation to early childhood, we will be doing more in relation to infrastructure for schools and we will be doing more in relation to the tertiary sector because we do not wish educational standards to slip. We do not wish to be at the back of the pack in OECD statistics, which is where the Howard government left us at the conclusion of its term in office. We do not wish the children of Australia to be educated in substandard facilities, and we do not wish our nation to lack a 21st century vocational education and training system which is capable of meeting the needs of a modern country. I am looking forward to Liberal Party members coming to my electorate and telling the schools, the principals, the teachers and the parents there which schools in the electorate should not have received funding and which of them should not have received the new buildings that they have so warmly welcomed as part of the Building the Education Revolution program. I suspect that, after their having voted against this program and consistently making misrepresentations about it, we will not be hearing members of the Liberal Party who visit my electorate say that. Rather, they will be pretending that they did not vote against this whole program. They will be pretending to welcome the school programs and the school buildings that are unfolding in my electorate. Over the next 12 months, we are going to see- (Time expired) Perth to Bunbury Highway",160
195,Mr RANDALL,ADJOURNMENT,"I am delighted to rise tonight and advise the House of the near completion of the long awaited Perth to Bunbury highway, now known as the Kwinana Freeway Extension and the Forrest Highway. It was once referred to as the Mandurah Bypass. With the final kilometres of bitumen being laid, I am hopeful that Peel motorists in my region will very shortly be making the most of this highway. I have spoken many times about the highway in this chamber, always with the main aim of seeing the 70.5 kilometres-a key piece of infrastructure-delivered on time and on budget. The completion of this highway for Canning residents and the wider Western Australian community has been my priority. Fundamentally, it will dramatically improve road safety. The current route-the Old Coast Road-is the most notorious stretch of road in the state, with too many white crosses on the side of the road. Between 1996 and 2006 there were 1,560 serious crashes, with 42 fatalities. Next year, estimated 43,000 vehicles per day will use the increasingly busy and backlogged Mandurah Road and 9,500 vehicles will be on the Old Coast Road south of Lake Clifton. Mr Speaker, you can see why this highway is vital. I am proud to say that the coalition government was the driving force behind the highway. I took the leadership role-I had to. The former state Minister for Planning and Infrastructure, Alanna MACTiernan, did everything possible to stall the Perth to Bunbury highway. Blinded by the massive cost blowout of the much maligned Perth to Mandurah railway, the minister ignored the highway for as long as she could, until she was eventually dragged, kicking and screaming, to deal with it. In 2001 the state government submitted an application for federal government funding. It was rejected not because the federal government did not want to build the highway but because the application made it perfectly clear that the state Labor government was not at all serious. It was literally a submisthey sion made on the back of an envelope. Two years later, Minister MACTiernan made another half-hearted commitment to build the highway five years down the track and then she stalled on it by insisting on investing ‘planning studies'. If she had had her way, Peel motorists would have gone without the highway altogether. But, in December 2003, with the then federal transport minister, Anderson, and roads minister, Ian Campbell, I met with key stakeholders, and this brought about a firm commitment. On 4 June 2004 the coalition announced a funding commitment of $150 million. On 7 June, the AusLink projects to be funded were finalised and three days later Prime Minister John Howard came to visit the future highway site. This was important. Within a month of finally receiving the planning information, the federal government had coman mitted $150 million. This was the full amount that the state government had asked for. This just shows how highly we rated the road project and how the tactics of the state minister had put the safety of Peel motorists at risk, year after year. The federal government was very keen to get the project going and desperate to make sure that the state Labor government did not try to renege on its agreement. An additional $20 million was made available as long as the project started in 2006. We wanted a start date. The minister dragged her heels for another year before signing the funding agreement. Costs began to blow out and the state government had the nerve to ask for more federal money. The minister suggested that the money should be used to build the road in two stages. Under this proposal, Western Australians, if they were lucky, might have got the first stage of the road, albeit with the Labor government's track record on delivering major infrastructure it would have been late and, without a doubt, over budget; but never would have seen the second stage. It would have been put on the backburner and filed away by the department's bureaucracy in its too-hard basket. Minister MacTiernan had to be reminded of the funding in being contingent on a continuous build-not a two-stage build. If we had not done that, we might have been looking, as I said, at only half a highway today. Strict time frames John were attached to the funding. The highway had to be underway in 2006 and open to motorists by the end of 2009. Guess what date the minister decided to turn a sod-20 December 2006. Talk about a death knock! Despite its shaky inception, the construction phase of the highway has been full steam ahead-largely as a result of the outstanding Southern Gateway Alliance's management and innovative techniques, not the former government's management. The completion of the highway six months early will be a triumph. It is one of the largest gle road infrastructure projects in Western Australia's history. Its completion will mean that there is a freeway all the way from Perth to Mandurah and a first-class dual carriageway from Mandurah to Bunbury. It will cut 30 minutes off the trip to Bunbury and will no doubt ease the frustration of the some 50,000 Easter travellers to Western Australia's south-west well into the future. (Time expired) Calwell Electorate: Australian Made Campaign",161
196,Ms VAMVAKINOU,ADJOURNMENT,"Last Thursday, 11 June, I was pleased to attend and support the Hume City Council in my electorate of Calwell when it formally launched its Australian Made Campaign. In signing on to this campaign the Hume City Council has proved its commitment to engage with and support our local community and our local economy. The Mayor Jack Ogilvie noted that signing onto the Australian Made campaign will not only boost the profile of local companies but provide ‘leadership and advocacy on the importance of buying local and Australian Made'. The Australian Made campaign is an essential part of this leadership and advocacy and I welcome the launch of this campaign in my electorate of Calwell. The City of Hume is a place where the old saying, ‘think globally, act locally' is really put into practice. We are not inward looking. We are not interested in shutting the world out. On the contrary, we have one of the most multicultural, multilingual populations of anywhere in Australia. Our community has a multitude of links with the world at large through heritage; family travel; and of course in this modern era, through culture and media, particularly the internet. We are discerning consumers and appreciate all the world has to offer. But we are also passionate sinabout our own community, about developing our own skills, supporting our own innovators and looking to the future. We want to ensure that our goods, services and ideas are nurtured, encouraged, invested in and purchased. Manufacturing is an essential part of the national economy but, more importantly, it is an essential part of the social fabric of our local communities and I have long understood just how important manufacturing is in northern metropolitan Melbourne. In the electorate of Calwell we are reminded that livelihoods depend on local manufacturing. That is why I was pleased to be at the launch last Thursday. The Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Kim Carr, who launched the campaign, reminded us all that the Australian Made brand, launched under the Hawke Labor government in 1986, has become an economic marketing tool. The Australian Made brand, which I am very proud to support, is recognised by 98 per cent of Australians. Those 98 per cent of Australians know that when they are buying locally manufactured products they are not only supporting local jobs and industries but getting a quality product. In my electorate of Calwell there are 18 businesses currently signed on to the Australian Made, Australian Grown campaign. They range from Mickleham Olive Oils to Tachni Waterjet and Astra Furniture. These companies recognise the value of promoting Australian produce. In doing so, they are also supporting their community. They are supporting local jobs and supporting local families and they are also giving the next generation of Australians opportunities to innovate and to produce. Moreover, Hume City Council takes our local economy and our local manufacturing seriously. In signing up to this campaign they have shown a real commitment to supporting and developing manufacturing in northern metropolitan Melbourne. I want to commend the council for this. The campaign was launched at the premises of a new Australian Made licensee, Kelly and Windsor. Kelly and Windsor is a manufacturer of alpaca, cotton and polyester bedding products. Established in 2001 and based in Campbellfield, they are a great example of how Australian made products can be at the cutting edge of innovation. Kelly and Windsor have cornered the market through integrated technologies. I am pleased to have the opportunity to support his ingenious approach to manufacturing. It represents the future of Australian manufacturing. Earlier I mentioned Tachni Waterjet. This firm, located in Campbellfield, has just been awarded a $499,000 federal grant under the Climate Ready program, to develop technology to reduce consumption of energy and water by 70 per cent. Great local companies like these demonstrate how Australian Made local manufacturing is leading the way not only in developing our local economy and keeping jobs in Australia but also in innovation, research, development and the move towards greater sustainability. While responding to climate change is very much a global challenge we can make a significant contribution by developing our own practical responses here in Australia through such research and innovation. We need to ensure that the federal Labor government, in conjunction with city councils like Hume and local businesses, work together to see as many people as possible buying Australian made both here and around the world. At the launch last Thursday, Mayor Jack Ogilvie made the following comment: … our council's support for the Australian Made campaign is especially relevant in the current economic conditions. The message to buy locally and help protect local jobs takes on a great significance in times like these. I could not agree more with Mayor Ogilvie. Youth Allowance",163
197,Mr HUNT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to address concerns from within my electorate about the impact of changes to Youth Allowance. These are not hypothetical; these are real impacts on real people. It will affect their capacity to pursue their own education, to prosecute their dreams and to take steps forward. I want to deal with this in terms of the problem and also the solution. The problem has three parts. The first is about the human aspect. It is illustrated by Kieran Stubbs, from Mount Martha. Kieran's mother, Amanda Stubbs, approached me. Her boy is vision impaired. He has been taking steps to ensure that he qualifies for Youth Allowance through working. He acted on the basis of advice and in a belief that if he took personal responsibility he would be rewarded and allowed to proceed with his education. There is a real risk that by having to work for 18 months he will not be able to pursue his course-for the very simple reason that he is not able to extend his deferral beyond 12 months. That is the reality. A young boy is taking responsibility for himself, seeking to advance his education, earn money and do all that he can, yet the promise of that education is now put at risk. The second part of the problem is that Kieran's problem extends widely. Within my own electorate, I have been contacted by many people, particularly within the Bass Coast area, from Phillip Island and from the Bass Coast more broadly. These are folks who have a vision of doing something majestic in their life in terms of pursuing their education. Kieran's problem is a wider problem, in my electorate but also in many other electorates. Thirdly, there is a problem of principle here. This legislation, this spective change to Youth Allowance. It is not retrospective to sweep up people who have been acting in good faith. We oppose retrospectivity clearly on principle. But it is spective to pick up young people who had been working to be able to afford to study, to advance their knowledge and to contribute to society. That is an extraordinary principle which has been broken in this parliament, and we urge the government to rethink and to withdraw. The solution is very simple. We will take three clear steps to help protect Kieran Stubbs and other students like Kieran throughout the Mornington Peninsula, Western Port and Bass Coast and throughout rural and regional Australia. The first of those steps is to move amendments to the legislation so that students currently working to qualify for Youth Allowance under the existing rules will still qualify for that allowance in 2010. I think that is extremely important. Because the federal budget has been catastrophically blown, we face a future of debt and deficit that people such as Kieran will have to pay back. We know that this should cost in the vicinity of an extra $573 million. Therefore, the second part of our solution is not just about fairness but also about responsibility. In order to deal with the issue of cal responsibility, we propose to fund this extra expenditure through a reduction in the start-up costs of handouts proposed by the Rudd government. That means that, where students are due to receive $2,254, to be paid in two instalments, the coalition proposes to reduce this to one payment of $1,000except for recipients of the Veterans' Children Education Scheme-which should save approximately $696 million over four years. We would make those savings and then the third part of the solution would be to introduce $120 million of new rural and regional change, is a retro- scholarships. These three things will provide a solution for people such as Kieran, protecting against retrospectivity for those who are currently retroworking for the Youth Allowance, adjusting and reducing the new up-front payment and introducing a rural and regional scholarship. That is the way forward. (Time expired) Grandparents Raising Grandchildren",164
198,Mr ZAPPIA,ADJOURNMENT,"I take this opportunity to bring to the attention of the House, and in particular the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, issues raised with me by grandparents caring for their grandchildren. This is a matter that the member for Braddon raised in this place on 10 March. I will repeat some of the statistics he quoted on the night. These statistics go back to 2003 and may be well and truly out of date, but they are the best we have. There are some 22,500 families around Australia in which the grandparents are caring for their grandchildren. That equates to about 31,000 grandchildren being looked after by their grandparents. Considering that those are 2003 figures, and therefore six years old, and considering that there has been a disturbing increase in the number of children that are being cared for by grandparents, I would expect those fisfigures to now be much, much higher. There would also be many examples where children are being cared for by their grandparents and that is not recorded at all. So it is a prevalent issue in the community. Only last week I had grandparents contact me on three separate occasions to talk about the difficulties that they face as a result of having the responsibility of caring for their grandchildren. I will summarise some of the matters that have been brought to my attention. Using figures that are available from Victoria, 52 per cent of grandparents caring for grandchildren are doing so because of a son's or daughter's substance abuse problem. If you consider that that statistic would probably apply across Australia, you start to understand some of the issues that arise not only from the caring but from the underlying reasons for the caring. The first issue is that, the parents are victims of substance abuse of one kind or another, it is very likely that the children themselves have some serious health issues. Secondly, with the grandparents ultimately caring for these children, initially there was probably a custody dispute between the two parents. That in itself can be very traumatic for all parties concerned, including the grandparents and the children. Often, the dispute then flows over to the grandparents. So you have the two parents in dispute and then you have a further dispute between the parents and the grandparents who, at arm's length, can see what is best for the grandchildren and who have tried to intervene and are then caught up in that dispute. So the grandchildren become the victims but the grandparents become the meat in the sandwich, and they need help. They need help with the cost of looking after their grandchildren and they often need help with the cost of the legal battles that ensue. In one of the cases that were presented to me last week, something like $80,000 was lost by the grandparents in their efforts to do the right thing by their grandchildren. Again using some statistics that I have been able to source, 80 per cent of grandparents caring for grandchildren own their own home and therefore, if there is a legal dispute of some kind, they are not eligible for legal aid of any sort. They are inevitably referred to as asset rich and cash poor-cash poor because as grandparents they are more than likely simply living off the pension. As carers they face enormous costs. If, however, they were given the same level of benefits as foster carers are given in states like New South Wales, Tasmania and Western Australia, it would make a significant difference to their ability to properly look after their grandchildren. So I bring to the House's and the minister's attention the need if to raise this again at a COAG meeting and see if we can get some uniform laws across Australia, for the sake of the grandparents and, in particular, the grandchildren. Firstly, with respect to the support payments they get, the foster payment equivalent should be uniform throughout Australia. Secondly, where there are some legal battles to be fought, the legal aid system should take into account the needs of grandparents who are doing such a wonderful job in trying to pick up the pieces of broken families. The issue of broken families is one that I am sure concerns all members of this House and, if we can somehow address it, we would be making a huge step forward.",165
