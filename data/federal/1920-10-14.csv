14,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown," That the first item in the Estimates, under Division I - The Parliament-namely-The President, £1,100 be - agreed to. Upon which Mr MCWILLIAMS had movedThat-the item be reduced by £1.  cluded my remarks last evening by a reference to the statement in the Budget that the Postmaster-General's Department, after an additional sum of £711,500 has been provided for telephones and other facilities of communication in the country districts, will show a surplus of £1,240,000. In my opinion, it is the accepted policy of this House that that Department shall be regarded as a public utility, ancl not as a profit-making machine; and, therefore, I should like to know why the Treasurer has taken credit for this profit? The in creasing of means of communication in country districts has been so strougly advocated by members that the amount set down for additional works of this kind must be approved; and, in my opinion, the expenditure of the money is wise economy. But I cannot approve of making revenue by means of the Post Ofiice. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) seems to see no way out of our financial difficulties except the disMAKING. covery of splendid oil supplies within Australia.",20
15,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"I did not say that.  to know exactly what the honourable member did say, if he denies that in his concluding remarks he made a statement to that effect.",20
16,Mr BRUOE,Unknown,"I said that some such discovery might, perhaps, lighten the burden suddenly and unexpectedly, otherwise we should have to rely upon our production for help.  ber will find it difficult to convince the Committee that he did not give doleful expression to what might happen if something of the kind did not occur. All that I can see in the Budget now before us is an artificial attempt to carry us over the present time. I can see in it nothing of the kind suggested by the Prime Minister (Mir. Hughes) during the last general election, when he told the people that since Australia was a producing country we could hope to shift our burden of debt only )>y the stimulation of production. The old methods adopted by the most antiquated Governments are followed in 'this national balance-sheet. We find the Government resorting to the levying of heavy duties on the goods that are consumed by the people, as well as to additional taxation, without any discrimination as to the form or incidence of that taxation, so that it falls most inequitably upon the shoulde|rs of some, while it lightens the burdens of others. There is no hisjh road to prosperity except that, of production in Australia. There is no artificial means of arriving at prosperity by the juggling of funds or taxation. This is essentially a producing country. Our public debt today, owing largely to the war and also to extravagant administration in the past, is a very heavy one to be borne by onr small population. I do not wish, however, to sound a pessimistic note. I have as much faith in the potentialities of Australia as has any citizen of the Commonwealth. I believe that it is possible for us to get r i d of this burden cf debt if we get to work properly, but I clo not see in this Budget any attempt on the part of the Government to properly 'set about the task. We find combines in all directions.. have a. combine of labour to> defend its interests-to sell its commodity highest price that it is possible to extract from the community and to give as little as possible of its commodity. We find the merchants-the suppliers of the peoplealso in combination, ""with the object of extracting as much as they can from those who must pay them for their We find these two combines working hand and glove to impose upon themselves a heavy burden of Customs duties, which essentially bring up the cost of living, although, for some reason, they do not appear to recognise that fact. I do not think the Government will attempt one moment to contend that the increased duties for which the Tariff schedule recently submitted to the House are necessary for protective They are really proposed as a short cut to additional revenues for an impecunious Government, utterly regardless of whether  such duties will help or hinderthe Commonwealth. It is to me singular that men who complain of the high cost of living will back up these high duties. We find the two combines to which I have referred, desiring to obtain foodstuffs from the primary producers of Australia ' for less than it is possible to obtain those supplies in any other part of the world. They are combining against 'the producers, and by means of heavy levies they place upon their shoulders burdens which make it hard for them to compete with other countries. It is urged in this House that onr primary ' products, in respect of which there is no Protection whatever, shall be given to the members of these two Combines, because of the force of their power, and the number of .their votes, for less than' they can be obtained elsewhere. That is the demand made in respect of sugar, jam, butter, bread, and meat. All these things we in Australia are asked to supply to these two great Combines for less than they can be obtained in any other country. We primary producers have not asked for a Protective Tariff for our industries. We ask the Government to call tenders for the food supplies of the people; and'we know that if they do we shall be the successful tenderers every time. Australia being essentially a primary producing country, it should be the first We duty of this or any other Government so to exert themselves as to stimulate our at the natural resources in order that we may cover our national debt. But what do we find? What, for instance, is the position in regard to taxation ? Every one knows that the revenue of the primary producer, . whether he be a producer of butter, sugar, f r u it , or wheat,-is spasmodic - This year wares. he may make a loss; next year lie may make a couple of hundred pounds, and so on. Assume that such a man, in this spasmodic fashion, receives £10,000 in five years, and compare his position with that of a member of the medical profesfor sion, or a Judge, or other salaried man, who can regulate his income at £2,000 a year, and thus has an income of £10,000 provides in. respect of the same five-year period. purposes. We have these two citizens of the same country, speaking the same language, receiving £10,000 in five years. The man receiving his sure £2,000 per annum, and £10,000.in five years, pays to the Taxation Department £ 7 1 0 . The producer who, in the same period, receives the same total income, but in spasmodic sums from year to year, according to varying natural conditions between drought and opulence, pays £1,500 odd to the Taxation Department. The individual with a certain revenue, who knows what he is going to get ancl can arrange his expenditure accordingly and invest his margin after paying for the upkeep of his household, is charged, under our taxation system, £ 7 1 0 ; whereas the other, earning an equal income during the same period, must pay more than double. That is not British justice, nor is it calculated to stimulate the business of the producer in Australia. And , although a Commission has now been appointed, I am afraid it is a. case of the geese being put to watch the oats. An independent tribunal, with an instruction to put this inequity right, should be appointed by the Government, and this unfair exaction from the producing community should not continue for one hour longer. It may be asked, in what way can Government reduce expenditure? It is sad state of affairs if the Government not find some means for reducing expensaw diture below' their latest estimates. When the Commonwealth Legislature Turner-fo was inaugurated the estimated expendipancy ture was not beyond £750,000. Of course, Commonwealth Departments have in creased; but today there is involved a lous condition. fabulous sum amounting to more than £S,000,000 per annum. The Commondid wealth and States are closely allied. Tliere are more than a quarter of a million public servants in Australia today, witli a salaries biU amounting t £35,000,000 per annum. I was not opday. We have fought a great fight. Ou "" posed to an arrangement being made i connection with the Public Service Bill , mendous credit. to place some capable person, or persons, in positions of authority, who' would a free hand to see that our huge Deto partments-whic h are rapidly growing and becoming ever more and more a burface den upon the people-shoul d be adminisof tered in a business-'ike manner. I dofoes. not care how much the Government may propose to spend upon the right man, or men, because such expenditure will amount to true economy. If honourable, members examine the report of the Ecoest, nomies Commission they will discover best possible evidence that such an ap pointment is neeessary; ancl, no matter how quickly the appointment is made, it will be in no sense too soon.",20

18,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I will if T can.  feeling-and it is riot a new one-that the Public Service may reasonably soon be classed as another combine. There is a feeling that the Public Service must not be touched - There appears to be diffidence in dealing with it as a business concern. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce), in that notable address of his last night, made reference to the only really successful loan recently raised by an Australian State. He referred to that of Victoria, and he attri* buted the success to the good governance of this State. I look back some twenty-five years for the cause underlying the success of this latest Victorian loan, when a man was in charge of the Victorian the Treasury.who was really strong, and who a was indifferent to people's opinions. He canset out with a pruning hook; he the condition of Victoria, following upon tlio land boom, and Sir George r it was he who was in occuof th© Treasury-inaugurate d a policy by which Victoria has ever since, benefited. Victoria was then in a parThat man saw exactly what was required to be done, and he it . There were many howls raised, but many of those people who then howled have lived to bless the late Sir George Turner. Such another man, with o a similar view-point, is looked for to7 n fighting men have done Australia treWe have beaten the enemy; but the conflict has created anhave other enemy within our gates-. I refer the enemy of debt-ou r national obligation-and it behoves every citizen to that obligation in the same spirit unity as our fighting men faced their",22
19,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"May I interpolate that another reason for the good government of this State is that it is the smalland its requirements the most easily the gripped. It is the most easily governed of all the States.  late Sir George Turner found its Public Service a nettle, which had to be firmly grasped. I am not against efficiency in the PtVdic Service. I am not averse from the proper payment of those who render value for their services in any business or Department. But the Public Service should bestrictly examined by a capable man, or men, who should be equipped with requisite power of action.. In the press of their overshadowingly important legislative business the Government have shut out a little measure which I had proposed in order to involve a saving of £50,000 per annum. action of members of this Legislature in awarding to themselves, at this time, additions to their salaries involving £50,000 a year has, to a considerable extent, robbed this Legislature of its prestige. - We were obliged, as managers of the Commonwealth, to exhort the people to the strictest economy; but, as we preached we should have practised. However, I hope I shall have another and more suitable opportunity to express my opinions upon this subject. I have already drawn attention to the iniquitous taxation which has to be borne by those who obtain a livin g from the soil. I have received from the H o n . John Scaddan, Minister for Mines in Western Australia, a letter, in which he says:I would draw attention to the unfair incidence of taxation in connection with the mining industry here. That is another industry we should encourage. W it h a proper policy we might discover some of those oil deposits to which the honourable member for F l in ders (Mr Bruce) referred last night, or another Eldorado like the Golden M i l e As you are aware,, under the Federal law, in the event of a prospector making a discovery worth, perhaps, £1,000 or so, he is taxed on the full value for that particular year. It may be that lie has battled along for a number of years, barely making a living, and, in some cases, subsisting only on the backing he obtains from his supporters. In this State we think it would be better if the tax were imposed spread over a number of preceding years, i.e., if a prospector earned at the rate of £50 to £80 per annum for five years, and in his sixth year made a discovery on which he realized the sum of £1,000, five years with all deductions and exemptions should be taken from the total amount of £1,000, and tax paid only upon the balance. The same thing also applies to the sale of leases. In a thousand ways primary production, which is the most important activity of the Commonwealth, is almost entirely disregarded. I have received from the fruit-growing community in Western Australia a communication which shows how the fruit-growers have been grossly fleeced owing to the difficulty and costliness of getting their products to market. After all we have done for the Mother Country, the Imperial Government has placed a restriction on the sale of Australian f r u it in England. There was a period during which American f r u it was allowed to enter England free of any restriction, The but now a restriction has been placed on both American and Australian fruits. We were informed by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) yesterday that the Imperial Controller of Foods .iutends to reimpose the restriction on the 15th November with a slightly higher fixed price. During last year our f r u it was sold in England under these restrictions, but the buyers transferred it from the cases in which it was lauded into paper or cane baskets, and sold it for almost any price they chose to ask. In that way they were exploiting the Australian fruit-grower.",22
20,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"The f r u it ring made over 50 per cent, profit by that one transaction.  one of the co-operative f r u it societies in Western Australia setting for t h the tremendous costs whioh the grower has to meet before his product leaves Australian shores, making it almost impossible for him to continue production. The f o l lowing is a list of the charges incurred:Per Case, is. d. Railage (truck rate) . . . . . 0 -4 Incidental charges .. 1 .. 0 li Freight .. .. ..8 0 Ordinary. Insurance .. 0 3*.

The balance left to the grower on rails on the foregoing basis is about 6s. 2d. per case. Add to this the cost of cartage from the orchard, 3d. per case (which would be quite a fair average); 4d. per case for picking and carting to the orchardists' packing shed; reduce the net return to 5s. 7d. per case. In addition to this, of course, there is the spraying, ing, pruning, upkeep of the orchard, &c, interest on capital invested, which, obviously reduces the net profit considerably. Australia is a country of primary production. According to Mr Knibbs' statistics for 191S, Australia bas derived its wealth from the following sources:Agriculture, £58,000,000; £98,297,000; dairy, poultry, and beefarming, £33,738,000; forestry and fisheries, £7,137,000; mining, £26,156, 000; and manufactures, with all the centralized efforts, assisted by Tariffs and ideal working conditions, £75,261,000. total wealth derived from primary production was £223,408,000, as against the total of £75,261,000 from secondary industries. When it is obvious from tbose figures that practically the whole of our wealth is won from primary production, would we not make much more profit by applying a little more energy to the increase of that production- a policy with which I have heard the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) express sympathytban by seeking to establish hot-house industries in the cities? We have raised tb. Tariff wall so high that the combine of labour wishes to wo.rk shorter hours, and to enjoy the products of the primary producers' labour at cheaper prices than are paid anywhere else in the world, whilst the machines used in such production are dearer than anywhere else. A policy of that kind does not stimulate primary production. Neither price-fixing, embargoes, regulations, nor other artificial expedients will overcome the problem thab is here presented. The great necessity is increased production, which connotes honest labour on the part of those-who work with us. With' increased production we may anticipate a lower cost of living and a reduced burden of public debt. There is absolutely no other way by which those two desirable ends may be attained. By merely imposing additional taxes to meet debts that are falling due we are creating an artificial solvency, and are, indeed, adopting theMicawber-like attitude of paying our : debts with a promissory note, and then saying, "" Thank God, that is settled."" The honourable member for Plinders (Mr Bruce) was quite right when he referred to the increasing obligation of our recurring debt. At the opening of this cultivatParliament, this recurring debt was something like £21,000,000 a year, and today it is over £25,000,000. This debt will rapidly increase, because the renewal of every loan will involve a greater burden of interest. We, therefore, are faced with an annual recurring debt, which pastoral, before this year expires will represent over £30,000,000. That obligation is not to be met by any artificial shuffling of the cards, but by actual production. There is another item - althoug h I see 1 it is provided from loan-of £3,000,000 The towards Commonwealth ship construction. I am not one who would readily cast aside the project of ship construction in Australia. It was an excellent idea during the war, and I think it has been evidenced to most Australians that ship construction, after some blunders, can be carried on effectually in this country. How successful in the future we may be in the matter of competition with other couutries is doubtful. I would, therefore, urge the Government to go extremely "" slow ""-to make haste slowly iv. the matter of Commonwealth ship construction. I would not advocate abandoning the project entirely, but would rather keep our shipbuilding paraphernalia in progress, so that we may remain in touch with shipbuilding. I desire, however, to strike a note of warning in my humble way against any excessive attempt to compete in shipbuilding with' other parts of the world. Mr Knibbs tells us that there is more tonnage afloat today than there was before the war. In other directions, honourable members know that when a commodity, such as potatoes, is cheap, and no profit is being made, nobody enters the business. The result is that the following year potatoes are £25 or £30 a ton, asd this tempts numbers of people to undertake their production, only to find, in the next year, that the price has dropped to unprofitable dimensions. To-day, everybody has a - mania for shipbuilding; and in some ports, where ships were never built before, a great number of steamers have been turned out. The United States of America got the craze, and the Old Countiy accelerated construction, with the result, as I said before, that there is more tonnage afloat today than before the war. With the extra freightage that is involved as an aftermath of the war, we shall inevitably find at no distant date a great slump in shipping; and, therefore, while it is advisable to keep in touch with shipbuilding, any attempt at construction, at a great rate would be unwise and unsafe, and likely to result in loss. I feel that the item to which I refer might quite easily be written down by £1,000,0.00.",23
21,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,But these are commitments; they are a liability that has been incurred.,25
22,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Bendigo-'Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [3.15] - The  has been giving us his ideas on matters of very great importance, in regard to which it is well we should all speak freely. Even those who are intrusted by this House with the government of the country must necessarily derive great benefit from the advice and criticism of their fellowmembers. The honourable member has spoken of the position in which the country finds itself today, ancl, although he said he imposed an embargo against sounding a pessimistic note, I am bound to say, after listening most carefully to him, that his speech has most profoundly depressed me. The honourable gentleman peers into the future with gloomy eye: he foretells catastrophies, falls in prices of primary products. He instanced potatoes as an example. In his opinion the potato market would go down like a plumb-bob. When he knows that I , myself, have started as a potato-grower, he will realise the effect of his gloomy prophesies. However, putting subsidiary matters on one side, the honourable member's remarksI regret that I had not the advantage of liearing other honourable members-were, » by-and-large, directed to two matters-^one, the necessity - for economy, and the other for the production of more wealth. I have never in my life met a man, either in this Parliament or outside, who was not heart and soul in favour of both those propositions. I have, course, met people who, while enthusiastically in favour of economy, declined to apply it to themselves; in fact, I have - never met anybody who did willingly so apply it. I have met people in favour of producing more wealth whose contributions towards the sum of the nation's riches might be expressed by a cypher. However, viewed in the abstract, the honourable member's propositions comtnieud themselves to us all. We are all in favour of economy. Of course, we, no more than any one else, begin with economy at home, and of this the honourable member has reminded us. He will permit me, I hope, to remind him of the fundamental difference between doctrine and conduct. It is very ea3.y to be a Christian if one's claim to be such depends on words; it is not quite so easy when one'3 claim is to be based on conduct. The honourable member told us many, things, but he did not tell us how w.e can substantially economize or how we could actually produce more wealth. He had something to say about a probable collapse of the potato market, about a restriction imposed by the British Government on ths price of Australian fruit, and about taxation; but surely he will not seriously affirm that if the difficulties he mentioned were adjusted-and those within the power of this Parliament to adjust are being adjusted-the work of those who seek economy would be completed, or that production would be sufficiently increased. My right honourable colleague has already expressed his approval of assessing taxation on a quinquennial basis. i Sir JosEni COOK--We are going tb do it.",25
23,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"When a deputation waited on me I said, - without committing my colleague, with whom I had not then had an opportunity of discussing the matter, that personally I was in favour of it. The 'honourable gentleman emphasized the fact that the greatest part of our wealth comes from the pastoral, agricultural, aud mining industries. Some persons are inclined to overlook the fact that, in the main, Australia depends for its prosperity on the sale of its primary productions; but I have never failed to emphasize this point, as the hono f ' orable gentleman himself admitted. But this is a wonderful country, and we are a many-sided people. The honourable gentleman spoke rather contemptuously of the £75,000,000 which was the value of the production of the manufacturing in dustries of this country in 1918. doubt this was only a third of the value of the primary products, which were worth £220,000,000, yet, nevertheless, it was of considerable importance, and when the figures for this year are available, 'the honourable member will find that the manufactures of this country are progressing by leaps and bounds. And this increase in production is due to the policy of the Government through the T a r i ff and other inducements to manufactures. It is easy for him to tell us to econow mize, and to say that what the country wants is more production; but I ask him, and others who thus criticise the Government, to tell us just how we are to produce more, to let us have some better way than the Government is pursuing of increasing production, and to tell us just whore we are to economize-the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) put that question very pertinently last night, but it has elicited no reply. Let me remind the honourable member for Swan of what the Government has done to increase the production of wealth in this country. During the war, as he knows, we found a market for the produce of the country, and provided freight for carrying it to that market, so far as freight was obtainable. During the war, when no man knew whether wheat would be saleable or not, we gave a guarantee to the grower of 4s. a bushel. Since the war we have offered a guarantee of 5s. per bushel at railway sidings for wheat. He will hardly say that that offer has not borne good f r u it . He spoke in rather a melancholy fashion, when dealing with the potato market, of the vagaries of the world's parity, and of the local parity, so that he must know that it is one thing to grow an article and another thing to be certain of marketing it profitably. But .every man who sows wheat in this country knows that, at the worse, he will get for it 5s. per bushel, which is much more than he could get for it before the [230] war. Then the Commonwealth has, at the invitation of the four wheat-growing States, joined a Pool for the purpose of securing the world's parity for our wbeat. Those are two notable and 'fcaugible No efforts that we have made to increase production.  duction of 4,000,000 acres in the area under cultivation.",25
24,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I clo not think that the honourable member will seriously contend that the offering of a guarantee of 5s. per bushel for the production of wheat reduced the area under - cultivation. At the present :ti-me the Government - is endeavouring to find freight for our wheat, and to market it , ancl I think that the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) ill say that in doing that we tire doing something to help the man on the land. During the war, and. since, we have done what was possible to find markets for the primary products of Australia. As to the secondary industries of the country, which the honourable member seemed to treat rather contemptuously, the Government was returned on a definite policy for their encouragement, and to that policy we have given effect. We said that we would encourage manufactures by imposing a protective Tariff. No doubt, it is impossible to frame a Tariff which will .meet with everyone's approval, but I venture to say that, considering the needs of the community by and large, the Tariff that has been in troduced will be a substantial and permanent means of increasing our productivity. We have also taken steps to assist the production of wealth by providing means for insuring the maintenance of industrial peace. The honourable gentleman seemed to leave out of his consideration that factor in production. Without labour nothing could be produced ; unless we have industrial peace it is idle to talk about producing more wealth. The Government during this session has passed measures providing ample facilities for the settlement of industrial disputes. And , as a consequence, a very serious industrial struggle has been avoided. Thus, by giving a guarantee to the farmers, by becoming a member of the pool for the marketing of the wheat, by imposing,a Tariff for the encouragement of manufactures, and by providing means for the settlement of industrial disputes, we have done what we could to encourage production. ,  the primary producer?",26
25,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"A Tariff may do a great deal for the primary producer. Yesterday a gentleman informed me that he had twenty-six tons of lemons, which he could not sell, because of the campetition of imported lemons. He wanted protection against the imported article. Human nature, when probed, seems to be always the same at the bottom. Every man who has anything to sell wants the .best price for it . If he is selling his labour, he joins a union; if he is a farmer, he wants the world's parity, and is not satisfied until he gets it ; if he is a manufacturer, he asks for a Tariff, and makes our lives miserable until we give him one. The Government is carrying out its pledges, aud is endeavouring to develop the great resources of the country. We are speeding up the Murray River water conservation work, and this afternoou my colleague (Mr Groom) laid on the table reports on the subject. We are endeavouring to secure the unification of railway gauges. I was sorry to .read in the press that one honourable member has taken exception to our proposals for the unification of the railway gauges of Australia. I should think that no on© thing could do more to help primary and secondary production, and to develop the resources of the country, than the unification of the railway gauges. No one thing has been such a hindrance to the free flow of oommerce, and-apar t from' the direct effect of droughts-ha s cost the country more in losses of stock, than the present system of diverse gauges. The Government is committed to the unification of the railway gauges, and will endeavour, with the co-operation of the States, to remove the hindrance to free traffic which, under present conditions, exists. I could amplify what the Government done, and is doing, in encouraging pro-duction; but time will not permit. I come now to the question of economy, to which the honourable member referred. in favour of economy, but he ventured to grapple with the subject only in relation to the Public Service of Australia. says that the Public Service is"" growing.. Is that remarkable? He says that it was not so big nineteen years ago. Of course it was not. Is the fact of its growth per se a fact to bp deplored? In the case of a private firm, it is considered to be rather an evidence of progress that it employs twenty or thirty times as many people as it did twenty years before. I agree with every honourable member that we should have value for our money, but I do not for one moment think that we get good value for our money unless we give value for services rendered. ",27
26,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The honourable 'membra perhaps does not realise that every member of the Public Service is as much a citizen as he is, and has just as many rights as he has. The purchasing power of the sovereign having been reduced to something like 12s. Cd., the public servant, corralled as be is bet-ween the f o u r corners of the Act, does not receive the consideration to which he is entitled. While I am one of those who will always support the honourable member in demanding from every servant of the Commonwealth a f a ir day's work ",27
27,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I know; but the honourable member made very light of giving our public servants a fair return for their labour. The public servant bas no more right to be singled out in this way than has any one else in the community. He has as many rights as any one else, and I have always endeavoured to preserve them to him. The only contribution that the honourable member made to the debate on the question of economy was the suggestion, which he did not amplify, that we should "" take it out "" of the Public Service. He eulogized the late Sir George Turner, a gentleman who was very well 'known in' this House, and was admired and re has spected by all of us. This Government, however, is not in favour of any more Black ^Wednesdays. It does not crave for that kind of distinction. We seek the He is support of the people of this country on quite different grounds. The honourable member for Swan  economy. He says that the Budget is not satisfactory, and his Leader (Mr MCWilliams) bas moved that the first item be reduced by £ 1 , as a direction to the Government to reduce its proposed expenditure by £1,000,000. did not have an opportunity of hearing the Leader of the Country pary, but, so faT as I'know, the honourable member did not indicate the direction in which we should cut down.",27
28,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,He spoke of two items-Defenc e and high salaries.,28
29,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,The salaries members ? Sir JOSEPH. COOK - No .,28
30,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I am sure he has too much sense to suggest anything of the kind. I am not going to say that every ther item in the Budget must necessarily be approved by a majority of this Chamber, but I do say that it is not business-like proper to give a general direction Government to reduce its Estimates .£1,000,000. What items are we to down? - He does not tell us. If we this is make reductions, these would again have to run the gauntlet of criti cism. One man wants one item cut down, and another quite a different one. If an amendment had been moved to cut down the Defence estialone. mates by £1,000,000, we could have for Defence. discussed it on its merits and have shown to the Committee, I think, the danger too of such a proposal. If , in spite of the Committee decided to take the reifc was too little. sponsibility of exposing this country grave risk, the Government would conwhen sider whether in all the circumstances should agree to it ; but one thing is certain: the Government cannot take a direction at, large. Honourable members, I am sure, will agree that whafc I suggest is the proper course. If honourable members wish, when we proceed to discuss the items detail, to move a reduction, we shall prepared to consider every proposal on its merits. While. I do not say the Government may not consider some items of such vital importance as to protest most strongly against their reduction, still, speaking of the items generally, we are prepared to be guided by the expressed opinion of .the mittee. I repeat, however, that we can-' not accept a direction at large. It would have been well if those orable members who have urged economy [231]- 2 had analyzed the Budget and had said where we should cut down. This Budget provides for practically the same I expenditure as was agreed to last year; but of the proposed expenditure, the amount provided for out of loan is £20,000,000 less than last year. Surely that is same evidence of a desire to economize ou the part of the Government. The extent to which we depend upon war loan money has been reduced, although our ' obligations to the soldiers of remain. An expenditure of £7,000,000 on account of our soldiers ' has been lifted from loan account, and provided for out of revenue. In addition to this, roughly speaking, we provide for f u r taxation amounting to only £2,000,000. W it h the surpluses of in creased revenue, and £2,000,000 addior tional taxatiou, we are meeting out of to a revenue about £16,000,000 more of by expenditure than we did last year.. cut Surely it can hardly . be said that not some evidence of wise and prudent economy. Honourable mem- bers, perhaps, do not appreciate the fact that out of a total proposed expenditure of £98,000,000, a sum of £62,241,000 is in respect of soldiers In addition, there is £7,000,000 It is true that some honourable members have said that that is much. I hope the day will that, never come when they will say that We can discuss to the amount, however, on its merits we come to the Defence estimates. it These two expenditures of £62,241,000 for soldiers alone, and £7,000,000 for Defence, account in round figures for £70,000,000 oat of the total proposed expenditure of £98,000,000. Then we have £5,250,000 for old-age pensions. That amount cannot be touched. There is also a sum of £6,775.000 in'respect of in the per capita payments to the States. be We offered to touch that item at the Premiers' Conference last year, but all that the Premiers objected. If any honoiable member seriously suggests fchafc we should touch it , this is the place, and now is the time, for them to speak. The Government will listen to what they have to say. If they are not prepared Combo do so, then they must face the fact that for all practical purposes £82,000,000 out of the total expendihonture of £98,000,000 cannot be touched. 5652 Budget [REPRESENTATIVES. ] Then it is said that high salaries should he cut clown. I'presume that the honourable member for Swan referred to the salaries of the higher paid officers, and not to the allowance paid to members. Air. PROWSE - I would include our own parliamentary allowance.",28
31,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I am sure that those who favour a reduction in the parliamentary allowance will never get a quorum in this House. Let us deal with this objection tpi.the increase i u the salaries of some of the higher paid officials. Curiously enough, this House asked the Governmeut to appoint a Commission, and, in consequence, the Economies Commissiou was appointed. That Commission is the child of the loins of this House. It went about its work, and made certain recommendations. One of those recommendations was that these salaries should be increased. The Government accordingly increased them. Honourable members of the Country party now tell us that we ought not to have done so. When I was speaking on the ouestion of salaries in this House a few days ago, I said, taking the head of my Department-Si r Robert Garran-as a case in point, that he was paid a shamefully inadequate salary, and he is now to be paid £2,000 a year. Does any honourable member say that he is too highly paid ? The honourable member for Swan may-have an idea of his ""own value, bufc I speak of what I know. Sir Robert Garran would have been appointed to a position in the Judiciary but for the fact that he is too valuable a man for us to lose. We cannot spare him. such a man only £2,000 a year. Is there in this city any lawyer who is his equal, who would work for the salary for which Sir Robert Garran gives such loyal, honest, and capable service? Take the salaries of the heads of the various Departments. If we want competence in the Public Service, we must pay heads of Departments and the staffs generally reasonable salaries. The honourable member for Swan, in referring to the Public Service, paid fchafc he wanted efficiency. It is a curious reflection upon the point of view of the critics of the Government that no sooner do we adopt the recommendations of the Commission which the Parliament itself insisted IIDOII than our critics fasten upon them. They (1.920-21). condemn alike the criticised and the critic. We bring m a measure to place the Public Service under a Business Board. How does it fare? Not very well. What is it that honourable members of the Country party want? Do they desire business efficiency in the Public Service. Do they believe in a. Business Board? The Government brought down a Bill providing for such a Board because the Commission recommended it , and because the House apparently wanted it . I am not particularly enamoured of the proposal, and I hope that no honourable member will spare his vote with the idea of sparing my feelings in the matter. If honourable members throw out the proposal the responsibility is theirs-no t ours. One thing I want to make clear is that, while we arc perfectly willin g to discuss with the Committee every item, of the Budget, we cannot accep't a direction at large such as is covered by the amendment.  planation, I wish to point out that I did not say that I desired to make the proposed saving out, of the salaries of public servants. I did say-and Hansard will show it-that I desired efficiency in the Public Service, and that efficiency should be determined by a competent person, or persons, who should be appointed, no matter what amount of salary might be in volved tliereby. ,",29
32,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"Wilmot ) [3.53] The figures contained in the Budget, when compared 'with those having to'do with a pre-war Budget, are somewhat staggering. We pay Australia has scarcely increased her population in the years between, but now our people have to meet tremendous outgoings, and the situation is such that one faces Australia's great financial problems with diffidence. It 13 very difficult to meet, the Treasurer's challenge to place one's finger upon a specific item in regard to which considerable retrenchments can be effected. A f t e r all, it is for the Treasurer himself to show that he has done his best to cut down expenditure, and that he cannot reduce further. In contemplating our enormous expenditure, amounting to £68,000,000, it must not be forgotten, of course, that about £1S,000,000 of this is to be paid out of revenue which, previously, was met from loan money. That indicates a step in the right direction; but the Treasurer should show that, ir. regard to many items detailed in the Budget, he had found it impossible to do better by way of reduction. The Treasurer, as a matter of fact, has not proposed or revealed any definite line of policy for the reduction of expenditure. To-day we have abounding revenues and bountiful harvests, but we are not only spending all that we expect to receive this year, but are setting out to raise additional revenue by taxation, and to spend even the accumulated surplus of £5,000,000. We cannot go on like that year after year. We cannot expect our harvests to be always abundant and our revenues always to be abounding. I doubt, personally, whether the anticipated revenue for the current financial year will be raised. I am doubtful, for example, whether our Customs and Excise duties will be the means of realizing £26,000,000. I hope, of cqurse, that they will be; but if his estinvates of receipts are not realized it is to be presumed that the Treasurer will not spend as much mowey as is now proposed. That is how some of our surpluses have been obtained. The Treasurer finds that he has not the time, within the scope of one financial year, to spend all he bas proposed to lay out. The very fact that we are enjoying exceedingly good times renders our position the more acute. I speak of good times in the sense that we are getting such high values for our primary produce. While fortune favours, we should do our best to employ our abundant revenues in the best possible directions. There is no reason why we should spend the whole of our income, seeing that next year we may be by no means so prosperous. Although our figures in respect of primary produce are so high, the Treasurer bas demonstrated that he is fully aware that the actual volume of production has not expanded. Our greater returns are due to higher prices, and not to enhanced production. That fact applies not only to primary produce, but to manufactures as well. Although the value of our manufactures is much greater than some years ago, the total number of factories has by no means proportionately increased. During the financial year 1913-14 exports were valued at,£78,571,000, and in 1919-20 at £14S,564,000. Our-imports in 1913-14 were valued at £79,749,000, and in 191920 at £97,456,000.. There was an increase of 22 per cent, as regards imports, and of no less than S9 per cent, in respect of our exports. The output from our factories in 1913-14 was valued at £166,000,000, and in 191S-19 at £226,000,000. At the same time, however, the number of our factories had only very slightly increased. The Government have done something in the direction of economy. For example,- the Government have transferred items, involving an expenditure of between £16,000,000 and £18,000,000, for payment out of revenue. Those items had previously been' paid from loan money. That is a step in the right direction. There sbould have been more of that kind of thing during the war. We all see that now. There was one honourable member, however, wbo saw it while the war was being waged. I have often heard the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) speak in those terms in this chamber; but his warnings were not heeded, and today we are suffering accordingly. I trust that, year by year, until our dead-weight debts shall have been got rid of, we shall be able to increase our contributions from revenue to the sinking fund. The Treasurer has already practically demonstrated his belief in that policy. iSome days ago the Treasurer mentioned that he had cancelled something like £3,500,000 worth of notes. It is very important that, at the earliest possible moment, our note issue should be reduced to proper dimensions. In his Budget speech the Treasurer referred to the time when the note issue would be handed over to the Commonwealth Bank for control and management. He said It is expected that, in the hands of the Board,, the amount of the note issue will automatically contract and expand according to business requirements. It is to the credit of the Government that there has been already a large cancellation of our notes. Not only do we require to practise economy, but, at the sametime, to display a certain amount of enterprise. While we must save all we can, and cut our expenditure down to bedrock, our debts are such that we can only remain solvent by encouraging increased production. We must find some means of helping the people to increase the total, and value, of their productions. The Government have done a .little in that direction. A Bill has been passed in the terms which help is to be given to Western Australian farmers in the matter of erecting silos for their wheat. not say that the Government were not a little more generous than they need have been. I am not satisfied that the deal was strictly business-like from the point of view of the Commonwealth. The Government d id not guard the interests of the Commonwealth as closely as they might have done in regard to the security tor the nnoney advanced. The Western Australian Government should have taken the place of the farmers' organization i the negotiations with the Commonwealth, 30 that a more tangible security might have been offered. the less, I supported the scheme, bebe cause I was returned to Parliament on pledge to help the primary producer in avery reasonable way. If the harvests of Western Australia are as good as we they will be, we shall have no trouble getting our money back, and Western Australia will derive a distinct advanexpenditure, tage from the arrangement. That is one thing the Government have done. B u they will have to go further in helping primary industries. I have previously mentioned in the House the need for couraging the production of fuel oil for the Navy. To-day the Government paying for oil two or three times as much as they were paying a few years ago; I do not suppose you can buy o i l today state at less than £ 1 4 per ton.",29

34,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,I am glad fco hear fchafc. Bufc if the Government had made a contract with the Tasmanian Shale and Oil Company they would have been able fco gefc oil supplies from a local industry afc £4 10s. per ton.  the Commonwealth that the contract was uot made. The State Government turned ib down.,31
35,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"The State Parliamanufactures ment turned down the agreement, but the Federal Governments got o u t .of it soon as possible, and would not renew.",31
36,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,The Government refused to erect oil tanks at Devonport the before the oil was produced.,31
37,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"The Commonwealth entered into a contract with the of Tasmanian Government for the supply of 8,000 tons of oil per annum at a certain price. The Legislative Council reI do jected the arrangement, and the contract lapsed. The company then approached the Commonwealth for a renewal of the contract. I believe that one of the terms for which the company asked was that the Commonwealth should build oil tanks at Devonport. But the company was prepared to imake a reasonable arrangement, and I do net know tlfa t that condition would have been insisted . upon. The Navy Department has bungled - this matn ter, as it bungled a' great many others. Ifc has wasted more money in proportion to its expenditure than has any other NeverFederal Department. That could easily proved by detailed references; bufc I a do not intend' to continue that subject today, because the Treasurer cannot be held responsible for all expenditure. It is of the utmost importance to the people hope that our expenditure of £68,000,000 in fro m revenue should be handled in the wisest possible way. If at times unwise is incurred, the' Treasurer is not always to be blanr.ed. He cannot t watch over every detail of administration'. If anybody cares to analyze the tptall expenditure of £98,000,000 from enloan and revenue, it will be found that a great deal of it is unavoidable, and are represents statutory commitments.",31
38,Mr GABB,Unknown,"I call attention to the of the Committee. [Quorum formed.""]",31
39,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"The necessity for per primary production is so urgent that I hope the Government will do their utmost to assist oil production and the development of other forms of latent wealth. I ask the Minister for the Navy (Mr Lair d Smith) to keep in mind the Tasmanian shale proposition, and endeavour to come to a reasonable 'arrangement with the company, so that a local industry may be u l t of encouraged, and the Navy may be assured of local supplies of fuel. We must continue to draw the great bulk of our wealth from primary, production. Our are increasing by leaps and bounds, an'd I hope they will continue to as do so, because, by creating a big home market for the rural producer, they will stimulate the primary industries. There is no reason why we should not also in crease our exports of primary products, and I am satisfied that, if a policy of encouraging production is adopted, Australia, with sane financing, will soon tur n the corner and regain the road to general prosperity. In 1918 the primary production of Australia was valued at £223,408,000, and manufactures £75,261,000, representing a total production of £298,669,000. If vernment will stimulate primary production we shall have a big increase in our population by immigration. from overseas, a large number of people of the right type-thos e who wish to better themselves, and are not afraid to face the hardships of the back countryand, if we get them, wealth will increase at an enormous . rate.' The history of the United States of America shows that, whilst population has grown steadily during the last two centuries, wealth has increased even more rapidly.",31
40,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,So has the population.,32
41,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"I am speaking of the total wealth of the country. If the Commonwealth owes £360,000,000 that must be admitted to represent - heavy burden upon 5,000,000 people. But if in a few years, by sane government and enterprise, we unearth some of the latent resources which are as yet untouched, and which may represent thousands of millions of pounds-and that is quite possible if Australia is the country we believe it to be-the balance-sheet will present a much more satisfactory appearance.",32
42,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"There are too many "" ifs "" in your policy.",32
43,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"When an individual dies, his estate is wound up, but a country never dies; it grows richer as it grows older, and is able to set greater assets against its liabilities. This country has greater possibilities than anj' other in the world. In comparison with Australia, what chances of recuperation have the older countries of Europe, depleted of population, with devastated in dustries, and staggering under a tremendous load of debt? What are their undeveloped resources compared with those of a country like Australia, which has barely been scratched on the surface? I would despair of our 5,000,000 people being able to carry our tremendous load of debt if it were not for the latent resources Of the country. Even our established industries of mining, pastoralism, and agriculture are capable of tremendous expansion, but we cannot expect 5,000,000 of people to do all that is possible to be done. We must bave a big inflow of immigrants to help us. I aan< glad that the Government intend to emat bark upon an immigration scheme. All I hope is that, the scheme will prove the Go- a good one. We have not yet beard the details, but I am satisfied .that the Government will do their best in this direcWe want, t i o n ; and if the Commonwealth and the States will "" pull to g e the r the future of Australia will be assured.",32
44,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,The honourable member will recall that.a member of this House once said that the best immigrant we can have is the child born in Australia.,32
45,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"Eve n so, that is no argument against accelerating the in crease of our population by immigration, and, at the same time, I hope that the pauper Australian child will come along faster than before. Looking at the figures in the Budget, it is very hard to say where we can save any a great amount. Although the items are large, they are chiefly legacies of the war. On war expenditure alone we are spending from loan £20,000,000 less this year than last. W it h the exception of what is to be spent on Nauru Island, and in meeting some outstanding accounts in connection with the Expeditionary Forces, the money is being devoted to more or less reproductive works. It is also in our favour that, although we are spending huge sums due to the w a r - I mean on soldiers' homes, and in lending money to the States for repatriation purposes-it is uot direct war expenditure, as during hostilities. We are to get some return for expenditure of the kind, and even if some of the soldier settlers do nol prove successful on the land, as I am sorry to think some of them may not do. the money will still not be all thrown away, for, while we may lose something here and there, the land will remain. As I said at the beginning, the Govern - ment cannot expect the present abounding revenues to continue year in and year out. and, therefore, wo must at the same timr not go on spending all our revenue and all our surpluses. Though the sum we receive for our products is large, that is not due to increased production, but to better prices. One fact to which the Budget speech does refer is that our tonnage now is less than it was in pre-war days; and it is fairly claimed, I think, by the Treasurer that tonnage is a good measure of the volume of our overseas trade. In 1914 our inward overseas tonnage was 5,272,000 tons, and today, when we are receiving more, perhaps, than we were some little time back, it is only 3,696,000 tons. All this points to the fact that we have to be extremely careful to make the most of the money that comes to our hands. There are one or two other matters on which, I think, the Budget speech might have touched. It is admitted that a good deal of the expenditure is unavoidable, seeing that it is due to statutory enactments of .this Parliament.; but even this expenditure might be dealt with in an improved way. Although, under an im proved method, the recipients of invalid and old-age pensions, the maternity allowance, and so forth , should not in any way suffer, the burden of the community might be lightened. I do not know why the Budget speech does not inform us as to what it is proposed to do in this connection. No one more than myself would like to see invalid and old-age pensions increased to £ 1 per week. I know numbers of deserving persons who ought to be receiving pensions of that amount, in view of the services they rendered to the country during their working years.",32
46,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,What good is £ 1 week now ?,33
47,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,It is surely better than 15s. per week.,33
48,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,But you are estimating the services of these people at £ 1 per week.,33
49,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"I would pay them more than £ 1 per week if the country could afford it ; but we have come pretty weli up to our limit , and a new plan is necessary. We have to find some better means of financing .these pensions and allowances, not only for the benefit of the community, which has to find the morsy, bufc more particularly for the benefit of those who have to receive it We must stabilize our old-age pensions"" speeches ? scheme by means of some insurance system. I do not know whether insurance for unemployment, sickness, old age, maternity and so forth should be abolish embodied in one comprehensive Act something should certainly be done to obtain contributions from people during their working years. There must be some system of the kind, sooner or later, if we are to continue old-age pensions; and I only hope the result will be increased stability, and larger payments. The contributions to the funds for such a purpose ought to be made easy, and, if a person could not pay, exemption might Do granted so that the pension would be enjoyed in any case. Of course, people who could work, but would not, and, therefore, did not contribute, ought not fco be paid any pension; there is no-kindness in wasting public money in such a way. I know people drawing pensions at the present time who have done nothing for this country; they may have had somebody to depend on, and have had the luck to keep out of gaol, and today they are - really better off than before, because they have all their former advantages with the pension in addition. Other people, . whose services to the country have been great, are deprived of pensions on technicalities.  those undesirables to whom you refer, they have contributed .very heavily through the Customs.",33

51,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"I am not talking, about "" boozers."" Some of those who a are drawing pensions have let others do the contributing through the Customsthey have never contributed anything except for their own pleasure. I think there ought to have been .some proposal in the Budget to reduce the p r in t in g bill of the country. A year or two' ago the Public Accounts Committee, of which I was a member, presented a report on this subject, and if the Government refer to that report they will .

54,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"The proposed expenditure on the Federal Capital might . well have been left out of this year's Budget. It represents, to my mind, a mere fritterin g away of money. The compact with Now South Wales will have to be kept, but the means now proposed will bring us no nearer to the realization of the Federal city.",34
55,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"How about the twenty-eight different Commonwealth offices in Melbourne, for which the Government pay high r.ents, and which members find it very difficult to locate?",34
56,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"I know there are many buildings rented by the Commonwealth in Melbourne, and this also is a matter which the Public Accounts Committee inquired into and reported on some time ago. That report showed that there are at present Commonwealth buildings which could be so altered as to accommodate the Public Service, and that the alterations would not cost more, in a capital sense, than the interest we are now paying.",34
57,Mr WISE,Unknown,The report showed that it would not cost so much.,34
58,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"I think that the report showed that the rents today would pay interest and sinking f u n d on those buildings, 'so that, in a certain time, the Commonwealth could house the Public Service practically rent free. Another item which might well have been omitted from the Budget is the expenditure on the High Commissioner in America. There are altogether too many Commissioners and others going backwards and forwards. We have a High Commissioner at Home, but we are continually sending some one oversea to do work that he ought to do.",34

America has not been foolish enough to put her faith entirely in politicians. abroad the best men she could get to represent the country-me n like Russell Lowell, who adorned the positions that they filled. We should appoint as High Commissioner the best man obtainable. He may or may not be a member of this House, but wherever he may be, he should be got.  may be sent will be more than an ornament, to the office ",34
63,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"I hope so, too, because if we are not going to get. more for our expenditure on the up-keep of the office than we have been getting of late, I shall move, ov support, a motion for its abolition. I have nothing to say of the personnel of the Inter-State Commission. It is not their fault that the country has got so little return from their' services. We could have appointed, haphazard, fro m this House a set of men who would have given the same value. Ha d the Commission possessed the powers which it was the intention of the framers of the Constitution to give it, it might have done more. Whether it would' be wise to give it, greater powers, I am not concerned to say at this moment; but for all the good that it is as constituted, it might well be wiped out, and the £6,000 ov £7,000 a year which it costs saved. When the Northern Territory Agreement was before Parliament, I prophesied - as will be seen by any one who takes the trouble to refer to the Hansard record of my speeches-that for many years the Northern Territory would be a burden on the rest of Australia; but I did not think that things would be as bad as they have turned out. At the time, I urged modifications of the agreement, but the agreement was put through Parliament without being modified in any way, and exactly as it was presented to Mr Deakin, send about the then Prime Minister of the Com argument time was Premier of South Australia. The agreement was not fair to the rest of Australia, and one or two modificasuggest tions could have been made in it which would not have injured South Australia, but would have benefited Australia as a whole. The Government has 'attempted to do many things in the Northern T e r r i tory, but. everything that has been atSbe has sent tempted there has proved a failure. The right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) said, just before the last election, that, on the advice of the Economies Commission, expenditure in the Territor y would cease, except so far as it was necessary to conserve works that had been begun; that no new expenditure would be undertaken u n t i l the Government had determined on a definite scheme for the development of the Territory. I do not know what the Government intends, but, in my opinion, the Northern Territor y will develop as other parts of Australia have developed. It will be settled first by the big selectors, who will be gradually supplanted by smaller men. fields will be discovered, and towns will grow up - A country cannot be developed by rule of thumb.  the Northern Territory agreement, like the Tasmanian agreement, should be honoured? - Mr ATKINSON - It has been, honoured. Would South Australia take the Territor y back?",34
64,Mr GABB,Unknown,Yes ; when the Commonwealth has carried out its bargain.,35
65,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"Of course, it would take the Territor y back after the Commonwealth had paid all the debts incurred in regard to it , constructed r a i l ways, and spent money generally on its development; but, as I said when the agreement was being considered, and as events have proved, the bargain was not fair to the Commonwealth. At the time. I admitted that South Australia could not continue to maintain the Territory at its own expense for the benefit of Australia as a whole, but I would have modified the agreement between, the Commonwealth and that State. It cannot be said that the agreement has not been honoured. No time was fixed for the building of a - railway from Oodnadatta, and I am sure that, if the Government were in a position to say that the finances of this country would permit of the construction of the line now, no member would oppose it , because, even though it might not be thought a good business transaction, we should be, giad to have the agi'eement in respect of it carried out - Commonwealt I wish to know what the Government intends to do regarding the maternity allowance, which, at present, is a waste ef money. The women of this country do not benefit from this expenditure as. they should do; a better system would give U3 a good return in the shape of healthy children. We should do well to copy the example of New Zealand, and institute a nursing system which would decrease in f a nt mortality to a surprising extent, and would give us value for oiir expenditure. The object of this expenditure should be to provide every mother and child with the best attention and most skilful treatment obtainable at the time of crisis, not to iprovide £5 for every M in i ng woman who gives b i r t h to an infant. At the present time, very many mothers who do not need the allowance, and sliould never have been given the opportunity to get it , draw it .",35
66,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Apparently , the honourable member would make the allowance a charitable dole.",35
67,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"No ; but I do not believe in throwing money away. I would not confine the expenditure on necessitous cases to £5, but would give all the attention needed, whatever that might cost. If we followed New Zealand's example we should save a considerable amount, and get ten times as much for our expenditure.",35
68,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Ninety-eigh t and a half per cent, of the. women who have babies draw the allowance.",35
69,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,They have earned it .,35
70,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"I do not think that the women of Australia would feel flattered to be told that. 1 The Government promised to appoint a Commission to inquire into the system of taxation, and that promise sbould bave been carried into effect, because it was made in the policy speech at Bendigo, wben we were told that the appointment would be made at an early date. Therefore,^ the Commission should before now have been appointed, and its report should be before us. The Budget snould have been prepared after consideration of the Commission's report, and we should be in a position to deal with it in the' light of that report. I hope that the people of Australia will pull together and help their Governments h and State-to put the finances of the country in a satisfactory position.",35
71,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,What is your opinion about a tax on bachelors ?,36
72,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"I have before to day supported a tax on bachelors. What the country needs, as the Prime Minister has said, is that the people should put all their energies into pulling Australia through the tryalone, ing period which has followed the regret, war, much as when the war was in treatment progress our soldiers threw themselves into the work of saving the country. I that be done, and the Government are truly economical on the one hand, and properly enterprising on the other, taking some business risks here and there where big primary resources can be tapped, we shall come through successfully. We may even find' the big o i l supplies of which the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) spoke last night. In any case, our mineral, pastoral, agricultural, other resources are illimitable, and w i determination and a modicum of luck people should be able to pull the country out of its troubles with in a few years. Then, instead of our balance-sheet show that ing a tremendous debit, as it does today, we should have thousands of millions of power. assets to our credit, and Australia not take long to recover from the heavy burden imposed upon her by the war. We have illimitable resources, including the shale oil deposits, to which I have already directed the attention of the M i nister for the Navy, waiting to be, debeen broken. veloped, and all that we need is sane government.",36
73,Mr OONSIDINE,Unknown,Does the honourable member suggest that the present Governnow ment is not sane?,36
74,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"I suggest that what we need is sane government and safe finance. These, coupled with the termination of every individual in the comimunity to do his best to country through its financial troubles, - would soon put us on the high road to prosperity.",36
75,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [4.51] I agree with a good deal that has fallen from the lips of the honourable member who has just resumed but I also disagree with much that truth hs has said. The Leader Country party (Mr MCWilliams) has moved that the first item of the Estimates, which relates to the salary of the - ' President of the Senate, be reduced by £.1, as a direction to the Government to reduce the Estimates by £1,000,000. If that saving could be effected in respect of the naval and military expenditure I should be glad. I have, with to bring before the Committee the of certain soldiers now undergoing punishment for military offences. f Among the brave fellows who fought for us overseas was a man named Lloyd, who was one of the first to enlist in his district. He committed what, in_ military circles, is regarded .as a terrible crime, and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment which, in m y opinion, was altogether too severe. He is a dead shot, . nnd, had he desired to k ill an officer who had made his l if e a. perfect hell, he could and have done so. He merely tried to th frighten, him , however, and for thai the offence was'sentenced to a term of imprisonment which was subsequently reduced, on review, by an officer here. Now the war is over, I think that all such sentences should be reviewed by the civil That would be in accordance would with a promise made to me by Mr . Fisher, when Prime Minister, that the civil law would, always dominate the m i l i tary law, so far as all our troops were concerned. That promise, however, has There are at present in Pentridge certain military prisoners, in cluding the man Lloyd, who are starving themselves, and, if my information be correct, the medical officer in charge is cutting off their supply of water. , I sincerely hope that it is not true that this action has been taken, since, if these men are deprived of water, and continue to abstain from taking food, they must dedie within ten 'days. In an article on fasting in the' Encyclopaedia Britannica, p u ll the it is stated thatWhen entirely deprived of nutriment, the human body is ordinarily capable of supporting life under ordinary circumstances, for little more than a week. In the spring of 1S69 this was tried, on the person of a ""fasting g i r l "" in South Wales. The parents made a show of their child, decking her out like a bride oh a bed, and asserting that she had eaten no food his seat, for two years. Some reckless enthusiasts for sot four trustworthy hospital nurses to of the watch her. The Celtic obstinacy of the parents was roused, aud, in defence of tlicir imposture, they allowed death to take place in eight days. Their trial and conviction for manslaughter may be found in the daily periodicals of the date; but, strange to say, the experimental physiologists and nurses escaped scot free. . . . Various people have tried, generally for exhibition purposes, how long they could fast from food with the aid merely of water or some medicinal preparation; but these exhibitions cannot be held to have proved anything of importance.. A man named Jacques in this way fasted at Edinburgh for thirty days in 1888, and in London for fortytwo days in IfiflO. nnd for fifty days in 1891; and an Italian named Succi fasted for forty days in 1890.",36
76,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,Is there any case on record of a sane man having died as the result of a hunger strike?,37
77,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I know of no such case. The life of a man who abstains from taking food can be greatly prolonged by his resting in bed, and taking a full supply of water. I cannot say whether the doctor attending these men i i a military officer, but. I should be loath to think that a military doctor would be so cruel in his treatment of a fellow soldier as to deprive him of water. I am told that this has been done, but I am awaiting proof of the statement. If this action has' been taken, I shall want to know who ordered it. If the doctor did not receive any direction on the subject, he had no right to give such an order. I shall fellow up my protest with an attempt to secure further evidence on the subject, and if my information proves l o be correct, I think the House will join with me in urging fchafc, where a military prisoner determines to deprive himself of nutriment, no official, medical or otherwise, is justified in cutting off his supply of water. I have endeavoured on more than one occasion to obtain information as to the wages aud salaries of officers of this Parliament. That endeavour, however, has been thwarted by a gentleman whom I at one time looked up to, and whom I revered as one who loved his fellow-man, and was prepared to uphold the rights of the workers. I allude to the President, of the Senate. I dislike giving utterance to my thoughts on this subject, but I certainly cannot understand the attitude taken up by the President. What right has he to deny to any member of this Parliament information as to the salaries and wages paid to officers in fchis building.",37
78,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown, It is not in order to discuss the President of the Senate.,37
79,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Then I shall deal with the matter in another way. On a previous occasion, while you, sir, were acting as Deputy Speaker of the House, I made arequest to be supplied with this information, and that request was supported by the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes), who was most sympathetic. As Deputy Speaker, you were informed that the information was at my disposal. Portion of the required information was supplied to me, but it related only to officers of this House.",37
80,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,That is as far as fchis House can go.,37
81,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I understand that that is the position under the Public Service Act. If so, the Act should be amended. I do not think any honourable member desires that an officer of this Parliament, who is a married man, shall receive only £ 2 14s. a week. A married man who was employed in this building afc such a salary was told by a senior official that if he did not return to duty at once, he would lose his position. He was away on sick leave, but, in view of this direction, he returned to duty before he should have done, caught a chill, and died. He lef t a widow and children, whose blessings are uot likely to follow r.he officer who brought him back to work before he was fit to resume. We are expected to pay reasonable wages, and I should like to know in what industry outside a married man is receiving only £ 2 l is . a week. I have not a word of reproach fco utter in respect of Mr Speaker. He is a gentleman in every sense of the word, ancl prior fco the election of the ' present President, no such difficulty as this arose. Two men with gentlemanly instincts can carry out even faulty regulations to the benefit of those who have to obey them; but when a man adopts the role of dictator, so far as the supplying to this House of information on these matters is concerned, it is time for ns to amend the Public Service Act , and to show him that neither he nor the Governor General-who , by the way, would not stoop to do whafc the President is doing-shal l have such a power. The honourable member for Wilmo t (Mr Atkinson) and I must cross swords in regard to the maternity allowance, to which he would attach, the stigma of poverty, and possibly of charity. When I was in charge of the Maternity, department in St. Mary's Hospital,, London, I had under rny jurisdiction, as obstetrical officer, every maternity case which came into that institution or required assistance therefrom. I remember being called out one night to deliver a child- a babe which the Christ, 2,000 years ago, would have taken in his arms and blessed. It was a sad case-of such a character, indeed, that ,1 had to send for the Medical Superintendent. Together, with our sleeves rolled back, we fought for those lives. The life-blood of the mother was flowing away, and we could only hope to save her by the unremitting application of physical pressure. We relieved each other every five minutes, and directly we stepped back from the bed we had to sweep from our arms and bodies the loathsome, filthy bugs which were crawling all over the room and its occupants. If that mother could have be6u given material assistance, would she not have spurned such surroundings in which to bring her child into the world?",37
82,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"I said nothing to suggest that, in circumstances sueh as those, help should not be given.",38
83,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I am not. crossing swords with the lionorable member' in respect of this specific matter; but I ask him, in view of our world-wide knowledge of the deadly effects of .germ carriers today, what chance had that babe of reaching .maturity, born as it was into a world of poverty and squalor? So far as Australia is concerned, the very fact that almost the whole of our people have accepted the maternity bonus removes the stigma of charity. It was announced by the Treasurer not long ago that 98£ percent, of the mothers of Australia bad claimed the bonus. No one, then, can say that it is a charity.",38
84,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,The fact of its almost universal acceptance does not r i d the maternity bonus of that aspect.,38
85,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"It is no charity when the women of this nation, almost as a whole, claim it as their right. ever, I am not severely angry with the honourable member, because I realise that, as a crusty qld bachelor, he does not know much about the subject, after all. But if he has ever patted the head of a dog, or stroked the arching neck of a fine horse, and found pleasure therein, I assure him that he would find a far greater t h r ill in gazing upon the budding intelligence to be perceived in the eyes of an infant. I hope that the maternity allowance will not be decreased, and that it will never even be attacked. W it h respect to the old-age pension, it is absurd that one man should be able to own a house valued at £500, and that, so long as he lived in it and made it his home and did not earn more than 10s. a week, he could claim the full amount of pension; while another, who had money in the bank equivalent to the value of that house, should be prevented from participating in our pensions scheme. As a matter of fact, a house affords a far greater opportunity for securing an increase in value than does £500 when it has been put into a war loan.",38
86,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"The difference between the two cases is, that from one in vestment a man derives income, while fro m the other he does not.",38
87,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,Canno t a man earn 10s. a week by way of rent from his house ?,38
88,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"L f he did he would be debited with its value. He can only participate in. the pensions scheme so long as he lives in his own house, and earns nothing from it .",38
89,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"But he is allowed to earn up to 10s. He may live in a house of his own that is worth £1,000.",38
90,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,Perhaps so; but he must not derive income from it .,38
91,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Would the honourable member prefer to have £500 worth, of war bonds or a house worth £1,000? I think he will ask for time to consider that proposition. The whole position is wrong. One individual should not be penalized while the other remains free from all penalties. I hope to see the age limi t in connection with pensions reduced some day, and there should be a further reform in that the States should be required to contribute more than they do. There is still another anomaly. I refer to v the weekly amount of 2s. as pocket money How- for inmates of charitable institutions. The cost of tobacco has risen so high that this luxury must be almost out of reach of poor old pensioners in public institutions. Even members of Parliament, despite their recent increase of salaries, must find it hard to keep themselves in "" smokes."" We should endeavour to make matters as easy as possible for our unfortunate old folk, who, after all, were bom in God's glorious likeness. The honourable member for Wilmot (Mr . Atkinson) referred to the national insurance, and upon that subject we are in agreement. At one time Germ amy led the world with respect to national insurance; but when the British scheme was evolved it stood head and shoulders above the German system. I trust that when Australia shall have inaugurated national insurance our scheme will tower above the British system as the latter does above the German. To the Australian plan of national insurance both employer and employee should contribute. In Germany, and in Denmark, and Great Britain, that principle holds good. But, when we shall have established our system, we should make the unearned increment from all the lands of Australia furnish the contribution of the whole community. In that way our national insurance would become the greatest ever known. In a recent year it was estimated that the value of Australia amounted to £1,200,000,000. year later-and this was a war yeartbat colossal valuation had' risen to £1,645,000,000-a n enormous increase. I do not say that the whole of that sum represents the unearned increment of the land, but a very large proportion, of it does. The unearned increment during the next ten years, if it were applied to Australia's Army, Navy, and pensions expenditures, would totally relieve the Commonwealth Government in respect of those heads. - I desire to quote now from Alfred Russel Wallace, .the peer of every writer on land nationalization. In his ninetieth odd year Wallace, in his efforts bo find the cure for poverty, wrote and published a book entitled Social Environment Moral Progress. He, like myself, could not believe in a Creator if he thought that poverty could not be eliminated. with our high intelligence, we can attain to the standard of the ant and the bee. No ant or be© suffers from want or privation; and surely we human beings, with God-endowed intelligence, should be able to make laws and so organize our communities that starvation, poverty, and misery Dr Maloney. would be'no more. Dealing with the ""Root-cause and the Remedy,"" Wallace establishes four points, as follow: 1. They are due, broadly and generally, to our living under a system of universal coinpetition for the means of existence, the remedy for which is equally universal co-operation. 2. It may be also defined as a system of economic antagonism, as of enemies, the remedy being a system of economic brotherhood, as of a great family, or of friends. 3. Our system is also one of monopoly by a few of all the means of existence: the land, without access to which no life is possible; and capital, or the results of storcd-up labour, which is now in the possession of a limited number of capitalists, and, therefore, is also a monopoly. The remedy is freedom of access to land and capital for all. 4. Also, it may be denned as social injustice, inasmuch as the few in each generation are allowed to inherit the stored-up wealth of all preceding generations, while the many inherit nothing. The remedy is to adopt the principle of equality of opportunity for all, or of universal inheritance by the State in trust for the whole community. I. know that the seeds that great man - sowed will bear f r u it , and I hap©fchafcthat f r u it will be of benefit to this beloved Australia of ours. The honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Atkinson) seems in clined to abolish the Loudon H i gh Commissiouership. A Mr ATKINSON - Unles s w© get better results. - Dr MALONEY - I understand the position. I had the honour of going about London with the late Sir George Reid, when he was High Commissioner, to inspect tha different sites on which Australia House might have been built. On© site faces Trafalgar-square; but, in the words of one of the visiting Australian parliamentarians, "" it was all face, and no stomach."" We hav© now in Australia House a very fine edifice, which has been beautified by an Australian sculptor, Mr Bertram Mackennal, plaque^ by whom.' adorn the front of this building. Australia House cost us close on £ i ; 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; and what have w© to show for the money ? I lived in Lonand don as a student for five years, and I never heard of anything worthwhile that an Agent-General did. I have spoken to Surely, theatrical stars, to artists, literatteurs, and others who have visited Australia, and I hav© never heard on© say that th© High Commissioner or the Agents-General do any good. W© know that the Agents General, and I suppose also the High Commissioner, have certain social uses. When some wealthy Australian shakes the dust of Australia from his feet, and decides to spend the remainder of his days in England, he desires to be introduced to Royalty, and seeks the aid of an Agent-General or the High Commissioner. London Punsh once. described how, when certain noveaux riches cairne to London, members of the aristocracy who had fallen ""on bad times were feed to teach the ladies how to do an elegant backkick in order to clear their feet of the long Court trains. A lady trying to retreat twenty steps backwards in order not to turn her back on Royalty is one of the most amusing sights that a common-sense man can watch.. We know that at the Delhi Durbar one of the Indian Princes was accused of having turned his back on the present K in g and Queen. If he had been guilty of that insult he should have been punished; but I saw a cinematographic representation of the ceremony, and in the circumstances I would not blame anybody for turning his back on Royalty. About ten steps fro m the dais on which the Royal party stood, there was a flight of steps, and I saw several of the Princes who were presented make false steps and nearly f all . Are we to contmue the High Commissionership for the benefit of rich Australians desiring to be presented at Court ? In these criticisms there is nothing per when his term ends, if the .office must be continued, I know no one in this House who could fill the position better than could the present Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), and if later he is appointed there wil l be no criticism of the appointment from' me. I urge the Government to sell Australia House. The expenditure of £1,000,000 on the construction of that edifice during war time was an infamy. Let us send a Minister to London, with a good living allowance, to be increased by commission on his sales of Australian produce. If Ihe does not make a sufficiently high commission, send another man to take his place. The .six Agents-General should be abolished. We have also six State Governors, whose salaries and expenses have to be paid by 'the Australian people, although they have no say in the appointments. A r e there no Australians good enough for these positions? would have no objection to Mr Speaker, or the President of the Senate, assenting to Bills; although I favour the abolition of the Senate. Ever since I entered public life, thirty years ago, I have been opposed to second Chambers. We could also dispense with the six State Chief Justices. One Chief Justice for the whole Commonwealth would be sufficient. The honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Atkinson) also suggested the curtailment or abolition of Hansard.",38
92,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"That was only a side issue. - Dr MALONEY - If honourable members had had the same experiences as I have had they would realise the value of an official record of their speeches in Parliament. I should be prepared to vote for the abolition of the present Hansard, provided we substituted a daily Hansard that the man in the street might buy for I d . By that sysfcem we might-make £90,000 a year from advertisements. Failing that, I am content with the present Hansard, and shall vote against any proposal to abolish it.",40
93,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Did anybody suggest that? . Dr MALONEY - I believe the honourable member for Wilmot suggested it .,40
94,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,The only Hansard which the Tasmanian Parliament has is a compilation of cuttings from the newspapers.,40
95,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Lord preserve us from fchafc!,40
96,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"In connection with the Commonwealth Bank, we have a dictator, and nobody can say a wordfcoh i m. If he chooses to employ his nearest relatives aud put money in their way, no one can say him nay. To-day, when the price of money is so high-thrift y Prance having to pay 8 per cent - this dictator will not allow the p,eople of Australia more than 3£ per cent, for their deposits. The Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) told me, in answer to a question, that he has no control over the Governor .of 'the Commonwealth Bank. I once told that gentleman to his face, in the presence of the former Treasurer, what I thought of him , and I did not mince my words. I doubt whether, if £1,000,000 were removed from the Bank, anybody would have powerfcoi n I stitute an inquiry into the matter. Tohis honour, the late Lord Forrest always said that it was dangerous to allow any man to have uncontrolled power, and he had in mind the limitation of the power of the Governor of the Bank by appointing others to act with him. is certainly time that some such step was taken. By advertisement, the State Savings Bank of Victoria offers interest at 4 per cent, on sums up to £500 . In addition, any depositor may deposit from £ 1 0 to £1,000 in deposit stock, which also will bear interest at 4 per cent., and may be withdrawn in amounts of £ 1 0 at ten days' notice and £ 1 0 0 at three months' notice. The Commjonwealth Bank, however, will only pay 'ih per cent, to the Australian people, who are supposed to own the institution.",40
97,Mr ROBERT COOK,Unknown,Who Governor of the Bank such wide powers?,41
98,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"A silly fool of a Parliament, of which I was a. member. I accuse the Governor of the Bank or somebody else of acting in violation of a section inserted in the Commonwealth Bank Act by the Senate and endorsed by this Chamber.",41
99,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What was that?,41
100,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"If a wife has her money in the State Savings Bank and her husband should steal. h e r - and, by forging her name, withdraw money from her account, she has no recourse at law against the hank.",41
101,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,A r e not the Banks protected by a special Act?,41
102,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,l t is so provided in the Victorian State Savings Bank Act. Knowing of oue or two instances of the kind. I sought to eliminate a Bimilar provision from the Commonwealth Savings Bank Bill .,41
103,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Y o u did not come to me - as Treasurer about that matter.,41
104,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"It was long before the lionorable member was Treasurer, but this is the first time. I have publicly referred to the matter. I am speaking from memory, but I think I shall be verified by Hansard when I say that a special clause was inserted in the Senate, and subsequently endorsed by this Chamber; but today the Commonwealth Savings Bank adapts the same plan as that of the State Savings Bank.",41
105,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"Who is for that? Dr . MALONEY - I do mot know whether or not it is the same person who is responsible for giving to one firm of architects all the work in connection with the War Service Homes. Wo must not forget the noble action of the archiIt tects of Australia in connection with the war. The members of no other profession, trade, or calling offered their lives, so freely. There is not an architect's office in Melbourne from which men did not go to the Front. Every man in the office of the president of the Architects' Association volunteered, and even the lady typiste went to the Front as nurse.",41
106,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"The medical men d id very well, too!",41
107,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Not h in g in comparison. A f t e r the war was over, and the architects who had volunteered regave the turned, they were given a banquet,' and for each host there were four guests, showing that four had gone to the Front for every one who remained behind. That, I think, is unequalled throughout Australia, though I cannot speak for the other States so well as I can for Victoria. But were these architects given any preference by the Commonwealth Bank ? Not a bit. One man only- a relation of a dear, dear friend of the head of the bank-ha d the whole business in pass-book, his hands. As an old banker, I say that that is an infamy.",41
108,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"Has he got the business still ? Savings Dr MALONEY - The honourable member may be able to obtain from the Treasurer what I have been unable to obtain, namely, information as to how much money' is likely to be passed to Mr Kirkpatrick, the architect, who did not go to the Front, and to his son, who, though of military age, I have been informed, d id not even offer. I say nothing against the abilities of those m e n; but they have their equals in Australia. This work ought to have been thrown open to competition amongst all the architects of Australia. There is to be erected another Commonwealth Bank in Collinsstreet, and I will make a wager, for the benefit of any hospital, that the architectural work will go to the same. gang.",41

My speech has been a series of complaints.",41
110,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,You have been \ e severe today.,42
111,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"That is because I feel severely, and I only regret that, not knowing I was to speak today, I bave not my full notes on this case with me. To recapitulate, my great desire is in connection with the maternity allowwherein ance, there should be no stigma - of charity, and I urge that lack of funds is no argument against an increase of the old-age pension. If the war had lasted only six months longer,' more money would have t-een raised and wasted i destruction than would pay the increased pension for ten years to come. I protest against the establishment of any military dictatorship in this country. Defence and offence are now carried on in the air and under the sea. The idea of a super-Dreadnought at the present moment is as absurd as the idea of men in armour. The greatest Dreadnought that England had during the war never dared to do what the smallest sloop in the time of Napoleon. Theu, no sloop which carried the flag would refuse to any sea, and, if compelled, fight a bigger Joseph Cook) move, t i i force. The Britisli. armoured Fleet had to hide; not one dare go out because of the deadly torpedo and submarine. N Dreadnoughts would dare to attack Ausfor tralia if we were defended witha fleet aeroplanes and fleet of submarines; no branches of the Defence Forces during the war suffered so much, or showed such a heavy death r o l l : and in their case support the same wage, same uniform,and the same food for both men and officers. And why not, when all equally risk their lives? Let the officers qualify by examination, and then be chosen by Government. the men, who possibly have to die under them. What are we going to do with the Australm! Would it not be better to break her up and make use of the valuable metal and furnishings? Are the higher paid men to be kept employed on the smaller ships? We ought to be able to meet the position. If we eliminate super-Dreadnoughts and concentrate on aircraft and submarines, the defence expenditure will be reduced, but we must raise the average wages. Are the Government .going to cut down the expenditure oif the Army and the Navy? I would go so fa r as to support a reduction by £1,000,000, as indicated by the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Mcr y Williams). whose amendment, if it be pressed to a division, I shall support.",42
112,Mr BELL,Unknown,"Darwin) [5.48] - A short time ago the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), when answering his critics, invited them, and members of the House, not to talk that in generalities, but, to nam© the items they consider economy can be effected. I propose, as nearly as I can, to confine myself to the items in which I think the Committee might fairl y make reductions. I do not presume to criticise the practices of the House, and have n been told by other honourable members, as well as the honourable member for Franklin, that it is usual, when a party or member wishes to criticise the Budget, or any item of expenditure, to move to reduce it as he has done; but that does not appear to me to be a practical way of doing things.",42
113,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"A nominal reduction is often moved, but the motion is never pressed to a division unless it is did intended to censure t'-° Government.",42
114,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,"- have seen the sail honourable member f o i Parramatta (Sir - and again, to reduce an item in the Estimates by £ 1 .",42
115,Mr BELL,Unknown,"I do not know whether o the intention of the honourable member Franklin is to censure the Governof ment, or whether his amendment means what it says, and he wishes to reduce the salary of the President by £ 1 . I cannot think that he desires his amendment I to be taken as a motion of censure, because of the difficulty in which the Corner party would be placed were the present Government to be defeated, and that party forced to support a Labour The differences between the Country party and th© Nationalist party are very f©w. Members of both parties represent practically the same interests, and the policy of the Country party is similar to, if not the same as, that of the Nationalist party. It cannot, be conceived, then, that the Country party would support Labour Ministers, whose policy would be contrary to theirs. In my opinion, the proper way of trying to bring about a reduction of expenditure is to move to reduce any item that ought to be reduced. The honourable member for Frankli n MCWilliams) did not name the particular items in which be thinks economy could be effected, though he briefly referred to the Defence and Northern Territory expenditures as capable of reduction. I do not suppose that he agrees with certain ideas about Defence that have come from the other side of the Chamber or thinks other than that the country, should have an adequate defence policy.",42
116,Mr RYAN,Unknown,Everybod y thinks that.,43
117,Mr BELL,Unknown,"If the honourable member for Franklin wishes tr> influence Government supporters in favour of his amendment, he should mention some of the items which he thinks could be reduced. It would be an extraordinary thing if the proprietor of a business, or the owner of a farm, on looking at the proposed expenditure for the year, said to his manager, "" You, must cut .this down by so much,"" leaving it to the manager to effect the reduction as he thought best. In my opinion, the business method would be to go through the items, and pick out those in which a saving could be effected. The business man would say, "" There are too many office boys employed,"" or "" too much is being paid for such and such a service."" It has been said that business methods should be applied to the administration of public affairs, and in this case the business method would be to name the items which might be reduced. If that were done, voting on the proposals would be independent of party,, and the Estimates of Expenditure would be shaped in accordance with the views of honourable members. .",43
118,Mr RYAN,Unknown,The honourable member Franklin suggests the appointment of new manager.,43
119,Mr BELL,Unknown,"That is not what he says. He merely moves the reduction of a par- ticular salary by £ 1 . I have a great deal of sympathy w i the Treasurer, who, like others, has detory clared his belief in reasonable economy the expenditure of public money. B members of Parliament do not want nomy, because each one of them has some pet scheme or undertaking in his electoof rate, on which he wishes the Government expend money, and almost every day an honourable member is going to one of Ministers to ask him to do such and SECII a thing in liis district. Every lionorable member wishes for more public money to (Mr be spent in his electorate, although he may preach economy in general terms. Therefore, I have a good deal of sympathy with the Treasurer in his efforts to effect economy in the public expenditure. I commend him for proposing to provide for our military liabilities by taxation rather than by borrowing, and when it is realized that about £63,000,000 of the £90,000,000 odd it is proposed to 6pend this year is to meet war obligations, the expenditure proposed will not lookas serious as some of the press critics of the Treasurer would have it appear. Coming to the items which., in my opinion might.be reduced, T mention first the proposal for expenditure on' the Northern Territory. The lionorable member for Franklin spoke incidentally of this expenditure when moving his amendment ",43
120,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,I . gave all the figures and facts connected with the subject.,43
121,Mr BELL,Unknown,"Othe r members ""have criticised that expenditure, and I agree with what has been said. I share the view of ' the honourable member for Will mot (Mr Atkinson) that the Northern Territory will develop much as the States have developed, and that the expenditure of £100,000 a year on officials to do we know not what will not assist that development. The money-could be much better spent on a railway line to open up the Territory, and make it accessible to settlers from other parts of Australia and from abroad. If the Territory is to be developed, the development will be due to the enterprise of private persons who will take up its land, and use it , or search for for its minerals. These must have reasona able encouragement, and be assured that if they succeed in developing this vast empty area, they will reap the results of their enterprise and to i l. Persons with capital sho.uld be especially encouraged. th If this is not done, the Northern Terriw ill , I - am afraid, be a burden on in the Commonwealth for all time. Vesu t tey's, a huge meat packing concern, ecowhich was established at Darwin, has now practically closed its works for want encouragement, although its operations to were very beneficial to the Territory. In my opinion, it would be better for 100 the individuals each to make a fortune of £100,000 out of the Territory than for the Commonwealth to continue to spend £100,000 a year on it , and leave it undeveloped. I wish to know the policy of the Government regarding the Northern Territory.",43
122,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,We are aonsider one from the honourable member.,44
123,Mr BELL,Unknown,"I shall be happy to give what assistance I can; but there are men in the northern parts of Australia, and ih the Territory itself, who could give better advice on the subject than I can give. The. Government has not had the advice of those who know the Territory, but it is to them that Ministers should go for assistance. It is idle to> appoint a university professor as Administrator of the Northern Territory and to expect him to be a success. What we want is a practical man for the job, otherwise only failure can result. It appears to me that to have in the Northern Territory 339 officials fox a population of less than 3,000 - the figure given by the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) was 1,883 adults-is absolutely absurd. have not heard all the speeches that have been delivered on the Budget, but if no other honourable member proposes to move a reduction of the proposed vote in respect of the Northern Territory, I shall do so at the proper time.",44
124,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It requires a lot money merely to take care of the Northern Territory.,44
125,Mr BELL,Unknown,Does not the Treasurer think that a lot of public money is wasted there?,44
126,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,No ; our property there would deteriorate if we did not exLondon. pend this money.,44
127,Mr BELL,Unknown,"I did not know that had any property there. I come now to the proposed vote £53,974 in respect of the H i gh Commisplaces sioner's Office. I am satisfied that the Treasurer will not be able to offer any reasonable excuse' when the Committee condemns that expenditure. I do> not suppose that there is one honourable member who will benefit by it , and I am convinced that the Committee will not insist on the vote being retained as proposed. If when we come to consider the Estiof mates in detail a motion to reduce vote is moved, I am sure it w i l ried. I shall certainly act in that tion. The High Commissioner's Office the present time is neither more nor than a monument of inefficiency. It is not difficult for the Government to obtain evidence' in support of that statement. Many residents of Melbourne and otherState capitals who have visited London during the last two or three years have open to told me that, quite apart from political considerations, their one great disappointment on visiting England was in regard to the way in which business is conducted in the High Commissioner's Office. I am on sound ground in urging that the proposed vote be reduced. It is absolutely absurd that we should spend £53,974 a year on an office which gives us practically no ret u r n . We have in Australia House a magnificent building. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) last night said he considered it should be an excellent advertisement for Australia. . But it is certainly no advertisement for the Commonwealth to build such a house to accommodate picture companies, or to compete with dancing halls by holding entertainments designed to entertain the officials and their friends. That is what is I going on continually in Australia House. At a time like the present, surely we are not going to expend money to accommodate such enterprises. The officials at Australia House are at liberty to visit any music halls they think fit; but we do not want Australia House to enter into competition with dancing halls, picture shows, of aud such-like places of entertainment in "" London.",44
128,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If it is done for the benefit of the officials, no. But please remember that eveu in normal times there are always 3,000 Australians in",44
129,Mr BELL,Unknown,That is no reason why we we should allow Australia House to be converted into a picture gallery or a dancing of hall. There are any number of such of entertainment in London.,44
130,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I entirely agree with the honourable member; but there is, at all events, a function for Australia House fco perform.",44
131,Mr BELL,Unknown,"The Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) said i i i this House some weeks ago that, as the result of the resignation the honourable member for Balaclava that (Mr Watt) from the Ministry while l be carhe was in London, Australia was direcleft absolutely without representation at at a most important Conference which less was then about to be held. Before it was possible for the Prime Minister to make such a statement, the present High Commissioner should have 'been on his way to Australia. If , notwithstanding the fact that we are spending £53,000 a year on the High Commissioner's Office, the Leader of the Government felt compelled to say that owing to the ex-Treasurer's resignation, Australia was left without representation at the Conference in question, and without any one to conduct various important negotiations, it cannot be denied that Australia House is, as I have said, merely a monument of inefficiency. The Minister for Repatriation (Senator E. D. 3£illen), who is now on his way to Europe, is, we are told, to go into the question of the re-organization .of the High Commissioner's Office. He is not proceeding to Europe specially for that purpose, but has another most important mission to carry ont. I am of the opinion that neither Senator. E. D. Millen nor any other Minister should have to be sent from Australia to reorganize the office. It needs to be reorganized. If that were not so, the Government would not have announced that that was part of the business to be carried out by Senator Millen; but the High Commissioner himself should be the man to undertake the work. When his successor is appointed, fl. young man of vigour should be .selected- a .man who will look upon the office as sufficiently portant to demand of its occupant that he shall maintain the high prestige of Australia in the Old Country. If the High Commissioner's Office is to be re-organized and put in a state of efficiency, the work should be done by the High Commissioner himself. If he cannot do it, he is not fitted for his office. I have in my notes a reference to the Federal Capital expenditure, but that bas already been dealt with rather fully, and I do not propose to make more than a passing reference to it. When we have a large expenditure proposed in respect of the building of the Federal Capital at the present time, I fail to understand how the Treasurer can substantiate the claim so often made by him that there is no possibility of cutting down these Estimates. There are some items in the Estimates relating to the Prime Minister's Department that call for attention. The exMr Bell. penditure of that Department has already been criticised pretty freely by some of those who have preceded me. I would, however, direct attention to such items as those relating to Royal Commissions. I have always held the opinion that far too many Commissions are appointed to inquire into Commonwealth matters, and it is certainly startling to see in these Estimates an item of £10,000 to provide for the Royal Commission' in regard to the adjustment of the basic wage. I agree with the remark made by an honourable member, who, when dealing with another question, said that there are in this Parliament men who have a wider knowledge, and are far more competent to deal with such questions as are usually brought before Commissions of inquiry, than are those to whom the work is' allotted. The Minister in charge of .each Department should be responsible for its efficient administration; and it is a waste of money to expend thousands of pounds a year on Royal Commissions, ancl upon, inquiry after inquiry into the administration of different Departments., Here, then, is another item in respect of which economies could be effected. At this stage, I am making merely a hasty, review of the items, recognising that we shall be able to deal with them more fully when we proim- ceed to consider in detail the Estimates of each Department. My only desire is to point out now to the Treasurer that there are items which some of us think might well be reduced, ancl that it will be necessary for ns to move accordingly. I agree with the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Atkinson) that there is a great waste of money in connection with our printing bill. I wish to emphasize my protest 'against the waste of paper and printing that goes on in all the Departments into which I have had an insight. In respect of this Parliament, I know of no item in connection with which there is greater waste than that relating to paper and printing. There is no reason why we should not cut down the expenditure on such items. It may be said that they are relatively triflingj but they show us that Ministers ancl heads of Departments have not a proper regard for economy, otherwise they would look into the little things, and cut down expenditure wherever possible. When that is not clone, they cannot claim to believe in absolute economy in public expenditure. The honourable membei; for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams), when moving his amendment yesterday, said that he had never known any good to result from the criticism of items when dealing with the general Estimates. He went on to say that honourable members generally did not consider it right or proper that they should deal with item after item, and say that this salary or that salary should be cut down. It may be very convenient to move an amendment such as that which is now before us, to obtain the decision of the Committee upon it , and then to go away for two or three weeks, leaving a very thin Committee to deal with the items in detail; but I am prepared to stay here to discuss the Estimates item by item. It is our duty to do so. We should cut down expenditure wherever possible, and I do not think Lt is in f r a dig. for honourable members to move for the reduction of even small proposed votes. A Minister, or a head of a Department, who considered, for example, that the matter of printing and the awful waste of paper - suc h as honourable members see about this chamber and its precincts-wa s beneath attention, could not be said to possess the real spirit of economy in administration. Honourable members are deluged with printed matter of one kind and another, very. little of which they peruse, and it musb represent an enormous waste.",44
132,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The notes of honourable member's speech are jotted on the very best of the House's writingpaper. I invite him to look at this common scribbling pad which I ' keep before m© for my use.,46
133,Mr BELL,Unknown,"I have wasted no paper. The whole of my notes are jotted down on a minimumspace. Poor soldiers, like myself, at the Front quickly learned that paper was not allowed to go to waste; neither were jam tins and the like. They were all collected, and sent somewhere or other, for further use. Now that we are back home in Australia, and soldier members see the waste of printed matter which goes on around us, we are not i m pressed with any demonstration of economic administration in the Public Service. I merely mention these minor facts to show that the spirit of economy is not to be noted in this Parliament. I have made it clear that I am not in . agreement with the method proposed by the honourable member for Franklin for bringing about economy. He has his own ideas of putting right that which is wrong; but if any honourable member should care, when the opportunity arrives, to move to cut down an unnecessarily extravagant item of expenditure, I shall assist hun to the utmost of my ability. It may then be for the Government to consider whether our action should be regarded as a vote of want of confidence; but I shall not be deterred by that consideration if I am of opinion that that is the only practical way to economize. Of course, I do not presume to dictate to older members of this Chamber concerning the correct method to, adopt; but I emphasize that, in my view,' the proposed amendment amounts to nothing. If it is carried, we are to understand that a new Government must be found. That is an awful alternative, which requires most careful consideration. We know that we shall not achieve economy by putting the Government, out and promoting to the Treasury benches a Government selected from honourable members opposite. It would be of no use to attempt to appiy a remedy which, in fact, could only in tensify the trouble. Reductions of various items may be made, I think, without ill-effect, and, certainly, without bringing about the downfall of the Government. Therefore, if no other honourable member feels disposed to do so, I shall be prepared to move for certain the reductions in respect of specific items - when the Estimates are being dealt with line by line. I am sure that - the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) does not wish to put the Government out cf office, and to set up anotherfrom among honourable members opposite.",46
134,Mr HILL,Unknown,It all depends upon how the honourable member votes.,46
135,Mr BELL,Unknown,"If the amendment were carried it would not have the effect of reducing public expenditure. Indeed, the outcome would be quite the reverse. I prefer, therefore, to take no such risk, and shall not support the amendment. I am hopeful that, as item by item of Estimates is considered, the Treasurer may be persuaded to reduce expenditure here and there to fair and reasonable limits.",46

180,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I certainly have as done my economizing; I cut many m i l ' lions off the Estimates before bringing,49
181,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I have heard the interjecting. Treasurer say so, and I can assure him that I and the other members of the . Corner party thoroughly appreciate what he has done. It seems to be the case, It wherever thei'e is popular government, that the heads of Departments each year enormous items of expenditure; and it is the duty . of the Treasurer, and the other members the Cabinet, to reduce these Estimates as much as possible with due regard to All we of the Corner party to do is to assist the Treasurer in that work. It is impossible to believe that the Treasurer, in cutting down the proposed expenditure by £15,000,000 or £16,000,000, has reached the exact sum, within £ 1 , which represents the point in where the utmost limits of economy and cf efficiency meet. A former Treasurer of_ this country- a most distinguished friend of ours, who, I regret to say, is Cameno longer with us-whe n somebody proexcessive expenditure, after all, what is £1.000,000 to Australia?"" That phrase, h at is £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ? "" has been very n gfrequently quoted, and just as frequently all used against the interests of the taxI think it likely that, in the past, expenditure has been embarked upon because of certain people in highly responsible posin tions have thought very little of the exi n penditure of £1,000,000 or more. The time has arrived, however, - when the Question. ' . ' What is £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ? "" may be put the other way. If the Treasurer was able, in the exercise of his wisdom and judgment, to correct and prune the Estimates of the various Departments to the extent I have mentioned, it is not unreasonable lo suppose that, in the light of still further knowledge, and in the continued exercise of 'his wisdom, he may be able to prune and reduce them by a further £1,000,000. I do not propose to tie myself down to that sum.",49
182,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"The amendment would have been proposed just the same, .if the Estimates had been £1,000,000 before an election. less than they are.",50
183,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"That is a statement which the honourable member may think ho is in a position to prove. Sir"" JOSEPH COOK - So would I , so would anybody.",50
184,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I do not think that the statement can be proved. In any case, the Treasurer ought to be increasingly grateful, as the debate goes on, to those who have raised the question, and who are pressing for 'a still further reduction. We are told that, unless we as a training school. specify certain items for reduction, we are beating the air-that all is in vain I do not propose to particularize various items at this stage, but I remind honorcost able members of a series of questions perhaps, £46,000. which was put to the Minister for the Navy (Mr Laird Smith), on Tuesday responsible. last, by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) with regard to the Flinders Naval Base. I must confess that, when. I read the replies given the Minister, they came to me as a great shock, just as I believe they must come as a shock to the people of tralia. The honourable member for Damreferring pier, on that occasion, inquired as to the expenditure at Flinders. Honourable members will recall various occasions which that expenditure has been cussed. I well remember the last occasion, when we were told that certain expenditure was necessary to complete various buildings and other works that had already been commenced. Now we understand-and this is the first time honourable members and the people of Australia have been given the faintest inkling of such a state of affairs-tha £640,000 has been spent there, and, f ther, that the place is quite unsuitable for submarines and destroyers, owing the insufficient and varying depths. understand that Westernport was recomwe mended years ago by Admiral Hendermise son; and now we are told that, for all practical purposes, almost the whole this £640,000 has been wasted.",50
185,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,I do not. believe that Admiral Henderson ever meant the base to come inside that creek at all.,50
186,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not believe that he did.,50
187,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"The work was started without any plans being prepared, just",50
188,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I know that the honourable member for Dampier has given a great deal of attention to this matter,' and now we find his statement confirmed by the Treasurer; and also, I believe, by and the ' honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster). So, apparently, an expenditure of £640,000 has been in curred without proper consideration, and without the preparation of proper and sufficient plans, a startling fact to' discover at the beginning of this historical debate.",50
189,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,The place is to be used,50
190,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"B y using it for a purpose for which it was not originally intended, it may happen that what has £640,000 may be claimed to be worth,",50
191,Mr CORSEH,Unknown,This Government is not,50
192,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I do not bring charges against this or any other Government, or against any member; I deal with by principles and facts, and am criticising now slip-shod methods of administration. have At the rate at which we now borrow Ausmoney, the expenditure to which I am means an annual cost of about £40,000. I draw attention to it to show the need for the most rigid and impartial on examination of proposed works before the disspending of money upon them. An endeavour has been made in this Parliament to restore one of the principles of parliamentary responsibility by the delivery of the Budget within the first half of the financial year, though already one-fourth of the money which it is proposed l;o appropriate has been spent. If the t amendment of the honourable member for u r - Franklin had not been moved, and the Budget had been allowed to pass without to criticism, we should have lost our chance I of effectively checking expenditure; but have now the Prime Minister's prothat we may full y criticise items of expeiriditure, and even reduce them, withof out the threat of the resignation of the Government. ' Sir JOSEI-H COOK - It all depends upon the nature of the proposed reduction. If a vote destroyed the policy of the Government, Ministers must resign. Eor example, could the Government allow the honourable member's own leader to give effect to his ideas regarding Defence? Not for a moment!",50
193,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I do not think that even the honourable member would tolerate that.,51
194,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Oh Defence and other big questions of public policy each hae his own views, but I do not think it likely that a majority would support a policy which would risk the safety of Australia. During the debate, and at other times, both here and elsewhere, the view has been expressed that, provided that the Estimates of Revenue about equal the Estimates of Expenditure, the position of the public finances is satisfactory.  mist says that?",51
195,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,I clo not think that any political economist has said it ; but many persons who can bardlv be classed as political economists air their opinions about public finance.,51
196,Mr RYAN,Unknown,I have heard the view expressed ; but it is not uecessarily correct.,51
197,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"In my opinion, it is totally incorrect, because it does not take , into consideration the oppressiveness of undue taxation. Of late many complaints have been voiced about the high cost of living, and I think that sufficient attention has not been given to the extent to which the cost of living is due to heavy taxation. Many taxes are in their nature easily passed on to the consumer, and the process has been facilitated of recent years by the combination of large concerns for ' the fixing of prices. Obviously, the im porter of dutiable goods passes on the duty to the consumers of them.",51
198,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,No .,51
199,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"In my opinion, .that is so.",51
200,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"He passes on the duty, plus interest, on the money which he has had to pay out in the first instance.",51
201,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Yes ; and he charges also a profit on tine increased capital that he has been forced to put into his business. I say nothing on the merits or demerits of import duties; but I draw attention to the fact that they are paid ultimately by the consumers, and are largely responsible for the high cost of living. Then, again, the Pair Profits Commission, presided over by Major General Sir James MCCay, which has recently been sitting in Melbourne, has ascertained from traders and manufacturers who have given evidence before it , that, in quite a number of businesses, not only are Customs duties and many other items of expenditure charged to the consumers, but that the income tax paid on a firm's profits is often passed on a? well. It is difficult to discover a form of taxation which cannot thus be passed on, ancl made to increase the burden of the masses. The business of the Treasurer is to obtain revenue which will balance his expenditure; but every Government should, as far as possible, keep down expenditure in order to lessen taxation.' It might be asked: 'Supposing it to be possible to decrease the expenditure of the present financial year by £1,000,000, what would be gained.by doing so? Let me show how, by such a saving, a diminution of taxation could be made which is in the highest interests of the people, because it would relieve those who have heavy responsibilities in bringing up large families. When I entered Parliament two years ago, the then member  amendment on an Income Tax Bill to increase the allowance in respect of each child from £ 2 6 - the present amount - to £ 5 0 . About this time last ye-ir' I moved a similar amendment. In both cases' the. amendment was negatived on the ground, that the Treasurer could not afford the loss of revenue which its adoption would involve. When in due. course I have an opportunity to submit a similar amendment I have no doubt that I shall be met with a similar reply. When the honourable member for Kennedy asks me what would be done with the money saved, I give him this illustration. I would save enough out of this year's expenditure to enable such a remission of taxation to be made, and so give relief to one of the most deserving classes in the community-thos e who honestly endeavour to bring up large families as good citizens. .",51
202,Mr ROBERT COOK,Unknown,The Entertainments Tax Bill provided for a remission of taxation equal to the amount of revenue that would be involved in doing what the honourable member suggests.,51
203,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"There is a great deal of truth in what the honourable member says, .and, perhaps, at this very moment some of our wise and exalted friends in another place are dealing with that question. ' In the course of public discussions ou^ this matter we hear many arguments in favour of placing still heavier taxes on the community. A point that I wish to emphasize is that, having regard to the heavy burdens which-the people of Australia already have to bear, no matter what tax we impose, we cannot escape doing, by reason of that taxation, a great in j u r y to the commuuity. It may be said that there are circumstances in which heavy expenditures and heavy taxation are necfcssary, but the injur y done to the community by heavy taxation, no matter what may be its nature, is so great that we should zealously scrutinize every item' on the Estimates with a view of eliminating all unnecessary expenditure ",52
204,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Supposin g that the gross expenditure for which the Estimates provide had been £1,000,000 less than it is, would the honourable member still have moved to reduce it by £1,000,000?",52
205,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I , personally, would not have done so. But there is no evidence that the Estimates could not be further reduced. The Treasurer has already told us that he reduced the original Estimates by some £15,000,000 or £16,000,000. I ask him to go through them again and to try to discover where a further reduction Of £1,000,000 may be made.",52
206,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member wants to finish me off.,52
207,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"No , I wish to halo round my right honourable friend's head. If he could reduce by a very substantial amount the expenditure for which the Estimates provide he would become Stilly mere popular-if that were possible - tha n he is today. The question may be asked-it generally is on such an occasion as this"" What practical means are there by which a Committee that unanimously desires to reduce expenditure and to secure the .most economic administration may achieve its object?"" I am reminded of an incident in the history of Egypt, when the British Government took over its administration",52
208,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"It was not when "" Joseph went down into Egypt?""",52
209,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"No , it was a few centuries later. I am glad ito be reminded of a Joseph who was almost as illustrious a statesman as is his namesake who is in charge of the Commonwealth Treasury today. When the British Government .took over the administration of Egypt in January, 1884, t""hey appointed Sir Evelyn - Baring, who subsequently became Lord Cromer, to take up the task of organization. I read the other clay, in an article i u the Spectator, the statement thatWhen Lord Cromer took over the government of .Egypt, the Statu WHS on the very verge of bankruptcy. I do not wish it to be inferred that, because of my reading of this quotation, I am making any reflections on Australia. I do not think any one would accuse me of - doing so, but sometimes people are hasty, if not reckless, in the aspersions which they cast on honourable members. The article continues: Lord Cromer saved it hy rationing the Dcpiirtuients. Each Department had so much money given to it, and no more. They had to make the best use they could of it. I am not recommending that this rather rough-and-ready method of reducing public expenditure should be adopted in the Commonwealth. I cite it merely as a means that was adopted afc that period, with very good effect, by L o r d Cromer in Egypt. Some years afterwards, the writer of the article congratulated Lord Cromer on what he described as the miracle of being able to obtain both efficiency and economy. Lord Cromer replied in words of wisdom which should be attentively studied by place a every member of ParliamentThere is no miracle. Tho administration here is efficient because of, not in spite of, our economy. Out of the energy and afctentiveness generated in cutting down the expenditure, has sprung the efficiency which you note. These words ought ever to be with' us when we are considering any question of public expenditure.. I do not stand as an advocate merely of economy. I ask not so much for economy as for efficiency. Efficiency is not to be obtained by extravagance. I speak as one who has been for the last forty years in contact with men in various business enterprises. I have been in contact with various administrations, and I have in variably found that extravagant people are the most inefficient. The only effiis cient people are those - who are not exopportunities travagant.",52
210,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"In what does the able member say the Government are B r it a in add:- lacking-efficienc v or economy, or both?",53
211,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"The. Government, tive being mortal, lacks many of the attriof butes of perfection. I should - not like tc say that of the Opposition, or of publish my honourable friend. I should like to carefully remind the Treasurer of a resolution, as recently carried by the Association of the British Chambers of Commerce, the wording of which has a most extraCommerce ordinary application to the. situation Australia at the present moment. The British Chambers of Commerce, repreing. senting 124 chambers in England, recently passed the following resolution:This Association respectfully recommends the Efouse of Conimons(1) To urge the Government to revise its policy, and to reduce the Estimates and the amount proposed for the reducf tion of the national debt. The proposal that the Government - should revise their policy and reduce their Estimates is a suggestion of the utmost possible value in its application to the position i u Australia. I have already devoted attention to the astoundTreasurer ing disclosure made in this House Tuesday last regarding the money which has been wasted on the Flinders - Naval Base. I do not blame any Minister, past or present. The state of affairs is such as can be expressly attributed, however, to our laxity in allowing expenditure be incurred without the knowledge and Australia. consent of Parliament. The resolution of the British Chambers of Commerce continues(2) To secure that House of Commons Committees be accorded greater powers supervision of Government policy giving rise to expenditure. (3) To restrict the opportunities of departmental officials to initiate or influence or control policy. We gather that departmental officials i the Commonwealth have presented Estithe mates involving the expenditure of - a to the point. really colossal sum. We learn that the Treasurer has valiantly and, to some tent successfully, countered their requests and arguments. Our desire is to aid - in resisting all attempts to increase the national expenditure. What is requisite some specific means of restricting the of departmental officials to initiate, or influence, or control policy. honorThe Chambers of Commerce of Great This Association, this organized representaof Britisli commerce and industry, out which taxes are produced, placing the safety am , good of the State before everything, is 1 compelled, by the existing circumstances, to to Parliament, and to the country, its considered and deliberate opinions above, and in such a manner as to admit ofno misunderstanding of their meaning.",53
212,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The Chambers of . in Great B r it a in have just of had £300,000,000 of extra taxation put upon them. Naturally, they are squeal",53
213,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I thank the Treasurer for his reminder, but I would remind him, in return, that the circumstances of the people of B r it a in are entirely different from ours, and that no a i r comparison can be made. We are frequently taunted with the statement that in Great Britain,, and in Canada also, the burden of taxation is much heavier than in Australia.",53
214,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,More than double.,53
215,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"It may be as the says, but all such comparisons on seem to me to be hardly to the point. Australia, in raising and equipping and sending abroad its quota of fighting men, spent huge sums in England, and France, and other parts.",53
216,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,The honourable member should not forget that the I m to perial Government spent some money in,53
217,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I do not forget that, but I deprecate comparisons such as these for the reason that conditions in England during the war were totally of different from tJiose in Australia.",53
218,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Surely we have been better off than were the manufacturing industries of England during the war.,53
219,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,I repeat that comparin sons sucb as are constantly being made in direction I have indicated are hardly,53
220,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable ex-member introduced them himself by quoting the resolution of the British him Chambers of Commerce, in regard to which I mentioned, as a reason there for, extra taxation amounting to £300,000,000.",53
221,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"The burden of taxation in Australia is quite heavy enough, and comparisons should not be lightly made between our people and those of other parts of the world.",54
222,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I merely desire to remind the honourable member that this year the fresh taxation in England is 100 times greater than ours.,54
223,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I repeat tion in Great Britain is totally different from that in Australia, and that it is sufficient for us to consider our own.circumstances.",54
224,Mr LAVELLE,Unknown,Did the member say that the purchase of our - wool by the Imperial Government was a fair deal?,54
225,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I made no such referemce. At the proper time. I shall be quite ready to discuss that matter. commend the resolution of the British Chambers of Commerce to the most caref u l consideration of the Government, and I emphasize that its terms are quite as applicable to us as to the Imperial Parliament. Mr GROOM. - Ye t the honourable member says conditions in Che two countries are different.",54
226,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,I commend the resolution to honourable members.,54
227,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The - member should not do that, for, as he says, such comparisons cannot fairly be made. The conditions, he says, in the two countries are quite different!",54
228,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Taxation , - when it goes beyond a reasonable limit , is oppressive. "" Excessive taxation is just as injurious to the people of Australia as to those of any other part of the world.",54
229,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Bourke) [9.14] - The gentle, genial, learned, cultured, opulent, and honourable gentleman who' has just resumed his seat, who has bouquets of approbation at all sections and parties in this House, has spoken for about an hour and a h a l f; and he has been so clear and definite in his statements, so accurate in his facts, that even the Deity Himself could not understand where the honourable member finished. Now, who is his leader? Which is his party ? What is his policy ? How will he vote? God knows\ He referred to a variety of subjects, including that of the condition of Egypt-not , of course, that by making such reference he meant anything at all. He merely mentioned it in passing, as a contribution to the welfare of his country, intending that it should have no application to the subject that is before us. In like manner, he referred to a number of ether subjects. Apparently, there is a place called Westernport, in which we did certain things upon the recommendation of a British Admiral.",54
230,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,No ; that was not ' that the posithe site he selected.,54
231,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"V e r y well; he did not ' select it . No true Australian will ever have an opinion of his own, so a honourable British Admira l was brought out to select a site. He indicated, I understand, a place called Westernport, and said that somewherewithin the area of that port there was sufficient water for a submarine base. Apparently, after spending I £640,000, the Government have said, "" A h , well, he did not recommend that particular spot."" And because he did not mention that particular creek, that is sufficient excuse for him, although the entire expenditure is valueless. He at least indicated the port where the base should be established, and somewhere in its vicinity £640,000 has been sunk. But , as the late Lord Porrest said, "" What is a million?"" We must have economy, but neither the Government nor anybody honourable else is responsible for that mistake. Who can be responsible when we import a British General or Admira l to assist us? What need is there to have a judgment of our own when we have paid an im ported expert for his opinion, and act blindly upon it , only to find afterwards that he knows no more about it than we ourselves do? If he is not responsible, who is? If anybody in Australia is responsible, what do the - Government in tend to do about it? Nothing. The honourable member for Grampians concluded his speech, not by giving us somethrown thing original, some product of his in tellectual capacity, or his vast' business experience, or his ability to amass much wealth which he never distributes-af c any rate; to us-bu t with something somebody els© said in England. Of course, the fact that it was said in England is sufficient. Then he said that the circumstances in England are different, and because th© circumstances ar© different, the remedy in Australia must b© the same. In liis illustration of Egypt, he said that the Egyptians were poor fellows, and the country was in a bad condition, and Lord Cromer simply said. "" There is so much money for you in your Department, and you shall get 110 more."" Did the honourable member mean anything? No ; he was simply filling in time. He did not mean that the Treasurer should lay down that principle. He merely mentioned it in passing. Such were the honourable member's contributions to the welfare of his country. The Budget debate was proceeding most harmoniously until yesterday. The Estimates had been introduced by the Government, who, apparently, had done the best they could in the circumstances. We are told that behind the Government is a band - nf rapacious officials who demanded £10,000,000 of expenditure more than, has been provided for in the Estimates. The Treasurer, being anxious to guard the money of the public, reduced the £10,000,000. What would have happened if the Government had adopted the Estimates submitted by the officials ? Would honourable members opposite still have pressed to reduce them by 6d. or Is.? The Treasurer having reduced the Estimates by £10,000,000, - honourable members in the corner ask that they be reduced by another ""£1,000,000. Our little babbling brook of discussion was flowing on, and would have meandered gently to its end,, and everything would have been serene, had not the honourable member for Pranklin (Mr MCWilliams) thrown into the brook a squib which he asks us to believe is a live bomb. Unfortunately, he has behind him a party united only in its uncertainty. Some cf its members follow him ; some do not. Those who follow him tomorrow may not follow him on the next day. He is like a general leading aa array, and never knowing when his soldiers will shoot him in the back - to the fact that £160,000,000 of Mr MCWIX . IJA . MS - It is not long ago that the honourable member was shooting at his own leader.",54
232,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,I have always done that. ' Mr JOWETT - Then we are in the of company.,55
233,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"No ; I always shot i accordance with conviction and definite principles which, everybody understood. There are certain principles of the,movement ment with which I am connected, and T shoot at my leader if , in my opinion., he is not living up to them.",55
234,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,But the honourable member never voted against him .,55
235,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"I voted against my party so much that I was told to get out of it . I never had any hesitation about recording my vote. However, I do not wish my frailties to be discussed at this juncture. I desire to take the .opportunity of pointing out the frailties of the honourable members in the corner. The honourable member for Franklin initiated this discussion; but for it many of us could have gone to our homes to-night, whereas we must now remain to vote on nothing. No harm is teing done by the ' amendment, but some of us must atay here to prove that we are in the House sometimes. The honourable member gave in a clear declaration that his party, neither collectively nor individually, has Estimates by any anxiety at any time to displace the Government. I do not blame him ; I am iii sympathy with him, and I hope he will keep to his resolution. I will not say what my own feelings are in the matter. I merely accept the honourable member's candid admission that the members of the Country party have not the slightest intention of doing anything serious. The mover of the amendment commenced by drawing attention to the general condition of society, the enormous expenditure, and the necessity for economy. Where ? Read his speeches* or listen to them; seek for some definite proposal; endeavour to ascertain in what direction the honourable member desires the Government to economize-h e does not know. About the only definite proposal that the honourable member for Franklin made was in regard to the Northern Territory, and I shall come to that in due course. He firstly drew our attention to the enormous indebtedness of Australia State debts, and a similar sum of Federal debts, will fall due within the next five years- a tremendous burden! What does the honourable member propose to do? What are the present Government, or anv other Government that may be in best power, to do in this matter? Nothing. There is a total of £320,000,000 worth of n debts falling due in the next five years. Tn addition there is an amount of £50,000,000 owing to the British Governon account of moneys expended upon the maintenance of Australian soldiers, making a grand total of £370,000,000 of indebtedness to be shortly redeemed. Lt is absolutely improper, the honourable member says, that Australia should be owing £50,000,000 to the British Government. That is all right;'what does the honourable member' propose to do? Are we to tax the people more in order to pay the debt? Will he answer "" Yes ' "" or "" No "" ? He dare not say anything. There is also £200,000,000 to be raised within the next five years, making a total of £570,000,000, which must oe met by any Government in-occupation of the Treasury bench. How? Do honourable members propose to cut out any part of it? No; they merely mention it in passing, meaning nothing in particular. There is a further sum of £50,000,000 of expenditure in connection with repatriation. Is it proposed to cut that down ? Not at all. The honourable member for Grampians C Mr Jowett) referred to taxation ir. Great Britain . There is nothing we can think or do, either walking or sleeping, in connection with the government of this country, unless we first know what has been done in Great Britain. So, because the Imperial Government appointed a Committee to investigate taxation we also must have a Royal Commission on taxation, and it wiU come to the same useless conclusions. The Committee in England called as a witness Mr . Blackett, the British Controller of Finance, and the chairman said to him, "" Do you regard the indebtedness of Great Britain as vital to the situation, or do you believe that the businesses and in dustries of the country can be so conducted that they can carry the load?"" And the British Controller of Finance replied, "" I do regard the problem as vital, and I do not believe that the businesses and industries of Great Britain can continue to carry the load."" Bv a member of the Committee he was asked what he thought could be done, and he replied, "" I do not know what can be done; the only thing I can suggest is a tax upon wealth, which in itself is dangerous."" As a matter of fact, the problems that afflict the Government of Great Britain afflict also the Government of the Commonwealth. Both Governments are incapable of making any recommendation to solve the problem, and any Government which is incapable of coping with that question copes with nothing and does nothing. A tax upon wealth, whether suggested by one party or another, or increased taxation of incomes, is no remedy. If we put a tax upon wealth, and that wealth represents the industries of the country, the organizations of 'employers can combine to fix prices and pass the tax on to the masses of the people; thus the tax merely increases the burdens upon-the general public, and does not another solve the problem. If we increase the taxation on incomes from the pastoral, agricultural, and other primary industries, which cannot pass on the tax, the burden then becomes so heavy that the industries cannot carry ou in competition with the rest of the. world, and they pass out of existence. Thus we create more of the economic disasters that we seek to prevent. The Government know not what to do. When a tax' is either passed on to the consuming public or cripples industries, it does not solve the problems which confront the Government. The honourable member slid over that probblem; he made no attempt to deal with it ; he ignored it ; like the honourable member for Grampians he merely mentioned it i u passing. He spoke of a debt - of nearly £400,000,000 which the country has to meet within a few years, and then he spoke of saving 6d. here, or cheeseparing there, or scraping a few shillings off the salary of an officer in this or that Department. But God help anybody who wishes to carve anything off our own salaries! Then he turned to repatriation-anothe r # £50,000,0001 What does he propose to do in regard to that? Nothing. Then why mention it? He turned to the Oodnadatta railway with its annual loss of £500,000. Does he propose to do anything ? Does he blame the Government because fchey are makingfchafcloss ? Nofc at all. He passed that over, and turned fco Defence. Does he, or does he not, propose a reduction of the Defence Estimates ? I do not know. Some say that he does, and some say fchafc he does not, and I leave him to answer.

All they could possibly do in face of their annual expenditure of nearly £100,000,000 would be to knock ofi a few thousands here and there, but that is like scraping the rind off a piece of cheese; it does nothing so f ar as the great problem itself is concerned. I had no wish to speak to-night, but I "" asked myself whether the honourable member for Franklin and his followers meant business. Perhaps, I said to myself they see things in a different light from myself. They may not be looking at the problem from the extreme point of view I do, and, as reasonable and rational men, they may think that they have a better remedy. We have heard one remedy proposed by the honourable mem ber clearly and definitely proposes to take £1,000,000 off the expenditure on shipping. That, I take it , refers to the £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 the Government are spending on the development of a mercantile fleet. But if there ever was in the proposals of this Government an expenditure that is of value to Australia and its primary producers, it is this. Whatever errors or waste there may have been in connection with the building of the wooden ships, that seemed inevitable at the particular time and under the particular circumstances. Even since the war we have been confronted with the fact that Australian ships, uuder the influence of the great British capitalists, linked up with their friends i i i this country, have been gradually withdrawn from our coast until we are now about 60,000 tons short. So great has been the resultant inconvenience that there is an outcry for the withdrawal of the Commonwealth-owned ships from overseas traffic to make up the shortage here. Those oversea vessels were specially constructed for deep-water traffic, and, therefore, are the most useful for the transport of the commodities of our primary producers, and for the breaking down of the Shipping Ring. Apart from the boycott by the Inchcape crowd, the Peninsular and Oriental Company, and the Orient Company, linked up with Burns, Philp and Company, who are now the owners of the Australian TJnited Steam - Navigation fleet on [231] this coast, and, with the Union - Company, this gang of British capitalists, who not only control the traffic of the world, but have monopoly privileges on our coast, are pushing the Australian Government into the position of being compelled. to withdraw their ships from overseas traffic in order to meet a shortage which the Combine itself has created. And at this hour, when it is most imperative that the full energies of the Government should be , devoted to supplying shipping for both overseas and coastal traffic, a man, who professes to represent pota-. toes and the primary producers, proposes to save this country by a policy which simply throws Australia more and more into the hands of the Combine. That is the remedy of the honourable member for practical proposal that he and his colleagues have put before us. The other night, when we were discussing Defence Estimates, I determined to find where the economists were. I came to the House to propose a reduction of millions in the Defence votes, not because I do not wish to see my country defended in her hour of necessity, but because, like the honourable member for Flinders (Mr . Bruce) who regards the financial problem as vital, I think it is useless to have men enrolled for defence if we have not economic resources to maintain them in the field. It seems to me waste of money to merely put arms into the hands of men, until we have reconstructed our financial and economic conditions, and have a material buttress for them. I moved an amendment, but the Country party would not support me in the reduction of a single penny. Now they come along with this amendment, but, of course, they do not mean anything, and that is the most despicable and contemptible thing of all . ' I did not mean to be offensive-that was a slip. They are like the gallant general who leads for t h his army, and before the attack makes sure that he will be defeated. So much is that the case that one member of the party frankly admits that he does' not wish to remove the Government.",57
249,Mr HILL,Unknown,"Do not be deluded, my' friend!",58
250,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Does the honourable momber not agree with the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) ? Another squabble in the camp-in great united party!' They caunot support a proposition made by me. What does it matter, after all, what particular brand is put on me-what label I carry? Personally, I would not put any brand on my thoughts, but leave them to speak for themselves. But the Country party is not satisfied with the Government, and the Government are not sure of them. The Government do not know at what moment that party may stab them in - the back. There may come an unexpected moment when, the Country party will march-forward united;'and in that moment the doom of the Government may be sealed. The existence of the Government is precarious, because it can rely neither upon the support nor upon the hostility of the Country party. But the' members of that party, rather than seize the reins of ofiice with the help of the Labonr party, prefer to allow the Administration, which they are always trying to ambush, to retain its position. denounce it on* the public platform, but, though marching'to the attack with foaming mouths and shaking fists, they retire to the rear in the - moment of victory. Under these circumstances, I am kept here to-night to express a: few homely thoughts. A party with great aims like these, that, keeps close together like a hive full of bees! If you ask me how-1 stand towards the amendmein't, I reply that at the present moment I am linked up with a very dear friend of the Prime Minister, who, I understand, is even how - manufacturing bouquets and garlands: of .approbation for him.. That, perhaps, obliges menot to vote, we being what is technically knowtaas paired - But, in any ease, rather than precipitate a crisis, with unknown results to myself, I would support this Government and not risk handing over the country to a body of men of opinions so indefinite as those of the Corner party. With men who have .opinions you can do something, but what sort of policy could that party formulate? The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) said,."" I am a man of open mind,"" and no one who listened to him to-night could doubt the statement. He said, ""I will give ear to the arguments for, and I will hear the arguments against, and 'bring both to the bar of judgment,"" - but God Mr Anstey. knows what the decision would be. I am this not compelled, on this occasion, to sacrifice my country in my own interests. There is no need for me to vote for the Government and to save it from a party whose views are so indefinite that no one knows whether they face north, south, east, or west. Being paired I could, if the position of the Governmeint were 'precarious, walk out of the chamber and not vote; but, as a matter of fact, the Government is quite safe, so that I can vote against, it, with the sure and certain knowledge that it will not be defeated. The members of the Corner - party are in the same position. It is grand to be able to stand on the public platform aind say, "" We opposed the Government tooth and nail."" There are no more glorious champions of human rights and human liberties than those who struggle, knowing that their efforts will not prejudice their personal convenience. How many members are there'in the Corner party? I know not. Perhaps their Leader may be They able to tell us. He may be able to say how many there are today as against yesterday, and what they will number tomorrow when, after the division, they will again be a grand united party, .banded for the defence of the primary interests against a vile and extravagant Government. But on the eve of a division they must always make sure that a sufficient number of their members is absent to prevent the Government from being overthrown. I once more congratulate the members df the party on the magnificent effort which they have made. Their struggle for the country's good is worthy of them. It has provided an inspiring and uplifting spectacle, and what the honourable member for Grampians has described as a very intellectual discussion. The honourable membeifor Franklin spoke of what willhappen when the prices of wool, wheat, and metals fall. What will happen when . the Customs revenue also begins to fall? In the trade and finance column of today's Age it is stated that the banks are raising-, the rates for money overseas pretty stiffly. In many cases they appear to 'be : refusing overseas credit altogether, but in any case their rates are almost prohibitive. The article to which I direct. attention says that these banking corporations are taking this action because they are short of money overseas-don s the Prime Minister believe that?-aii d find it difficult to meet their obligations there. The article goes on to say that the object of the banking corporations is to restrict importation, which will have the same effect as a prohibitive Tariff. They have taken on themselves to proceed with a policy which may be detrimental to the Customs revenue of the country, and when it takes effect, although our expenditure will remain the same, our revenue will be greatly diminished. I . do not say that it is disadvantageous to restrict imports if thereby internal industries are built up, because it is well for a country to have a variety of industries to provide for the.varied abilities of its inhabitants, and to build up a population for its defence. 'The banks registered in Australia, together with the three English banks which do business in this country, had at the end of June £450,000,000 of assets, of which £270,000,000 were then in Australia, and £180,000,000 overseas. As the imports of July and August did not total more than £22,000,000, their oversea money could not have been reduced below the amount of £150,000,000, and therefore they must still have £100,000,000 overseas more than they had at .the outbreak of the war. Yet, for seme purpose which they know best, but not for the benefit of the country, they propose to increase their oversea holdings. The enormous power of the banking corporations and the Shipping Ring provides problems for us to deal with - But I have .said all I need say on the subject to-night, and now I am willing that the Committee shall proceed to the division, and God save the Government!",58
251,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"""Wakefield) [9'.56] - I was not able to satisfy myself && to the motive of the amendment, and having heard the speech delivered by the honourable member for Bourke. I find that he has made the tion still more difficult of solution. I - am sorry that the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) is not present, and in his absence I address a few words to the members of the Corner party generally, some of whom may share with him responsibility for' the amendment, which, it is evident, either means mischief or is evidence of a great deal .of simplicity on the part of those who support it , perhaps both. Although the demand for economy has come from the Corner party, I would remind its members that long before they were elected there was in this House for years a strong combination, which quite as persistently demanded economy in public expenditure. I believe that recently considerable economies have been effected, and we were hopeful of further increasing the application of economical principles to the public expenditure. But the amendment makes an effective attempt to economize practically impossible. Since the commencement of the session the cry for economy has been on the lips of the honourable members sitting not only in the Ministerial Corner but in other parts of the House. There has been an insistent demand that the Government should give us an early opportunity to discuss the Budget and deal with the Estimates. For the first time for many years this Government yielded to that request, with, the result that we have the opportunitv to deal with the Budget and the Estimates at a much earlier period than we have had for many years. And how is that opportunity appreciated by the Leader of the Country party (Mr MCWilliams) ? At the very outset, he makes it impossible for us to be with him, because by his proposal to reduce the item by £1, with the accompanying condition that it shall be a direction to tbo Government to reduce the Estimates by £1,000,000, he immediately throws out to the Ministry a challenge that must be accepted. Honourable members sitting on this side, and particularly those who represent the producing districts of Australia, had reason to expect that there would be 1 sympathetic co-operation on the part of honourable members of the Country party on not only this, but many other similar questions affecting, not merely the general interests, but particularly the producing ques- interests of Australia. Yet we have a hostile amendment submitted immediately the opportunity offers for us to get into close quarters with the Government proposals, and to examine the Estimates thoroughly, so that we may know something about important items of public expenditure of the details of which we have a right to be informed. B y such cooperation we should very soon have obtained the* information. This, then, is the way in which we are met by the Country party! 1 try's interests are being served J1 What was the nature of the speech by the Leader of the Country party submitting his amendment? It was a ter of broad'generalities dealing, amongst other things, with the enormous liabilities resting on the Government during the next five years in connection with the newal of loans falling due. It was really a repetition of the information contained in Mr Knibbs' Handbook. There was attempt to get at any particular item the Estimates which could be materially reduced. It was a broad, general stateHouse, ment of the intention of the Country of a similar character. partu to propose a reduction of the first item in the Estimates by £ 1 as an indirespect of any of those, items. They have cation or direction to the Government to reduce their expenditure by £1,000,000. I would call special attention to the criticism of the Budget last night by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce). penditure in the It was illuminating, practical, educational-on e of the finest criticisms of Budget statement that I have heard in of the House. this House during the last twelve years. I regret that there were but relatively few honourable members present to hear it . amounting to £1,250,000. I would advise all honourable members to read the Hansard report of that magnipenditure? ficent contribution to the debate. I wish the people throughout Australia would carefully read that report. It would pay them, and give them a mighty difWise) ferent impression from that which they gather today through-the medium of the press in regard to the financial situation. No one has been a more persistent vocate of economy in public expenditure than I have been for the twelve years that I have sat in this House, and to-dav am just as desirous as ever of effecting sire information. economy in every possible direction. if the Leader of the Country party will but read the speech delivered by the orable member for Flinders last he will find that what he proposes is solutely impossible. He could uot looked at the Estimates. A mere cursory survey of them would convince any one that it is utterly impossible to reduce them by £1,000,000. We have the figures - particularly as related by the honorwant to know what it is. able member for FJinders^-showing of £82,000,000 of public moneys proposed to be expended this year, £62,241,931 Mr Richard Foster. consists of war expenditure. Deducting This is how the counthe war expenditure, we have remaining £36,622,000, or, to institute a comparison made between the expenditure of the pre-war in year 1913-14 and that of the current matfinancial year, as the honourable member for Flinders did, we have an increase this year of something like £S,000,000. How is that increase of £8,000,000 made up? reA n examination of the Budget will show that nearly £7,000,000 out of that total, of £S,000,000 is accounted for by comno mitments over which the Government hasi n no control.

There are some Departments concerning the expenditure of which I , and, I I think, honourable members generally, deTake, for instance, But the Prime Minister's Department-and this brings me to the reason which causes honme to deeply regret the action taken night, Iby the Leader of the Country party. abI am anxious to get into close quarters have with the Government in regard to the expenditure in the Departments to which I shall refer. The Prime Minister's Department shows a considerable increase. There must be some reason for it , and I The Departthat ment of Home and Territories also shows an increase, and it is my intention to obtain some information concerning the proposed expenditure there. I have already referred approvingly to the increased outlay in the Postmaster-General's Department, because there can be no objection to an expenditure which carries comfort and relief to those who have blazed the trail outback. I also desire some information on the increase in the Attorney-General's and Taxation Departments. The additional outlay in the latter is probably accounted for by the fact that its activities have been extended and the staff increased. Notwithstanding what has been said by the Minister  ton), I believe that the Northern Territory under existing conditions is overmanned. If it is not, the Minister should tell us what duties the public officials are performing, because, apart from the work associated with the pastoral and mineral industry, operations are at a standstill. Australia House, which has been referred to in this Chamber on frequent occasions during the last .few months, is also mentioned in the Estimates. Practically every visitor who has returned from Great Britain bas a sad story to tell of the conditions prevailing in the Commonwealth's head-quaTters in London, and the Government sbould give some details of the proposed expenditure. I also desire to refer to the Department controlling shipping. I was particularly interested in that portion of the speech of the honourable member for Bourke (Mr. Anstey) in reference to shipping, and its bearing on the interests of primary producers in Australia. We are face to face with the actions of a Shipping Combine, which owns a very large proportion of oversea shipping, and which, by its strength, influences the price of every pound of wool, 'every bushel of wheat, every pound of butter or other produce we export. If it were not for that, I would be a very severe critic of the Government shipping policy. I have not been a warm supporter of this particular governmental activity, but my mouth bas been closed because conditions have been such that opposition was not justified. I am anxious, however, to ascertain if we are doing right in pursuing a policy of shipbuilding in Australia. I have been informed that so marvellous have been [232] the activities in the shipbuilding yards in the Old World that at the present time there is a tonnage approaching 8,000,000 available above the pre-war standard, and that construction is still being continued. In these circumstances, we have to consider whether we are justified in extending our shipbuilding operations in Australia beyond the keels already laid down, and whether it would not be cheaper to stay our hands and risk a fall in the market. Our present Inter-State fleet is altogether inadequate, "" because Australian shipowners have adopted the shrewd policy of not restoring their fleets to their pre-war strength until they learn whether ships cannot be purchased at a cheaper rate than that at which they can be built. It has been said by the Leader of the Country party that the plan that has been adopted is the only effective way of making an impression upon the Government, and that statement has been repeated by other honourable members. In my opinion, it is the least effective way. To begin with, it is asking this House to perform an impossibility. It would be infinitely better if we were to pass the first item, and then, when we are dealing with particular items, to demand the fullest information from Ministers. During the twelve years I have been a member of this Parliament, we seldom have been able to perform effective work, because the Estimates have always been brought down so late. On one or two occasions they were not introduced until the following year, when every penny had been spent. When they have been presented reasonably early, we have either spent all the available time in aimlessly debating the first item, or devoted days and hours to trivial ' votes, allowing items involving an expenditure of millions to afterwards go through without any consideration at all. In regard to many Departments there is nc hope of cutting down the Estimates. TheTe is no possibility of that, for example, with respect to the Defence Department. The honourable member for Franklin, when moving his amendment, indicated that most of the money upon which he aimed at economizing could come from the Navy. I would remind him that the press, in criticising public expenditure, has almost unanimously started out by giving the Government credit for exercising a fair degree economy with respect to Defence. Generfor ally, the press has approved the Defence Estimates, both naval and military. The method employed in the South Australian Legislature, in the considerabe tion of Estimates, is far preferable to that usually followed in the National Legislature. Year after year, in dealing this stage. with the Estimates in the State Hou3e, the procedure was to go through all the Departments seriatim, and the responsible Minister would be called upon, whenthat ever required, to explain every pound down. If there was any item concerning which the Minister was not in a position to furnish an explanation, the Committee would insist upon an adjournment until the particulars could be provided. That indicates the only effective way of ing with Estimates, and the plan should be adopted here. I believe that enormous results have followed the investigations of the .Econbe. omies Commission, but we cannot be lastingly appointing Commissions. appreciate the work of that body. Taking a line from what it has accomplished, should make a stand each year upon Estimates, and let Ministers know that no items can pass until honourable bers have been informed of all particulars required. The very existence Economies Commission has made the Departments generally more - careful'; it tainly. has made Ministers more careful - also.
