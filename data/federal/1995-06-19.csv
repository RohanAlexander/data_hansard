1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Stephen Martin) took the chair at 12.30 p.m., and read prayers. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Motion (by Mr Beazley)-by leaveagreed to: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Prime Minister moving forthwith a motion relating to the decision of the French government to resume nuclear testing in the Pacific, and for debate on motion to take precedence over all other business until 3 p.m. this day.",11
2,Mr KEATING,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"I move: That this House: (1) condemns the decision of the Government of France to resume testing in the South Pacific; (2) calls on the French Government to reverse its decision and not to resume testing; (3) shares the resentment of South Pacific countries at nuclear testing in the South Pacific and endorses the statement condemning the decision issued by the South Pacific Forum; (4) deplores France's decision to breach its 1992 moratorium which had improved relations between France and countries in the region; (5) expresses its outrage that France's decision undermines the outcome of the recent Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Review and Extension Conference, particularly the commitment m<1de at the Conference that, pending entry into force of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), the nuclear weapon states should exercise utmost restraint; (6) notes that Australia will do all in its power and urge all other countries to hold France to President Chirac's statement that France would sign a CTBT without reservation in autumn 1996; and (7) calls on France to sign and ratify the protocols of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. This motion is intended to convey as clearly as possible to the government of France the firm condemnation by the people of Australia, acting through their representatives in this House, of the decision announced by the government of France to resume the testing of nuclear weapons at Mumroa Atoll. It also expresses our hope that the decision might yet be reversed. The president of France, President Chirac, announced the decision to resume underground nuclear testing on 13 June. He said Orders that a program of eight tests would be conducted between September 1995 and May 1996. President Chirac said that the testing was essential in order to ensure the security, safety and reliability of France's nuclear weapons. He said that, after completing this series of tests, France would intend to sign that the comprehensive test ban treaty and to rely thereafter on simulation techniques to maintain its nuclear capabilities. The decision revMotion ersed the moratorium on nuclear testing announced by President Mitterrand in 1992, a moratorium which had been widely welcomed and which-together with the earlier Matignon accords, which set up a basis for reconciliation in New Caledonia-formed the foundation on which a new cooperative partnership between France and the countries of the South Pacific was emerging. President Chirac's announcement on 13 June followed widespread speculation in France about the future of the testing program during the presidential election campaign and afterwards. In response to this speculation, Australia, along with many other countries, had made known to the French government our hopes that the moratorium would be maintained. I wrote to President Chirac about this matter following earlier representations made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans). The French moratorium matched separate commitments by the United States, Russian and British governments to refrain from testing. In the end, however, the French government ignored the views of the vast majority of members of the international community and decided to proceed with its program. That is an indefensible decision, and the Australian people and the Australian government condemn it. Australia's opposition to the resumed testing of nuclear weapons by France stems from a number of concerns, of which the most fundamental is the security implications of the decision for Australia, for the South Pacific region and for the international community. The end of the Cold War, having removed the spectre of global nuclear conflict which had thrown such a dark shadow on the second half of the 20th century, gave new hope to the world that we might at last see a world free of nuclear weapons. An important signpost towards a safer world was the decision by the international community on 11 May of this year in New York to extend indefinitely the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Critical to achieving the indefinite extension of the NPT was the simultaneous negotiation and adoption by all parties to the NPT, including the nuclear weapon states, of a 'declaration of principles and objectives on non-proliferation and disarmament'. This declaration included, centrally, a commitment to the goal of nuclear disarmament, with the ultimate objective of the total elimination of nuclear weapons. It gave encouragement to the further development of nuclear weapon free zones, and it said that one important measure towards the elimination of nuclear weapons was the early conclusion-in fact, no later than 1996-of a comprehensive test ban treaty. Pending the entry into force of a test ban treaty, the nuclear weapon states were committed to exercise 'utmost restraint'. The French decision clearly contradicts this undertaking. 'Utmost restraint' on nuclear testing cannot possibly comprehend a program of eight tests. The decision is certain to in the minds of non-nuclear weapons states questions about the good faith of all the nuclear weapons states. It will add to the negotiating difficulties over thecomprehensive test ban treaty. France's action might well provide a con-enient excuse for others who might want to join the nuclear club and who will now argue that the commitment of the nuclear weapons states to the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons is a sham. This is a critical time for the world. The Cold War has ended but what will shape our future security and prosperity is still uncertain. We are moulding the building blocks of that now. It is particularly important that all governments work together to ensure that the international system we have in the 21st century is one that suits all of us better than the one we have had. The French decision is a narrow decision, made according to a narrow definition of narrowly French interests. It defies world opinion, but that is the only bold thing about it-that is, the fact that it defies world opinion is its only defining thing. In every other sense it betrays timidity. It is an act of retreat; it is not an act of engagement. As I said on 15 June, why should a country of such substance undertake this program? What is there to fear in cooperative engagement with the rest of the world? What will best protect the French people is not a 1990s version of the Maginot line but participation in the global dialogue. The French government claims that this nuclear capacity-this force de frappe-is a deterrent, but in the post Cold War world a deterrent to what? It is certainly no deterrent against the greatest nuclear threats to Europe and the world now, including the emergence of new nuclear weapons states. France, by its inflammatory action with regard to its testing program, now runs the greater risk of losing international support, both moral and material, for cleaning up the rotting carcasses of the old Soviet reactors, whose presence still hangs over Europe and France like a pall. This is one of France's and Europe's greatest challenges. These dangers, like the stockpiles of degrading nuclear wearaise pons and weapons systems, and contaminated nuclear sites, cannot be deterred through the further development of an offensive nuclear weapon capability. These considerations are international in scope. They also shape Australia's opposition to nuclear testing by China. Mr Tim Fischer-Or the United States, if they resume.",11
3,Mr KEATING,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"By anybody who resumes. But Australia and the other members of the South Pacific Forum have a particular concern with French testing because it is being conducted not in France's metropolitan territory but in the South Pacific. Most countries in this region are small island states. For many years they have made clear their opposition to nuclear weapons. They have shown this. year after year in the resolutions of the South Pacific Forum and, most clearly, in the creation of the South Pacific nuclear-free zone. The gov-rnment of France is defying not only their wishes but their moral rights. This action will call into question for many in the South Pacific the legitimacy of the French presence there. The French government has defended the environmental safety of the tests at Mururoa and it has alluded to the possibility that international scientists might observe the But the fact is that accidents happen and noone can foresee the longer term dangers associated with possible leakage from the underground coral structures housing the tests. The fact remains that, if thes- tests are perfectly safe, they could be made perfectly well in France. Condemnation of .the French decision has not been confined to the 15 members of the South Pacific Forum. Critical statements have been issued by Belgium, Chile, Denmark, Indonesia, Ireland; Japan, Kenya, Luxembourg, Mexico, Norway, Peru, the Philippines, Korea, Russia, South Africa, and Switzerland. On 15 June the European Parliament in Strasbourg adopted a resolution expressing shock at the decision and urging France to reconsider. Canada and the United States have regretted the decision. Australia's response has been strong and unequivocal. The government has deplored the decision. We have frozen defence relations with FranceÂ· and we will not engage in any defence activity which would in any way assist the testing program. We have protested against the French decision in the Intemational Atomic Energy Agency board of governors meeting in Vienna, and other international bodies, including the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva and the United Nations in New York. Australia has a particular responsibility in this matter this year because we are chair of the South Pacific Forum. I have been in close touch with my forum colleagues about it. On their behalf, I issued a statement condemning the decision and expressing our ljnequivocal opposition to it. I said that forum leaders hoped that France will hear and take note of what the world is saying. To make sure that France does hear, we proposed to send a delegation of members of the South Pacific Forum to Paris to put the views of forum countries directly and unambiguously to the French government. Because of the limited time available, and in accordance with forum practice, the delegation comprises the past, present and next forum chairs. So Senator Evans is leading the delegation. He is accompanied by President Bertests. nard Dowiyogo of Nauru and Mr Tsiamilili, a special envoy from the government of Papua New Guinea, which takes over the forum chair in September. The New Zealand minister for justice, Mr Graham, and the Western Samoan minister of education, Ms Fiami, are also represented on the delegation, as is the secretary general of the forum, the Hon. Ieremiah Tabai. The delegation will meet the French government later tonight, Paris time. The passing of this resolution by the House will assist it to convey to the French government the depth of forum countries' concerns. When the delegation reports back on the results of its discussions early tomorrow morning, I plan to be in touch again quickly with my forum colleagues about what next steps we will take. The concerns of the Australian people about the French decision have been demonstrated clearly over recent days. I hope they will continue to be expressed and in ways which help bring home to the French government how widespread is the opposition to these policies .. But, Mr Speaker, some important things need to be remembered in this debate and some have been lost sight of. The government's position in this matter-and I believe the position of most Australians-is not shaped by hostility towards France or the French people, or to France's role in the Pacific. It is shaped solely by our opposition to this specific policy of the government of France to resume testing nuclear weapons in the South Pacific. French people and Australians who have come from France have, made a valuable contribution to Australia. I have spoken before of the opportunities which exist for French ness in Australia and for Australian businesses in France. I have also said that we welcome constructive French participation in the South Pacific. It is very important that the expressions of Australian concern about this French policy do not flow over into racist attacks on France or French people. It is this particular French government policy which we object to. It is important for Australians to remember that many French people object to this decision as well. A number of members of the French delegation to the European Parliament voted in favour of the resolution I referred earlier. I am sure that all members of this House will share the view that terrorist acts, like the arson reported to be the cause of the fire at the office of the Honorary French Consul in Perth on 17 June, must be utterly rejected and condemned. It would be a very sorry consequence if our opposition to an act which contravenes our every sense of fairness, democracy and decency should erode these values in our own society. Such acts as that which occurred in Perth the government utterly condemns as both illegal and un-Australian. Such acts are not only objectionable but also counterproductive to our cause. Those with influential positions in the community, in politics and in . the media must be aware of their responsibilitiesMrs Bishop-How about yours?",12
4,Mr KEATING,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,And when they voice their concerns they should be careful not to encourage acts of violence or acts which undermine the legitimacy and moral authority of Australia's protest. Mrs Bishop-That is what happens when you leave a vacuum and take no strong stand.,14
5,Mr SPEAKER,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,I warn the member for Mackellar.,14
6,Mr KEATING,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"It does not diminish our resentment of the French decision to understand exactly what it entails. It should be a concern of all members that Australians have an accurate knowledge of the French proposals, not least because our protests will have more effect if they do not contain exaggerbusi- ations and inaccuracies. Our arguments will be more persuasive if they are based on reality and not irrational fear. I doubt if there is any Australian who does not feel anger about the French decision. What we must take to the French government is a collective concerted response-the response of all the Australian people channelled through the best means available to us. This decision to resume testing is a bad decision by the government of France. It is bad because it endangers progress towards a to world free of nuclear weapons. It is bad because it ignores the views of the people of the region in which the tests are being conducted. It is bad because it sets back so far the cause of constructive French participation in the South Pacific region. It is bad because it is a decision which is essentially selfabsorbed rather than showing a wider vision. It is important that this parliament, representing the people of Australia, convey clearly to the government of France the extent of our concern at its wilful and unnecessary decision. I commend the motion to the House.",14
7,Mr HOWARD,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"I commence my remarks by saying that the opposition completely agrees with everything set out in the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I also very strongly associate the Liberal and National parties with the condemnation of the act of wilful destruction that occurred in Perth over the weekend. It was an un-Australian act and an act that was calculated to bring into this debate an element that all of us would wish to be kept out. But, most significantly of all, such behaviour is counterproductive to the very cause of registering the depth of anger and feeling Australians have on this particular issue. The argument Australians have is with the decision of the French government. We do not have an argument with the French people. Australia has long ties of history and sacrifice with France. Because of that, there are few countries in the world that have as much right to speak bluntly to the French government as has Australia. In fact, the sacrifices of Australians in defenceÂ·of France have very few parallels in history. If there is one country to which we do have a right to express to its government and people in very blunt, unapologetic and frank terms our anger, condemnation and contempt for the behaviour of that government, it is France. But, in doing that, phasise that our argument is with the political decision of the French government. I share to the full the Prime Minister's concern that it not be a general anger directed at ordinary French people or at Australians of French descent living in this country. The decision of the French government to resume nuclear tests in the Pacific was a particularly insensitive decision; a decision that ran counter to the events of world history over the past few years. To many Australians-indeed to many people around the world-it must have seemed as though time had stood still for President Chirac and for those people in the French government who were responsible for the decision. It is as though the momentous events of the late 1980s and the early 1990s-which, first of all, brought the end to Soviet hegemony over eastern Europe and, ultimately, led to disintegration of the Soviet Union and to the end of the Cold War-had completely passed the French President and his colleagues by. It is as though for them time had really stood still. I am sure that to many young Australians, in particular, the decision of the French government must have seemed particularly insensitive, anachronistic and brutishly out of touch with the drift of world opinion. In recent years we have grown used to hearing talk about the peace dividend-in other words, the consequences for the world with the end of the Cold War, with expenditure on armaments being directed to other things, with the removal from the nations of the world of the awful implications of living on the balance of the nuclear terror that was a function of the Cold War. But of all the dividends of that peace, I dare say that most Australians-indeed, most people around the world-would have imagined that the greatest dividend of all was the belief that, long term, the threat of nuclear war and nuclear holocaust had been removed. Therefore, whatever technical justification or complicated theoretical reasons may be advanced by the French government, the very fact that a nation known for its civility and I em- for its enormous contribution to Western civilisation should be so against the background of that peace dividend and should be so insensitive to world opinion as to propose these tests was not only particularly disappointing but also, in my judgment and, I am sure, in the judgment of all people in this House, justifies the very strong reactions of disgust and revulsion. The coalition comes to this debate sharing all of the concerns that have been expressed by the Prime Minister. I think this is one of those occasions where it is possible to say that right across the spectrum of Australian opinion-people who support the government and people who support the coalition-there was an instantaneous explosion of anger. Many of us would have to acknowledge that in our political experience in recent years there has rarely been an event which has brought forth such an instantaneous expresthe sion of hostility and rejection. More than anything else, there is a sentiment of bewilderment and amazement that, given the end of the Cold War and the changed circumstances that exist in the world at the present time, a nation with the record of civilisation and civility that the French nation has could possibly have made this decision. Having said that, I think I would be failing in my duty as Leader of the Opposition, and I would be failing in my duty in speaking on behalf of a significant section of the Australian population, if I did not again express my absolute amazement at the pathetically inadequate response of Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans). However much the foreign minister may have been subsequently justified, nothing can alter the fact that the language used by him in his press conference in Tokyo was not the language of somebody expressing the justified outrage of the Australian people. It was the language of somebody bringing a technically balanced and academic approach to an international problem. That is where Senator Evans was wrong. It might have been the language of somebody who might aspire to high office in the United Nations but it was not the language of somebody who was properly expressing the concern or the outrage of the Australian people. Let me read to you what he actually said after having taken his obligatory swipe at his opposite number and after having lapsed overseas into domestic politics. He said: What we're talking about here are the proportionate responses to the nature of the decision that France has made. We deplore the decision. We are disappointed by it. At the same time, we do acknowledge the context in which these tests will be taking place is really very different from that in which they have taken place in the past. I will borrow the words of one of his predecessors. When the now Governor General, Bill Hayden, was Australia's foreign minister he warned us once that words were bullets in diplomacy and in foreign policy. They can also be bullets in terms of the grossly excessive impact they can have on the opinion of the world, or the opinion of individual countries, but their lack of force could also have an equally big impact on the interests of this country. Our complaint is that, in those remarks, Senator Evans failed to capture the mood of anger, disgust and rejection of the Australian people. Worse than that, he basically said to the French government, 'We're upset about it but we really understand why you're doing it.' That is where he let the Australian interests down, and all of you sitting opposite know that he failed Australia lamentably last week. In his failure to express the legitimate anger of the Australian people on that occasion, and in his taking of that extraordinarily academic approach-an approach that did not capture the community mood-he failed the basic test of somebody who represented the interests of the Australian nation overseas. His remarks even produced this interesting response from one of the journalists, who asked: Are you saying that the French decision to go ahead then is not as bad as what it could have been? The senator replied: Exactly. What kind of message did that send to President Chirac? Senator Evans's vjsit to France at the present time, as a result of these remarks, is next to useless. Having given that initial tickle-my-tummy, weak, limp response, the foreign minister has basically telegraphed and conveyed to. the French government and to the French people that, no matter what he now says, no matter what the Prime Minister now says and no matter what anybody opposite now says, we really do understand that this particular decision is not quite as bad as it might have been; that the context is different. To use that kind of language over something as serious as this is absolutely to betray the Australian people and to translate to the French government an academic and internationally academic acceptance of the broad diplomatic reasons as to why the French government might want to carry out these tests. The foreign minister then went on to say: I think you've just got to keep these things in proportion. We are talking about underground tests here. We are not talking about atmospheric tests and as such the health implications of that remains to be proven beyond doubt that there is a serious and widespread impact. In other words, in his initial press conference, he has tried to paint a benign context for the carrying out of these tests. That is the failure of the foreign minister of Australia. Whilst I agree with everything the Prime Minister has said-and there is nothing the Prime Minister said that anybody could possibly have taken exception to-I took exception to what many on this side of the House, and what many on your side of the House, also took exception to, and that is the initially weak, indifferent response of the foreign minister. An attempt has been made by the Prime Minister to engage in a bit of catch-up politicsMrHowe-Oh!",14
8,Mr HOWARD,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,You are catching upA government member-It is absolutely right.,16
9,Mr HOWARD,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"It is absolutely right. Your foreign minister failed to discern, understand and capture the mood of the Australian people when he gave his initial response, and there is nothing you can say in the parliament today that is going to wipe that out. The fact is that you completely failed to capture that mood of anger, that mood of hostility and that mood of disgust. As I say, whilst there is absolutely nothing in the motion that the opposition takes exception to, and we will have absolutely no difficulty in supporting that motion, we do believe that there are a number of additional steps that ought to be taken; and we are going to propose an addendum to this motion. Therefore, I move: That the following words be added to the motion: 'requires the government to: (a) join with New Zealand and suspend military cooperation with France, except for serveilmoved lance, United Nations and humanitarian activities; (b) cease refuelling all French non-humanitarian military transit flights; (c) recall the Australian Ambassador to show the depth of our concern, and to develop in association with the South Pacific Forum a regional plan of action to embarrass and if possible hinder French nuclear testing, including action in the United Nations condemning French nuclear testing as a gross abuse of colonial power and, along with similar tests by the People's Republic of China, as gross violations of the world environment; and (d) discuss with the USA the possibility of data sharing to remove the public French excuse for the tests.' I invite the government to give us some indication as to why it is not possible to add at least some, if not all, of those additional proposals to the motion that has been presented by the Prime Minister. Are you going to give us this clinically defined, limited response again today, or are you going to add a few more things to it? Are you, once again, going to fail to capture the sense of indignation, or are you going to rely on your numbers? I say to you, Mr Speaker, very clearly that if our amendment is defeated we will not divide the House on the Prime Minister's motion. I have no argument at all with the substance of the Prime Minister's motion, but I think this is an occasion where the House could go further. We could give a lead to the Australian people, and they will want to know why the Labor Party is not prepared to embrace this reasonable addendum to the Prime Minister's motion.",17
10,Mr KEATING,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"Mr Speaker, I seek leave to make a brief response to the Leader of the Opposition.",17
11,Mr SPEAKER,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"Prime Minister, you actually moved the particular motion, did you not?",17
12,Mr KEATING,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,Yes.,17

17,Mr KEATING,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"You got it half an hour ago. Half an hour is not 30 seconds. Mr Speaker, we will look at it, but I thought much of the humbug which the Leader of the Opposition just engaged in can be demonstrated by these facts. He talked about the role of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans). He said, 'But what I took exception to is the initially weak response of the foreign minister.' Mr Speaker, I want the House to mark these words.",17

21,Mr KEATING,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"I am speaking to tpe amendment. Of course I am. The Leader of the Opposition was asked-and this is when this program was up and running: Do you think that the French are riding roughshod over the South Pacific area? I mean, are they acting arrogantly in pursuit of their Force de Frappe? Mr Howard: Well, I don't want to make a provocative statement about what they are doing. believe that there is a certain, you know, there certainly an appearance of insensitivitY, and I I can understand some of the concerns that have been expressed. Then the question comes: should France stop testing? Mr Howard replied: Well, that's a difficult issue. I certainly don't far as the government does on that. These are the words of the outraged now Leader of the Opposition. Later in 1985 he gave us his views on the government's proposal to create a nuclear-free zone in the Pacific.",17

It says: The constructive proposal is that the Australian Labor Party should totally abandon its absurd support for a nuclear-free zone in the South Pacific. That is what he had to say.

54,Mr SPEAKER,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"I have already ruled that the Prime Minister is in order in responding to this matter. In the process of this debate, I will give latitude to all members of this parliament.",19
55,Mr KEATING,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"The Leader of the Opposition said that the nuclear-free zone in the Pacific was obsessively tangent. He said it was a preoccupation. He was more worried about the Soviet threat at Cam Ranh Bay. Then, on 20 August 1986, the member for Mayo (Mr Downer) said: I have two objections to this Treaty. One is that it is basically an anti-French treaty and little else, and except for the platitudes that we all support, it embarrasses a number of our major allies. He went on-this is the member for Mayo, your valiant shadow spokesperson-to say: ... the raison d'etre of the Treaty-this needs to be understood-is to attack the French and the French involvement at Muroroa ... Here you are actually saying, 'How dare the Australian Labor Party as a government attack the French for testing.' But it has always been your attitude. Mr Howard interjecting",19
56,Mr KEATING,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"Let us take 1995. Last week the Leader of the Opposition's response to this was basically supportive of the government's response. He moved his position with a humbug change and then got up in this debate to attack the foreign minister, when he has supported everything the foreign minister has said-supported every single thing the foreign minister has said-only to react to material from his pollster and from his advertising agent to shift his position. Mr Reith-I raise a point of order with you, Mr Speaker. I refer you specifically to page 469 of House of Representatives Practice, which substantiates the point which I made to you earlier. I refer to your previous ruling which I put to you now is in fact wrong. The specific quote from House of Representatives Practice states: A Member who has already spoken to the original question prior to the moving of an amendment may speak to the question on the amendment but the remarks must be confined to the amendment. The Prime Minister has clearly been stung by the amendment and now he is addressing his original motion.",19
57,Mr BEAZLEY,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"Mr Speaker, on the point of order: obviously in debating the amendment you debate the argument that went to the amendment. The argument for the amendment put forward by the Leader of the Opposition quite specifically was an attack on the foreign minister-absolutely specifically-and that is what is being addressed here.",20
58,Mr SPEAKER,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"I am indebted to the honourable member for Flinders for drawing that matter to my attention, but I did say that I was prepared to allow some latitude on both sides.",20
59,Mr HOWARD,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"Oh, yes!",20
60,Mr SPEAKER,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"I did say that. The Prime Minister, as the Leader of the House has indicated, has responded appropriately in my view and the Prime Minister has the call.",20
61,Mr KEATING,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"Mr Speaker, I happen to know the standing orders. I have been here long enough to know them. Let me make this clear: the Leader of the Opposition got up and said that he supported the government's amendment, he supported the government's proposition. But then in a mealy-mouthed way he went on to attack the foreign minister, seeking to deny unanimity of view in the parliament about this proposal-that is, after having initially agreed with the response by the foreign minister, he shifted his position, as he was told by his party or his advertising agency, because he thought there was a shift in popular and public sentiment. So the Leader of the Opposition came out supportive of the government after Senator Evans's remarks. If members of the public want an indication of where the Leader of the Opposition is coming from, they need to go back only to the remarks I referred to. He has never supported the government's position against nuclear testing in the Pacific, because he has always believed that basically the position was anti-French. It was never anti-French; it was always about the sovereignty of this area of the world and making it clear that if the French wanted to test this weapon they could test it in metropolitan France. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to come in here and secure a benefit for the country and himself by saying that he supports the amendment-and I am just exposing his mealy-mouthed approach in this debate by his references to the foreign minister, and the amendment which he moved without notice or without the courtesy of providing the government with it as we did when we provided him with the motion-the government will consider the amendment and will respond appropriately. Let me record the points again. At no point in time, when pressed on this issue, has the Leader of the Opposition ever shown a change of sentiment in his answer to this question: Should they stop testing it? Mr Howard: Well, that's a difficult issue. I certainly don't go as far as the Government does on that. That was his position then and that is basically his position now. That has basically been his position all along. That is why he did support the foreign minister when he came out. The Leader of the Opposition then comes into this House, after supporting the government's resolution, with a mealymouthed attack on the foreign minister, who is now representing our country in France and who should be supported by him, and trails his miserable political coat to seek some partisan advantage. While the foreign minister is in Paris with the delegation from the South Pacific Forum putting a position to the government of France, the Leader of the Opposition is carving away at the authority of the foreign minister to put that position. I put on the record the fact that the Leader of the Opposition has always been a humbug on this issue and he remains a humbug on this issue. No attempts by him or frontbenchers on his side to try to silence me by phoney points of order can disguise the fact that he has been a complete humbug on the issue.",20

He said that he thinks what the government has done is appropriate, yet he comes into the House and attacks the foreign minister when he supported the foreign minister and the government's position.

I remind members of the circumstances in 1985, lest they forgot. Mr Snowdon-Anti-nuclear, Tim.",21
78,Mr TIM FISCHER,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"I remind the member for the Northern Territory that that was four years before the Berlin wall collapsed in November 1989. It was in the middle of difficulties with the Star Wars. It was in the middle of the negotiations on the SALT treaty and it was at the height of the presidency of Ronald Reagan. It was when the Cold War was still very much, sadly, about the world. It was in that circumstance that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) at that time made those remarks. They related to 1985; they related to the circumstances of 1985. It did the Prime Minister no credit whatsoever to come in here and give that quote as if it were just last week when, in fact, it was in 1985. It was a most dishonest approach and he has been caught absolutely red-handed. Only he could downgrade this quite important and momentous occasion of the federal parliament by bringing out this very shabby dimension. The reality is that both the government and the opposition support the motion moved by the Prime Minister today. I make it very clear, and the Leader of the Opposition made it very clear, that we support all the words put down by the Prime Minister in the government's motion here today. The Leader of the Opposition went right through his speech and just at the end made the point that we needed to take some additional reasonable steps, which have been made available to the government by way of an amendment-an amendment to put a bit of guts into our position on the French decision. I have no hesitation in supporting both the motion and the amendment. I want to make the threshold point that I exclude the French people in France. I also want to spare a moment of thought for the French-Australian people who have been battered around the ears in the course of the last week-many of whom oppose this decision to resume French nuclear testing in the South Pacific. Mr Bilney- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I do not want to interrupt the Leader of the National Party but I believe that if we are debating an amendment we ought to have it in front of us. I do not have a copy of the amendment and I would like to see it.",21
79,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,Mr Jenkins)Order! The minister will resume his seat. Copies of the amendment will be circulated as soon as possible.,22
80,Mr TIM FISCHER,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. In fact, the minister now has a copy of the amendment, and it is a good amendment, which I would ask the government to consider and in fact adopt so that this parliament can speak with one voice through both the amendment and the motion. But I make the point that those FrenchAustralians deserve a fair go. The target of this is the President of France, Jacques Chirac. The target of this is the government of France and its disgraceful decision to resume nuclear testing. I just happen to have in my hand a brochure from the most recent French election campaign, and it is very relevant to this debate and this decision. On the front cover it says, 'Jacques Chirac la France pour to us'-'France for all'. You might say he was referring to French electors. Hopefully, he might have been referring to mankind as well. Going over to the back page of this brochure, I quote the last line in, I must admit, my not too good French, 'respecte dans Ie monde', the accurate quotation of which istaking into account what he said in the rest of this paragraph-'and with respect for all in the world'. This election manifesto of Jacques Chirac spoke of 'respect for all in the world'. There is no respect in this decision by France to resume nuclear testing in the South Pacific. Indeed, it creates the circumstance where Jacques Chirac henceforth ought to be known as 'Dark Jacques' for the heavy shadow that this totally unwarranted nuclear activity places over his incumbency as President of France and for the regression into the bitter attitudes of the Cold War that his action suggests. The last thing we need as the world approaches a new century is a return to the dark ages of nuclear stand-off. Yet that is exactly the way France is heading the world. There is no justification whatsoever when you examine in detail the utterances of the French President and other French spokesmen. There is no excuse. Their decision simply does not stand up. These people, the French government, spent some 25 years exploding atmospheric and underground nuclear weapons in the South Pacific until this was ceased by a decision of President Mitterrand in 1992. Mr Bilney-No. The underground decision was ceased as a result of the ICJ case which the Labor government took.",22
81,Mr TIM FISCHER,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"And, the minister concedes, France ceased testing back in 1992. I take on board, in the spirit of getting some sense into this debate, the view put forward, but it was reaffirmed by President Mitterrand with that decision. Are we to believe that the French really need additional nuclear testing, an additional eight explosions over the course of the next 11 months? Do they need more technical information to better their information bank with regard to the whole concept of atom bombs and nuclear testing? Let me just dwell on this particular point, because I think it is relevant to the debate. In one sense it could be said that, after 25 years, after all their computer programming, all their scientific endeavour, France has-and it is probably the equivalent of many times this-a million megabytes of computer capacity of information on French nuclear testing. If they have eight more tests-though I hope they will change their minds-that might produce one more megabyte. So their computer capacity of information will be going from one million megabytes to one million and one megabytes before they eventually cease to test for all time. I simply say to the House: that does not stack up; they do not need even one more megabyte of information, let alone one million megabytes, with regard to nuclear testing, given all the testing they have done and the damage they have done already in the Southern Hemisphere. It is time that France went back to the drawing board and reviewed this decision very carefully indeed. Not only is the testing of a bomb in the Pacific something which will cause a major backlash in Australia and New Zealand but that backlash will continue for a long time to come. I fear all of this, in essence, is nothing more than a public relations stunt. It is all about the glory of France, a new president embarking on his presidency; it is little about scientific endeavour or building up additional nuclear information. It was a very convenient decision for President Jacques Chirac to take, and it will be one he will eventually come to regret. For whatever reason he has made this decision, we must now take the fight in very strong terms to the government of France, and to the President of France to get him to review this decision. It does give me a certain satisfaction that, so strong has been the reaction of the peoples of the South Pacific and even of some people in France to this action-as the Prime Minister alluded to-Chirac's callous and cruelly cynical decision will backfire not only in a commercial sense but also in the sort of leadership that a modern day France ought to display to the world. A France which over the last century gave the world so many advances in the health field, so many advances in technology, be it in rail transport or whatever, and so many cultural advances is now a France which, against the very statement in President Chirac's brochure, is going to turn its back on the rest of the world and proceed down this particular path. I hope Chirac has ultimately misjudged the mood of his own people. I hope that that will cause him to reconsider for domestic political French reasons as opposed to and quite apart from the reaction of the rest of the world. But what was our government's response to all of this? I would make the additional point: we were very slow off the mark. The quote of the Leader of the Opposition was a quote made at the doorstop interview early in the day on arrival at the Cairns shadow cabinet meeting, which I attended. Even in that quote the Leader of the Opposition kept the options open. He was reviewing the unfolding situation, and his quote from last Tuesday in Cairns should have been seen in that perspective. But to go back to further mislead, as the Prime Minister did, is very disgraceful and I think he will regret that also in setting the debate off in this particular way. Further, the French have dismissed subsequent Australian concern with just a shrug of the shoulder. They seized on the horrific fire in Perth-and I very much regret that act of arson against the French consulate in Perth. They read of the first reaction of our foreign minister, and they read between the lines; they read clearly enough the reaction of a government that really did not care to rock the boat while France literally rocked the Pacific and the rest of the world. That is what I really regret-that the Australian government on this issue did not come out boxing more quickly in a more coordinated way and with a more comprehensive approach. If the government's own lack of protest was not bad enough, no less a person than the Prime Minister sought to denigrate members of the opposition who did demonstrate a fitting sense of outrage over the French decision. So we had more name calling by the Prime Ministername calling which Australian politics could well do without, particularly when dealing with issues of great substance. I think our amendment to the motion will add strength to the Australian position. So let the government, just this once, take on board what the coalition has put before it. We are prepared to support every word of the government's motion, and the government should indicate that it is prepared to support every word of our amendment. We will then have a unanimous decision by, hopefully, both houses of this parliament, on this issue. I would like to close by saying a few words to those people in the Australian community who feel the greatest outrage over French testing and the greatest outrage over their own government's lack of action, those people who have taken direct action and have taken part in protests around the country. I say to them that I know how they feel-that they are annoyed at and angered by the French government and they are annoyed at and angered by their government's failure to make their protest more effective. I know that many will express their feelings by boycotting the purchase of French goods. I certainly cannot blame them for expressing themselves in that way. But I appeal to them not to confuse actions of legitimate, non-violent protest with taking violent action of any kind. I reject any move towards violent demonstration and urge them to proceed with peaceful demonstration and no violent action whatsoever. In that way we can build a grand coalition of opposition right across Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific against this incredible decision by France. . These people have been let down by the President of France. These people have been let down by the response of their government. These people are entitled to put their view in a positive and peaceful way. It is our obligation to see that that view, in tum, is put on the floor of this parliament. That is why the coalition supports the motion before the chair. That is why the coalition takes the additional step of arguing, quite properly in all the circumstances, for the recall of the Australian Ambassador to France, and for new instructions, as a reflection of our protest over the French government's decision. It is a bit sad but it is a matter the Kenyan nation has recalled its ambassador from Canberra in the last few days, over a lesser matter . We should be prepared to have the courage and the decisiveness, as part of our approach, to instruct the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, to bring back"" on the same flight to Australia, the Australian Ambassador to France. This would be a very sharp reflection that there is some strength and some backbone in the Australian response to the French government decision. We want a proper course of action arising from this French government decision. We want to remind President Chirac of his own election statement that he would have respect for all ,the world. We want France to reconsider and for the government to adopt both the motion before the chair and the amendment as being the correct way forward to deal with this disgraceful decision by France, which I again condemn.",22
82,Mr BILNEY,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"Kingston-Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs) (1.34 p.m.)-I agree with the previous speaker, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), that it would be a pity should grandstanding in this place be allowed to obscure the great measure of agreement that there is between government and opposition about this announcement by France that it will resume nuclear testing. I will start by looking at some of the points made in the opposition's amendment, which we have undertaken to consider. J do deplore the lack of courtesy involved in not giving prior notice of it. Many of the points made in it are points which the government has acted on. They are aqornments to the, proposed resolution rather than substantive additions to it. The amendment reads: Join with New Zealand and suspend military cooperation with France; except for surveilhince, United Nations and humanitarian activities. Effectively, that is what we are doing by refusing to refuel military flights through Australia which have anything to do with supporting, directly or indirectly, testing at Mururoa. That applies to the next point: Cease refueliing all French non-humanitarian of fact that military transit flights. The next point requires the government, to recall the Australian Ambassador for various purposes, one of which is to develop in association with the South Pacific Forum a regional plan of action to embarrass and if possible hinder French nuclear testing. Our consultations with nations of the South Pacific Forum are close and continuing. It is for that reason that Australia has orchestrated a protest to France on behalf of the 15 nations of the South Pacific Forum and has led that delegation through the person of the foreign minister, who is now in Paris. Another point reads: including action in the United Nations condemning French nuclear testing ... It is a measure of the ignorance of the opposition that it does not know that that action has already been taken. Our Ambassador to the United Nations, Mr Richard Butler, has delivered to the Secretary-General a message on behalf of the South Pacific countries represeqted in the United Nations precisely to that effect. The final point reads: Discuss with the USA the possibility of data sharing to remove the public French excuse for tests. Again, that is something which has been explored by me, including with the French. To make out that these are substantial and far-reaching additional actions which are being urged upon the government is to make out something which is not true. Unfortunately, it is that meretriciousness that has characterised the opposition's approach to this debate from the very beginning. We appreciate its support. But it would be nice to see it given freely and it would be nice to see it given in a less pettifogging way than has happened. The announcement that France would resume nuclear testing has provoked extremely widespread international indignation, and in the South Pacific-the area for which as minister for Pacific island affairs I have a particular responsibility-bitterness and outrage. The countries of the South Pacific Forum have expressed their deep resentment and opposition to this decision. That bitterness and resentment are the more compelling as they come from a part of the world where people take pride in their traditions of respect for the views of others-a respect which has not been shown by France on this occasion. There are very good reasons why the countries of the Pacific feel a particular sense of outrage and why Australia, as the proposed resolution says, shares that sense. For the Pacific, this is not a decision which has been taken by a distant power and which has merely distant effects. The decision to resume nuclear testing in the Pacific is a decision to try out an abhorrent weapon-a weapon the long-term effects of which both on people and on the environment are not known but are greatly feared-in a part of the world which has a very deep affinity with the natural environment. Pacific countries, as many in the House would know, regard themselves as the custodians of that environment for future generations. By introducing an element of doubt about the safety of that environment, France is imperilling the birth right of the Pacific countries. Those countries are tiny. They have not had the power, the influence, the economic levers or the population to convince France the not to continue testing. That is another element of the outrage that is so widely feltthat this is a decision of a powerful country taken against the interests of a group which has a very small voice in world affairs. These countries have a total population of around six million. However, without Papua New Guinea and Fiji, there are less than a million. The nearest country to the tests is the Cook Islands, with a population of some 20,000. Nauru, whose president is part of the delegation now in Paris, has a population of 10,000. So it is clear that it is a David and Goliath situation-an imbalance-which was very much at the centre of the decision by a number of Pacific countries to seek greater strength through more unity by establishing the organisation which now represents them. The first South Pacific Forum met in Wellington in 1971, the original members being Fiji, Western Samoa, Cook Islands, Tonga, New Zealand, Nauru and Australia. It has since expanded to include all independent countries in the South Pacific. This year, the forum will be welcoming the latest of them, Palau. Nuclear testing was then and is now very much at the centre of the forum's concerns. It is instructive to return to that foundation year-I971-to realise just how abiding and how deeply felt the Pacific's concern with French testing has been. The final communique drew attention to the forthcoming series of nuclear tests to be conducted by France in the South Pacific. Participants expressed their deep regret that the tests, which were then conducted in the atmosphere, continued to be held in the islands of French Polynesia, despite the partial test ban treaty and the protests repeatedly made by a number of countries. The forum addressed an urgent appeal that the then current test seriesremember, this is 1971-should be the last in the Pacific. France ignored that appeal and, 32 years after it was made, has still not signed the partial test ban treaty. French testing in the atmosphere ceased 1974. Why did it cease? It ceased because Labor government, in consultation with New Zealand, took the French to the International Court of Justice. The French, as a result of that action, withdrew from testing in the atmosphere. However, it continued testing underground from 1975 to 1991. Since that time, France has conducted altogether 192 tests, 175 of which have been in the South Pacific--44 in the atmosphere and 131 underprovide ground. At last year's forum in Brisbane, there was perhaps some scope for optimism that the cessation of testing would be permanent. forum welcomed the extension by the United States of its moratorium on testing and the continuation by other nuclear weapons states, except China, of their testing moratoriums. tackled the issue of French testing very specifically by saying that, if France were cease testing permanently, that would contrithe bute significantly to improving the relations between France and forum countries. Conbenefit versely, the forum noted that any resumption of testing would be a major setback 'current positive trends in relations between France and the region'. Unfortunately, the cautionary tone of that final statement has been borne out by subsequent events. I must say that it was with a very deep sense of personal disappointment that I learned that France had taken the decision to resume testing. One could always hope that good sense, a sense of responsibility and of understanding of the views of others, prevail in France. Indeed, we can still have some hope that the French will better undersolution. stand the depth of the Pacific's concerns when confronted with them directly by the forum mission which has been talking to them in Paris. We must continue to urge France to reconsider its decision, to assume a sense of international leadership on the issue, and to be in fact, as well as in rhetoric, the constructive participant in Pacific affairs which it has claimed to be-indeed, in recent years it has been. I had the sense-to my disappointment, it has proved to be wrong-that France was continuing to move towards a more positive in and constructive role in the Pacific. It has the shown considerable willingness to cooperate with Pacific countries in a wide range of activities-from maritime surveillance operations directed at detecting illegalÂ· fishing activities, and thereby helping to protect one of the region's most valuable resources, to an arrangement concluded with Australia and New Zealand in 1992 to coordinate responses to natural disasters in the region and to development assistance to the region of around $20 million a year in addition to the resources it provides for its own territories. So it is a constructive participant, including in the region's largest program delivery The organisation-the South Pacific Commission. It is because those elements of France's relations with the Pacific-and this goes to It some of the points in the amendment-remain a benefit to the Pacific countries themselves to that we would like them to continue, even if overall tone of relations has been soured. It is also because these activities are of to the tiny countries of the South Pacific that we believe our own involvement to the in them should continue. I refer briefly to New Caledonia. The House will recall that New Caledonia was the focus of great discontent and conflict in the Pacific not so long ago and the scene of quite dreadful bloodshed. The process which was set in train under the Matignon accords in 1988 has achieved great progress in reconciling political attitudes and in setting the political and economic basis for a referendum on the status would of the territory in 1998. A lot needs to be done to bring about that I urge France to continue with the process in a constructive and positive way. We still look to France to ensure a peaceful evolution in 1998, even though France's relations with the region will be set back by the resumption of testing. I hope I have managed to express some of the background to the deep disappointment and heartfelt regret that many in the Pacific feel about France's announcement. France has acted in a high-handed manner, disregarding many of the values which Pacific countries hold dear. That is why forum countries have unanimously supported Australia, unanimously supported the efforts of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as forum chair and unanimously supported his statement condemning the French announcement. It is also why forum members, at very short notice and at the expense of business at home, went to France to participate in the forum mission. We urge France to heed the call of the South Pacific Forum. This is our region. It is precious to us. If France participates as a positive and constructive partner in the region and its development, it will be welcomed. But I say to France, 'Please don't visit on the region an abhorrent technology which is so much at odds with the way life is lived in the Pacific.' I want to comment specifically on the matters raised in the opposition's amendment. The Prime Minister made clear in his speech that the passing of this motion would assist the forum delegation which is now in Paris to convey to the French government the depth and intensity of the concerns forum countries have about the decision to resume nuclear testing. He said that, when the delegation reported on the results of its discussions, he would be in touch again quickly with his forum colleagues about the next steps we would take. The initial response from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was a totally unfair attack on the leader of the forum delegation, Senator Gareth Evans. The effect of that-by accident or design-was to undermine the authority of the delegation and the forum's approach. That response seems to me to have been shaped by the narrowest perceptions of political advantage, not at doing what is necessary to advance the critical national and regional interests that are at stake here. As Prime Minister said, the government will wait until the forum delegation meets the French government. That will be the time to discuss with forum countries the next steps. It seems to me to be quite wrong and bad that, with this cheap point scoring which the Leader of the Opposition, in particular, has gone on with, we should have the effect of pre-empting whatever happens in Paris and whatever the French reaction may be. So much of the pettifogging activities which are described in the amendment-those that are not more substantial and serious-really seem to be solely for the purpose of point scoring. The government rejects the amendment, unless and until it is made of value by whatever comes out of the discussions in Paris.",24
83,Mr DOWNER,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"I support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). I think it will enhance very substantially the motion that has been moved today by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Let me say at the outset that my colleagues and I, as the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, are deeply disappointed by the French decision to proceed with nuclear testing in the Pacific. We believe that the French decision shows an arrogant disregard for not just Australia or New Zealand but, importantly, for the many nations of the South Pacific. A lot of those countries lack population, lack economic power, have no military power and are not strategically crucial. The French should show a much greater degree of sensitivity and a greater humanitarian concern towards those countries than they are clearly showing now. Our relationship with France is, on the whole, a long and historic one which is important to Australia. I personally do not walk away from the fact that France is a country that I like very much. The French are people for whom I typically have the very greatest of regard. But this decision by the French President and the French government is profoundly disappointing. It is a decision which is rejected strongly by the people of Australia. The task for us as a country is to demonstrate in the strongest of practical terms our the objection to what the French are doing. There is no point in Foreign Affairs simply taking the view that all that the national interest involves is being polite to other countries. The national interest is deeper and more important than that. France-and any other country-needs to understand that Australia is the most decent and friendly of countries imaginable. We will notÂ· have our interests stamped on by anybody, including the French. If they choose to stamp on our national interest, as they are doing by resuming nuclear testing in the Pacific, we have every right to react in the strongest of practical terms to that. That is the difference between the coalition and the Labor Party. The Labor Party has taken a weak stand on this issue. I have been a little surprised weakness of its stand. It has been dragged news bulletin by news bulletin into taking a stronger stand by the coalition and, importantly, by their constituents. I understand that the member back there is from Queensland. I am not sure of his electorate.",27

85,Mr DOWNER,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"He is from Queensland then. I know the electorate of Moreton even if I have not heard of the member. The electorate of Moreton is near Brisbane airport. I was at Brisbane airport last week on my way from Cairns to Adelaide. In a lounge there I spoke on the telephone to somebody about the French nuclear testing. A Labor member of parliament in the lounge with me congratulated me on the stand that I and the Leader of the Opposition were taking on this issue and condemned the stand that the Labor government was taking. A member of the Labor Party condemned the stand of the Labor Party! If anybody in the gallery or anyone in the House thinks for a minute that members of the caucus are proud of the way the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney), the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Prime Minister have handled this issue, they are not. That is the corridor talk. They just do not have the guts to say it properly. Sorry, one member does: the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones). The President of the Australian Labor Party did the right thing. He came out and attacked Senator Evans for his response to this decision by the French government. He embarrassed the Labor Party but reflected the views that I and the Leader of the Opposition had been expressing on behalf of the people of Australia. The people of Australia are outraged about this. The Labor Party leadership, not necessarily the backbenchers, has taken a pitifully weak approach to the whole issue. This French nuclear test issue did not spring from nowhere. Plenty of publicity was given to the fact that Mayor Chirac, as he was before and during the French presidential election campaign, said that one of the things by the he would look at doing was resuming French nuclear tests. I think Monsieur Balladur said the same thing. Mr Bilney-Not quite.",28
86,Mr DOWNER,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"He was a bit more equivocal perhaps. Two out of the three candidates indicated that they were well disposed towards the idea of resuming tests and the socialist candidate was against it. When President Chirac won the election, the Australian government should have been aware that this was a real possibility. It will say that it was aware, that Senator Evans wrote to the French about it. I think the Prime Minister wrote to Mr Chirac and got short shrift from President Chirac, as did Senator Evans from his counterpart. Mr Bilney-As did you.",28
87,Mr DOWNER,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"You are the government. The opposition does not carry the weight of a government by definition, although I know you live in constant fear of the opposition. Mr Bilney-Ha, hal",28
88,Mr DOWNER,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"Why do you send out mindless pamphlets at taxpayers' expense into the electorate of Kingston if you do not live in constant fear of the opposition? You would not waste your money otherwise. I make the point that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade still has not finished preparing a paper on the implications of a Chirac presidency. I know they have not. They still have not finished preparing an assessment of the implications of a Chirac presidency and already the French have announced that they are going to resume nuclear testing. We had the second round of the French election on around 7 May. On 15 May, which I think was a Monday, we had the Minister for Trade, Senator MCMullan, sitting down with Leon Brittan, the European commissioner responsible for, amongst other things, external relations. If the Australian government was concerned about the resumption of French nu-lear testing, would you not have thought that atÂ· that meeting Senator MCMullan would have said to the European commissioner, . responsible after all for the European Union- s external relations, that this was an issue of. concern to the Australian government? If you look at the record of that conversation, which I have done, you will notice that Seriator MCMullan did not mention the issue. It was never mentioned. The fact is that, for all their claims, the Labor Party has not been overly concerned about the resumption of French nuclear testing at all. . When the announcement came, the government was unprepared and the government was weak. Its fiist reaction was to say that they were going to freeze new defence ties-not existing ties, as New Zealand said, but new defence ties. What did that amount to? A couple of defence scientists, as I understand it, were to fly to Paris for talks. That trip by those two scientists was cancelled. Let's face it. They must have been sitting there in the Elyse- Palace and at the Quai d'Orsay laughing their heads off and popping champagne corks when they saw what the Australian government's response was. The response of the country that has to take a lead role in the South Pacific-and Australia does have to take the lead role of the South Pacific-was that a couple of scientists would no longer be going to Paris to talk about defence science issues. They must have been laughing at the Quai d'Orsayand they must have been laughing in the Elysee Palace. As a result of that, there was, of course as time went on,a fairly negative community response. I have never seen a more negative community response than the response given to Senator Evans's press conference. When Senator Evans was asked in Tokyo by a journalist, 'Are you saying that the French decision to go ahead, then, is not as bad as what it could have been?' Senator Evans's response was, 'Exactly'. Does the member for Moreton agree that this decision was not as bad as it could have been? Is that your view? Silence indicates that it is not his view. Mr Gibson-You'll hear my view when I make my speech.",28
89,Mr DOWNER,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"I won't be hearing your speech, unfortunately; I'm a busy man. Is that the view of the parliamentary secretary at the table? Mr Lindsay-You know my view.",29
90,Mr DOWNER,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,I know your views. I know you think Senator Evans has dropped the ball.,29
91,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,Order! The honourable member for Mayo will address his remarks through the chair.,29
92,Mr DOWNER,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"I will, Mr Deputy Speaker. The simple fact is that Senator Evans's remarks at his Tokyo press conference alone undermined the credibility of the Australian protest against the French. They did more than that because Australia has the chair of the South Pacific Forum. He undermined the credibility of the protest by the South Pacific Forum. Who does the French foreign minister see later today? He sees Senator Evans as the leader of the South Pacific Forum delegation which, fortunately, includes a New Zealander. Plucky little New Zealand, a smaller country than Australia, no doubt with more to lose than Australia, has had the guts to go out and protest strongly over this, but Australia hasn't. The Australian people may have, but the Australian government has not. In doing so the government has let down the Australian people. There you will have Senator Evans sweeping into the Quai d' Orsay trying to pump up his rhetoric a little but with the French foreign minister sitting there with a transcript of the Tokyo press conference. I am sure his opening line would be: 'Well, Senator Evans. You don't think our decision was as bad as it could have been.' That simply decimates Senator Evans's credibility before the French foreign minister. Senator Evans regards diplomacy as a parlour game. He does not regard Australian diplomacy as the promotion of our national interest. It is a parlour game. After you have passed Go and got your $200 or 200 nights at the Hotel Maurice in Paris, or whatever he is after, and you have gotten to the end of the game, what you apparently get is the secretary-generalship of the United Nations. Why is Senator Evans concerned about France in that context? It is because the Security Council ultimately has to approve the next Secretary-General and France is a permanent member of the Security Council and has a veto. Senator Evans's diplomacy has been compromised by personal ambition. Everybody knows that. You know that only too well. The whole of Australia's credibility on this important issue has simply been undermined by this minister. We have moved an amendment to this motion, recommending some strong measures that the government could take to make our position clear. We have seen through the last week Labor playing catch-up politics on this matter. One of the funniest things that happened was on Friday at 2 o'clock Adelaide time: I held a press conference in Adelaide and announced that the coalition would move a motion at 12.30 p.m. today condemning the resumption of French nuclear testing in the Pacific. Two hours later, somebody from my office rang me and guess what happened? The Prime Minister put out a press release saying that he would like to move a motion today. This is the man who boasts about leadership-the big, tough leader-the man who does not want to offend the French any more than he has to because of his personal and emotional passion for France. When he thinks of France he thinks of the glorious chateaux of the Loire, the magnificence of Versailles, the Grand Trianon, the Petit Trianon, the Chateaux Fontainebleau, the Elysee Palace. This is his vision of a great world in which live-clattering around the antique shops of the rue du Faubourg Saint Honore and the like. No wonder his response to this incredibly important issue has been so weak and so flippant. This is a challenge to our national interest. When our national interest has been directly challenged, the government has simply dropped the ball. We have moved an amendment here today. If that amendment is opposed by the Labor Party, then any claim by the Labor Party that it is taking a strong stand-any claim of that kind-will simply be proven to be as hollow as it sounds. If the Labor Party votes for our amendment, we will concede that it has caught up and understood the importance of this issue to the Australian people. If you are not prepared to support this amendment, we will know that on this issue you are phoneys and that you are not prepared to take a tough stand. If you moved a conscience motion in this House condemning Senator Evans for his Tokyo press conference it would be carried by just about everybody, except the most sycophantic of Labor members of parliament. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), sitting opposite me is one such person who comes to mind. Broadly speaking, this House wOldd condemn Senator Evans because he has undermined Australia's effort, he has undermined the credibility of Australia's protest. The coalition protests in the strongest of terms and believes that the measures outlined in the amendment should be taken by the government. Then Australia will have made a strong and constructive statement of its opposition to what President Chirac's government has done.",29
93,Mr GIBSON,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"It is of great disappointment to the people of Australia that instead of targeting the real villains, the government of France, the opposition has decided that it will target the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and the government of Australia in this debate. A good indication of that is that the shadow foreign minister, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), spent 10 of to his 15 minutes attacking the government on this matter instead of talking about the people who have made the decision that has caused this debate: the government of Jacques Chirac. We should be targeting our venom towards his government today. I highlight one of the points that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made: we should not be targeting French people; we should be targeting the people who make up the government of France because it is their decision that is going to have such an impact. We need to look at the short history of this debate today. The Prime Minister moved a very strong motion in this place condemning the government of France for its decision to resume nuclear testing. In a statesmanlike address he outlined all of the reasons why Australia took that strong position and why we are opposed to the testing of nuclear weapons. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) got up, said that he supported everything the Prime Minister had to say, said that he supported the motion, and then spent 10 minutes attacking the government. It has been the Leader of the Opposition that has brought politics into this debate, and it is a great disappointment to me that, instead of having a unified motion and unified debate that shows the people of Australia and the people of France that this parliament is unified in its opposition to the decision to nuclear weapons in our region-instead of having a bipartisan political position-the opposition leader and his cohorts have decided that they are going to engage in a cheap political point scoring exercise. It is clear that the opposition leader and cohorts think that the government will gain a lot of credibility through this campaign against the French nuclear tests and that they are trying to undermine the government's credibility on this issue. One just has to look back over 20 years of history at our opposition to nuclear testing in the South Pacific: it has been the Australian Labor Party that has shown the leadership every year and every step of the way. The Prime Minister highlighted that in his response to the amendment when he outlined how the Leader of the Opposition back in 1985 was attacking the Labor government for its position of opposing nuclear testing and how the Leader of the Opposition said that we should not be antiFrench, that our position as a Labor government was one of attacking the French government and that the French had legitimate reasons to test nuclear weapons. Those opposite have not changed their position. The only reason they are trying to become more vociferous in this campaign and out-point score the government is that they believe they can get some cheap political advantage from this debate. They should be condemned for that action. They have destroyed the effectiveness of having a unified parliamentary motion and parliamentary debate on this matter. That is something the people of Australia should be very disappointed about. One just has to look at the statesmanlike speech that the Prime Minister made. Throughout his introductory speech he did not make one criticism or one comment about the opposition's position or the cheap point scoring. He just stated on behalf of the people of Australia why we are opposed to nuclear testing in the South Pacific. Then the opposition leader decided it was too good a speech: he had to try to tear it down. That is a great disappointment. Let us look at the reasons why we are test opposed to testing in the South Pacific and why we on this side of the House totally condemn the French government for its decision. One of the major reasons is the total hypocrisy of the French government on this issue. Just a few weeks ago in New York the his representatives of the government of France supported the indefinite extension of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. I see in the chamber my colleague the member for Groom (Mr Taylor), who, like myself, was a participant in some of the negotiations and discussions that occurred about that indefinite extension to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The Australian people, through their representatives at the United Nations, fully supported the indefinite extension of that treaty, as did the government of the people of France. The people of France said that they supported the indefinite extension of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. I will read a couple of clauses from that. Clause 4(a) states: The completion by the Conference on Disarmament of the negotiations on a universal and internationally ly and effectively verifiable Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty no later than 1996. Pending the entry into force of a Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty, the nUclear-weapon States should exercise utmost restraint . . . The French government supported that resoluclaim tion and this is the way it is exercising utmost restraint: it is going to start a series of tests in a few months time in our very region. Another clause in the resolution states: The determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally, with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons, and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control. That is another clause in the resolution the nuclear weapons states, including France, and all the non-nuclear weapons states dorsed at the nuclear non-proliferation treaty negotiations in May this year in New York. France supported this resolution. Now, with the utmost hypocrisy, it has decided to against that decision and to recommence further testing of its nuclear weapons. The President of France, in justifying his countries. decision, lied to the people of France and to the people of the world. He said, 'There no dangers to the people of the world from nuclear testing.' What utter rubbish! There absolute and complete evidence that the testing of nuclear weapons, even the undertreaty ground testing of nuclear weapons, imposes major health risks and major environmental risks to the region in which those tests are done. There is very clear and overwhelming evidence that the test program will cause environmental damage to the South Pacific and thereby to the whole world. The testing has caused fracturing and fissuring of the atolls in which they ucted. There are fears that radioactivity is now already leaking into the marine enviis ronment. Continued testing on the damaged atolls will further threaten the geology of area and could lead to a major radioactive leak. The fact is that there are some 25 million people living in the region of these tests who will be directly affected by the environmental damage that these tests will do. It is absolutecrucial that the people of France understand that there are 25 million fellow human beings, who have no argument with the people of France, who are not in any sort of war with France or who are not trying to some French territory or French possession, living in the South Pacific region who eight are going to suffer environmental damage and health damage because of France's decision to recommence testing of nuclear weapons in the South Pacific. ' My plea is to the people of France to say to their government, 'Enough is enough. We do not need these further tests.' I ask: why does France need to test further nuclear weapons? Who is the enemy of the people of France? that Who is the enemy that they need this huge nuclear arsenal to protect themselves from? enThe Cold War is over. The Soviet Union and all its satellite states that were there as a huge threat to them have gone. Most of those satellite states are now democratic countries. go The Soviet Union no longer exists. Those people have been freed from that communist control and are now living in democratic There is no physical threat to France-in are Europe or elsewhere. There is no need for nuclear weapons by France. The time has well is and truly arrived for France to live up to its commitments to the nuclear non-proliferation and to decide to start a process of disarmament, not a process of further development of its weapons. I fully commend the motion that the Prime Minister has put to the House. I strongly oppose the cheap political point scoring by the opposition in trying this stunt of moving an amendment to the words that are there in the motion of the Prime Minister. I urge the are condwhole House to support the motion.",30
94,Mr TAYLOR,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"This a very bad decision by the French government. The opposition, as the Leader of the the Opposition (Mr Howard) and other speakers have said, supports this motion without qualification. Without being too flippant about what is a very serious situation, the most appropriate analogy in this case is the drunk who is about to have his last drink and become a reformed drunk. He says, 'Of course, I have got a case of scotch in the bar which I need to drink first.' That is a bit like what we have in relation to this nuclear testing situation. Let me put on the public record the degree to which the French have been testing in the Pacific since 1966. There have been 185 tests of devices in that area of the world. About 177 of those have been since 1966. In 1989 there was a ban on large weapons on Mururoa. There were suggestions, as the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) said, of fissures being developed in the islands, and lagoon four, as a result of those large weapon tests. It therefore was not surprising that in 1992 then President Mitterriind decided that testing should be discontinued, which in hindsight and with forethought was a very commendable decision. The most recent decision by President Chirac is therefore something which we should abhor. The decision is a wrong one. It is wrong for the French people; it is wrong for the world at large. It is an immoral decision. It is an immoral decision simply because the French, as the honourable member for Moreton has said, were very instrumental in the indefinite extension of the NPT in New York only last month. To now tum around and do exactly what they are doing is totally immoral. The decision is also unnecessary and it is anachronistic. It is unnecessary and anachronistic in the sense of the force de frappe that has been mentioned and the post Cold War situation. Really, why does France have to test in a military sense these weapons of war? It is a bad decision because it is unduly nationalistic. This is not about a sense of international movement. It is a domestic political move on the part of a new president who of course is trying to make a point, a very nationalistic point, in terms of the French domestic electorate at large. It is also a bad decision because it has regard for the wider international ramifications and indeed the deep sensitivities which have been reflected in the speech by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and subsequent speeches in this place. It is a high-handed decision and therefore, again, a very bad decision. Finally, and most importantly, it is a totally abhorrent decision which we in this House and elsewhere should totally reject. In fact, it flies in the face very strongly of what our permanent representative in the United Nations, Richard Butler, said on 12 May this year-soon after the indefinite extension was reached in New York. He said, in part: Australia shared the disappointment of many states that more progress towards nuclear disarmament was not possible during the long years of the Cold War, particularly during the first twenty-five years of the Treaty's life. But this trend has been reversed in recent years. It needs to be promoted. The decisions taken on 11 May make this clear. It is of the greatest importance that all parties to the NPT reaffirmed their commitment, for all time, to prevent nuclear proliferation and to work on a program of action for nuclear disarmament with the eventual goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. He went on to say: Australia has never accepted that an indefinitely extended NPT would in some way 'ligitimize' the status of the nuclear weapon states forever. I do not have to point out to the House that France falls into that category. He continues: That would not only be unacceptable, it is simply wrong. It does not reflect what Article VI of the Treaty states. With the Treaty extended indefinitely, the obligation on all states, but particularly the nuclear weapon states, to pursue nuclear disarmament has now become one from which there is no escape. Thus it is not only our hope but our expectation that the principles and objectives adopted by this Conference will consolidate progress to date, promote accelerated progress in disarmament negotiations currently under way, and result in additional early steps, in particular a permanent end to nuclear testing by 1996. He finished by saying that the NPT review and extension conference saw an endorsement of the value of regional non-proliferation arrangements, such as the South Pacific nuclear-free zone in our own region. One could summarise the Prime Minister's little speech today on his motion as being more notable for what it did not say rather than what it did say. Earlier I listened to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs, the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Bilney), and was not persuaded by what he had to say about some of the defence implications. On 14 June the Prime Minister said: In the present circumstances the government has decided to freeze co-operation between Australia and France in the defence field at its existing level while any new testing program continues. I have read nothing since he made that comment and I have heard nothing today which throws any light on exactly where we are heading with the freezing of the defence tied process. For example, on surveillance, joint exercises and defence industry ties-today I have heard nobody talk about defence industry ties; perhaps I will come back to that in a moment-the government's response overall, to be kind, has been very vague indeed. On personnel exchanges, which have been mentioned in the press, a planned exchange of defence scientists has been scrapped as a direct result of this Chirac announcement. We should all commend that decision by the government. On ship visits and aircraft staging, the government announced last Friday that it would not permit the berthing or the landing of ships or aircraft that are involved in the nuclear testing program, although it has not made it clear how it is going to police that arrangement. It is not surprising that the amendment was moved by the opposition. We support a ban on all personnel exchanges, all joint exercises, all French navy ship visits and military aircraft transits except in the case of emergencies. But we are questioning in particular past transit arrangements. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay), who is at the table: is it true that France has in the past been able to bypass some of the customs cargo formalities and, in some cases, been able to get away with making no sort of customs declaration? That should ring alarm bells in lots of quarters, not the least of which in that of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), even though he is in Paris at the moment. The opposition supports this motion without qualification. However, we will be disappointed at the rejection of the amendment, if that is what is to happen, which would give additional substance to the motion and is not, as the honourable member for Moreton indicated, some cheap political point scoring. We are disappointed that too many questions are left unanswered. We are disappointed at the sit-on-the-fence attitude of notably Great Britain and the United States. We would like to have heard a lot more from President Clinton and others about this nuclear testing by the French government. Finally, the Australian people want less political rhetoric on this issue and more substantive action with France. The government of France deserves the international condemnation that it is receiving and will continue to receive. This motion is a commendable formal first step, but without the amendment it is a phoney smokescreen. Once again, I say to the parliamentary secretary: please support the opposition's amendment.",32
95,Mr CLEELAND,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"MCEwen) (2.24 p.m.)Since 1966 France has conducted over 44 nuclear tests in the atmosphere in the South Pacific and 115 underground tests on two tiny South Pacific atolls. This act is only possible because of the colonial attitude of the French nation. It should not be forgotten in this debate that, in leading the free French during the Second World War, Charles de Gaulle, a great general for the French, made a promise to the French colonial countries that, at the conclusion of the Second World War, France would grant independence to the French colonies. Those French colonies included the Polynesian Islands and New Hebrides in the Pacific. It is to France's eternal shame that as we approach the year 2000 this great European power is still a colonial one, a country which denies the right of self-determination and of freedom for peoples in the Pacific. It is arguable that the only reason France has denied the right of free determination of the Polynesian people is its desire to use the Pacific as the testing ground for its nuclear weapons industry. Up until the French decided to use Mururoa and the Polynesian Islands as the testing grounds for their so-called nuclear deterrent program, they had promised colonial independence for these people. For a country which talks about liberty and freedom, denying the right of free determination has brought it shame. It is a country which demands condemnation by this parliament and by this country not just because of its approach to the South Pacific but because of its use of the South Pacific for its nuclear testing program. No doubt other people in this place have said that if nuclear testing was safe the French would quite happily drill holes in France, seal them with concrete and detonate nuclear devices in them. But they do not do it in France; they do it in the South Pacific. There are a lot of arguments as to whether or not underground testing of nuclear devices is or is not safe. I am relying on a report lished in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. That report has a map of the atoll at Mururoa. It points out that the atoll has at least five lateral fissures and a whole number of longitudinal fissures. There have been recorded blow-outs in the atoll itself where nuclear material from underground testing has in fact leaked. The report also points out that originally a 28-kilometre strip of the atoll, which is half the reef's ring, was used for underground testing. In that 28-kilometre strip, 46 drills have been sunk between 800 and 1,200 metres deep and bombs have been exploded down those shafts. In other words the bomb blasts have been spaced at about SOO-metre intervals on this atoll, which is damn close in anyone's language. We are talking about hydrogen bombs. We are not talking about bombs of the size that were dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, which were by any stretch of the imagination small bombs. Those bombs, which caused so much damage and loss of life, are now used as trigger devices for hydrogen bombs. The French are quite happy to explode at SOO-metre intervals hydrogen bombs of quite phenomenal power compared with those used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The French say, 'There's no health risk; there's no environmental risk. We're not doing any damage whatsoever.' Yet, strangely enough, we cannot do an independent assessment because the French do not allow independent scientific teams to enter French Polynesia and conduct health tests on the Polynesian population. They just simply say, 'No way.' They will not let people do that. It is known that the most common radiation induced diseases in French Polynesia are leukemia, brain tumours and thyroid cancer. From the early 1980s there has been an enormous increase in French Polynesia in the incidence of these three types of cancers. So the world does know that leukemia, thyroid cancer and brain tumours, commonly associated with radiation illness, are increasing in French Polynesia. But the French will not give us their statistics and they will not discuss what information they have. The pubFrench do not even allow people from the French radiation controlling body to enter French Polynesia and conduct their own tests. Only the army and army doctors are allowed into Tahiti to conduct those tests. If the French say that it is safe and that they are not causing any harm or any damage there, then it seems to me that they would be the first to allow an independent assessment. In 1984 an Australian-New Zealand team was allowed to visit Mururoa. The members of that team did a short study. They were allowed to stay there for only five days. They were not allowed to do deep sea testing in the fissure areas. They were very limited as to what they could do. As Atkinson remarked in the report: As the mission was not permitted to sample sediments from the lagoon nor take any types of samples from the safety trial area, verification was denied. But the Atkinson report was highly critical regarding such subjects as radiation ventage, leakage and breakage occurring in the atoll. They were experts. But the report also contained a section on cancer incidence statistics in French Polynesia. They were very critical of the refusal of the French government to allow proper testing and proper survey work to take place in French Polynesia with regard to that problem. What is unarguably clear is that you cannot have over lIS underground tests on an area as small as this atoll and not cause major environmental problems. In the past when the French were conducting atmospheric tests they thumbed their nose at Australia anyway. Who can forget the 1970s when Australia and New Zealand stood up and said, 'Get out of the South Pacific'? There were bans on French products in the 1970s. But the French just basically stuck their noses up in the air and told Australians, New Zealanders and people in the Pacific, 'It's none of your business.' Today, to their shame, the French still say that French Polynesia is French territory; it is no different from Europe in terms of territorial ownership. The people in my electorate want me to say in this House that it is not on. First of all, want the French out of the Pacific. We want them to stop being a colonial power in our part of the world. We want the French to understand that, regardless of what they may say, they are causing environmental damage and we do not want nuclear devices exploded in the Pacific. The people in my electorate want me to say to the French that, if it is they should do it in the Mediterranean, outside Paris, in Marseilles or in Provence. Finally, I know the people in my electorate want me to say in this House: vive la France dans la merde.",34
96,Mr CAMERON,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"Stirling) (2.35 p.m.)There is very little I can add that is different to the remarks that others have already made in this debate. What I think is important is not what somebody said in 1950, 1960, 1970 or 1980, but what people are doing in 1995. It is what the French are doing in 1995 that we are talking about today. The French, by their intention to resume nuclear testing in the Pacific, are proving to us all that they are most definitely not good world citizens. Frankly, I believe Australia, as the largest nation in the Pacific, should be leading the way in the condemnation of the irresponsible actions of France. I would go further than the motion and the amendment to the motion moved today.",36
97,Mr GEAR,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,Move another one.,36
98,Mr CAMERON,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"It would be up another notch, but I do not want to delay the situation. I do not want to dredge up history, however the history of our relationship with France is particularly meaningful for many Australians. Many Australian men and women are buried in France as a result of the two world wars. Those Australian men and women went to France to defend that country. They went to ensure that France and other nations of the world could live their lives in freedom. Thankfully, that was achieved. Australia is in no way, shape or form indebted to France. The French have not taken one jot of notice of the concerns of the people of the Pacific over their nuclear testing. I was speaking to a young woman in my office this morning who has just arrived from the United States. I said to her, 'Have you we been hearing much about this issue in the United States, Cindy?' She said, 'Not a word.' I think the French think they can get away with it because it is only a few small nations in the South Pacific that are bitching and screaming about the situation and on the world stage it does not mean much. It certainly means a lot to the people of Polynesia and safe, the South Pacific, especially the people of Australia and New Zealand which are the two leading nations in the Pacific. I will outline an interesting juxtaposition. When a lone French yachts woman came to grief a far way off the southern shores of Australia there was no hesitation in our going to her rescue. It cost some millions of dollars. Various people condemned the government for spending that money to rescue this lone French yachtswoman, but we did it because Australia is a sound world citizen. It was our responsibility to look after someone in distress. I put it to the House that the nations of the Pacific are now in distress as a result of the actions of the French and the French are proving categorically that they are not good world citizens. I remind the House of the circumstances surrounding the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior in Auckland, New Zealand. That boat was sunk by the French. It was found that it was French agents that put the boat to the bottom. Whilst doing that they killed a woman. Instead of being charged with murder they were awarded medals of honour by the French government. That sums up the arrogant attitude of the French government in relation to this entire issue. The French are not good world citizens and they have to be snapped back into line.  in support of the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and against the amendment moved by the opposition. Before I do, I want to dwell as much as I can on the bipartisan spirit of this debate. I notice that the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) is at the table. I point out to the House that the honourable member for Indi, as deputy leader, and I had the pleasure of leading a bilateral visit to France and to the European institutions. In the total spirit of cooperation and bipartisanship I can report to the House that we did not fail to signal either to the French government officials or the European parliamentary members that we met that whilst our relations with France had pleasingly improved greatly, particularly given the moratorium on French nuclear testing, any resumption of testing was bound to have serious consequences. Sometimes the people of Australia do not understand that members on both sides operate in a bipartisan way. I commend the honourable member for Indi and all other members of the delegation for their efforts in that regard. Also I must say it is pleasing that the opposition does object to the resumption of nuclear testing which France has announced with the change of government. But I then have to draw the line and really get down to the nub of it: if we want to maximise the concern of the Australian people with this parliamentary motion moved by the Prime Minister, then it is important that both sides of parliament are seen to embrace such a proposition without reservation. I tum to the amendment. It states that we should: . .. suspend military cooperation with France; except for surveillance, United Nations and humanitarian activities ... I have to say that our military cooperation with France is pretty minimal. Already the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator MCMullan, has announced a range of measures. Firstly, there is refusal to refuel for all but humanitarian flights. That has already been announced. And we have gone one step further. We have said that, in terms of the replacement of the RAAF trainer, in considering the tenders offered by various countries, France's activity in the Pacific will be taken into consideration. That also has been announced already. The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs has said that, even though there are not very many of them, we have moved to cancel reciprocal visits by ships to each country . We have taken those steps. There is nothing new in what is being proposed. But what I find most amusing, if you like, is the fact that it has been suggested we should recall our ambassador. If we were to do what the opposition is suggesting, recommending or urging the House to do, we should at this very time be placing a call through to the Australian Ambassador-who is probably with Gareth Evans, chairman of the Pacific forum, meeting with French officials-and say, 'Ambassador, we want to withdraw you out of that meeting for you to come on straight home.' How ridiculous. This is unfortunately, I think, a rather cynical proposition at this time. I listened to the contribution of the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). I need to remind the House and the Australian people that this is the former Leader of the Opposition who self-destructed, shredded himself into pieces-not a victim of a government onslaught, but that he self-destructed. What was his reaction? His reaction, of course, was that we should send a frigate over there. I am sure that, if those opposite had the aircraft carrier they have always wanted, they would have wanted to send the aircraft carrier. What good would that do? Of course, the opposition and its leader have had to walk away from that proposition. Returning to the topic of France, I would try to put on the record how deeply Australian people cannot understand the need for France in the 1990s to have a nuclear deterrent. In their defence policy position, similar to our Australian white paper, who is the enemy? Is it the traditional enemy, Germany, against whom Australians have fought in France during two world wars, leaving French soil soaked with Australian blood? Is this the traditional enemy? Is this the one against whom they need the force de frappe? Or is it Albion; is it Mr Major and his legions over in England? Are these the people against whom France needs to have this nuclear deterrent? Or are the French worried that the hordes will descend through Luxembourg into France? This makes no sense at all, particularly to the honourable member for Indi and I who were in France and Europe 12 months ago. Clearly, Germany and France occupy a leadership position in the European Union. That France should be detonating nuclear bombs and weapons in our backyard goes smack against the position that Germany and France hold. Mr Deputy Speaker, you get mixed signals about what the French people believe. If they believe and support a nuclear deterrent in this day and age, I have to say it is a real pity that that support does not extend to testing in France, testing on the French-German border, or digging into the channel between France and England and testing there. If France must test, it should not do so in our backyard. But, of course, it is doing so. I thought the honourable member for Mayo made some very disparaging remarks about the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans). He disparaged the fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is touted by some as the future Secretary-General. I am very proud to say that we have already had an Australian as the President of the United Nations. A former member for Barton was the President of the United Nations. The idea that an Australian could hold the position and could be seen to be effective in all the challenges for the United Nations of the 1990s is something we should be proud of and not condemn. The member for Mayo was also critical that Senator Evans highlighted in this morass of a decision that at least France was embracing the fact that it would join the comprehensive test ban treaty. I must say that as much as I abhor this decision to resume nuclear testing in our backyard, I do welcome the position of France in saying that it will embrace the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. What possible threat does it see in Europe that requires this force de frappe, this nuclear deterrent? The other suggestion contained in the opposition's amendment to the motion is that the United States should share its data. Clearly, approaches must have been made in that regard and the United States declined to do so. I would have welcomed a positive decision by the United States to avoid this testing, because the United States itself-the last remaining superpower on the globe-is declining to test. If it had shared its data with the French, so much the better. But when we move a motion that is so important to the Australian people, we ought to be confident that what we are advocating and proposing is practical. I suggest that this amendment is not practical. I started my speech by saying that I support the Prime Minister's motion. I regret that the strength of the Prime Minister's motion-and the moving of such motions is not a very normal procedure for the House-has been somewhat diminished by the fact that an amendment has been moved by the opposition.",36
99,Mr GEAR,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"Grandstanding.  says, it is grandstanding. Why could we not bury our differences for the interests of the people of Australia and the South Pacific and support the Prime Minister's motion? In conclusion, I want to say this: France may be worried by an initial adverse reaction to this decision, but it wants to open up its markets to Asia. I say to ASEAN countries: let us not forget that France will be commencing eight nuclear tests in September. I hope ASEAN countries will join us in the South Pacific and voice very strongly and condemn strongly the fact that France is not a good corporate world citizen, is acting unilaterally and unrealistically and is endangering our environment, not her own. I commend the motion moved by the Prime Minister. I wish it could be passed without qualification, with the unanimous support of all members of parliament, without being sullied by an amendment. That is exactly what the Australian people expect of their parliamentarians.",38
100,Mr SINCLAIR,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"I think it is sad that the government has not approached this subject-which all of us see as probably more fundamental than almost any other in the environmental sensein a proper way. The future of the children in the South Pacific is predicated on a comprehensive test ban treaty being put in place. The motion that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) introduced was an attempt to ensure that all of the ground that had been lost by the Labor Party when it went soft on the French announcement about nuclear testing would somehow be offset in the minds of the electorate. The trouble with the Prime Minister is that he was not content to just make a statement: not only did he make a statement but he then sought to speak on the opposition's amendment. The Prime Minister is, of course, a very good politician, but politics has several levels. The most significant part of politics in this case should be to try to ensure that a message of strength, integrity and purpose is sent to the French government, following the announcement by President Chirac that a series of nuclear tests will be conducted in the South Pacific. But what has happened since the announcement was made by President Chirac? Firstly, nothing was done when he made the announcement during the campaign. Secondly, when it was announced as a result of his being elected, the idea was allowed to continue, as though in some way it was an afterthought and something which he had not committed himself to. My worry about this whole debate is that it exists on three levels. The first is even beyond the comprehensive test ban treaty. Like the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), I have had the opportunity to look at some stations in Belgium which monitor the level of radiation that comes from nuclear explosions around the world. The graphs that came out of those monitoring stations show that, at the time of the Chernobyl explosion, there was an appalling increase in the fallout in the Northern Hemisphere. We know that the result was that it affected people not only around the Ukraine but also in Finland and in the whole of western Europe. The first and most significant part of this debate should be to recognise that any type of a nuclear fallout is something which can have pernicious effects which are harmful to society and dangerous to mankind. It is absolutely important that we start at that level. The second level is one which has to address the problems that the announcement by President Chirac represents. In that too, I think most people in this place would be fundamentally in agreement. The difficulty is that the Prime Minister, in the manner and form of his response, was saddled by the initial press conference given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) in Tokyo. It is of no use the Prime Minister, the Labor Party and everybody else saying that the foreign minister was misunderstood. It would have been far better if the Prime Minister had for once tried to adopt a position above politics. But, unfortunately, he tends to see everything in the light of the next election, rather than in the light of what should be done internationally. I think it is absolutely appalling that the Prime Minister's behaviour today has reduced the effectiveness of the South Pacific Forum delegation to France. It is of no use the member for Chifley and the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who is at the table, suggesting in some way that, because we have moved an amendment, we are prejudicing Australia's case. My friends, what we have done is to show that your Prime Minister is extraordinarily vulnerable. If he had any statesmanlike instincts, if he had the capacity to be a Prime Minister which all Australians could be proud of and if he had the capacity to influence the French in a mission which we all endorse, he would have shut up and registered that there were points in the amendment moved by tp.e Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) which he and his colleagues would have done well to endorse. The third level relates to the last paragraph of the opposition's amendment which concerns the sharing of data with the United States. I cannot understand why a computer test cannot be run which would give exactly the same appraisal of nuclear weapons as the French are apparently seeking to obtain from the eight tests proposed. I would have thought that, even if there has been a refusal, as the honourable member for Chifley suggests, and the United States has said that it is not prepared to share data, there is every reason for the world to say to the United States-which, I was horrified to learn this morning, may also be considering a number of underground explosions-that there are ways in which computers can assess the consequences of nuclear weapons, nuclear fallouts and whatever other chemical formulae that may be needed to be tested. Why it cannot be done on a computer, I do not know. If we put pressure on the United States to agree to computer testing of the French weapons, perhaps the tests could be avoided all together. The real thing that worries me is that the Labor Party has played this whole issue far too much for domestic consumption and far too little for persuading the French. I mentioned the response by the Prime Minister to the amendment. I go back to the initial performance by the foreign minister in his press conference in Tokyo. I will quote from an article by Geoffrey Barker in the Financial Review of Monday, 19 June. There are three comments that I think are worth remembering. First he says: Suddenly hethat is, Minister Evansis revealing glimpses of the gung-ho Attorney General who earned the nickname ""Biggles"" 12 years ago ... Remember? That is the trouble. He is impetuous. He does things because he does not really think. The article continues: . "" when he sent RAAF fighters to spy on Tasmania's Franklin dam site, explaining afterwards that it seemed like a good idea at the time. The second thing is that we need to underof stand that the South Pacific Forum is only of the bodies in this region that we ought be trying to persuade to support our case. Senator Gareth Evans has had a rethink, and' if the Prime Minister's views of today which he put when speaking to his motion are to be sustained, why does he not raise in APEC the whole question of nuclear testing? I find it quite incredible. Here is this new body, a new association of countries of the Pacific rim, a group that is set up to consider realistically matters of importance to our region. It is not just a trade association. To date it has only met with heads of state. The Prime Minister is going out there saying what a great rapport he has with all the heads of state in our region. Why does he not go to APEC? He could start with Japan, which we know is opposed to nuclear testing. He could go around all those countries in the western Pacific 'rim that are opposed to' the French tests. He could then go to the United - States and say that there is a significant body of opinion within the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation which says th-t this nuclear testing should not proceed. From there, you have got a body of opinion that even France would feel apprehensive in rejecting. I have no truck with the violence that appeared in Perth the other d,ay. I think that, if anything, weakened the Australian case. I think it is unfortunate when anything other than symbolic processes are used. As soon as you use violence against violence, you tend to destroy the whole position. I strongly believe that APEC is a forum which at this stage is untested and untried. Had I had a say in an amendment to this motion, I would have a,dded to it a suggestion that there be a resolution raised with all those who are heads of state within APEC and I would suggest that they consider the question of whether or not action should, be taken jointly to attempt to stop the French testing at all. I do not accept the position that testing should take place only on mainland France . As far as I am concerned, it should not take place at all. That last item in the amendment the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), one which suggests that the United States should to be contacted and a method found by which If computer appraisal might be enable you to do all that you otherwise could, is the course that should be followed. I support the amendment and am very disappointed that the Labor Party apparently at this stage is not inclined to do so. - r SNOWDON (Northern TerritoryParlIamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (2.59 p.m.)-I am pleased to be involved in this debate. I think it should be noted by all members. I am sure it will be as we get closer to the day-that this is the 50th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It ought to give us food for thought as a community, as a nation, and indeed as a world community-the impact of nuclear weapons and their use on the peoples of the world. I note contributions to this debate so far. We have had a motion put by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and an amendment moved by the opposition in the context of approaches made by the government on how to deal with this issue of the proposed French nuclear tests. I was not attracted by the statements of the French foreign minister, Mr de Charette, reported yesterday in the Canberra Times. He said that he thinks the nations of the South Pacific",39

104,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I ask the Prime Minister: what prior notice or advice did your government have of the French decision to resume nuclear testing? What official response did you give at that time? Will you release all relevant documents? _ Mr KEATING-I need to check with the Foreign Minister and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to see whether there was any advance notice other than the public statement by President Chirac. The - ove?1ment has been completely forthright in Its VIews throughout this. It has responded instantly. Most of the response has been there for all to see. I notice that the Leader of the Opposition today, in standing to support the motion that - propo-e- - o the House, sought to politicise - t and dI-msh the .foreign minister's standing m the lnIddle of thIS negotiation. That sort of absence of any loyalty to the common approach does not reflect well on him. That is why I think the Leader of the Opposition need not fear that anything that the foreign minister says will be consistent and cogent as has always been the case during his most distinguished period chairing the foreign ministry. Aboriginal Health",41
105,Mr JENKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Human Services and Health. What action has been taken to ensure that a national effort is made to improve Aboriginal health?,41
106,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sure all members are aware that as from 1 July responsibility for Commonwealth funding and program delivery in the area of Aboriginal health will come to my department. I am pleased to inform members of the House and the member who asked the question that that transfer is progressing very well. There have already been very significant achievements secured, particularly in relation to a national effort. I think all the ministers responsible clearly recognise that Aboriginal health is a complex issue and governments, if they are to achieve anything here, have to work together and work effectively. The present poor health status of Aboriginal people indicates to all observers that the current system is not working, so a concerted effort by all governments is required. I was pleased that last week health ministers from around the country agreed to enter into bilateral agreements to ensure a national coordinated approach. I do indicate however that some four years ago the same commitment was made and I will certainly be looking for early results. The agreements will be based on agreed national principles and criteria and will reflect the priorities that occur in each state and territory, because clearly there are great differences between the states and territories. I have indicated, and they have agreed, that they will be completed no later than February. So we will have a genuinely national effort. Those agreements will also ensure that the buck passing stops. It will not be good enough to blame another government, because we will have agreements about funding and service delivery. I am also pleased that the conference reaffirmed the importance of community control and participation. There has been some resistance on that score from some state and territory governments, but all the ministers finally agreed that that was critical. They also agreed that there are no quick fix solutions in this area and that we need to build a much more responsive health care system. In order to do that we obviously have to ensure that Aboriginal people are involved at every level. For instance, they will be consulted about and involved in the council for aboriginal health, which will determine policy. They will also be consulted about and involved in the indigenous health work force corporation, which will be established this year, and they will also help devise a mental health and hearing service strategy, for which funds are provided in this budget. There will also be consultative committees established in each state and territory, reporting back by October. In the past the state and territory governments have not worked with the Commonwealth as well as they might. That is not necessarily anyone's fault, and I am not attempting to blame anyone organisation, but I think that what emerged last week in Alice Springs was a very clear commitment from all parties. I am delighted that we will now have a very genuine and national coordinated effort in this very important area of health care. Nuclear Testing in the Pacific",41
107,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. Why did the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade wait until last week to even begin work on an options paper on Australia's response to possible resumption of French nuclear testing? Why did this crucial work not commence the day after President Chirac was elected on 7 May? Why has the department still failed to complete its policy submission on the implications of the new French presidency? Why did the Minister for Trade not even bother to raise the question of French nuclear testing when he met with the European Commission Vice-President, Sir Leon Brittan, on 15 May, when it was already clear that the new French President was intent on reinstituting nuclear tests? Is this not clear evidence that the Minister for Foreign Affairs showed no interest whatsoever in stopping the tests until well after they were publicly announced?",42
108,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This was a matter of debate in the French elections, not a matter of being discovered in some position paper by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. You could have discovered it on the front page of any French newspaper in the last three months. Mr Downer-Why didn't they produce an options paper?",42
109,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! You have asked a series of questions. You will listen to the answer.,42
110,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the point you are making is the different point that there should have been some sort of tactical response to this as yet unforeseen looming matter, it was not unforeseen: it was a possibility. Australia made its views known and the foreign minister made his views known to the French foreign minister before this everÂ· happened. That is the position. Mr Speaker, you would assume from what the shadow minister says his complete revulsion and rejection of these tactics by the French, and yet we find him saying in the pastMr Costello-Where?",42

112,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Why?,43
113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left!,43
114,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the French are exploding nuclear weapons at Mururoa Atoll, they are either exploding them or they are not: you either take a position or you do not. This government promoted a South Pacific nuclear free zone treaty. The member for Mayo said in the debate on that matterMr Downer-In 1985--.:.",43
115,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He said: I have two objections to the treaty. One is that it is basically an anti-French treaty and little else. He went on to say: Secondly, I think it could be described also as the first stone that has fallenlisten to thisfrom the edifice which was the Western alliance in our region. It could eventually lead to an avalanche which would swamp ultimately the Western alliance of the Pacific. This was his view then. But if the foreign minister saysMr Downer- Mr Speaker, on l;l point of order, the questionMrKeating interjecting Mr Downer-You sit down. Have you ever heard of the Cold War? Did that pass you by with your clocks and your chandeliers?",43

117,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat. The Prime Minister is in order. Mr Downer-But these statements were made,43
118,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You asked a series of questions. Resume your seat.,43
119,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, but when the foreign minister said that, if the testing had been open ended, that is, to continue on, unaccompanied by any commitment to participate in the test ban treaty negotiations, or if it was about the generation of new higher level weapons rather than simply maintenance and stewardship of the stockpile, he is to be roundly condemned by a person who actually believed in the testing program and who actually supported the testing program. When the foreign minister consistently argues the position where the French, through President Chirac, have said that they will sign the comprehensive test ban treaty and he points to the fact that,.objectionable though this may be, it was limited, according to the French, to eight tests and was not an ongoing program and was not about the development of a new weapon but the stability of the existing stockpile, he is to be roundly condemned by the member for Mayo. The member for Mayo, in that aside, made . some reference to me and French clocks. Let me just read this: He also seemed not to see when he was embarrassing other South Australian Liberals in front of Labor MPs. The most talked about example of this was his openly expressed reason for always flying Australian between Canberra and Adelaide. He has never hidden that he flew Australian because Ansett did not provide French champagne in first class, and he prefers French champagne. More than one South. Australian politician well remembers sitting next to Downer. . . Mr Downer-Is this relevant?",43
120,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is about as relevant as your reference to French clocks. . . will remember sitting next to Downer and cringing as he asks for another bottle of expensive French to be opened only minutes from landing. Like I say, it is battleships in the bathtub; but maybe they were floating in champagne. Parenting Allowance",43
121,Mr CLEELAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Has the Minister for Social Security seen reports of claims that the introduction of the parenting allowance on 1 July 1995 will make families worse off? What is the government's response to those reports?,43
122,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for MCEwen for drawing to my attention an article in a local paper in his electorate by his coalition opponent based on a highly misleading statement by the Australian Taxpayers Association. The fact is that the introduction of the parenting allowance from 1 July will be a major boost to Australian families. The bottom line is that spending on families programs as a result of these changes will be $400 million a year higher than it would have been in the absence of these programs. It is obvious that families are the beneficiaries of that. This article had a table which was calculated, I would say, to mislead. It left out of account crucial facets about the new structure. The article makes no reference to the well over 100,000 families who will benefit from the much higher rate of parenting allowance targeted to low income households. That will provide an average benefit of around $117 a fortnight, we calculated, to a large number of low-income families. It also fails to take into account the potential gainers from the re-configuration of the income test that will accompany the transition from home child-care allowance to parenting allowance. Under the current income test for home child-care allowance, which is the same as the old income test relating to the with child dependent spouse rebate, the carer starts to lose entitlement after earning just $10.80 a fortnight. Under the new income test you will have a free area of $60 a fortnightalmost six times as much under the new arrangements which will come into effect from 1 July. There are well over 100,000the estimate is around 140,000-who will gain financially as a consequence of that. We have substantially enhanced assistance to low-income families and put in a far more satisfactory income test, with a much higher threshold---"":'almost six times as high-and with a higher taper rate that has resulted from the re-configuration of that test. Overwhelmingly, people stand to gain. The bottom line is that there is $400 million a year more going to Australian families as a result of these changes than would have been the case previously. : The table in this article that appearec;l in the honourable member's electorate is calculated to mislead. At the end of the day, in the event that some people end up worse off as a consequence of those changes compared to HCCA they canÂ· fall back on the old with child rate of dependent spouse rebate at the end of the financial year. There are no losers and a very substantial number of winners, and some very large winners indeed. Nuclear Testing in the Pacific",44

When we go back to 1983 we find: 'Don't be rushed' , Howard warns. 'The Liberal Party.should not allow itself to be pushed quickly into finalising its policies.' That is 1983. He is saying exactly the same things in 1995. Stampeding the Liberal Party , "" inte;> policies would be like stampeding Ayers Rock. ' Mr Downer- Mr Speaker,' I raise a point Of order. Under the standing order in relation to relevance, the Prime Minister does not have licence to use question time to make a lot of Don,Watson written jokes. The Prime Minister is required to answer questions. He has been asked, to answer three questions on French nuclear testing and he has not begun to answer one of them. Mr Beazl-y- Mr Speaker, pn the point of order: when an opposition member asks a ' question and put- in a series of epithets, preaQlbles and Godknows whl:1.t, including the expression 'jellyback' ,it opens up relevance to cover those areas as well. The Prime Minister has been completely relevant. Mr SP.EAKER-The Prime Minister in his response mentioned exactly that same thing. Cap I just drop the hint to all members about a ruling that was given by the Second Deputy Speaker in this place about points of order.",45
135,Mr KEATIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will conclude on this point: it is a bit much to be asked by the Leader of the Opposition about the government being jellyback when he says, 'Why do I have to have a pOSltlOn on everything between now and the next 20 years?' He has been saying for years, 'Why does the Liberal Party have to display its policies?' 'Don't be rushed,' Howard warned 12 years ago. Nothing has changed. Twelve years have gone by. He is still saying the same things that he said 12 years ago. The fact is that he is either absent from the debate or struggling to survive it. No amount of abusive epithets in question time is going to diminish that fact. Internet: Rape Guide",45
136,Mr MARTYN EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Has the Attorney-General seen reports that a guide to rape was found circulating on the Internet? What action is the government taking to deal with this kind of abuse of modem communications and computer technology?,46
137,Mr LA VARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have seen reports. that some students at the Australian National University here in Canberra discovered on the Internet a guide which apparently contained tips on how to get away with a rape. Naturally, material of this sort is completely objectionable. It is offensive to all reasonable people. Unfortunately, it does not appear to be a completely isolated incident. There does appear to have been other objectionable material circulating through computer bulletin boards and via the Internet, such as how to engage in terrorist activity or how to make bombs. The government's starting point is to have a censorship regime which is effectively technology neutral; that is, if material such as honourable member described were produced by way of a film, a video or in book form it would be subject to classification, and most likely in that case would be banned outright. Those same sorts of principles should apply to material which finds its way into circulation via the Internet. I suppose we do have to get the thing into proportion. There is a vast array of information available on the Internet and 99.9 per cent of that material is perfectly reasonable legitimate material which can go to proper ends. Nonetheless, even though the amount of material involved may be very small, we do need to be concerned about it. That is why the Minister for Communications and the Arts and I, together with state ministers involved with censorship issues, have been working on the introduction of a new regime to cover the production of material on the Internet. This regime will have three tiers to it. The first will be the development of a code of practice to be developed by the industry itself- This is something which I think the industry broadly supports, although it is fair to say, given this is such new technology, that there are not clearly operating peak associations as such in terms of provider and user groups. However, we are working with what groups do exist to develop that code of practice. The second tier will involve a complaints mechanism similar to that which is currently operated by Telecom on 0055 numbers. Given that we have received a range of complaints, including the one the honourable member refers to, there is clearly scope for such a mechanism to be used. The third tier will involve the enactment of new offences in order to cover the production of this material. That will deal with material which would otherwise be banned if it was produced by way of film, video or literature or material that would receive a rating which would not allow it to be available to minors. These measures are of concern to the government. They will be discussed again by the Commonwealth and the states at the next Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. Within a very short time, a further paper for the consultation with the particular industry involved will be released to that industry in order to further the response of the industry to the development of self-regulatory codes as well as the other items I have outlined. Nuclear Testing in the Pacific",46
138,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. By what sea or air route from Europe have the French in the past transported their nuclear weapons and associated infrastructure for their weapons testing program? Can he assure the parliament that in the past Australia has not been a transit for any of this material? In solidarity with New Zealand, why does he not ban allnon-humanitarian French transit flights or ship visits?",46
139,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Does he mean the nuclear free zone he has always opposed? Is that the area he means? Does he mean through the nuclear free zone that he has always opposed; is that right? Is that the one? God you are looking embarrassed today, John. Let me amend that, you are looking silly and embarrassed. The government has made it very clear that in terms of any material which is likely to be coming to this part of the world, or which the French may seek to bring through Australia, there would be a very clear set of guidelines which would apply to any aspects of defence cooperation under which the French may try to bring materials or devices to the South Pacific via Australia. Any requests under such arrangements would require an undertaking that the units, the imports or the goods were not supporting the French testing program in the area. Refugees",47
140,Mr GORMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs. In this the national refugee week, can the minister provide details of the Australian government's response to the plight of refugees worldwide?",47
141,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I appreciate the interest that the honourable member has shown in national refugee week. In this week all Australians,47
142,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,47
143,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"including those raucously yelling from the opposite side, should be aware of the plight of the 23 million refugees worldwide who have been forced from their homes in fear of their lives. Our Australian government's refugee and relief program is a very high profile component of our aid program. In 1994-95 the Australian government will provide some $66 million to support refugee and relief programs through both Australian non-government organisations and international agencies. Tragically, for the foreseeable future Africa will remain the major recipient of those funds. There are massive movements of displaced people in Sudan, Rwanda, Burundi, Zaire, Tanzania, Eritrea and Kenya. Other refugees in different countries which receive substantial support are Afghans in Pakistan, Bhutanese in Nepal, Bougainvilleans in the Solomon Islands and Burmese in Bangladesh and Thailand. Our assistance is making a real contribution to improving the living conditions in refugee camps in the host country. As well as that, it is funding programs which encourage the refugees to return to their own home countries. The strength of that concern was reflected in the recent budget by the commitment of an additional $10V2 million for emergency and refugee assistance, one of the major initiatives of a very good aid budget. Of that increase over half will be used to more or less double our support for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which is the lead United Nations agency dealing with refugee emergencies and refugee situations. We will give a total of $13V2million to the UNHCR this coming year. We are also funding a number of nongovernment organisations, such as Austcare, and international humanitarian agencies, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, which carry out programs of voluntary repatriation and reintegration of refugees, emergency food distribution, medical services and water supply and sanitation. I also point out that, as far as resettlement in Australia is concerned, this year Australia will provide 13,000 resettlement places under our humanitarian program, and that includes 4,000 places for refugees. Sadly, I conclude on the point that these needs are ever increasing. But, through our aid program, Australia will continue to make strenuous efforts to provide immediate support for the growing numbers of people afflicted by civil conflict and social unrest, working through the UN system and the international community to help prevent the underlying causes of refugee movements. Victoria: Electricity Assets",47
144,Mr CLEARY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that in the proposed massive and unjustified sell-off of Melbourne's electricity supplies, the leading tenderer is Electricity France, a state owned organisation which is the principal producer of nuclear energy in France and the major scientific beneficiary of French testing in the Pacific? Does the Prime Minister now accept that, no matter what qualities you attribute to the proposed Australian republic; a republic which abandons its public assets to foreign control without consideration of how those foreign interests operate in relation to Australia, as the Fi'ench are about to show, is a laughing-stock republic? Will the Prime Minister now take up the only meaningful strategy for an independent nation and introduce economic rather than symbolic sanctions and step into prevent the sale of Melbourne's electricity to a French nuclear company?",47
145,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not privy to the policies of the Victorian government, although I know that it leans towards the privatisation of some electricity assets. How these assets will be used or how they will be required to perform in economic terms is a matter for the Victorian government to determine in. the face of community opinion in Victoria. Any government of any state seeking to sell assets-it is the same with the Commonwealth in respect of, say, Qantas or the Commonwealth Bank-will want to know how these assets are likely to be deployed and how they will be used in economic and social terms. There has been a concern in Victoria that wholesale privatisation will be a problem for that state. In South Australia there is a lively debate about a French company taking over the South Australian water supply. There has been not unreasonable public disquiet about whether community interest considerations are uppermost in these transactions. It is always important that, when what has formerly been a state owned asset is sold, the community considerations are kept before the minds of the government of the day. I could only commend this to the Victorian government. How far it has advanced along this path and to what extent it has advanced its arrangements with particular companies, including French companies, I am not aware. But this is an issue which obviously the Victorian of Premier should take on notice, given the fact that he now has an extended interest in foreign policy and given his unprincipled pandering to the Greek community in Melbourne when it suits himMr Bilney-He's very sound on the republic.",48
146,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, he is sound on the republic. No doubt the foreign policy implications' and the attitudes of Victorians as to who may own these assets are important, and of course' the attitude towards the French or whoever might takÂ« these assets up eventually. No doubt if I have not needed to take your question on notice the Victorian Premier might. Infrastructure",48
147,Mr GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister able to confirm the government's commitment to improving Australia's infrastructure, especially in regional Australia?",48
148,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government has improved Australia's infrastructure through a number of programs under the leadership of my colleague the Deputy Prime Minister. One such program is the Better Cities' program. Just last week I was at the Inveresk railyard in Tasmania, which is yet another Better Cities project. There are 26 of them in all, where $816 million has been expended and thousands of jobs have. been created. The private and public sector contributions to these projects now amount to $4 billion. We can see this with the extension of Better Cities stage two and also with the regional development policies of the government with regional development organisations being developed around the country. There are now 40 organisations. Some $3Y2 million has been invested in North Queensland, south-east Queensland, Northern Rivers, Illawarra, the Hunter, Gippsland, Western Port and Perth. Mr Truss interjecting",48
149,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Wide Bay.,48
150,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Prime Minister has effectively established a new regional force for economic and social development. This is not true of both parties. I am able to release the opposition's policy on regional development and infrastructure which was outlined by Senator Ian Macdonald. He stated: The Grand Vision My policy proposes a long tenn visionary Infrastructure Planning and Priority Council consisting of State and Local Government and some leading business and technical people . . . The policy indicates that prior to the election we would be announcing a list of long tenn visionary projects we would specifically like the Council to investigate and prioritise, for example: Darwin to Alice Springs Railway, turning coastal waters inland, rejuvenating the Murray-Darling Basin, Adelaide Airport. This gives us the flexibility of announcing a lot of major. long tenn visionary matters but without committing ourselves to actually proceeding with them. He goes on to state: The third major element of my Portfolio is infrastructure. The problem with proposals in infrastructure is how to give us the flexibility to campaign properly without being so specific as to lock us into particular projects which then of necessity must rule out others. He goes on further to state: It is my assessment, supported by the Federal Secretariat, that we need to approach infrastructure from both the grand vision and the more localised angle. Again my policy allows the flexibility of announcements during the campaign of the projects that would be submitted. This particular approach is strongly endorsed by the federal secretariat. I seek direction on just how specific Shadow Cabinet would require us to be . . . In drafting the infrastructure policy I have attempthow ed to be precise enough to be more than just words, and yet flexible enough not to stretch credibility. I will table the document because it refers, three leaders later, to a statement by the former shadow minister, the honourable member for Maranoa. He stated: We need a set of figures ($1 billion, $3 billionthe actual number is insignificant) as an indication of our commitment to putting roads, dams, airports, bridges, whatever, into regional Australia. That was referred to in the latest document. This is a sad reminder of how low the opposition has sunk under the leadership of the Leader of the Opposition. When we look at the Deputy Prime Minister's achievements in relation to regional and economic development; regional development organisations and in relation to the $816 million in Better Cities and support for the development of regions, we find that we have from the opposition, three leaders after the time when the member for Maranoa produced that tawdry piece of paper, under the leadership of John Howard, another piece of paper from the shadow minister for regional development and infrastructure which states: This gives us the flexibility of announcing a lot of major long tenn visionary matters but without committing ourselves to actually. proceeding with them. He goes on to state: The problemÂ·with proposals in infrastructure is how to give us the flexibility to campaign properly without being so specific as to lock us into particular projects which then of necessity must rule out others.",48
151,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That's the new integrity.,49
152,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is the new integrity in policy-exactly. So let rural Australia know-whenever they see you coming in Northern Queensland, Western Australia, the Northern Territory, the remote or provisional areas of Tasmania, New South Wales and Victoria-that this low grade piece of paper, lying as their policy before their meeting in Cairns last week, presented to their meeting in Cairns last week, is the strength of their policy. They will announce visionary projects that they can cancel or not keep; and that they are talking about the capital works program of a Labor government being successful and they need to emulate our policies but not put any of them into place. Mr Speaker, compare that with the completion of the first stage of the Better Cities program-$816 million and $4,000 million with private capital expenditure. Compare that with the 30-odd regional areas under the economic development organisations and the money we have put into that. Compare that policy, principle and advances with this substitute-this trickery, this deceptive approach to those rural people who the Liberal and National parties want to hoodwink. If they want proof of their hoodwinking, they only need to see published a copy of this paper which has been presented. Mr Speaker, could you believe that in 1995, after the policy advances of the last 12 years, we would see these sorts of attitudes being expressed by the opposition in a policy paper before the shadow cabinet within a year of an election? Is it any wonder that the Leader of the Opposition is saying, 'Why am I called upon to articulate policies for the next 20 years?' The truth is, he cannot be called upon to articulate policy for the next 20 minutes. What we see here is a repeat of what Mr Scott did exactly, almost to the word, three years ago under two former Leaders of the Opposition. Let their lack of principle be on the public record for all to see, and may they stand condemned for their cynicism. Nuclear Testing in the Pacific",49
153,Mr TAYLOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister and is further to his response to the last question from the Leader of the Opposition. I refer the Prime Minister to the announcement last Friday that French ship berthings and aircraft transits through . Australia would not be permitted where they were involved in the Pacific nuclear te-ting program. Can the Prime Minister confirm that France has complied with Australian Customs cargo clearance formalities on all past transit flights through Cairns, Darwin or Norfolk Island? If not, as some suggest, why not? What are to be the future clearance arrangements to ensure that the government's decision on Friday is unambiguously effective?",50
154,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,";-Words from another great fighter of the nuclear free zone in the Pacific, no doubt; words from another great person who is opposed to testing by the French of nuclear weapons in this part of the world. The humbug of you is extraordinary! Let me come to the case in point. The government, as I said, will be preparing guidelines which will apply to aspects of defence cooperation. These will be developed to the best of the government's ability so as to require of any French authority undertakings about the nature of the cargoes or the nature of their involvement in transiting Australia. I am not aware of whether any such guidelines existed in the 1980s-they may well have-or. what the consequences of the application of those guidelines were. But what I am concerned about are the guidelines which apply from here on. The government will. be doing as it has said it would dopreparing guidelines which may apply to any transit flights by the French government. Elderly Ethnic People",50
155,Mr NEWELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Human Services and Health. What action is the government taking to meet the needs of elderlY ethnic people?,50
156,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the member for Ca1well, my parliamentary secretary, who has done a lot of work in this area to ensure that the government responds to the fundamental principles of access and equity. It is quite clear that we need not only to respond to the ageing of our population but particularly to look carefully at the ageing of the postwar migrant intake. Some 17 per cent of older Australians have an ethnic background and by the year 2001 that will rise to 25 per cent. I think it is worth members notingthat already around 11 per cent of nursing home residents, eight per cent of hostel residents, 12 per cent of home and community care clients and 18 per cent of those using the new community aged care packages are people from ethnic background. So, clearly, all of us need to strengthen our efforts and plan for future needs. . Like the rest of the community, older people from ethnic communities want to stay in their homes for as long as possible. So it is critical not only that residential care be sensitive and culturally appropriate but also that our home and community care programs should provide for those older citizens. I was pleased to note, for instance, that Meals on Wheels is increasingly changing its menus with appropriate food to reflect the nature of its clientele. Our strategy, however, involves full partnership with private and charitable sectors. It is not just for government but also for providers to make sure we have this cultural sensitivity. We have to build on already significant achievements. I draw members' attention to the fact that we have clustering to ensure that people who do not live in concentrations of ethnic groups still have access to appropriately sensitive facilities. In Western Australia, Victoria and the ACT we are now trialling placement of dedicated ethnic liaison officers in some of our larger facilities and community care programs. I am delighted that in Victoria, following consultations with DEET, aged care providers and ethnic organisations, we are developing a pilot traineeship program for the ethnic unemployed, particularly older women, for places in hostels and community care services. They will be trained to work with people from ethnic backgrounds to ensure that the twin objectives, in this case of appropriate care and a skilled work force, are met. These are matters of great principle. I was very worried recently when I heard-second hand, it must be said, but nonetheless accurately because I heard it from a number of sources-about the current shadow spokesman in this area saying that he was quite keen to talk to the owners of the residential care facilities about planning and programming into the future. But he made no mention at all of consumers and residents. I am very worried that we will.have a return to the bad old days when those people who use these facilities were consulted last and when those people who own the facilities and make a profit from them were considered to be the only ones who had an insider's working knowledge. Certainly the impression they were given that meeting was that there would be a special partnership between them and the coalition, and the rest of the sector could go begging. Diesel Fuel Rebate",50
157,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister agree that it is a fundamental principle of our legal and political systems that retrospective legislation should be used only in the most extraordinary circumstances? Why then is the government proposing to legislate back to 1 August 1986 to deprive individuals and companies of moneys they are legally entitled to under the diesel fuel rebate scheme? Does the Prime Minister agree that there is no element of illegality or fraud to justify the retrospectivity as there was with the removal of the bottom-of-the-harbour tax schemes? Why did the government not act to clarify the operation of the scheme at some time in the previous nine years and avoid this unjustified retrospectivity?,51
158,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I never knew that the opposition adopted this question of retrospectivity as a matter of high principle. In fact, I remember a lot of retrospective legislation from the opposition. But that is not the intention of the government in this case. It goes to the operation of the diesel fuel rebate scheme, and some may argue that clarity in these operations would obviate the need for any retrospective collections under the arrangements. Nevertheless, the government considered the whole of the diesel rebate scheme in the budget process and made no fundamental changes to it. It reviewed the provisions of the scheme to improve its administration and its targeting. This is a very broad scheme and it is becoming a costly scheme. The need is to ensure that the scheme continues to meet policy objectives. Retrospective clarification of eligibility criteria has been included to protect.government revenue from broadening the scope of the rebate scheme beyond its intended focus on core agricultural and mining activities. However, retrospective claims will be permitted in the residential category, which has since been abolished. All claims which will not be eligible after 1 July 1995 but which have already been paid following concluded legal action will not be recovered. In this way, we can keep the scheme targeted to do the things we wish it to do-to give that relief to people in primary industry and in miningbut at the same tillie keep it focused and targeted. Copyright",51
159,Mr GIBSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Justice. The minister would be aware of the recent World Trade Organisation agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights. Can the minister advise the House what implications there are for the enforcement of such rights under Australian copyright law?,52
160,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Fortunately, and I think because of the foresight that this parliament has had in terms of the framing of our copyright legislation, the answer is only a minimal implication. This is because, in the past, the international community has left it to copyright owners to enforce their own rights. Whilst they have been the owners of a set of property rights, there has not been a legal obligation internationally to deal with the dispossession of those rights as theft or 'copyright piracy', which is the phrase used in this area. The trade related agreement now deems it necessary for governments to provide criminal sanctions as well as civil sanctions to protect copyright owners. Australia already has in place a regime which permits crirriinal actions to be taken to stop the theft of intellectual property and to combat piracy. In that respect, only minimal change to our laws is required. Where our law does require change is in the area of Customs. Copyright owners will now be able to alert Customs of a threatened transit of a pirated product. Customs will seize the product, and there will be a process to determine whether that claim is justified otherwise. If the claim is not made out, the product will be released to the importers. That means the burden of enforcement is shared between the private and public sectors. That is pretty important because, not withstanding any changes in this international environment, I do not think anyone who is a copyright owner or associated with law enforcement expects that there could be a wholesale shift of the cost of copyright protection from the private sector. to the public sector. It obviously needs to be worked out together. In the past, various film and video associations have funded a private group working with the Australian Federal Police to ensure that their criminal rights are also enforced. . There is a legitimate concern amongst some in the copyright community that insufficient seriousness is paid to the consequences of the piracy of copyright material. Sometimes penalties that have been awarded by courts have been thought to be too low, and representations have been made to the government about this. I have also had representations from the Business Software Association. It has sought to ensure that there is effective cooperation between the Federal Police and itself to protect software users. All in all, I think this government has a lot to be proud of in terms of the way in which it has made a wholesome, effective copyright environment. After having had recent discussions with the BSA, I can say this: only three countries have lower levels of piracy than Australia-:-the United States, South Africa and, I think, Austria. This means that we do a heck of a lot better than most European countries. We certainly do better than Britain and France, and we certainly do better than any of our neighbours in this region. It is a reputation that we as a government are keen to maintain.",52
161,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Radiation Levels Mr .CAMPBELL- Mr Speaker, I asked or this question in 1988, and I have not had an answer to it. I refer to the background levels of radiation in this parliament. Since they are probably significantly higher than Mururoa and certainly higher than the average for Australia, can you undertake to supply members of parliament with the background radiation levels in this place and various locations?",52
162,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I will endeavour to fulfill the requirements of that question. BARLIN, MR LYN",52
163,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Before I call the clerk for petitions, it might be an appropriate time to place on record the congratulations of the parliament on the award of Membership in the General Division of the Order of Australia in the Queen's Birthday honours list to the clerk, Lyn Barlin. It goes without saying that Lyn Barlinis the quintessential public servant. Every member of this place enjoys his confidence. I think the recognition that Lyn has received is long overdue, and we offer our congratulations to him. Honourable members-Hear, hearl NA",52
164,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: Family Law Act To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Austriilia draws to the attention of the House the need for changes to the Family Law Act of Australia and to the Child Support Scheme. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House enact the following changes: 1. That the existing Family Law Act be scrapped and replaced by a more simplified version together with the minimum of rules and regulations necessary. 2. That The Family Court be replaced by a Tribunal and that all matters resulting from divorce and family breakdown be heard before, and determined by a panel, the panel to be made up of persons qualified in matters arising from family breakdown. 3. That legal professionals be barred from appearing before the Tribunal resulting in vast savings to the disputing parties; 4. That a modified fault clause be re-introduced to Family Law primarily designed to discourage adultery and to stop rewarding adulterers at the expense of deserted and innocent parties .. 5. That the Child Support Agency be scrapped and replaced by an appropriate administrative procedure within the Tribunal. 6. That apart from cases of exceptional.circumstances parental-child access become the inalienable right of all parents. 7. That alternative counselling, (Government funded) be made available through the churches and that much more emphasis be placed on mediation in resolving disputes prior to the commencement onegal proceedings. by Mr Beale (from 43 citizens), Mr Hawker (from 3,015 citizens), Mr MCArthur (from 1,672 citizens) and Mr O'Connor (from 1,000 citizens). Kingsford Smith Airport To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that a large number of people are being adversely affected by the operations of Kingsford Smith Airport. To reduce this intolerable situation, the scaling down of operations at Kingsford Smith Airport is needed. Your petitioners therefore request the House to oppose the proposed privatisation of Kingsford Smith Airport. by MrBaldwin (from 117 citizens). Breast Cancer Research To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia: (a) deplores the fact that six Australian women per day die from breast cancer and notes the possibility of contracting breast cancer is as high as one chance in sixteen for Australian women; (b) recognises the fact that breast cancer has the potential to effect every Australian family; (c) recognises that there are inadequate research funds available to help combat breast cancer; (d) notes that extent of research funding expenditure on :other medical conditions with significantly lower mortality rates such as the HIV virus; (e) calls on the Federal Government to provide more funds .for breast cancer research; and, (f) recommends that the Government introduces tax incentives for donations to breast cancer research in the order of 150% to encourage community support to help eliminate this disease. and to increase the availability of research funds. We therefore pray that the Parliament take steps to ensure that greater resources are made available for research into breast cancer. by Mr Richard Evans (from 7q citizens). ANZAC Day To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: The ANZACs at the Gallipoli landing on 25 April 1915 were instrumental in forging a new identity for Australia. That landing was a lifetime ago but the deeds of those ANZACs of 1915-18 still speak a message of selfless service and sacrifice that will last forever. ANZAC Day is a day to remember those who left their homes with a strong desire to return but did not, as well as those who did return, but in so doing carried for the remainder of their lives the scars of these experiences. It is a day to contemplate the spirit that moves men and women to serve, to suffer discomforts, dangers and fears and to risk their lives in defence of their country and in the pursuit of peace, justice and freedom. On ANZAC Day, we salute not only the spirit of the ANZACs but, in paying tribute to them, we take the opportunity to dedicate ourselves to striving for our country as they did and to upholding their finest qualities of courage, commitment, endurance and mateship. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House urge the Government to declare ANZAC day as Australia's National Day of Commemoration and that it be held on 25 April in each year, and on no other day. by Mr Hawker (from 40 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: 1. The majority of Australians are completely satisfied with the existing Australian nationTo al flag. 2. We therefore request that the House of Representatives ensures that the Australian national flag, as provided in Section (3) of the Flags Act, is not changed or replaced without first being voted upon and approved by the people of Australia in a national poll. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Hawker (from 40 citizens). Safe Sex Guide To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that: 1. We are opposed to the sex guide endorsed by the Minister for Human Services and Health, the Hon Dr C Lawrence, MP, and published in the December 1994 issue of Cleo magazine. 2. We believe that the sex guide encourages dangerous sexual practices which could have serious medical and moral effects. We call on Minister Lawrence to withdraw her endorsement of this sex guide and for the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, to indicate his disapproval of it. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House requests Minister Lawrence and Prime Minister Keating to take note of our serious concerns and to act on this petition. by Mr Hicks (from 190 citizens).

We are opposed to the sex guide endorsed by the Hon C Lawrence, Minister for Human Services and Health in the Keating Government and published in the December issue of Cleo. 2. We believe that the sex guide encourages dangerous sexual practices which could have serious medical and moral effects. We request the House to calion Dr Lawrence to withdraw her endorsement of this sex guide and for the Prime Minister, the Hon PI Keating, to indicate his disapproval.

We are opposed to the sex guide endorsed by Ms. Lawrence, Minister for Health in the Keating Government, and published in the December issue of Cleo. 2. We believe that the sex guide encourages dangerous sexual practices which could have serious medical and moral effects. 3. We strongly object to the misuse of $250,000 of taxpayers money for the preparation of Ms Lawrence's sex guide. The petitioners therefore calIon the House to require (1) Ms Lawrence to withdraw her endorsement of this sex guide and (2) the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, to indicate his disapproval.

The Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that: 1. We object to the 10bsearch and New Start Allowance rates being more than the Austudy rate. 2. This situation provides no incentive for unemployed people to further their education. We calIon the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, the Hon. Ross Free, MP, to take action that will result in the Austudy rate being raised to the same level as the 10bsearch and Newstart Allowance payments. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House requests Minister Free to act on our serious concerns and on this petition. by Mr Hicks (from 100 citizens). Family Day Care To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia, being Family Day Care Caregivers and/or Parent users of Family Day Care Services, draws to the attention of the house to the threat to the continuation of Family Day Care services, the loss of thousands of childcare places, the loss of employment for thousands of caregivers, resulting from the introduction of an award for Self Employed Caregivers. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House recommends, with regard to the ALP Working Party, set up under resolution No. 164R 'to consider the implementation of the provision of better wages and conditions for home based child care workers', that the Government seek input from the stake holders: the 15,087* Family Day Care Caregivers the Parents of the 76,356* children using Family Day Care, the Sponsors of the FDC schemes, before making any decisions. by Mr Newell (from 37 citizens).

165,Mr HAWKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Wannon) (3.57 p.m.)Today I would like to talk about Medicare and, in particular, the injustice in the treatmentof people in the country compared with that of those in the city. There is a major imbalance. Rebates to people in the country are something like 30 per cent less than those to people in the city. I refer honourable members to the answer to a question I put on notice to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), question No. 2107, which gives some very detailed answers as to the . level of Medicare rebates to all electorates over the last three financial years. I asked what the Medicare benefits were on a per capita basis for each of the financial years. We see from the answer that, from the time Medicare was introduced, there has been a growing imbalance, yet the government has repeatedly been using words like 'fair' and 'fairest' to describe Medicare. We see this first when the then Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, wrote to all Australians in 1983. In part of that letter he said: Medicare is not only a cheaper and simpler system but it is also fairer. In 1987 we had the member for Canning, now the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), saying: As I have said, it is the fairest system we have. In 1989, former Minister for Health Dr Blewett said: We believe that that is the fairest system of all . . . These are the sorts of superlatives the government has been using. Yet when we start to look at the facts, we see that these statements unravel somewhat. These figures actually show that there are massive deficiencies in the Medicare provision for rural health. They show that, in the country, rebates are around $239 per head per year, yet in the city they are nearly $100 more at $324 per person per year. This shows very clearly that Labor has neglected rural Australia for 12 years. It is trying to do its best to kill the goose that the golden egg. After all,rural and remote Australia produces over, 70 per cent of Australia's exports and contains 28 per cent of the population. Yet rural and reqJ.ote Australia is served by only 20 per cent of Australia's general practitioners and just 10 per cent of the specialists. While not wishing to overplay the point, it is very interesting to note the following fact: if you look at the averl;lge amount of rebate and the electorates that place above that average, you find that there are more Labor held electorates than coalition' held electorates. Significantly, you find that, the majority of electorates that fall below that average are coalition electorates, not Labor electorates. I firid that highly curious. ' Let us look at some examples. In the 199394 year, for example, the rebate to the electorate of Blaxlarid was $399; Watson, $453; Sydney, $429.89; Melbourne Ports, $413; and Kingsford Smith, $392. If we look ,at some of the country electorates, we find, for example, that in my electorate of Wannon the average rebate was just $215,86; Grey, $213;99; Braddon, $219; Forrest, $208; Kennedy,,$195; and O'Connor, $198; There is clearly a very big difference. In fact, the difference is that in some cases country electorates are getting just half. ' Yet people in the country still pay the same Medicare levy. Obviously, they are getting less value for their dollar. The government often likes to emphasise in reports that there are similar bed n)lmbers in the country and the city, but this hid-s many of the facts. City beds are of a far higher . intensity and they offer far more specialis-d services. As we all know,-ountry areas suffer a lack of general practitioners,' speciali,sts equipment. I would like to t-ink that it was otherwise,but the idea that country health is better is, regrettably, a myth. We only have to look at the report entitled Rural health and welfare in Australia in 1990 to see that the country experience- higher accidental death' and injuries; allergic reactions, skin, disorders and suicides Jhan do people in, the cities. Likewise, if we Joo-, at the rates for avoidable death, we find' that they are 47 per cent higher for men in, the lays country than in the city, and 30 per cent higher for women. The Commonwealth Department of Human Services and Health estimates that there is a need for 300 to 500 GPs to improve the rur-l health situation. It has been saying this for some time. :There is also a need for specialists, as I have mentioned. What people in the country find sogalling is the minister's arrogant attitude toward the elderly in the country. Clearly there is a growing ,number of elderly - people in the country. Often they are far from their family or from other people and, there is, a greater need for hostel care, probably ,more so than in the city in many ca-e's. Yet, as I fou-d in a case in, my own electorate, the minister refused' to. .meet a delegation from Lismore where the hospital was under very serious threat, notwithstanding that half the funding of that hospital camefromthe COnlmonwealth for the nursing home. ' The issue becom:esmore s-rious when we look at what has happened because' of the slump in farming. It has clearly had a major effect, not just on farmers and the health of farming families but on those involved in nori-farm businesses in the country. There are two studies around that highlight, tl;lis. The first one is Rural businesses and the reces-ion.: its effe-ts in six NSW towns, which was done last yearby the"" University of New South Wales. The second on,? is B.etter health: rural health project 1991-93, which was put out' by the pniting Chur.Gh in Melbourne' in 1993. , 'These studies show that dU-e to the slump in farming incomes there has been an increase ana in domestic violence;ari increase in accidents on roads and on farms; an increa,se in the consumption of anti-depressants and tranquillisers; an increase"" in, mental, physical and social disorders and suicicies; and a high level of drug alld alcol}ol consunlpti'on. What response have weseen.from the government? We have seen what has been occurring in so many other ,areas of-hisgovernment; itÂ· has become the government .o-fperpetuallmnouncements., It has become the master of the majorailliouncem-nts, the' glossy . ) "" , , brochure, , the earnest report, and then the complete letdown+-and , so it goes round again. Let us look at what has happened in recent years. The national rural health strategy to startin 1991. It was repackaged in 1994 just to - ee whether it had some meaning. In 1990, th- rural health support education trainingÂ· program was introduced. The rural incentives program, RIP-one wonders what that was really meant to refer to-was introissues duced ih 1992. Then we had the multi-purpose centres and multi-purpose service programs introduced in 1989. Then, despite all these inquiries and little extra efforts, guess what happened in 1994? The government started the Australian Rural Health Research Institute; I guess its job was to study what had happened to the previous four, because clearly they had not had effect. They are very impressive sounding names, but we have had from government perpetual announcements. Instead of dealing with the major problem of providing better health services in the country, we find the government is more interested in trying to make perpetual announcements. It has very little to show after all these years. What shows IS that, despite these programs, despite these inquiries, despite all these announcethe ments, the facts speak louder than the words. The facts are. that forcountrypeoplt(Medicare is not the fairest system. People the country, on average, are getting $100 per year per head less than their city counterparts. Clearly this shows in a very stark way just how much the government is failing to .proit vide decent health services to people in country. I think what we really ought to be saying to the government is, 'Look, if you can't do this, here is an option. If provide better services to the country, you really should give serious consideration to giving $100 rebate to people living in the country so they do not get ripped off by this system.' There is clearly a massive imbalance and is about time the government had the decency to admit it. Country people know it. Country doctors know it. It is about time that this government knew it. Australian Constitution",55
166,Mr HAVILAND,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Macarthur) (4.06 p.m.)Today I grieve for the state of Australia's was federal system-in particular, for the poor level of cooperation between the Commonwealth andÂ· the states in many areas and the and consequential impact on social policies and the goals of equity and social justice. It is not the first time. I have spoken on some of these in this place, but they remain one of . our greatest problems in Australia. Australia is six years away from the centenary of Federation, which occurred in 1901. The constitution is now 94 years old. We have had a lot of debate about the constitution in recent years, particularly with the advent of the republic debate. Of course, we had the historic statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) two weeks ago about the proposed republic and there has been a lot of debate from the usual sources about how we should never change the constitution. Any debate involving the Australian constitution, especially in. this place, is bound to evoke strong feelings and passions. It seems that, whenever anyone suggests a change or it a reform to our society which may require amendment to the constitution, members of conservative opposition parties, the Liberal and National .parties, those forces of reaction opposite-I cannot see any here at the momenf-typically find a way of opposin ing it, no matter how sensible or how necessary it might be. For these forces of reaction, their argument seems to be that the constitution should never be changed, simply because supposedly reflects the intent of the 'foundthe ing fathers'-and I guess the people who wrote the constitution were all men in those days-of the 1890s. They say that therefore you can't the constitution is sacrosanct. It seems to escape these people that what may have seemed appropriate to conservative colonial lawyers and politicians in the 1890s may no longer be relevant to the best interests of Australia in the 1990s. After all, the task it in the 1890s was to draft a constitution to bring together six sovereign colonial states into one nation, at a time when the horse and buggy was the normal mode of transport. The situation is, of course, very different now. It is this self-serving conservatism of those parties representing the ruling classes which has made constitutional reform a difficult path in Australia. Constitutional change requires a referendum to be carried by a majority of voters in four out of the six states as well as a majority of voters overall, which in itself makes reform difficult, especially when it concerns so-called states rights and the powers of state governments. Consequently, only eight out of 42 referenda put to the Australian people since 1901 have been passed. Over the past century, as advancement in communications, technology and social conditions continue to make state boundaries and divisions less relevant, federal governments, especially reforming federal Labor governments, have had to rely on other means to bring about progress, especially in social policy. These include use of the Commonwealth's financial powers under section 96 of the constitution, which involves specific purpose payments, or SPPs, to states for specific government programs. Australia has a federal system of government, and has had since 1901. Federalism is a system of government in which authority is distributed between central and regional governments. Although there is no pre-emiÂ­ nent definition of federalism, it is generally agreed that its main features involve power sharing between the levels or tiers of government, with each enjoying some degree of autonomy from the other. Federalism places limits on the powers of these levels of government by means of a written constitution. The Australian constitution divides the areas of law making between the two tiers of government-federal and state. As in the United States, the powers of the Commonwealth of Australia are enumerated, that is, they are written into the constitution; while those of the states are residual, that is, they have powers over any function not mentioned in the constitution. Some of the powers of the Commonwealth are exclusive, meaning the Commonwealth has sole jurisdiction, while others are concurrent or shared with the states. For example, taxation is a concurrent power, as each level of government may raise taxes. Section 51 of the constitution sets ou- most of the areas in which the Commonwealth can legislate. It includes matters central to a national government such as defence,' postal services and currency and coinage.! Other powers of the Commonwealth are listed in section 52, where the CommonweaJth has exclusive powers over the seat of govbrnment, the Public Service and 'other matters declared by the Constitution to be within the exclusive power of the Commonwealth' . Section 109 gives the Commonwealth the right to prevail when laws are inconsistent in areas where both levels of government can legislate; while section 96 permits the Commonwealth to allocate tied financial grants to the states. The powers of the states are set out in section 107 of the constitution, which declares that every power that is not vested exclusively with the Commonwealth remains in the domain of state governments. The original division of responsibilities left the states with most of their day-today functions, including law and order, education, health, housing, transport and land use. Vast changes have occurred in Australian society since the drafting of the. Australian constitution nearly 95 years ago. This has facilitated a gap between the written constitution and modern political and social realities. This seems most stark in the area of social policy, the area I want to particularly address. At the time of Federation, the attitudes towards social policy were equivocal. The constitution provided for Commonwealth powers in areas such as defence and foreign affairs. However, it did not fully set out, or hardly set out at all, the responsibility for social policy because it was assumed in those days that private charities or the states would provide resources in this area. Throughout the 20th century there has been increasing pressure for the development of cohesive national social policies. To meet these demands, the Commonwealth and state governments have taken various informal and constitutional actions. The federal structure is a perennial source of tension and debate in Australian politics. Over the years various reviews have been considered, both formal and informal. It is in \ the Â¥ea of. social policy where most of the tenSH)US anse between the Commonwealth and the states; in areas like defence, taxation and s\>cial security there are very clear-cut Commonwealth powers; the states obviously have r-sponsibility for the areas I mentioned, such a- land use, the police force, education and trahsport. It isiinareas of social policy that Labor govermpents, in particular since 1972, have found the need to become more involved. There are plenty of glaring examples of thisAboriginal health, mental health, child care and a number of others such as aged care. The reason the Commonwealth has had to get involved in most of these areas is that over the decades state governments have basically failed to provide adequate resources for social justice and adequate social policies. The Commonwealth, certainly since Labor was elected in 1972, has seen the need to get more involved. Because of the limitations provided by the constitution, the way the Commonwealth has had to do it is largely through financial arrangements such as specific purpose grants. I am currently involved in a Joint Committee of Public Accounts inquiry into specific purpose payments to the states. I think all the state governments have put forward written submissions, although only some of them have agreed to appear before our committee. It is very interesting, although hardly surprising, to note that when they have appeared they have put forward the view that the Commonwealth should keep out of telling the states what to do with what they consider to be their money. In fact, that money is Commonwealth money. The Commonwealth raises the taxes, yet the states believe we should hand over the money, particularly in the area of social policy, and leave it to the states to decide how to spend it. I think any reasonable government committed to social justice at the national level would reject that view. I certainly reject that view. I will be very interestto ed to see how this inquiry unfolds. It is in. the area of social policy that I believe we need fundamental change in Australian society. While it might not be possible nor even necessary to abolish state governments-a lot of us on this side would probably like to see that happen one day-in the short term to achieve the outcomes that we want, I think we need to look at the roles of the Commonwealth and the states. Included there are some obvious ones. The Commonwealth has a clear role in foreign affairs, defence and taxation. The states have a clear role in the areas I mentioned earlier: police, land use and urban transport. A lot of areas which at the moment are subject to Commonwealth-state agreements I think would be better placed in the Commonwealth domain. (Time expired) Aged Care Building Industry Roads Timber Workers",57
167,Mr NEHL,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Today I grieve for the elderly in the electorate of Cowper, who are totally neglected by this Labor government. That is an outstanding claim to make, but the figures prove it. The government is pork-barrelling in the Labor held seats of Richmond and Page in looking to the next election. I think it is absolutely outrageous that by the year 2000 the aged care situation in Cowper will be the worse in New South Wales. Labor neglect is evidenced by last year's round of nursing home bed allocations. Cowper received four extra nursing home beds, which went to the Legacy nursing home. It really needed six to be viable, but what did Labor do? It gave that nursing home only four. Richmond, a Labor held seat, got an extra 40 nursing home beds. Its situation is no worse than Cowper. We have a desperate need. Organisations like Marion Grove are doing a wonderful job with aged care hostels. They desperately want to provide nursing home beds. I am giving them the total support that I can, but unless Labor is going be fair, equitable and just that is just not going to happen. Others in other centres also need that as well. It is also interesting to see what happened with the community aged care packagesagain, great injustice. Page got 50 places; 1734 REPRESENTATIVES Richmond got 60 places; Cowper got none. Worse still, the Aged Care Advisory Committee has already recommended that the midnorth coast, which is basically Cowper, should not be targeted for any more nursing home places in this coming financial year. I think this is absolutely outrageous. I make the point that by 1997, which is not that far away, in the electorate of Cowperwhich takes in the Macleay Valley, the Nambucca Valley, the Bellinger Valley and Coffs Harbour-there will be a shortfall of 151 hostel places, a shortfall of 90 nursing home beds and a shortfall of 121 CACPs. This is on the government's own ratio. By the year 2001, the shortfall on nursing home beds will be 167; on hostel places, 246; and on CACPs, 141. That is a supreme illustration of just how this government has neglected and is neglecting seats not held by itself. If we look at the budget we find that self- the world. funded retirees are being kicked in the pants again. The l-a-w law tax cuts are not going to go through to them. Self-funded retirees have worked hard and saved. At the last election the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) promised tax cuts for seniors. The National Party believes and I believe it would be just and equitable for the taxation threshold for self-funded independent retirees to be raised from $5,400 to $lO,nO-the same as it is for pensioners. The government promised it would reduce tax on the incomes of seniors over $20,700, but now there is no benefit whatsoever to senior Australians looking after themselves. This promise is no good to those with super-nnuation who are going to retire before it comes into effect. Those self-funded retirees will have to pay more tax because of the tax on cars and petrol. Sales tax is going up, and if they need to maintain their house they will have to face the 12 per cent sales tax on building materials the government is trying to put through. All over Australia the building industry is in trouble. There has been a 30 per cent downturn in new housing approvals which has affected national housing growth. When the 12 per cent sales tax hits, it will make the industry Wllrse off. That 12 per cent sales on building materials will affect everyone. It I Monday, 19 June will affect not only builders but also carPenters, brickies, electricians, plumbers, - hiteÂ­ goods manufacturers, retailers, solioitors, carpet manufacturers and those wh- sell curtains and light fittings. I I am also disappointed that the govefnment is attacking subcontractors. About 18fnonths ago, I fought on behalf of carpet: layers against the Taxation Office in Newcastle, which was trying, in a pilot study, to-ategoÂ­ rise them as PAYE taxpayers. These people, whether they are carpet layers, brick layers or carpenters, are independent, self-supporting businessmen. This new proposal will take them out of that situation and put them into the PAYE tax system. I believe the hidden agenda is a ploy to recruit them for the unions. The Australian housing industry is entirely based on subcontractors. In fact, we have the most efficient housing industry in I need to make the point that the Pacific Highway has been dumped by Labor. There is still 430 kilometres with only two lanes and there is only 60 kilometres of dual highway between Hexham and the Queensland border. The government has also dumped the black spots program. I am pleased to tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the people of Australia that it is National Party policy to have that black spots program reinstated as quickly as possible. I am most concerned about and grieve for the families of timber workers. The workers in the forests, the contractors and the sawmillers are all under threat and under attack. They have no certainty, they are worried about their mortgages, and their wives are very concerned. In a moment I will refer to an excellent report produced under the sponsorship of the member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow). It has been shown that these forest workers have to guard their equipment from sabotage. The forest industries of Australia must have resource security. They have to be able to plan for the future. When we talk about plantations we have to make the point that there must be harvesting rights. There is no tax point encouraging people to invest enormous amounts of money in plantation timber if at the-nd of the day the fanatic greenies will put them in the situation where they cannot cut down a singletree .. We have to realise that - e will nev-r satisfy the extreme environmental gree1).1es, because they are never satisfi-d with what we do. "" I ma,de mention of the report sponsored by the member for Eden-Monaro. I must compliment him on the report on the controversy in the hardwood industry in south-eastern New South Wales carried Qut by Gerry Cirulli. This report applies to the timber workers, the forest families, the kids and the workers in the .,honourable member's area. It also applies to the constituents of my electorate of Cowper. People in Dorrigo are under threat and people in the Upper Macleay who are dependent on timber are also under ,threat. . The report found that there was a massive proportion of worry and stress over uncertainty in the women . and children of timber workers. In Â·an interview conducted for the report, a logger said, 'How can I plan my future when I don't know if I will have a job tomorrow or not?' That was the sort of complaint that was repeated time and time again. That is the sort of uncertainty affecting the timber' industry throughout New South Wales. Just 'on 60 per cent of respondents reported suffering from insomnia, ranging from severe to mild, caused by worry and stress. There is no stress leave forÂ· timber workers. Mind you they lose their fingers, their knuckles, their hands and sometimes their legs. It is a very dangerous business, they are very hard working people. . The respondents are beil)g made to feel socially o-tracised. Because they work in the timber industry, and because of the campaign against it, th-y are mad.e to feel guilty. That brings on strong feelings of frustration, anger and, indeed, bewilderment. No Australian citizen, no Australhin family or no Australian mother or kid, should be subjected to that. We are fhiding that mothers have to spend nights iIi the'torest to guard the family's costly logging equipment to stop the greenies from. sabotaging 'it.Â· They spend the night in the forest so theirhusb,and cart sleep soÂ· he can work the next day. This is Australia and thi- is going on. It is totally unacceptable. Children are complaining of being reared in towns developing a siege mentality. In some schools the subject of logging has been banned from school discussions. Some parents have complained of children being indoctrinated in some schools through the teaching of greenie songs. We have to make sure that we do have a sustainable forest industry in Australia, that people who are working in the forestry industry do have a future and that those who are prepared to invest in plantations have security and the harvesting rights for when the trees have grown. For the whole of the timber industry, we must have resource security. Timber Workers Australian Defence Industries Site, St Marys Commonwealth Bank, Emerton Branch University of Western Sydney  driven to respond to a couple of points raised by the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), for whom I do have a regard. The suggestion that somehow the environmental movement is opposed to plantations and would prevent the harvesting of plantation timber really does stretch the imagination. All honour.able members want to see a secure future for the timber industry but I have to say that I can see no future for the timber industry if the emphasis is merely on and the cutting down of sawlogs or on woodchipping. The real future for the timber industry, I believe, rests in value adding. Parties on both sides of this House have a lot to answer for in that there is not the value adding in this industry that there should be. I can remember that when the timber industry appeared before the caucus working group it was saying that no research had been done into AustraJian timbers to identify those that were suitable for replacing rainforest timbers in housing construction or, alternatively, studies had not been undertaken to determine what was the minimum safe level of timber thai could be used in housing construction to make that a viable alternative and one that was competitive with the steel 1736 structure that is being used more and more. So we have a lot to do but value adding is the way ahead. I commend the state government for the initiatives it has taken. In terms of the effect on families, I sympathise with the contribution of the member for Cowper. We do have to work to secure a future for all the workers in the industry but with the emphasis on permanent jobs not on pretend jobs that are going to go away. In this grievance debate, I want to raise a few points. I would like to draw to the attention of the House that, in the week before the election when I was an endorsed candidate for the seat of Chifley, I discovered to my horror that there was radioactive waste at the ADI site at St Marys. I have raised this issue in the caucus. I have put questions on the Notice Paper. I have variously and vigorously pursued this issue for some time. I am very pleased to report to the House that in May of this year that waste was finally removed from my electorate. Mr Bilney-Virtue is rewarded.  stubbornness are rewarded, as the minister says so kindly. People can say, as was said to me during that period, that this is safe and these quantities are very small. In fact, I had the opportunity to walk into the bunker and observe the waste being stored at the ADI at St Marys. But the point I would make, and it is particularly relevant in this era of the resumption of nuclear testing by France, is that no amount of radioactive waste, no matter how safely stored, should be stored in the vicinity of about half a million peoplethe number is even higher, depending on where you want to draw the radius-living in the Blacktown and Penrith local government areas. The other point I would like to make is that people have a right to be informed. Here I was, the Labor candidate and the deputy mayor of the city of Blacktown, and I had no knowledge of the waste being stored there, even though officials had said it was a matter on the public record. They have to do more than say that is a matter on the public record. They have to take a pro-active role and REPRESENTATIVES Monday, 19 June 1995 . inform people. If they have these substances in their midst, people have a right to Jmow about it. I very much resented the approach of those officials in making those statements. Regretfully, I have to say to the Hou-e that part of the solution was seen as establishing a national repository for such waste. We seem to be no closer to that today than we were some 10Y2 years ago, and I think that is a matter of regret. I also want to talk about the move of the Emerton branch of the Commonwealth Bank to the new shopping centre at Plumpton. It is true that Coles and a number of other shops in the Emerton shopping centre have closed down. Paul Gibson, the state member for Londonderry, shifted his office from Emerton to Plumpton. But the people who use that facility, particularly the ordinary people-not so much the business customers-really are not being given a choice. We have to develop .a set of community service obligations for the banks so that we can guarantee ordinary Australians access to what I would call basic banking services. W ehave no conditions on the licences that we grant to banks. They are licences granted in perpetuity. Why cannot we follow the United States model and have renewal hearings? Why cannot we make these licences for four or five years and call banks to account for their operations? Some may say, 'That's just grandstanding or bank bashing.' That may very well be the case. But these large organisations provide an essential community service. Employers demand that their employees have a bank account. The Commonwealth government demands that its recipients have a bank account. You do not have a choice as to whether you want to have a bank account, so there ought to be a level of service that is guaranteed. These organisations seem to believe that they are beyond public. accountability. I do . not think they are beyond public accountability. I say to any organisation-whether it be a bank, a Commonwealth department or a private enterprise institution-you cannot get too close to your customers; you cannot know your customers too well. Part of that accountability process ought to be licence renewal hearings. In the short time left to me, I want to briefly make a few remarks about the secessin ionist moves by the Kingswood campus of the University of Western Sydney. I have often spoken in this place about the University Western Sydney, particularly when we were struggling to get it established. It goes without saying that I am totally opposed to this dismemberment of the federation that consticated tutes the University of Western Sydney. I also have to say that Gillian Maling, chief executive officer of the Kingswood campus, .is a personal friend of mine. I agree with her on a lot of things, but sometimes have disagreed with her in the past. I have great deal of regard for her. I do not believe that you solve problems by seeking the rooted resignation or dismissal of the chief executive officer of the Kingswood campus of the House University of Western Sydney. I would say the board of governors, the vice-chancellor and the chancellor that they ought to indulge in meaningful discussions with all the puses, particularly the Kingswood campus, about their desires to go their separate ways. I reiterate in this place that I am steadfastly against splitting the University of Western reads: Sydney. Penrith got not only the Kingswood This CAE but also the main campus upgraded to a university. It is totally abhorrent, if not somewhat deceitful, that those same people receiving should now say, 'The main campus remains shares at Penrith but we want Kingswood to be substantially autonomous. ' This university means too much to the people, particularly the young people, of Western Sydney to compromise, tarnish or otherwise inhibit its development. Let us have these discussions. Let us meet to sort out our problems. I think it is too early to sever the federation. I am not saying that might not be a question or an issue in the future. These things are not immutable. But, given its short history, I very much deprecate the moves of the Kingswood campus. I also regret the heavy-handed approach by the board of governors arid the vice-chancellor. (Time expired). Country Estate and Agency Co. Pty Ltd",59
168,Mr ANDREWS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Menzies) (4.36 p.m.)Hundreds of thousands of Australians invest shares each year to provide for their income and future security. It is an activity which also adds to savings and investment in of the future of this nation. Many of these people who make those investments in shares are senior Australians-some of them elderly, some infirm and some relatively unsophistiin their knowledge of the legal and company complexities concerned. In this context, it is important that all the investors, particularly the elderly and those who do not have a comprehensive grasp of legal documentation, have faith in the inI tegrity of the regulatory system. It is equally a important that those who seek to prey on the susceptibilities of people are identified and out of the system. It is in this context that I wish to bring to the attention of the today the activities of the firm Country to Estate and Agency Co. Pty Ltd; the firm National Exchange Pty Ltd; and a Mr David Tweed, who is listed in documentation as the camdirector of both of these companies. This matter has been raised with me by my constituents. I wish to quote from a letter I received recently from one constituent, which issue first came to my attention some 12 to 18 months ago when in the course of assisting my elderly father with his affairs I noticed he was a number of letters from Country Estate & Agency Company Pty. Ltd. offering to purchase that he held in various companies at prices below the current market price for such shares. The correspondence which my father received and the accompanying Standard Transfer form appeared to me to be aimed at unsuspecting elderly or frail shareholders and designed primarily to take advantage of such people. In early 1994 I spoke to and in fact wrote to a number of departments including The Australian Securities Commission, the Office for Aged Care and The Health and Community Services Office. I was concerned at the time .that the actions of the Country Estate & Agency Company Pty. Ltd. verged on the fraudulent and were at the very least abhorrent. The letter goes on: It appears that Mr Tweed, a Director of Country Estate & Agency Company Pty. Ltd., relies upon the entitlement of every person to obtain a copy of a company's share register and armed with that information approaches share holders with offers to purchase. My father received a number of these offers from Country Estate & Agency Pty. Ltd. and after his death in December, 1994 such letters have been received by myself and other recipients of shares from his Estate. It is also now quite common to receive correspondence from companies advising share holders that a copy of the share register has been supplied to Country Estate & Agency Company Pty. Ltd. and warning share holders that an approach may be made to them by this company to purchase their shares and advising that independent advice should be obtained before accepting any such offers. I have also now leamed that there was a David Tweed who was a well known financial writer/commentator who now lives overseas. The person who now calls himself David Tweed and who is a Director of Country Estate & Agency CompanyPty. Ltd. on my information changed his name to David Tweed presumably for the purpose of taking advantage of the reputation of another. The letter goes on. I will not go into the other details that support that claim. Since then I have received from a number of companies copies of letters in which they have advised their shareholders that National Exchange Pty Ltd has made offers to selected shareholders to purchase their shares at prices substantially below the market price. For example, North Ltd said in a letter to its shareholders on 28 February 1995: North is very concerned about the activities of Country Estate and urges you to consider very carefully any offer which you might receive from them to purchase your shares. If you are in any doubt you should consult your financial adviser or stockbroker before accepting any such offer. North also stated in its letter: In April last year the Australian Securities Commission issued a mediaÂ· release noting various concerns which had been expressed to it about the activities of Country Estate, including a concern that ""purchase offers have deliberately targeted elderly and unsophisticated investors"". Those concerns led to the Australian Securities Commission revising the conditions on Country Estate's dealers licence. To put this in context, the letter which was sent to North's shareholders with the signature of Mr David Tweed says: Disclosure: the offer price has been calculated by taking into consideration Country Estate's view of management perfonnance. Whether the price of the stock is expected to be more or less volatile than the market average, the expected degree of volatility of the market as a whole, the future uncertainties relating to the company, the market and otherwise and the costs of this offer. By making a reference to 'the future uncertainties relating to the company' there is a suggestion that in some way there has been some mismanagement on the part of the directors of the company and there is an implication that it is somehow conducting its business in an inefficient or inappropriate manner. This ought to be taken into account by the shareholder recipients of this letter who are getting offers to sell their shares to this particular company at a price substantially below the market price. It is not just the shareholders of North Ltd that have had these sorts of letters directed at them. Normandy Poseidon Ltd wrote a letter on 3 April to its shareholders advising them in similar terms. I noticed in an article in the Age on Saturday 10 June 1995 Wesfarmers was giving a warning to its shareholders. The article stated: Wesfarmers has told its shareholders that Country Estate & Agency Company Pty Ltd had sent letters offering to buy Wesfarmers shares for $6.50, which was $2.26, or 26 per cent, below the market price of $8.76 a share. The article also contains a quote from Mr Perkins of Wesfarmers. He stated: . We at Wesfanners are very concerned . . . that Country. Estate has made these offers to achieve a large financial gain at the cost of our shareholders and without any regard whatsoever to the interests of our shareholders ... We strongly advise that under any circumstances you should ignore these below-market offers from Country Estate. Last Saturday in the Age there was another warning. This time it was from Bridgestone Australia to its shareholders. The article stated: The ASC said Country Estate, under the heading ""disclosure"", had advised that ""the offer price is 90 cents below the.market price of $1.50"". This statement is clearly incorrect and is likely to mislead investors, the ASC said. The ASC is concerned that the information set out by Country Estate & Agency could cause Bridgestone shareholders to suffer substantial losses .. The ASC said the company's share price at the time of the offer was $2.40 and from early May to 15 June had not closed below $2.25. This article relates to an offer by Country Estate to buy their shares at $1.50 which it compared to a market price of $2.40. In speaking to directors and company secretaries what appears clear is that Mr Tweed, and the companies of which he is a director, is entitled under the law, if they pay a sufficient price, to obtain the register of shareholders of a company and then build a profile of shareholders, particularly those who have small holdings in a variety of companies, and therefore target a certain type of shareholder. For example, they can exclude the institutional shareholders and concentrate on individuals. By putting a profile together they are able to say which shareholders fit into a certain category and they are able to target them. Given that it costs something like $3,500 to obtain the register of shareholders of a company such as North you can see that a substantial profit is involved should enough people pay this sort of money. My concern is that the ASC said, in its response following the North action, that it had received over 200 complaints about the company's activities and actually revised the licence conditions for Country Estate. It said that it expected that every licence dealer would act honestly, efficiently and fairly and comply with the provisions of the Corporations Law. These latest instances, particularly the one concerning Bridgestone, suggest that that is not being done. It points to a systematic program by Country Estate and Mr Tweed to prey upon the susceptible and the vulnerable. As such, this is a parasitic blight on the market system. I call on the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the Australian Securities Commission to take effective action, given this continuing breach of what might be regarded as fair and reasonable conduct in these circumstances. In the meantime, I warn all shareholders that, if they receive correspondence from these companies, they ought to dispatch it to the appropriate placenamely, the rubbish bin. Hellenic Republic: Social Security Agreement Cyprus",63
169,Mrs EASSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise to speak on the subject of the proposed social security agreement with the Hellenic Republic. These discussions between Greece and Australia have been going on for a few years and the government is to be congratulated for its serious and professional approach to this matter. The Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) and his officers should be recognised by the Australian community for the good work that they have done so far. With the social security agreements that have been negotiated with other European countries, financially the benefit has been to Australia. The situation with Greece will probably mean that Australia will be out of pocket-so be it. What we lose on the swings we gain on the roundabouts. As things now stand the Australian Department of Social Security pays about $60 million to about 8,000 pensioners in Greece. The payment of Greek pensions in Australia is quite small. These 8,000 pensioners all earned their money through a life time of work in Australia. It is not unusual for people to return in their retirement to their place of birth. Not all do this, not even most, but some do and we should not begrudge them. It appears to me that this imbalance will remain. I think that we should not worry too much about this matter. The relations between Greece and Australia are old and very settled. We have gained immeasurably from Greek migration and we have given them a marvellous land in which to live. The war sealed the bonds between us in blood. I do not think that we should always keep in mind these past bonds. We are a nation of people, Australia is not a proprietary limited company. Money must not be the sole decider of decisions. These 8,000 retirees who returned to Greece did not do so from a feeling of animus towards Australia. Quite the contrary, I have never met a Greek who is not a fierce loyalist to this land. The Greek people are certainly smart enough to know that we have built a great country here-with their help--and they are smart enough to know that they belong here. The psychology that affects some old people is not a reflection on their attitudes to Australia. We must be conscious of these matters and take these unknowns into account. I call upon the Greek government to make every effort to sign an agreement on social security with the Australian government. The continued delays only allow an element of uncertainty to exist in the minds of retirees in both Australia and Greece. This is not helpful. I recognise that our social security system is essentially residence based, and I see the administrative reasons for this. I have no problem with this. However, it should always be interpreted in a helpful manner. I also understand that, with or without an agreement, Australia will continue to meet its obligations to Greek-Australian residents and to those who have returned to live out their retirement in Greece. This notwithstanding, it is better if all these arrangements and agreements are incorporated in a formal social security agreement. The matter is causing a great deal of unease. I am constantly making representations to both the department and the Minister for Social Security. I am happy to do this because I know that relations between Australia and Greece, being as strong as they are, will not be damaged by the continued delays to which I have previously referred. I wish that these delays would end, and I am working to bring this about. I believe that both governments are working towards this-and both are working in good faith. I will be doing everything in my power to ensure that the Australian government facilitates its end of the bargain in signing this agreement. I would also ask that 1995 see the signing of this agreement to the mutual benefit of the citizens of both Australia and Greece. Another matter I would also raise is the grave situation in Cyprus. Cyprus as a member of the Commonwealth is now in its 21st year of division due to the illegal presence of the Turkish army in its northern part. The 1974 invasion of Cyprus by Turkey has never been recognised, and the Turkish republic of northern Cyprus is the Rhodesia of the Mediterranean. . Many Australian citizens lost their property in this 1974 invasion-that property being mainly real estate. The property remains intact and recoverable. I think that our Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Attorney-General's Department should realise the central position held by property in our society and activate themselves toÂ· protect Australian property which was illegally seized in 1974. At the moment there is no Australian financial assistance for Australian citizens who in 1974 were displaced from their property. One of the departments has said that at the international level the only way that the property question can be resolved is in the context of an overall political solution. This seems an especially hopeless piece of handwringing, and the matter in relation to Australia is very simple. Turkish officials have allowed the theft of Australian owned property, and this theft is ongoing and.must stop. I am not calling for the Turkish army to allow these Australian property owners to return to their property; this is a political matter. Australia has no political involvement in the Cyprus matter, nor should it have. What I am calling for is for Australian owned property to be in the control of a trust, established in Turkey and run by Australian officials from Ankara. My demand is connected purely to property and not politics. In recent months the climate of opinion has moved further against Turkey. The European Court of Human Rights, on 23 March 1995, ruled that Turkey is liable for human rights violation in the Turkish occupied northern part of the island of Cyprus. This decision follows on the heals of a decision made by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg in July 1994. This ruling established in law the complete illegality of the Turkish republic of northern Cyprus and declared that Turkey was the actual, although illegal, power in that territory. With these serious legal precedents established, Australia should take a stand, on behalf of its own citizens, on the principle of property rights. As a way of doing this, I call upon the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to consider giving financial assistance to a class action by Australian property owners in European courts to recover effective control of their property. Ire-emphasise that I am not involving myself in the politics of the matter. The solution is a TurkishEuropean one and does not involve Australia. My suggestion concerns court costs and Australian property. The government has a certain degree of responsibility to Australians outside of Australia. We cannot simply wash our hands of our own citizens when they go abroad-and I might point out that it is estimated that the property is worth in excess of $1 billion. We have not washed our hands of people, as has been demonstrated in the case of James Peng in China. Similarly, we must also stand by our citizens when Turkey is the offending party. I urge both ministers to carefully examine this suggestion. Cladribine Hepburn Football Club Raffle Older Unemployed Ballarat Enterprise and Employment FundÂ· Association Textile Industry",65
170,Mr RONALDSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Ballarat) (4.54 p.m.)I wish to grieve and make comment for a number of my constituents today. The first grievance I would bring to the attention of the House is of a constituent of mine who suffers from a rare and unusual form of leukemia-a disease potentially curable by the use of a drug called cladribine which has a treatment cost of some $4,500. The appalling situation is that in-patients in private hospitals are eligible for an authority to prescribe, with cost largely being met as a general pharmaceutical benefits item. If ever you do not have private health insurance, which is the case with my constituent, then the only amount available to you if treated in a public hospital-that is, under casemix fee-is about $600. Mr Cleeland-Ahl Liberal policy.",67
171,Mr RONALDSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I would not be too cocky, if I were you, my friend, because this is a fight between the Commonwealth and the state. Because of the large gap between the casemix fee and the drug cost, prescribing doctors in Victorian hospitals have been denied the use of this drug for patients urgently in need of it. Also, treating doctors have been encouraged to write PBS prescriptions which can be filled by outside pharmacies-a procedure that may breach the Medicare agreement. You talk about the state government. Indeed, your government will pay for it if you are treated in a private hospital. But if you do not have the money to take out private health insurance, then you do not have access to it. So I suggest that you listen and learn before you make ignorant comments such as that.",67
172,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member for Ballarat will address his remarks through the chair, and the honourable member for MCEwen will cease interjecting.",67
173,Mr RONALDSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. This is a matter that should be of great concern to all members, not just me. My constituent's treating doctor, Dr Richard Bell, has quite rightly said that doctors feel it is iniquitous and unjust that the Commonwealth will pay for these medications via the authority prescription mechanism in one circumstance-that is, in a non-public hospital setting-but that no adequate provisions are made for public hospitals and their patients in the same clinical circumstances. So if you are in a public hospital, you will get $600 out of $4,500 back. If your doctor is prepared to break the law and prescribe the purchase of the drug from outside sources via the pharmacies, then you can get it-but the the doctor is then at risk. However, if you can afford private health insurance, you c-m go into a private hospital and get that treatment. Surely-and I put this on behalf of all members and all people who have this disease, which is curable--common sense must prevail between the Commonwealth and the state in relation to the amount of refund that can be obtained by people with this disease. It is a horrible disease but it can be cured, although it seems to depend on your means as to whether or not you can get access to it. I would also bring a matter to the attention of the House relating to-and the honourable member with whom I previously had a discussion will be aware of this area-Hepburn, a new part of my electorate. An extraordinarily hard working group had a raffle-and I am sure honourable members will be amazed at this-which was the largest raffle I think of any footy club in Australia where 2,000 tickets were sold at $200 per ticket. They were oversubscribed and actually had to send 200 tickets back. This small group of about five people sold tickets all over Australia. Really, it was a stunning performance. For those of you who are mechanically minded, the first prize was a Kenworth T900 valued at $233,500, the second prize was a Harley Davidson motorcycle valued at $25,000, and the third prize was $10,000 worth of petrol. So it really was an extraordinary performance. Mr Bilney-I hope you'll encourage them to join the Labor Party; we need raffle ticket sellers.",67
174,Mr RONALDSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I suspect that we all perhaps need help like that. In any event, they certainly sold these tickets. The greatest problem from the Victorian point of view was that all the prize winners were from outside Victoria. I pass on my congratulations to Alex Glass, Adrian Trevorrow and the group of about five or six who worked extraordinarily hard. I would also grieve today on behalf of my constituent Mrs Dorothy MCKenzie of Greendale. A letter which she sent to me states: In May 1993 I flew to England with Travellers Cheques and a Mastercard issued by the Commonwealth Bank with $2,000 bank credit and an extra credit balance to cover two months expenses. My original Mastercard was stolen and a replacetrying ment card arranged in France. No misuse of my card had been made and my credit account was intact. The Commonwealth Card Service Centre in Sth Melbourne stopped my account leaving me in Europe with no access to my account despite two attempts to reinstate the Mastercard system. On advice from Commonwealth Bank to my home I returned. I followed this problem through to the Ombudsman who condoned the action because my money was safe in Australia. I had no claim for reinstatement of my lost flight and travel plans. My reason for travelling was unfulfilled due to the forced return to Australia one month earlier than originally planned. The way the law seems to be structured makes the banking industry a closed organization controlled by a bank appointed Ombudsman with limited responsibilities. Mrs MCKenzie was extremely aggrieved at the actions of the Commonwealth Bank in cancelling her second Mastercard without any reason at all, which forced her return in Australia. She has not in any way been adequately compensated for her wrecked holiday. In my view, the Ombudsman and the Commonwealth Bank need to do a lot more than offer her $500 recompense for her wrecked holiday. Her husband was due to join her and did not. I would also like to grieve on behalf of the older unemployed in my electorate. I will read a letter from a constituent, Mr Glenn Baker of Snake Valley: Dear Michael, I am forwarding a copy of a letter I sent to Simon Crean on the subject of unemployment, this concerns the older unemployed which don't seem to rate much of a mention. Most older unemployed people have been very responsible in their working lives and managed to pay off houses and also bring the next Generation into this world and through no fault of their own and work reform have found themselves thrown out of work. What I am trying to point out is most of us have been out of work for three years or more and can no longer afford to keep our properties due to the many increases in rates, power, gas, water and all the other basic things like food, petrol. The most hurtful part of this is that we have been totally ignored by everyone, and even get told you're too old, I am sick of this, I have applied for over Five Hundred jobs which is no mean feat to compete with younger people. Coupled with all this I reached the point of suicide, but nothing has changed, my house is up for sale so that I can buy a cheaper house up country in some run down town, you must realise this by just seeing all the houses up for sale in BALLARAT and the outer towns. I appeal to you to put our plight to the house in Canberra and try and get older unemployed people the same Benefits and Discounts as people on a Pension. We have a moral right to be treated with respect after giving years of Faithful service Private Sector and paying many years .of Tax to the Political running of this Country. I'll bet no Canberra is living like the many thousands of us Yours faithfully, Glenn BakerI am pleased to say that a large number of groups in Ballarat are now meeting the needs of the younger and older unemployed. One of those groups is the Forty Plus Group. I know that Mr Baker has been in touch with threpresentatives of those groups. I am sure is aware of the great work they are doing. While I am speaking on this subject, I would like to pay tribute to the Ballarat Enterprise and Employment Fund Association Inc., self-help group that it has been my great honour to be associated with from day one. I will read the opening paragraphs of a letter that has been sent out by the association to potential lenders: The mission of our Association is to initiate operate a Ballarat Enterprise and Employment to finance people in new and expanding enterprises, particularly those that will create local employment, but who have difficulty accessing normal commerAustralia cial finance . . . We are aware that <You> are very concerned about the problems of unemployment in Ballarat. We know, too, that you share our perception Ballarat both can and must find most solutions, and are therefore eager to facilitate practical, community driven initiatives. That is working. I am extremely pleased proud that the Ballarat community has taken it upon itself to be involved in self-help. I would also like to grieve for the textile based manufacturing industry in my electorate. Having written to the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, Senator Chris Schacht, I was horrified when he advised me as follows: Advice from the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs is that no Australian standards apply to the quality of rubber-backed productswhich is a specific query I had of him. The letter continues: The Australian Standard for Labelling of Clothing, Household Textiles and Furnishings sets out requirements for labelling with regard fibre content of textile products. The great tragedy is, as far as I can ascertain, that there are no Australian standards in place in the to check the quality of imported Chinese or other textiles. We have a terrific industry in one in this country which must be protected. I would have thought that at the very least the industry could have,Â· by way of protection, some standards for imported textiles and similar imports. If we do not do that, we cannot protect the industry. (Time expired) Serbian Community of Melbourne",68
175,Mr CLEELAND,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I he rise today on behalf of members of the Serbian community in Melbourne. Last week they forwarded to the Speaker's office a petition signed by a large number of their a community in Melbourne drawing their concerns to the attention of this House. Due to an error in the drafting of the petition, it was unable to be tabled in this House as a petition. So today, in the grievance debate, it is my intention to read to the House the and grievances of the Serbian community of Fund Victoria. The petition states: The petition of certain honourable citizens of draws to the attention of the House that Mr Franjo Tudjman, President of Croatia, has been invited to visit Australia during June 1995. As this House is well aware, the President of that Croatia, Mr Tudjman, arrived in this country of its own yesterday. It continues: The undersigned citizens object against Mr and Tudjman's visit because he: 1. Ordered and/or authorised the attack on the Western Slavonija region, including Jasenovac, on 1st and 2nd of May during which some 4000 fleeing Serbian refugees were massacred by Croatian ground and air forces. 2 Authored the book ""Wastelands: The Confusion of Historical Truth"" in which he repudiates the holocaust against the Jews and claims that the genocide carried out during WorId War II by the Croats against Serbs, Gypsies and Jews at the Jasenovac Death Camp (in Western Slavonija) was a myth contrary to historical truth. We can well understand the Serbian community in Victoria drawing the attention of this House to their concerns on the visit of Mr to care and Tudjman. The petition continues: Your petitioners therefore dutifully pray that: 1. the House refuses entry to Mr Franjo Tudjman into Australia; 2. the Australian Government uses its influence at the United Nations and all other internationdamage al forums and conventions to stop further Croat aggression against the Serbian people It refers to other similar matters. Whilst I would pray in this parliament that the Bosnian Serbs, the Serbs, the Croats and the Muslims of former Yugoslavia lay down their arms and meet around the negotiating table-and I would urge them to do that very quicklynevertheless, it is fair to say that, for many Australians of Serbian descent and for many Australians of Jewish descent and of Jewish persuasion, the book that was written by Mr Tudjman is offensive. I have read extracts of the book, and I personally find it offensive. The book does deny what is regarded by most people as historical fact. It does suggest that the great slaughter that occurred in what is now known as the Holocaust in what was then known as Yugoslavia in the Second World War was the fault of the Jewish people. I reject that totally as a human being and I reject it totally on the basis of the evidence I have read. I say that that which occurred in Jasenovac was murder, was slaughter, upon innocent people, be they Jewish, gypsy, Yugoslav or Russian. It was slaughter. It was not acceptable then; it is not acceptable now. I have great trouble with any person who tries to excuse in any way, shape or form by revisionist history the facts of that which occurred. On behalf of both the Jewish community and the Serbian community of Melbourne, I believe it is appropriate that those concerns be made in this House today. But, again, I would stress my own personal view: whilst I reject the revisionist history of the Holocaust by whomsoever may care to write such revisionism, I plead that in the former Yugoslavia the United Nations can, through its good graces, get to the negotiating table those people who see that the only resolution to political and social conflict is through the force of arms and that it can get them to stop using heavy weapons to slaughter innocent women and children, the aged, the infirm and the ill. Anyone who watches television and has seen hospitals in Sarajevo, as one example, where people are defenceless and where people Of goodwill are trying to repair the caused elsewhere, will be horrified and will bleed internally for the pain and suffering that many of these people are undergoing. I hope that the Croats, the Bosnian Muslims, the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs generally can very shortly, through the graces of the United Nations, resolve this great conflict. I am sure all in this House would join me in urging this course of action.",69

180,Mr SNOWDON,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (5.16 p.m.)-Prior to question time, I commenced my speech on this debate. I was discussing the observations of the French foreign minister which were reported in yesterday's Canberra Times. He said: There are two decisions, one to resume a few tests ... and a second [that] from May 1996 France will stop testing forever. He continued: I think the nations of the South Pacific, which have been asking for that for a very long time, should rather be rejoicing by saying that overall, the second decision is far more important than the first. I think that demonstrates the utter arrogance of the French government in dealing with this issue. It also shows the contempt which it has shown the nations of the South Pacificincluding Australia-in its proposals to continue to test nuclear weapons in the Pacific. It is worth reminding ourselves very briefly that these tests are repugnant for a range of reasons, not the least of which is their environmental impact. An article entitled 'Poisoned Pacific: The legacy of French nuclear testing' by Bengt Danielsson was published in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. It went into some detail about the issue of these tests. I suggest that, after reading this article, we would realise why the French are so opposed to having these tests on their home ground. The article reads: The full extent of the leakage of radionuclides into the ocean is unknown, mainly because technicians have been unwilling and unable to undertake studies at the depths where the explosions take place. It continues: Even more shocking, the French National Radiation Laboratory, which measures the radioactive pollution of the environment, the food, and the population in France, has never been allowed to send any experts to French Polynesia. What does that say about the safety or otherMotion wise of these particular tests? The article continues: There seems little doubt that leakage from the underground testing initiated in 1976 has lead to irradiation of the sea fauna around Momroa, and that many contaminated fish, shellfish, squids, and sea turtles have been consumed by the inhabitants of nearby islands. But a greater danger to the health of Pacific islanders in a more extended radius plutonium waste dispersed by typhoons. I do not think I need to explain the environmental problems that are caused by these nuclear tests in the PacifiC. The proposals by the French stand condemned. We just have to take our minds back to the Rainbow Warrior affair to remind ourselves of the' absolute contempt with which the French have treated opposition by South Pacific nations to these tests. These tests have been an absolute political disaster for the Polynesians who are most directly affected by them. It has meant the continuation of colonial regimes in the South Pacific by the French just so they could, at their pleasure, decide when, if, how and how often they might explode nuclear weapons. ",71
181,Mr SNOWDON,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"It is sick. It demonstrates very clearly why the parliament is required to show our concerns with a united voice directly to the French government. As I said earlier, this is the 50th anniversary of the bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. I go to the amendment being proposed by the opposition. I say to the opposition that, of the first two proposals before the House, it is very clear that, in large part, they are being carried out in any event. They are basically superfluous because the government is taking those appropriate actions. Then there is a proposal that we recall the ambassador. The opposition should understand that the ambassador will in all likelihood be returning to Australia next week in any event. So I am not quite sure what the purpose of recalling the ambassador would, be. In any event, I do not think at this point in time it is an appropriate response to the discussions we are seeking to have with the French government. The second last paragraph of the amendment states 'to show depth of Ollr concern . .. including action in the United Nations condemning French nuclear testing as a gross abuse of colonial power' ,and so on . .I' have no personal opposition to those proposals. In fact, they might well be the response' which is arrived at, after appropriate discussion and is the consultation with the South Pacific Forum leadershIp. That is,' after ali' what the 'Prime Minister has said the government is committed to doing. If, after the discussiQns 'with the French President this evening' in,Paris,it is clear that we need to have a further discussion with the South Pacific Forum leaders and that a further response is required, this might well be the nature of a response which would be appropriate at that time. But it is rather preemptive, given that the discussions with the French have not taken place. ' The opposition, unlike the government,and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), is, not in a position to know what the leadership of the South Pacific Forurn countries wants to do post the discussions with the French. Until we have those discussions with the French, it would be absolutely asinine and quite stupid, in my view, for us to proceed with this amendment. The final proposal is that we 'discuss with the USA the possibility of data sharing to remove the public French excuse for the tests'. Are we going'to say to the French that they must docer:tain things? How are we going to compel the French to undertake a sharing of information with the United States and vice versa? After all, if the United States were to provide open acce-s by the F-ench to their information, 'far from retarding the process of nuclear development in France it would in all likelihood enhance it, because the French would have more inforIllation than they likely have at the moment Whilst I can understand the intent, at least in terms of political opportunism, of the opposition for some of these amendments, the proposals are in fact either being undertaken by the government in some form or, alternatively, are prejudging the oiltcome of meetings which are about to be had and further discussions which the Prime Minister has already foreshadowed he will, have with the South Pacific Forum leaders .. Lastly, I think the proposal for data sharing is, as I said, rather absurd. I go to the political opportunism of the opposition. I conclude my brief address to this debate by just bringing to the public's attention the hypocritical cant coming from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the shadow minister for foreign affairs (Mr Downer). The South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty is based on the support of South Pacific countries. for the following broad principles. It is important that the public understands what they are. They state: (a) To be free to live in peace and independence and to run their own affairs in accordance the wishes and traditions of their people. (b) To enjoy peaceful social and economic development free from the threat of environmental pollution. (c) To acknowledge existing international treaties and organisations such as the Charter of the United Nations, the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea which contribute to these principles. (d) To act in accordance with applicable international principles and treaties, notably the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons with respect to nuclear activities and to take into account other regional arrangements. (e) To retain their unqualified sovereign rights to decide for themselves, consistent with their support for these principles, their security arrangements. Under its terms, the parties pledge to each other: (a) Not to possess, manufacture, or acquire nuclear explosive devices anywhere. (b) To prevent in their territory the testing of any nuclear explosive device and to prevent the stationing of any nuclear device in their territory. Understand that. It is very important. The treaty further states: (c) To take measures, including the application of full-scope International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards . . . (d) Not to dump radioactive waste and other radioactive matter at sea in the zone ... That is exactly what the French are doing. But what did the Leader of the Opposition say about that in this House in 1986? What did the present shadow minister for foreign affairs say about that at that time? The Leader of the Opposition said: We do not believe that that arrangement has made this part of the world a more peaceful or more secure one. We believe the Government has an overoptimistic view of the benefits . . . The present shadow minister said: I think that this legislation and this Treaty are an over-reaction to the French testing at Mururoa. That statement is quiteÂ· interesting because France's opposition to that testing was, we with believe, long focused on the question of nuclear tests. French statements and publications in the 1980s attacked the treaties of Raratonga as a political instrument designed first and foremost to put a stop to French nuclear testing in the Pacific. That is what we said. But what did the present shadow minister say? He said that too, but he ran the French line-not the line of the Australian community and not the line of the South Pacific. I think we should oppose the opposition's amendment. I would ask the opposition to come and support the proposals of the government. Let us ensure that there is a strong, uniform voice from this country to the French so that they fully appreciate and understand the importance of our feelings on this issue.",72
182,Mr RUDDOCK,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"I tell the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) that, of course, if after our amendment has been considered, the motion proposed by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is to be the subject of a vote, it will be the subject of a vote with the support of the opposition. That ha- been made clear. What I think is so disappointing in this debate is that the government is now indicating quite clearly that the amendment, which was intended as a helpful and constructive amendment, proposed by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), will be rejected in this parliament today with the government voting against each and every one of those additional propositions. I believe that approach of the government is fraught with difficulty for it and will be an approach condemned strongly in the eyes of the Australian public. I have not seen an issue which has galvanised in quite the same way the support of the Australian community as has the opposition to these particular tests. What the Australian public is striving for is not words in the form of platitudes which are mouthed merely to put a view to the French which they can easily reject but, rather, definitive steps taken by the government and the Australian people which will have an impact upon France and the French people. That, I think, is the overwhelming desire of the Australian community. I had a letter faxed to me by Sherry Stumm of Dangar Island, a very delightful centre, a very small place in the Hawkesbury River just north of Brooklyn. She is part of the Write-on Group and she wrote to me these lines. I would hope the member for the Northern Territory notes this. She says: This is not a time for party politics. It is, as John Howard said, a time for both houses of parliament and all parliamentarians to stand united against the arrogance and stupidity of the French. I want you to urge the government to do more than diplomatic representation. I think this is what is in the nature of the government's motion. She goes on: I have suggested to Mr Keating in a letter to him today that Australia with other South Pacific rim nations, urge their citizens to send a flotilla of every kind to support Greenpeace's Rainbow Warrior in the waters off Mururoa Atoll. We are a small nation and we can boycott French products, but all our actions are but a drop in the ocean. However we can win the PR war for world opinion by encouraging such a flotilla of craft to convene on the island to mark the anniversary of D Day. It would capture world attention, for it is a visual demonstration, is reminiscent of the defiance and courage of those in the D Day invasion when craft of every shape and kind took to the English Channel to liberate France and repel the Nazis. I think symbols such as unity, courage and as Martin Luther King and Gandhi were aware, giant mobilisations of peoples in opposition, can have a remarkable effect. I must say I regarded that as a positive and thoughtful contribution for people to note. But it seems to me that positive ideas, additional steps that might be taken beyond the mere bureaucratic jargon, are being simply put off by the government and government members as steps that are inappropriate. I find it extraordinary that the propositions by the Leader of the Opposition can be condemned by the government in the way in which the member for the Northern Territory, a parliamentary secretary, speaking for the government can suggest. The propositions were: that we join with New Zealand and suspend military cooperation with France, except for surveillance, United Nations and humanitarian activities; that we cease refuelling all French non-humanitarian military transit flights; that we recall the Australian ambassador to show the depth of our concern and to develop, in association with the South Pacific Forum, a regional plan of action to embarrass and, if possible, hinder French nuclear testing, including action in the United Nations condemning French nuclear testing as a gross abuse of colonial power and, along with similar tests by the People's Republic of China, as a gross violation of the world environment; and, finally, discuss with the United States the possibility of data sharing to remove the French excuse for tests. It was interesting when arguments were being mounted against each of those propositions that it was put in the context of awaiting of craft discussions between the foreign minister of France and the delegation that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) was leading there today. What the parliamentary secretary was suggesting was that all we had to do was to put off developing any further steps which might demonstrate some leadership on Australia's part to await some views that might be distilled through the use of the forum. In the words of the parliamentary secretary, it would depend upon the views of the forum as to whether or not we adopt those propositions. Is it not interesting that all we were seeking in the first paragraph was that we join with New Zealand, which is already arguing for the suspension of military cooperation with France? In relation to the refuelling of French nonhumanitarian military transit flights, what view of other countries would be relevant to our adopting that position? In fact I think most of the forum countries would be more than happy that we would deal with something within our own purview. In relation to recalling our ambassador, it was in the context that it would enable that dialogue with the South PacifiC Forum in which we would be able to get other views that would assist him. Recalling the Australian ambassador, it seems to me, is not a step that we need to wait for the South Pacific Forum to give us a clue as to what steps we should take. In relation to dialogue with the United States of America, again, it is a matter in which we are involved in data sharing and in which much of the South Pacific would not be likely to be involved. This idea that these matters can be put off the agenda until we get a steer from the South PacifiC Forum is just one further way of demonstrating that this government has lost touch with the views of the Australian community. The other matter I want to address in this debate today is the historical circumstances in which we are discussing this issue. It is very interesting that government members have been delving back into the past to try to find statements by opposition members upon which they can find some comfort for the views that they are adopting on this very issue. IÂ· have to say that going back to views of people in the 1980s to try to justify the government's position in the 1990s is of no relevance or consequence at all. As anyone who has studied world affairs would know, quite significant changes have occurred since many of those utterances were made. The fact is that that was a time in which we were involved in the so-called Cold WarMr Dodd-It was all right then, was it?",73
183,Mr RUDDOCK,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"in which the leading nuclear powersMr Dodd-It was all right then, was it?",75
184,Mr RUDDOCK,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"were still involved in activities which required the defence of a nuclear shield as it was argued, mutual deterrents. Mr Dodd interjecting",75
185,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,Mr Rocher)Order! Last time. The member for Leichhardt will come to order. That's a warning.,75
186,Mr RUDDOCK,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"---:-In that time there were quite different perceptions of the world then than there is today. The fact is that, when you have had the changed public opinion that has occurred in relation to nuclear weapons with the undertakings that both the United States and the Soviet Union have given to each other with the progressive disarmament that has taken place, you are in a much more , secure environment than you are now. So the very arguments which may have justified French nuclear testing and which may have justified a government giving the French some solace in relation to those efforts are of no currency today when the arguments that might have been advanced then had some validity. That is the very point that needs to be understood. It brings us to the point that needs to be asked: why is it that Australia, represented by Senator Gareth Evans as its foreign minister, is taking this approach of appeasement on this important issue? Why is it that Australia now has to be seen to be developing arguments on a matter that is of such importance to Australia and its people as well as to the people of the South PacifiC? When you look at our record, on a whole host of issues today you can understand what Senator Gareth Evans is involved in. He wants to keep his options open in relation to his walk on the international stage. As we have been walking away from our long standing and I think properly critical approach of many country's human rights records, Senator Gareth Evans has now been saying, 'Wait. Think about how these matters might affect our ability to be elected as a member of the Security Council,' and, 'Wait. Think about how Australia is going to be seen by some of the countries in our own region if we take a vigorous and critiCal approach to, say, the issue of East Timor.' That is a matter which many government members feel quite strongly about. I would have to say to government members that if you have some concern about Australia's reputation in the world, if you have some concern about the way in which we are seen on issues relating to human rights, if you have some concern as to the way in which we are seen on this particular issue of French nuclear testing, you would be prepared to put Australia and Australia's. interests before the interests of the foreign minister and his walk on the international stage. The government would need to put bipartisanship, Australia's interests before Senator Evans's possible appointment, at some stage in the future, to a senior administrative role in United Nations. We all know his barely for concealed ambitions in that direction. It is so clear, is it not, that, when he has to comment on these matters, he does so now as one who would have to represent wider interests, particularly the wider interests of western Europe, and particularly those of the French, who find it convenient to test nuclear opposed weapons in somebody else's backyard, even though they claim it to be a rather than in provincial France itself. The Australian public has good reason to be angry about this matter and about its governis ment, which, in terms of this motion, one that has our support for all that it says, is prepared to adopt in a bipartisan way the amendment proposed by the opposition that would give the motion teeth and ensure that the French are aware that there are conseam quences of their taking this decision, and consequences as far as France's concerned.",75
187,Mr DODD,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"I support the motion before the House which has been moved by the Prime. Minister (Mr Keating). The government will be voting against the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). I think the government has made it clear that, in voting against the amendment moved by the opposition leader, we are not saying that some of the matters that are put in that amendment will never be considered by Australia. Far from it. The government is saying that some of the suggestions in the amendment are premature. Given the fact that today the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), with the delegation from the South Pacific Forum, is going to see President Chirac, and although President Chirac has indicated in the media that he is not willing to bend, it would be premature to take some of the actions that the opposition is suggesting. I think it is very sad that we have seen recently a turning away from the bipartisan attitude in this House to foreign affairs, but it is pleasing that there has been a return to because it does seem that the coalition now supports the South Pacific nuclear-free zone treaty-at least for France; the we are not quite sure whether it supports it Australia. That is the natural implication. The honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) seemed to be saying in his speech that it was all right for France to detonate and test nuclear weapons in the Cold War and that now things have changed. I can assure him that the Australian Labor Party has always the testing of nuclear weapons in the Pacific by France, both underground tests and part of France, atmospheric tests. The honourable member for Berowra talked about the need for definitive steps. I think it true to say that that is what the Australian people are calling for. I certainly think that not the government-me and other members of the government-will be calling for other steps if Senator Evans's diplomatic ventures in Paris come to nothing. But at this stage I not sure whether this mishmash amendment means anything like 'definitive steps'. interests are The amendment says: Join with New Zealand and suspend military cooperation with France; except for surveillance, United Nations and humanitarian activities ... I think there is little else Australia does in cooperation with France. The only possible suggestion of what I would call a definitive step is the paragraph of the amendment which says: . . . and if possible hinder French nuclear testing I do not know whether this is the gunboat of the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), but that is the only definitive step suggested there. I am not sure whether that is an appropriate course to take either. The Prime Minister's motion accurately reflects the outrage that the Australian population feels at France's decision. There is no doubt that there is outrage felt in the Australian population and there is no doubt about the comments that have been made by previous participants in this debate-the fact that France, although it says the tests are safe, refuses to test in metropolitan France and the sheer arrogance of testing, in what amounts to colonies, with total disregard for the indigenous population. All these things have been said and will continue to be said in this debate. They have to be said. The purpose of this motion is to condemn the French government. I represent the electorate of Leichhardt in Far North Queensland. Although this issue is, of course, of concern not only to all Australians but to all people in the South Pacificand, I hope, in the world community-it is of particular concern to people in Cairns in my electorate in Far North Queensland. It is well worth remembering that during the period in which France conducted its atmospheric nuclear tests Australia maintained a comprehensive program for monitoring radioactive fallout resulting from the tests. I realise in saying this that the currently suggested tests are underground tests but I think this is still relevant. The fallout monitoring program included measurements of concentration of iodine 131 in the nine major Australian milk suppliers to establish average internal radiation from iodine 131 to the thyroid for those consuming fresh milk in Australia. Here I quote from the Australian government submission to the International Court of Justice. It said: The French nuclear tests from 1966 to 1972 have resulted in increased radiation doses to the Australleaders-not Ian population, both externally from fallout depositPacific ed underground and internally from the consumption of milk and other foodstuffs contaminated by iodine 131, caesium 137, strontium 90, carbon 14 and tritium. In that period concentrations of iodine 131 were measured in milk supplies in a figure called picocurie days per litre. That is very significant. Malanda, which is not in my electorate but is near my electorate on the Atherton tableland, supplies milk to a lot of northern Australia-not only to North Queensland but also to the Northern Territory. The Malanda figures-and I give them in picocuries-were as follows: in 1966, 11,000; 1967, 10,360; 1968,4,540; 1970,5,790; 1971, 5,390; 1972, 170. Those figures alone are alarming, and the whole of Australia's figures were alarming. I will give the same figures very briefly for Hobart. They were 1,500, 380, 790, 860, 350, and 0 in the last year. Even in Brisbane the figures were 4,600, 940, 2,250, 13,020 and 1,360. In terms of the effect on contamination of milk, it is very clear that the north of Australia suffered more from those nuclear tests than did the rest of Australia. If you draw a line directly from Cairns into the Pacific, straight across the Pacific, you come to French Polynesia. Obviously the north of Australia is very concerned about the resumption of tests by the French in French Polynesia. In my electorate of Leichhardt there is a great concern about these issues. In Far North Queensland we also understand very well even minor effects on coral reefs, so one could imagine what effect underground nuclear tests would have. In conclusion, I urge the House to support the Prime Minister's motion. I know my electorate in Far North Queensland will be voicing its opinion in many ways. I will be addressing a rally, which I am helping to organise, on Sunday in Cairns because of the importance of this issue. I urge that the House accept the motion of the Prime Minister and reject the amendment by the coalition, not because it does not contain measures that might be necessary in the future but because it is premature and it really does not address the current issues. Give the negotiations in Paris a chance and give the South Pacific only Senator Evans but the other leaders-in Paris a chance to convince France because that is really our only hope. I urge the House to adopt the motion of the Prime Minister.",76
188,Mr CONNOLLY,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"Bradfield) (5.51 p.m.)The debate we are having today is one which does unite the House, although there is a degree of disunity on the question of whether or not the government has taken the necessary action and whether the action it has taken is strong enough to make it quite clear internationally, and certainly in the context of Australia's bilateral relations with France, we abhor in every respect the actions of new French President in announcing the with resumption of nuclear tests at Mururoa in the Pacific. Australia's relations with France, going back to at least the 1970s, have been constantly marred by the whole question of nuclear testing in the Pacific region. In at its first meeting the South Pacific Forum issued a strong statement against French deposit nuclear testing. It is inappropriate, therefore, this year when Australia is the president the South Pacific Forum, that the French government has once again determined, entirely in its own unilateral interests, recommence nuclear testing in the Pacific. The reason circumstances are different today from what they were in the past-and this point was totally ignored by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in response to queslations tions today-is that, previously, the world was divided between East and West in what was known as the Cold War. In that context successive French governments, to support their policy of a force de frappe, which them an independent nuclear capability, insisted on their right and their need to conduct a series of atomic tests in the Pacific and, earlier than that, in the Sahara. Circumstances in recent years have fundanence mentally changed. The Cold War is of the past. What we are looking at today is a new world environment in which it is hoped that there is simply no need for any nation, be it France or China, to resume nuclear testing as a means of ensuring its security. Today we are as concerned about maintaining an envian ronment for collective security as we had during the 1950s, through to the 1990s, when, in the western European context, NATO was the organisation to which all Western nations were associated as a means of ensuring their long-term physical and political security. Since 1971, Australia's relations with France have been constantly marred by the ever present spectre of French nuclear testing. On 9 May 1973, Australia and New Zealand instituted proceedings against France in the International Court of Justice in connection with the French nuclear tests in the Pacific that region. I recall those details very clearly the because here in Canberra I was associated briefing the Australian delegation to the Atoll ICJ on how it should handle those very important discussions. The important thing is that the International Court of Justice in its judgment of June of the same year ordered that, pending its final decision in the case 1971 submitted to it in May, the French government should avoid nuclear tests causing the of radioactive fallout on the territory of Australia, New Zealand, the Cook Islands, of Niue or the Tokelau Islands. There is now one fundamental difference. At that stage we were talking about atmosto pheric tests; today we are talking about underground tests. Let there be no mistake about the fact that any tests, whether they be underground or in the atmosphere, carry with them a considerable health risk for the popuwithin the vicinity of those tests. It is no secret that the islander people of the west Pacific, who for generations have depended upon the sea as their source of food, are now effectively prevented from so doing. There is gave no doubting the fact that we have seen in Australia alone, according to the AMA, a potential for an increase in cancer as a result of nuclear testing in the South Pacific. The level of iodine 131 found in milk supplies and so forth, which came to international promia few years ago with the Chernobyl disaster in Russia, demonstrates the reality that it is so difficult to hermetically seal off any nuclear testing in any part of the world. The proposition now put to us by the new French government of President Chirac is that additional eight tests are necessary, presumably to enable the French to test a new warhead, are eight tests we do not need for world security, are eight tests that, frankly, France does not need for its security, and are eight tests which no-one in the South Pacific needs for our health or for the sovereignty of our nations. The important thing we have to consider in this whole issue is that we as pro-Australians are not anti-French. We in this parliament are united in our determination to be against the specific policy of the current French government. But let me make it absolutely clear that no-one in this parliament should support the burning of French consulates, the destruction of French property and the attacking of Franco-Australian citizens in any respect. Regrettably, in recent weeks-and I think to some degree egged on by elements of the media-there has been a tendency for somewhat extravagant language to be used in this matter. The fundamental fact is that President Chirac has determined a policy which we should have been aware of well before the event, because history teaches us that when Chirac was previously Prime Minister in earlier French governments the relationship between France and Australia was difficult for two reasons-firstly, because of our involvement in the determination that over time the French territories in the Pacific should be independentMr Lee-Especially, when he was Prime Minister.",77
189,Mr CONNOLLY,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"Certainly, Prime Minister Chirac found that most odious; the second reason being this whole question of French nuclear testing again in the Pacific. So let there be no doubt at all that the government of Australia, the Keating government, was well aware or should have been well aware of the implications of a new French government led by President Chirac. Mr Lee-Conservative.",79
190,Mr CONNOLLY,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"Conservative or Gaullist, as you say. The question which we have been asking is: has this government acted responsibly in that context? The questions asked today by the shadow minister for foreign affairs, the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), of the Prime Minister were pertinent. 'Why is it that the department of foreign affairs,' he asked, 'has been so slow at initiatyear ing the necessary policy work to determine what the implications for Australia would be with the election of a Chirac presidency? What action was taken by the foreign minister ahead of the act to try to head off the French policy change?' Everybody who has examined this issue over recent years would know that there was a high probability that President Chirac's government would go back to the policy it has enunciated previously; that is, the right of the French government to develop an independent nuclear capability as the underpinning of its force de frappe approach to defence. We need to understand that France's relationship with NATO, although it is a member, is fundamentally different from the relationship of all other members. While France accepts to a degree the concept of collective security, it believes that it has the right to defend its own sovereignty in the context of its defence policy. There is no question in this particular case that it has been prepared to go it alone, regardless of what anybody thinks. What we in the opposition find most unfortunate and unacceptable is the general attitudinal change we have seen in the government's position over recent years. For example, in 1984 the then foreign minister, now the Governor General, Mr Hayden, in a press release made this point: . .. he had reaffirmed the Government's view that while the environmental and health effects of nuclear testing were important, the Government's dominant concern was that nuclear testing should not take place by any state in any environment. That was his response to the report carried out following an inspection of Mururoa Atoll in that year. The press release also states: . .. while he found reassuring the Report's conclusion that the levels of radioactive fallout were relatively low and that these levels do not lead to any expectation that radiation-induced diseases will be detectable, he was concerned at the Report's conclusion that leakage could occur from the detonation chambers in the long term and that the structural integrity of the coral limestones on the upper section of Mururoa Atoll had already been impaired. That was back in 1984 and here we are, 11 later, in 1995, being told that a further eight explosions are necessary to ensure France's defence integrity in terms of its atomic weapons. Nobody can guarantee us that the physiological integrity of those reefs will withstand another eight explosions. Nobody can assure the people living on those Pacific islands-New Zealanders, Australians or anybody else in the south-west Pacificthat our long-term health will not to one degree or another be impaired by a further eight nuclear explosions. This is what concerns us. We are concerned that the attitude that has been adopted by this government and the foreign minister has been less than forthright in making it absolutely clear to the French authorities that as a sovereign independent nation, as the current leader of the South Pacific Forum, Australia not only has a right but has a fundamental responsibility to make sure that every possible opportunity before the event-not after the event; it is too late then-is taken by the government to emphasise to the French authorities that we do not accept and we will not accept their attitude. President Chirac claimed during the week that people were complaining that these explosions are not taking place in France. But they are, he said, because the islands of the South Pacific are French territory; ergo, they are part of France. That is a bit of Descartian logic that I think some would find rather quaint in today's world. The factÂ·of the matter is that the Pacific is the other end of the from Paris. Frankly, too few people really care. We live here in the Pacific. Those islanders are looking to us for some support at this time. That is why the amendment that has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) is particularly pertinent in this debate. We have asked that 'Australia join with New Zealand in the suspension of military cooperation with France; except for surveillance, United Nations and humanitarian activities'. We have asked that the refuelling of all French non-humanitarian military transit flights to Mururoa Atoll or to the French possessions in the Pacific be curtailed. We have asked for the recalling of the Australian ambassador 'to show the depth of our concern, and to develop in association with the South Pacific Forum a Regional plan of action to embarrass and if possible hinder French nuclear testing'. The reaction of the Keating government has been that this is all over the top, all too extreme. But, surely, this government should realise that public opinion in today's world is a very significant weapon. It is not good enough just making speeches. It is not good enough just sending your foreign minister across to Paris whenÂ· he has gone under duress. The comments he made in Tokyo last week were not the comments of a foreign minister who was genuinely concerned about the issue, and they were certainly not the comments of a foreign minister concerned about how the Australian people saw what was happening in their part of the world. Unfortunately, therefore, we have had to move this amendment because we believe it is of particular importance at this stage that the Australian people have confidence in their government and that every possible step be taken to emphasise to the French authorities in Paris our genuine concern. (Time expired)",79
191,Mr CHYNOWETH,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"I welcome the support of the opposition on this particular motion, but it brings a bit of a wry smile to my lips. In listening to the cant and hypocrisy that has been uttered so far in this debate, I am really shocked and cannot believe what members of the opposiearth tion are saying. In going back and looking over the contributions these people have made to stopping the nuclear issue throughout the world, I have come to the conclusion that I do not think they have ever made any contribution to it. I asked my staff to go through records on the computer to find out how many times I had spoken on this, the nuclear, issue. They came up with 33 pages of speeches I had made since 1983. Mr Lee-All of high quality.",80
192,Mr CHYNOWETH,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"Yes; definitely high quality. Maybe some speakers from the opposition might be able to go through the list of times they have made a contribution to the nuclear debate. I doubt whether they would get to half of what I have done. Their hypocrisy is just amazing. We have Johnnycome-lately standing up there waving the flag for the Liberal Party and saying, 'We'll stop the French. We'll send in the gunboats.' Those opposite have never done anything in the past; they are not going to do anything in the future. All they do is just stand up and try to jump on a popular issue. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was right when he said it is a poll-driven issue for the Liberal Party. I can just see what those opposite intend to do at the next election: any time an issue comes up that looks popular, they will be all for it. They are liable to go around each electorate saying, 'We'll build this here. We'll build a post office here. We'll do this and we'll do that.' That will be all we will hear from them. This is just another election ploy. In all the times that I have marched up and down Bourke Street outside Parliament House, I have never seen a Liberal member. I do not think there has been a Liberal in one of those marches .dating back to the mid1970s, which is when I first started marching. I cannot say I have ever seen one, and here they are supporting this stand against the French. I would like to know whether any member opposite has ever marched up and down Bourke Street protesting against the nuclear issue. I am the founding member of People for Nuclear Disarmament, Frankston branch. I would like to know how many on the other side have ever taken a stand and joined an organisation to stop nuclear proliferation. A firm that I was a partner in was called CND Industries. It was not called CND Industries for any particular reason except that it was the initials of me and my neighbour and it also meant 'campaign for nuclear disarmament'. I flogged it around all over Melbourne when I was selling office equipment. This was many years ago-in the 1970s. I was quite pleased that I was subtly getting across this message. The Prime Minister, in answer to a question, discussed what is happening with Jeffrey Kennett in Victoria and the sale of the SEC. The French equivalent of the SEC has a debt of $30 billion. I do not know what we are going to do with our SEC, but Jeffrey will probably flog it off to them because he needs the money. I cannot recall anyone on the other side talking about what happened when the Rainbow Warrior was sunk. I cannot remember any of them supporting Greenpeace and saying that it was a shame that the French actually killed a person on that ship. I believe Chirac was a minister at the time when the FrenchMrs Bishop- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The statement just made by the honourable member was a reflection on members of the opposition, somehow saying that we condoned the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior in New Zealand and killing people, which clearly we did not. I would like the imputation withdrawn. Mr Lee- Mr Deputy Speaker, on the point of order. The words the honourable member used were that he could not remember any opposition members criticising the French actions. He did not make the statements attributed to him by the shadow minister.",80
193,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,I did not hear the words actually said by the member for Dunkley because I was discussing something with the clerk.,81
194,Mr CHYNOWETH,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,What the minister said was correct. I said that I had not heard anyone from the opposition actually speak against the French who killed the photographer on the Rainbow Warrior.,81
195,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,There is no point of order.,81
196,Mr CHYNOWETH,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"I have never heard anyone of them actually come out and condemn Chirac, who I believe was the minister who actually let the killers of that French photographer go. I am still waiting to hear whether that is true, but that is what I believe. Chirac is also a member of the Gaullist Party. The Gaullist Party is a conservative party which I believe is similar to the Liberal Party. The idea of nuclear testing has only reappeared since the new President was installed. Under former Socialist President Mitterrand this never happened; he stopped it. Mitterrand's party is closer to the Labor Party. I am sorry for the French people that they have to put up with such an arrogant government. I have been to New Caledonia in the last couple of years and I was pleased to see what was happening there under the Matignon accords. I was pleased to see the KanaksÂ· of New Caledonia getting a better deal. I am afraid that if this new government is going to undertake nuclear testing at Mururoa Atoll, the independence that was gradually coming to the Kanaks of New Caledonia will be taken away. The Chirac government should be condemned. I believe that as a nation we should take the strongest possible stand against it. I will be making certain that I do everything I possibly can to put across the Australian government's point of view.",81
197,Mr REID,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"I commence my remarks by saying that I agree with the motion set out by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) today. I also support the addendum in the amendment put forward by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). I want also to strongly associate myself with the comments made by the Leader of the Opposition in the House today about the condemnation of the act of wilful destruction that occurred in Perth over the weekend. It was an abhorrent, un-Australian act and one which was calculated to bring to this debate an element that all of us would wish to be kept out. I also want to comment on the French government's decision to hold these tests. I believe the French government should reverse its decision. I condemn the testing in the Pacific, and many French people also disagree with the decision that has been made by the French government. Let us be absolutely clear that this is a French government decision. We should not blame the French people for the decision. If we did that, it would be a bit blaming the people of Canberra for the deceit and broken promises of the Keating government. Blame should not be apportioned to the French people in to to. Australian people are very well respected in France. In fact, the sacrifices of Australians in defence of France have very few parallels in history. If there is one country to which we do have a right to express unapologetic and frank terms of anger, condemnation and contempt for the behaviour of its government, it is France. But in doing that I emphasise that the argument is with the political decision of the French government. I share to the full the Prime Minister's concern that there not be general anger directed at ordinary French people or at Australians of French descent living in this country. The sweeping, broad statements that have been made condemning French people are quite inappropriate. However, their government must be made and held accountable for that decision. I want to make note of a comment made by the Australian junior foreign minister, as he was referred to, the Minister for DeVelopment Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney), in my local paper, the Bendigo Advertiser, on Monday 19 June. The minister said: I think the pressure is building up and I would certainly not discount the possibility that we may be able to modify the French stance in some way. That statement is quite different from the outof-touch, weak and pathetic response of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans. The response of Senator Evans was totally inadequate. He did not express the legitimate anger of the Australian people or, in fact, the Bendigo people whom he purports to represent. He is a senator for the whole of Victoria and has an office in the Bendigo area. From comments I have received I can assure honourable members that people in the Bendigo electorate are absolutely outraged at the decision by the French government. They have contacted me to call for a reversal of that decision and condemn further nuclear testing in the Pacific. I was impressed with the comments made by the Leader of the Opposition when he like indicated that he would move amendments, to be put to the Australian parliament, and call for Australia, New Zealand and all Pacific nations, including Nauru, Western Samoa and Papua New Guinea, to register their disapproval and condemnation of further testing in the Pacific by the French government. I want to comment on the addendum which has been proposed by the Leader of the Opposition. The opposition believes that a number of additional steps ought to be taken by the government to add to the motion presently before the House. We propose that there be an addendum to the motion containing the following: first, that we join with New Zealand and suspend military cooperation with France, except for surveillance, United Nations and humanitarian activities; second, that we cease the refuelling of all French nonhumanitarian military transit flights; third, that we recall the Australian Ambassador to show our depth of concern; and, fourth, that we develop, in association with the South Pacific Forum, a regional plan of action to embarrass and, if possible, hinder French nuclear testing, including action in the United Nations. That should strike a chord with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is aspiring to some position in the United Nations at some time. I believe that action in the United Nations condemning French nuclear testing as a gross abuse of colonial power and as a gross violation of the world environment should be followed up by the government. The final part of our addendum is that we will discuss with the United States the possibility of data sharing to remove the public French excuse for these nuclear tests which they are proposing to continue in the Pacific. I urge the government to give an indication to the coalition as to why it is not possible to attach these additional proposals to the motion that has been put before the House by the Prime Minister. I believe that the motion on French nuclear testing which the Prime Minister has put forward is very fitting, particularly the first two items which are very strong. Firstly, he condemns the decision of the government of France to resume nuclear testing in the South Pacific and, secondly, calls on the French government to reverse its decision to resume testing. But the motion put forward by the Prime Minister does not go nearly far enough in registering the extreme anger felt by the Australian people and people throughout the Pacific region. With the strength of all of those I have mentioned-New Zealand, Nauru, Western Samoa and Papua New Guineapeople in that Pacific area should band together with the coalition in registering their support for the addendum which has been put forward by the coalition which would strengthen the motion that has been put before the House by the Prime Minister. There should be absolutely no reason why members of the government party on the other side of the House should not support the addendum in the amendment being put forward by the Leader of the Opposition. I was appalled at the actions that took place over the weekend. I know that every member of my party believes that it is abhorrent behaviour in Australia and is something which we do not require in Australia at all. The further amendment and additions to this motion, which have been put forward by the Leader of the Opposition, will strengthen and portray the will of and the anger being felt by Australian people as a result of the French government's decision to do additional nuclear testing in the Pacific.",82
198,Mr HORNE,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"The decision by the French President to resume underground nuclear weapons testing on Mururoa Atoll is one that is abhorred by the vast majority of Australians. From my contact with French people in Australia, and representatives of French companies in Australia, I understand that the unilateral decision by the French President is also abhorred by the majority of French people, particularly the young who have a far greater reason to fear nuclear fallout than we do here in Australia. Living in a country that possesses a nuclear arsenal would not provide one with a feeling of comfort or of peace. It is unfortunate today that the opposition has elected to attempt to score cheap political points by demanding an extreme, knee-jerk reaction to a country that has shown itself to be a good ally, an honourable trading partner and a firm friend in peace and war. We should not overlook the fact that it was France that led the world in 1993 when it called a voluntary halt to nuclear testing, and that showed the way to the United States and nations that to the Soviet republic. Surely it is our duty as fellow global citizens to remind the people of France that we are their friends. We understand the pride that they must have felt in 1993 when their government broke new ground and called a halt to nuclear testing. We should remind them that their dogmatic and autocratic President has made an incorrect decision. Since we were advised of this immoral decision last week, I have made contact with many people and urged them to respond in a reasonable way. I have written to all of the schools in my electorate and asked them to select a school in France. I have asked them to try to pick a locality that is very much the same as their own so the children of that school can compose and send letters to their colleagues in France. They can remind them of our history of friendship and cooperation, of our involvement in both world wars. They may even have the grandchildren or great grandchildren of Australian veterans who fought in France and perhaps even died there. They could remind the French children of that. We could remind them of the pride that we had in being able to send a naval ship to rescue their lone round-the-world sailor, Isabelle Autissier. We could ask them to show their revulsion at the decision of their PresiIn dent. I believe that the circuit breaker in whole of this is getting the French people to show that they also are responsible global citizens, and I believe they are. I have addressed the Trades Hall Council in Newcastle and asked them to contact the union leaders in France. France is a strong trade union nation. I have been contacted by Lions clubs because they are an international organisation. In Paris alone there are between 150 and 200 Lions clubs. I am sure they will respond. Rotary clubs also are an international organisation. All Rotary clubs in Australia should consider writing to Rotary clubs in France to remind them of our long history of association. I have even had an advertising agency give me a quote on placing a full page ad in Le Monde and Le Figaro. Because of the cost, we are now examining alternative methods of getting the feelings of Australian people understood by the citizens of France. After all, this is the year of tolerance. We should appeal to the French to tolerate our position, our feelings. I certainly have not heard a lot of statements of tolerance espoused by the opposition today, either tolerance of the French or tolerance of the government. Let us compare the actions of this government with those of the opposition. On this side, we have been entirely consistent in our efforts to get the French President to understand our point of view. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been entirely consistent, even before this decision was made, having made contact with the newÂ·President of France on two occasions to advise him of the feelings of Australian people on and their opposition to nuclear testing. This government has a strong history of opposing nuclear testing in the South Pacific and anywhere else. That is our strength. That is our point of consistency. Compare that with the position of the opposition. Let us have a look at some of the things that some members of the opposition had to say last week. The shadow minister for foreign affairs, the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), said: addition, the Government should actively the consider the New Zealand proposal which would involve sending an Australian frigate into the region to protest and monitor the tests. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) said: I think at this stage, what the Government has done is appropriate. I think that the New Zealanders have said they're not going to send a frigate, not for the time being but I think it's one of those things, you've got to keep the situation under continuing review. It's not a question of saying on day one, everything that should or shouldn't be done. It's a question of keeping different things under review. Today must be his day one because the amendment he put today is certainly going to give all French people a feeling that suddenly Australians do not care for French people. I am sure that is not the feeling at all that any Australian wishes to convey. As I said at the start, I am convinced that the majority of French people find their President's decision as abhorrent as we do. In conclusion, let me just remind those opposite of a few other things. They might care to consider the response of the government of the country where our head of state resides. Its reaction has been to do nothing. As a matter of fact, the Prime Minister of Great Britain has said, 'Oh, I don't think we'll be too concerned about that.' There is no doubt that it is extremely unfortunate that the French have embarked on this decision. The way to resolve it is not by gunboat tactics or standover tactics. The President of France has already indicated that while he will allow foreign delegations to visit his country-he will even speak with themMrs Bishop-How generous!",83
199,Mr HORNE,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"I am sure the member for Mackellar would love to be there and speak with him too. Mrs Bishop-A lot more firmly than Senator Evans, that's for sure.",85
200,Mr HORNE,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"I am sure. I am sure the President of France would tell the member for Mackellar exactly what he has told the rest of the world leaders: 'I will listen but my decision is irrevocable.' I wonder whether he will say that to his own people if they tell him that his decision is not one of the majority French people. I am sure that is the path this government has to explore. I am sure it is the path the whole world has to explore. The secret is not in strong arm, hairy chested tactics; it is in convincing the French people that they must tell their own government that they will not tolerate the actions of their President.",85
201,Mr COBB,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"I would like to say at the outset that I support very strongly the motion that has been moved by the government and the amendment that has been moved by the coalition. I believe it would do the whole chamber well not only if the coalition recognised that it supported the government's motion but also if the government recognised that it supported the coalition's amendment and actually did something positive about the issue we are debating today. All Australians have found it very disappointing that at a time when the world has finally realised the absurdity, the immorality and the dangers of nuclear testing France has decided that it is going to have one more round of underground testing-I believe this series of eight tests will conclude in May year-before it will put its signature on the comprehensive test ban. If the French reflected on this, they would realise that this may give authority or licence to another country that may not necessarily be their friend, such as China or perhaps in the future Libya, to come forward and accelerate their nuclear arms race. That is the great danger of what France is doing. I believe the French proposal should be opposed on those grounds alone. What the French intend to do is an act of the utmost seriousness and it has quite rightly attracted the moral outrage of much of the world. I do not believe the French have good and valid reasons for this final round of underground nuclear testing. I appreciate that, unlike Australia, France was overrun and invaded in recent times, such as in World War I and World War II. As a result of that, the French have a deep nuclear culture behind them. But today they are not threatened by any country that I am aware of. In fact, they of are situated in one of the most stable military regions of the world. They are a member of NATO, as are the United States and Great Britain, which have a nuclear capacity. Having said that, I believe there has been a gross overreaction in Australia to some aspects of what has happened. Many people have worked themselves into a lather that to a large extent is unnecessary. The recent torching and burning down of the French consulate in Perth is absolutely deplorable. I understand it has been condemned by everybody in this chamber, and quite rightly so. In fact, the pollutants that would have gone out from burning that building would have done far more damage to Perth than any supposed fallout from the Mururoa underground nuclear tests. Other extravagant statements have also been made. I note one made the other day by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) when she said that there is good reason to be worried about health as a result of these tests. I do not know of any evidence whatsoever which supports that claim. I would like to speak about what these tests involve. They are to be carried out in the next Mururoa'Atoll, which is way out in the Pacific. It is not in any sense close to Australia. In fact, it is 6,900 kilometres from Australia. So it is certainly not in our backyard in that sense. It is a little closer to Chile, being 6,720 kilometres from its capital, Santiago. It is 6,560 kilometres from Los Angeles in the United States of America where these proposed tests have been given virtually no publicity at all. It is even 4,750 kilometres from New Zealand. This does not mean that it is right to conduct those tests, but they are a long way away. The Mururoa Atoll is a volcanic reef set amongst about 130 islands making up French Polynesia. The atoll is a partly submerged and extinct volcano. What we can see is the rim of the volcano. The lagoon in the middle is the water-filled crater and the bottom of the lagoon is the bottom of the volcanic crater. Over the years many underground tests have been held there, usually discharging a force of somewhere between 10and lOa-kiloton bomb equivalence. Hiroshima was about 12kiloton bomb equivalence. The underground tests take in letting off a nuclear explosion about a kilometre under the surface from a hole drilled through coral, dolomite and volcanic basalt.

202,Mr COBB,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"The table is very interesting. It clearly shows that nuclear tests were begun in 1945. The USA had three atmospheric tests.

Algeria before independence in 1962. Up to 1963, when the atmospheric test ban was signed, 571 tests in total had been carried out. The last underground test was conducted by China in 1993. I do not remember all that much outrage from the other side of the parliament or from this side, in fairness. In total something like 1,449 tests have been carried out in the world. If France continues with what it intends to do, there are only eight more to go. Let us all be thankful for that. Let us hope that if we cannot stop these final eight tests that will be the end of it once and for all. Of course, the atmospheric tests were by far the most damaging. Caesium 137 and strontium 90 in particular are contained in everyone of us here today due to previous atmospheric tests that were carried out. The levels are very low. It was said that by the time it blew over Australia the radiation dosage increase that we got was only equivalent to living an extra 100 feet above sea level. When you think that members fly to this parliament from Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth, they are increasing their exposure by about 20 times by doing that. However, that gives nobody the right to contaminate us at all, no matter to what extent. About half the extra radiation that we have in our bodies is as a result of what the French did in the Pacific in those days. Some of the radiation also comes from the United States and the USSR tests in the Northern Hemisphere. Some of it also comes from what the United Kingdom did at Maralinga, partly at our request, and from what the Chinese did in the past. Atmospheric tests carried out by the French at Mururoa Atoll between 1966 and 1974 increased the radiation levels in Australia by 0.1 to 0.2 millisieverts. I remind the House that the natural occurring level of radiation that we receive every year is something like 10 to 20 times that. When wandering past the granite in Parliament House we are exposed to quite a substantial level of radiation. If you own a television set and sit quite close to it you get a level of radiation from that. We have to keep this in perspective. The average level of radiation increase amongst the people of the islands of Tureia and Gambia, which are near Mururoa, was only 0.75 millisieverts. It is interesting that when tests were done in Australia in 1975 on iodine 131, which goes into milk and ends up in our thyroid and could potentially cause cancer, they were unable to detect levels sufficient to cause an increase in cancer. The conclusion of the studies done in 1975 was that the tests at Mururoa would cause less than one additional cancer or genetic deformity. That was the finding of the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council. Nevertheless, that does not make those tests right. I think we should be grateful that everybody is uniting today to condemn a continuation of tests even if they are underground. Just because the levels are low is not an excuse to carry on with the tests. It does not make it right. Just as the pressure to ban atmospheric tests was correct the pressure to ban tests underground is correct. The sooner that message gets through to the French the better. This was started by Charles De Gaulle back in 1960 and was carried on by other presidents, such as Giscard d'Estaing and even the socialist President Mitterrand when he came to power in 1981. President Jacques Chirac will allow this to happen later in 1995 and 1996. I believe that not only Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific islands but also the rest of world, and in particular America, should come forward and voice their displeasure with what has happened. In the long run it will do the French cause no good at all and it will give the Chinese a great excuse to continue with their tests if they so wish. I believe it will bring the antipathy of the rest of the world upon France for what it is doing.",87
203,Mr ROBERT BROWN,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"There is no question that the people of the world have every right to be outraged by the decision of France to resume nuclear tests and break the moratorium which had been agreed by countries of the world. I do not want to say too much about the comments of the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), who preceded me in this debate, but I want to emphasise that, to a very large extent, his comments attempted to downplay the nature, importance and the danger of these tests. To compare, for example, questions of radiation associated with nuclear tests of this kind with radiation which might come from a television screen is fairly effective in destroying any credibility that claims of that kind might otherwise have. . I do not intend to go through all of the words of the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), which the government will be supporting. I want to refer to some expressions used in the motion to indicate whether or not the wording of the motion is sufficient to indicate the nature of outrage which Australia has and which this government feels. The motion uses the word 'condemns' and it says that we share the resentment of South Pacific countries. It also says that we deplore the decision of France alld it expresses the outrage of this House. I do .not know whether there is any stronger word a government can use than it is outraged by a particular matter which has offended it. That is the term which is used in that motion. I then come to the amendment which was moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). I suggest that that amendment is incoherent. I believe that that amendment is childish in what it expresses and what it purports to seek to do. I believe it is also opposition attempt to make some sort of bipartisan political gain. Mrs Bishop-What is wrong with that?",88
204,Mr ROBERT BROWN,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,Have you participated? The member for Warringah is the best snapper and snarler in this House. It would be much betterMrs Bishop-It's Mackellar.,89
205,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,Mr Andrew)Order! The member for Charlton has been in this House,89
206,Mr ROBERT BROWN,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,I suggest also that the member for Warringah might be encouraged to stop interjecting.,89
207,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"The member for Charlton knows better than to make suggestions about what I should do in terms of rulings in this House. I remind the member for Charlton that he not only has the call but also has the obligation to address his remarks through the chair. Mrs Bishop- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The honourable member speaking, with his disregard for being accurate, eVen gave me the wrong seat. I remind him that I am the member for Mackellar. The accuracy of his speech is mirrored by his inaccuracy with my seat.",89
208,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,There is no point of order. The member for Charlton has the call.,89
209,Mr ROBERT BROWN,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"That is typical of the attitude of the member for Mackellar in this chamber and in this parliament, as you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and everybody else knows. The amendment that was moved by the Leader of the Opposition was an attempt on the part of the opposition to simply secure some sort of partisan political advantage and the member for Mackellar has indicated that that is quite right. I am glad to have it confirmed by a person whose credibility is of such a high level. One of the propositions suggested in the amendment is that we recall the Australian ambassador. The absurdity of that has already been indicated by other members of the an government who have spoken in this debate. Another proposition is that we develop with other South Pacific forum countries 'a region..; al plan of action to embarrass and if possible hinder French nuclear testing.' I do not know who drafted this amendment, but those who have spoken in support of it I do not believe have read it very closely. It is incoherent and childish and the government has chosen to reject it. It is all right for the opposition to make propositions of the kind that it has in that amendment, but it is the responsibility of the government to act responsibly in relation to such matters. The government has acted responsibly by rejecting this amendment out of hand. I also want to emphasise that no-one condones the act of violence that was committed against the French consulate in Perth. What I do want to emphasise is that violence begets violence. The tests that France intends to conduct are unquestionably an act of violence against the Pacific nations-small and vulnerable nations as they are. For example, 5,000 Pacific islanders live in a radius of about 1,000 kilometres of the atoll where these tests are to be conducted. To suggest that because the atoll is relatively isolated the matter is of little consequence I think is an unfortunate reflection on those people who make that claim. President Chirac himself, in his response to the Gareth Evans's mission, said: They will be receivedthat is, the members of the missionwith all necessary courtesy. They will be listened to. But I would like to tell you that my decision is irrevocable. Ms Daniele Caraty, an organiser of the French-Australian protest rally in Sydney yesterday, claims that the response of some French firms operating in Australia has been to threaten their employees with the sack if they protested publicly about this proposed increase in French testing in the Pacific. These tests also unquestionably offend against international morality. They undermine the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, they threaten the negotiations for a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, and they unquestionably pose a threat to the environment. They represent an act of violence against the conscience of the world, and especially against the well-being of the people of the Pacific. I believe there is an element of racism here too. France has claimed that there is no environmental danger, that there are no dangers associated with these tests. Of course government members have said that, if there are no dangers associated with the tests, why are they not being conducted in the English Channel? Why are they not being conducted on French soil in Europe? France has chosen to conduct these tests in the Pacific where, within a relatively small distance, thousands of Pacific islanders-non-Europeans-live. The French have claimed, of course, that these tests are safe. They have also claimed that they will be the last tests they will conduct. The people of the Pacific should rejoice, according to the French President and foreign minister, both of whom have made comments to that effect. These tests will also provide, according to French claims, all of the technical information that they require so that they can then do simulated tests in the future. In order to do what? In order to refine more sophisticated weapons of mass destruction? And against whom? Should we be pleased? Should we applaud what France is proposing? I am stunned that such an argument should be used to seek to excuse the tests and minimise the significance of those tests and everything that they mean as far as Australia, the Pacific, the Pacific islands and islanders and the world community are concerned. If or when a comprehensive test ban treaty is concluded next year, with or without the signature of France, how could France ever in the future provide credible and moral support to any attempt that might be made to discourage other countries from continuing tests or resuming tests? Just briefly, I would make one more point. In our family records there is a note that was sent by my late mother's brother when serving in France during the First World War. In part, that note reads: Dear Motherthat is, addressed to my grandmotherI am still on leave in Paris . . . I am keeping in the best of health and quite recovered from my wound. Hubert That was my late uncle, Hubert Johns, born in Pelaw Main, a coal miner, who went to France at the age of 20. He survived. He was one of 330,000 Australians who fought in Europe in the First World War. Fortunately, he was not one of the 60,000 Australians who died in Europe in the First World War. The overall casualty rate for those young Australians who died and still lie today in Europe was the highest of all the allied forces: 68.5 per cent of all Australians who enlisted and fought in the First World War were in some way casualties. In fact, in four months, in 1917, in a battle near Ypres, 38,000 Australians died-38,000 Australians fighting for the defence of France died in four months. People have responded to these tests in different ways. But the world generally, with the exception of France, has deplored this decision. The world generally, with the exception of France, has been outraged by this decision. The world generally, with the exception of France, is aware of the implications of these tests. I conclude with these comments. The question then might be asked as to whether or not these tests are even necessary within the French program for perfecting and making more sophisticated the technology that they bring to nuclear weapons. The National Union of Scientific Researchers in France said it 'condemns without reserve' the decision of France to resume those tests. The Nobel prize-winning physicist, Louis Nee1, a member of the French Academy of Sciences, said that the tests were 'absolutely unnecessary'. Everyone objects to these tests. Everyone deplores the tests. I am pleased to have had the opportunity to participate in this debate that I also could state clearly my abhorrence of the decision that France has made to resume these tests. I hope that goodwill may prevail. I would like to think that perhaps Gareth Evans and those people from the South Pacific Forum who have accompanied him to Paris may have some desirable influence on the French government.",89
210,Mr SOMLYAY,NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC,"In the few short minutes I have available to me, I would support the motion and also the opposition's amendment. The short time. I have only allows me to speak very quickly about my electorate and the outrage people there have felt. Last week when the announcement as to nuclear testing was made by the French President, my electorate office was inundated with telephone calls, faxes and messages absolutely abhorring the decision of the French government. On the weekend we had the violence which occurred in Western Australia. Nobody on either side of the House condones that sort of violence. Also in my electorate, there was an instance of a French restaurateur being racially vilified over the issue of the nuclear testing. If I can give a message to the people of my electorate, it is: please do not vent your anger on these French-Australian citizens; these people are Australians, the same as every other Australian; they are against this decision on nuclear testing as much as is anybody else. It was necessary for the opposition to move an amendment because, as the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) said, there are strong words in the motion. But so what? Basically, they are only words. Every possible attempt should be made to put every possible barrier in place to make nuclear testing difficult, if not impossible. That is what this amendment seeks to do. It seeks to take action-not words. I can just imagine the French government shaking in its boots at this motion which is before the House calling on the French government to 'reverse its decision', sharing resentment, deploring the decision, expressing outrage: ... that France's decision undermines the outcome so of the recent Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons notes that Australia will do all in its power and urge all other countries to hold France to President Chirac's statement that France would sign a CTBT without reservation in autumn 1996; and calls on France to sign and ratify the protocols of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty.

211,Mrs CROSIO,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (7.09 p.m.)-I move: NOES That the bill be now read a second time. This bill serves to make various portfolio amendments to social security and associated legislation. Taken together, the amendments amount to a significant further step in moulding a responsive and accountable social security system for the Australian community. The bill introduces a series of initiatives that recognise the importance of further education and training in equipping people currently in the social security system for their future roles in the work force. Recipients of jobsearch or newstart allowance may currently continue to be paid that allowance for up to three weeks if they start a course that lasts for longer than six months. This payment is made while their entitlement to Austudy or Abstudy is being assessed. The scheme is to be made simpler for all concerned by continuing the payment for a standard three weeks rather than up to three weeks. The scheme is also to be extended to Lawrence, C. M. certain people who start courses that last for less than six months and who, as a result, lose qualification for their allowance. Currently, a person in this situation would lose the allowance if the course is one that is not approved for the purposes of the activity test or an activity agreement. Furthermore, special beneficiaries will now also be able to take advantage of these improved rules. The bill also makes an education entry payment available to recipients of jobsearch, newstart or youth training allowance who start a full-time course that lasts for less than six months. This will apply as long as the course NA is one' that they were required to start under the activity test or an activity agreement. Therefore, these people will join the longer term unemployed customers who already have access to. this important payment that can make all the difference with the unavoidable up-front costs involved in starting an educational course. An inconsistency is also being eliminated in the treatment of Austudy and Abstudy for the purposes of whether social security allowance or benefit recipients qualify for bereavement payments on the death of their partners. In the past, bereavement payments have been paid only if the person was a long-term social security recipient-'-that is, they have been receiving a relevant social security payment for at least 52 weeks. Periods on Austudy and Abstudy will now count towards that period. This will reduce any disadvantage to people who undertake study during an extended period on social security payments compared to those who do not. This bill will exclude as income under the act loans made to Austudy and Abstudy recipients under the student financial supplement scheme. The amendment ensures that a person in this situation will not be excluded from qualificationÂ· for a health care card on the basis of student financial supplement scheme loan payments being included in their income. Two amendments are also being made to the waiting and deferment period provisions for jobsearch, news tart and sickness allowance. There is a current rule that reduces the education leavers waiting period for a person who does some full-time study during the waiting period and reclaims allowance within four weeks of starting the course. To improve the incentives for people to attempt a return to education, this concession will now apply if the person reclaims allowance within 12 months of starting the course. It is also being clarified that the part of the waiting or deferment period that may be waived if a person undertakes approved vocational training during the period is only that part of the waiting or deferment period that overlaps with the vocational training: In other words, it is not the whole waiting or deferment period. The bill also contains a number' of useful enhancements to the social security disability programs. Mobility allowance is generally available to people with disabilities who are engaged in gainful employment, vocational training, voluntary work or jobsearch activities to help them with their special transport costs. Period of grace payments of six .weeks worth of mobility allowance. are paid to people who cease some of these qualifying activities. This bill provides that all mobility allowance recipients will genendly receive these period of grace payments when they stop any kind of qualifying activity. A further amendment relates to telephone allowance. Telephone allowance will continue to be paid to people who lose their entitlement to disability wage supplement when they return to work, as long as they continue to qualify for fringe benefits. Also, it is being clarified that, to be entitled to an employment entry payment, disability wage supplement recipients must claim the payment within a reasonable time of returning to work in the supported wage system. The time limit will be 28 days. These amendments bring disability wage supplement recipients into line with disability support pensioners whose payments are similar in nature. The bill also modifies the meaning of the term 'continuing inability to work', which is one of the qualification criteria for disability support pension and disability wage supplement. In response to the unanticipated out,. come in the AAT case of Loknar, the amendment puts beyond doubt that the necessary assessment must be whether the person is fit for any work, whether skilled or unskilled, that he or she could do without' needing preparatory training. Alternatively, if such training were necessary, it would have to be likely to equip the person to do the job within two years. In a further amendment affecting disability support pension and disability wage supplement, the qualification provisions will address a trend emanating from several recent SSAT and AAT decisions. The amendment will make sure that the person's continuing inability to work is directly caused by an impairment of 20 per cent Qr more under the act's impairment tables. Factors that are consequences of the impairment,. such as - ttitude and lack of motivation to work, may not be taken into account. The government has assessed the legal impact of the assets test in the Social Security Act on successful native title claims. In general, a person's native title right or interest would be regarded as akin to a life interest because of the restrictions on saleability of native title land. All life interests, unless created by the person or their partner, are exempt under the assets test. Government policy on this issue is clear; the assets test should not apply. The government wishes to make this policy explicit and this bill does that by exempting as assets under the act any native title rights or interests of a person, or of any community or group of which the person is a member. The compensation recovery provisions of the act protect the social security system from 'double dippers'-that is, those who might receive social security payments, as well as compensation, for the same period. Several measures contained in this bill build on this comprehensive package of provisions. First, the provisions will clearly apply to superseded payment types. In other words, they will apply-as was always intended-to the forerunners of the payment types that are already specified in the current provisions. Secondly, a trend in compensation settlements highlighted by the AAT case of Kilinc needs to be overcome. This trend has meant that the compensation recovery provisions have been avoided by splitting compensation settlements into two or more payments, only one of which-usually relatively small-is expressed to represent lost earnings or earning capacity and is therefore caught by the provisions. Thirdly, the provisions will apply to claimants as well as recipients of certain social security payments. This will free claimants as well as the department of the need to go through a time consuming and often costly qualification assessment exercise when the compensation recovery provisions might well already preclude payment. Lastly, compensation payments will be clearly included in income for the purposes of the disadvantaged persons health scheme. The relaxed residence requirements for refugees were introduced last year. These basically allowed the payment of certain pensions to refugees without their needing to satisfy the usual qualifying residence requirements. This bill refines certain aspects of that legislation. The amendments make sure that a person continues to be regarded as a refugee for social security purposes, and therefore retains the residence concession, even if they cease to be the current holder of a refugee type visa because of certain incidental effects of the immigration visa system. The loan fringe benefit provisions apply under the family payment income test and the parental means test for young allowance recipients. How this operates is that, if an employee receives a loan from an employer, the employee has a loan fringe benefit. The value of the loan fringe benefit is calculated having regard to a notional interest rate that should reflect market rates. However, it is in fact well below those rates at present. This amendment both raises the rate to a reasonable market rate and sets in place an automatic mechanism for its adjustment each year. The rate will be the lowest available rate from anyone of four major banks specified by the minister. Provisions also being amended are those that govern the date of effect of determinations to cancel, suspend, increase or decrease a person's jobsearch, newstart or partner allowance. The amendments provide that where the information that results in the determination to vary, cancel or suspend the allowance is provided on a recipient statement notice, the determination will take effect on the day of the event or change. A recipient statement notice is the form that persons receiving these payments are required to submit to the department regularly declaring their circumstances. Lastly, the bill makes minor technical and consequential amendments, including to provisions in the areas of the qualifying age for the seniors health card, the income test and related matters, superannuation pensions, debt recovery and data matching. I would also like to add that the government intends to move some minor amendments to the bill at the conclusion of this debate. The amendments relate to three areas in the bill. First, the refugees residence emption initiative will be amended to sure that the definition of 'qualifying dence exemption' works properly for youth training allowance and parenting allowance intended. Also, a reference to a particular qualifying visa class is to be refined. ly, there will be minor technical to the compensation recovery measures to remove superfluous provisions and preserve the effect of another. Thirdly, there will be two minor amendments ments to the qualification provisions for partner allowance to ensure consistency with the amendments introduced in the Social Security (Parenting Allowance and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Act 1991. Earlier today these amendments, which the government proposes to move at the consideraddressing. ation in detail stage, were circulated. I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum in connection with these amendments. I commend the bill to the House.",92
212,Mr RUDDOCK,PAIRS,"I detail guess there are 10 minutes in which to deal with a bill that really requires a good deal more attention than we will be able to give tonight. I do want to make a number of points about the Social Security Legislation Amendorganisation. ment Bill (No.1) 1995 because, as the ernment would know, we give a great deal of, attention to considering the proposals that government brings forward to deal with social security matters. There is a good deal interest, quite surprisingly, in some of these matters that seem at times to be described more technical. Let me just foreshadow that the opposition has some difficulty with three issues amongst the very large number of issues that have been raised in the speech the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister Social Security (Mrs Crosio). I will not go through and detail each of matters that we agree with. I ought to the last letter I had from the government's advisers in relation to the amendments that were circulated today. Certainly, my file and my own recollection indicate that I was not acquainted with the terms of the amendments that the government intends to propose to this bill. I do not believe I have seen either the exexplanatory memorandum or the further make amendments. I accept the parliamentary resisecretary at her word that they are minor, inconsequential amendments designed to as improve the legislation, but I would like to tum my mind to them before I give you any Secondassurance as to the passage that will be amendments accorded them. Having said that, let me just identify the three issues of concern. They relate first to the clarification of the qualification requirefor the disability support pension, the disability wage supplement; secondly, the issue of the native rights and interests that are not to be taken into account when applying the assets test in the act; and, finally, the issue of the split compensation settlements. They are the three issues that we will be In relation to the first issue, I have had an extraordinarily large number of representations from principally the Welfare Rights Centre in Sydney which has put down in its comments on this particular matter, but I have been apprised of a concern from every major organisation that is involved in it offering advice on welfare issues. The Sussex Street Community Law Service was one such I have had representations from govthe Townsville Community Rights Legal Service Inc., the National Federation of Blind the Citizens of Australia Ltd, the Welfare Rights Centre here in the Australian Capital Terriof tory- Mr Stephen Langman, the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association of as New South Wales, the South Australian Council of Social Services Inc., the Welfare Rights Centre of South Australia Inc., as well as the Launceston Community Legal Service of Inc. The fact is that when you receive reprefor sentations from such a wide representative group of bodies that do comment on these the matters you have to be aware that there are check potential difficulties with the bill. In addition, I have had a large number of letters from individuals who are concerned at the purport of these particular clauses. Our intention in relation to that matter and the three other matters that I adverted to is to have a further opportunity in the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs to hear each of those interested parties on that matte! and to hear the department's justification. I want to make it very clear, and I do not do so lightly, that the issue of attitude and lack of motivation which has been raised by those bodies and the extent to which it ought to be related to a physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment of 20 per cent or more strikes a positive chord with us, but we are open to be persuaded that the view that the government has adopted on this matter is incorrect. In relation to the issue of native title being excluded from the provisions of the assets test, if, as has been suggested by the parliamentary secretary in her address, it is clear that in all like situations-and life estates was one that was mentioned-that has been and is the practice, that because you cannot access a particular asset the appropriate response is that an exclusion from the assets test applications is appropriate, obviously we would be prepared to look at that question in a positive light. But it needs to be seen that the provisions that are being enacted here are in every respect provisions that you would have in a system of social security that all Australians who have satisfied the broad ranging eligibility criteria. In other words, there should not be provisions that give, on the basis of a person's culture or race, a particular advantage that, in principle, you would not accord to people in like circumon stances. That ought to be the principle. I have had some advice from the parliamentary secretary's advisers which came to me after we in the opposition had given consideration to the treatment of this particular matter. A number of questions that I had in mind have been answered, but I think it is important that the answers to these questions go on the record. I did ask whether the exclusion of native title rights and interests from test also apply to land obtained under the land acquisition fund. I think it is important that members know that the advice that has been furnished is that under the proposed amendments this is not the case. Further, I asked whether the exclusion of native title rights and interests from the assets test also apply to land obtained under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. The advice I received on that matter, belatedly, was that under the proposed amendments it would not be the case. In order to look at the issue of consistency in application, I also asked what was meant by the inclusion of 'relating to rights and interests under the law of a foreign country dealing with native title issues'. It was quite interesting what advice came forward in relation to that. The department was originally alerted to the possible significance of native title rights and interests to assets by a customer who had a native title interest in New Zealand under the Treaty of Waitangi. Subsequent inquiries revealed that native title rights were recognised in Canada where Indians, Inuits and Metis have such rights and that the United States and Sweden were currently considering introducing native title regimes. You can see that it had fairly wide application. The other issue I wanted to address is more complex and as it is likely that I will be interrupted within 15 seconds or soMr Leo MCLeay-Do you want another is available to five minutes?",95
213,Mr RUDDOCK,PAIRS,"I have a number of colleagues who want to speak on other mat, ters. Perhaps we should enable the matter that is to be addressed to be dealt with separately another occasion. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later time. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA NA Motion (by Mr Leo MCLeay)-by leaveagreed to: That the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1995 be referred to the Main Committhe assets tee for further consideration.",96

215,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It now being only marginally past 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn.",97
216,Mr CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Queensland. Speaker, I would like this evening to express my encouragement of the Australian National University internship program which you have nurtured in this parliament. I took advantage of this program for the first time in the intake in March. I expressed an interest in having my intern investigate the use of hemp as a resource. I have been singularly fortunate in acquiring the services of Mica Stark from the University of New Hampshire. Mica has done an outstanding paper which I shall at later date be presenting to the Standing us Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts in my capacity as deputy chair of that committee. I would like to make a few points about Mica's paper which he has prepared for me to present to you this ning. It is unfortunate that most people do not know the difference between hemp and marijuana. Although they both come from the same plant, Cannabis sativa, they have drastiexplore cally different THC levels. THC, or tetracrops. hydrocannabinol, is the chemical component in marijuana that produces a hallucinogenic effect. THC levels in marijuana are between two and 10 per cent, whereas THC levels hemp such as the hemp used to make the in more depth. paper for Mica's report, which I have here with me this evening, are below 0.3 per report cent-so minimal that you would need to smoke hectare upon hectare to get any halluone cinogenic effect. Because many people do not know the difference between hemp and marijuana, there is a belief in society that state governments are now looking at growing marijuana, when they are simply looking at growing hemp for industrial purposes. Hemp has been grown for paper, sails, art canvas, clothes, oil, paint, varnishes many other goods for thousands Until the 1880s, hemp was the world's largest agricultural crop and the world's most traded good. Hemp was used so universally because of its inherent strength. Mr Speaker, as you can see from the fibres which I demonstrate to you this evening, hemp has particularly long fibres-in fact, the world's longest agricultural fibres. They are very good indeed. Hemp Mr Bruce Scott-They would grow in",97
217,Mr CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"They would grow very well in Queensland and probably even better in Western Australia. It is because the hemp's fibres are long that they are so strong, thus last making it an excellent source of fibre for manufacturing goods. In recent years throughout the world, interest in hemp has increased. This is due in large part to the strain and pressure we are placing on our forests. Although there are people who will refute this a claim, there is an unfortunate reality glaring in the face, and that is that our forests are under tremendous strain to provide for our paper and timber needs. With consumption of paper in Australia expected to increase by four per cent this year alone, it is time we evebegan to look at hemp as an alternative resource for the manufacturing of paper, fabric and fuel. Within the last few years, and in particular this year, state governments have begun to the possibility of industrial hemp It is time the federal government also began to look at it. It is my belief that Mica's report will kick-start the debate on this issue. His report addresses several different areas in which I hope my committee will investigate One of the most fascinating parts of the is the section that deals with the environmental benefits of growing hemp. This is of the reasons why we should take a serious look at it. Research that has been done overseas has proven that hemp can be grown without herbicides and pesticides. Hemp also suppresses weeds and soil-borne diseases. With these characteristics, hemp is a farmer's delight. It has obvious environmental and rugs, economic advantages. One environmental and benefit from growing hemp is its ability to of years. consume carbon dioxide. Economically, hemp could prove to be a goldmine. Based on the markets that have been established overseas, there is a huge demand for hemp products. For example, there is a woman in France who is building houses out of a material called which is made by mixing the inner portion of the hemp stem and natural lime. Perhaps colleague the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) can show members the inner portion of the stem. The woman in France builds several hundred houses a year and has a quent waiting list of thousands who want their dents houses built out of Isochanvre. In England there is a hemp paper company that is unable to meet the demand for its paper. Hemp is a win-win situation. It has both environmental and economic effects. The first Western country to develop a major hemp lation industry will have struck a goldmine. It is important for Australia to begin developing own hemp industry, and it is time to address suburbs. those issues now. I welcome all comments on this topic. There are many issues which still need to be addressed and researched and it time to address those issues now. To help get the hemp industry off the ground, the governtion. ment could help by amending existing drug laws to allow for the industrial cultivation any hemp cultivar which contains less than 0.3 per cent THC. We can also begin educatthe ing people on the difference between hemp and marijuana. I seek leave to. table Stark's report. Leave granted. Roads: Congestion",97
218,Mr SWAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Ori 30 stretching August last year in the House, I raised the issue of the impact of increasing road traffic on our quality of life. I am privileged represent an area which is on the doorstep a major city, yet retains its leafy streets, peaceful parks and quiet suburbs. It is a place where many pensioners and seniors have retired, an area where young families have chosen to raise their children within close proximity to the city, to send their children school and to enjoy the tranquillity of life. This is a close and supportive community. Communities such as these are a very importplanning ant part of our city and our state. Successful needs. communities like these around Wavell Heights, Chermside, Kalinga, Kedron, W loowin and Nundah are the most important resource any government can have, because successful communities are the basis of a Isochanvre, successful society. Over the last 12 months there has been a my public debate about traffic congestion throughout these suburbs. Traffic affects our health, our safety and our work. The sickening screeching of tyres and the all too fresound of sirens signalling traffic accijolt our sense of security and well-being. Nothing can be more important than the quality of the air we breathe, affected as it is by vehicle emissions. In Brisbane we have one of the highest incidences of asthma in Australia, with over 10 per cent of the popusuffering. In many of these suburbs the incidence is much higher than that, affecting its one in four children in many of our local The motorcar is a necessary evil. It is essential for many of us in earning our living, is and socially it gives us great mobility to enhance the quality of our life through recreaAs a community we have to find the balance between our use of the motorcar and of the enhancement of our quality of life. Communities must control the car. We cannot let car drive all of our social and economic decisions. Whilst traffic is necessary, we must Mica control its effect upon our community. The area I represent is at the apex of growth pressures in south-east Queensland. Pressures in south-east Queensland are our local quality of life through noise from the airport and the growing number of cars on quiet suburban roads. Since last to November there has been a state government of commissioned traffic study in the suburbs I mentioned earlier. The study was commissioned after the state government ruled out a proposed airport tollway through the suburbs of Kalinga and Wooloowin. Working with the local community, I played an active role into opposing the tollway and asking the state government to set up a genuine consultative process to involve local communities in their community and transportation Along with Terry Sullivan, the MLA for 00Chermside, and the airport motorway action committee, the airport motorway was opposed and it was successfully stopped. The independent study conducted by Mitchell MCCotter and Ove Arup was commissioned by the state government. The consultants are due to present their final report to the state government soon. The report contains options-only options-for government decision. Late in November 1994, I met with the consultants to express my concern about the methodology of their consultation and the quality of the early consultative meetings with the community. I did this because I was extremely concerned about the quality of feedback I received from local residents. Because I live in and know this community well, I pointed out to the consultants that in the northern part of the study area, Kedron and Wavell Heights, they must directly engage locals in the consultation process by advertising in the Northside Chronicle. I also pointed out to them that they should communicate directly with residents via Australia Post. Representatives of the airport motorway action committee were present at these meetings and can confirm these discussions. Sadly, neither of these recommendations was taken up by the consultants. In their third community consultation newsletter issued in March 1995, where they canvassed road based options for the northern suburbs, out of the blue an option to upgrade Rode Road to four lanes was included. To my knowledge, such an option has never been discussed before at any level of government or at any significant level of the community. All the other options outlined in the road options put forward by the consultants had previously been the result of extensive consultation, discussion and criticism amongst locals. To have included this option at this stage without local community consultation was an act of incompetence and a blunder on the part of the consultants. This blunder has unnecessarily alarmed residents in the Rode Road area. Last Saturday the local community gathered to express their concern at the inclusion of this option in newsletter No.3. I share their anger because this option has never been, and could never be, considered. It has not been, and has never been, a serious option. This is also the view of the local member of parliament, Mr Terry Sullivan. The state government should immediately rule out this option. Traffic congestion is a complex problem. As we head towards the 21st century, it requires a comprehensive road transport policy which upgrades our approach to public transport. Governments need to provide better public transport and citizens need to vote with their feet and support public transport. A onedimensional approach of simply building more roads is unacceptable. The futility of this approach can be seen in Los Angeles. To use a medical analogy, you cannot keep widening arteries forever without cutting into vital tissue. Cut too deep and you risk harming essential organs. To maintain and enhance our quality of life in Brisbane, we must have a comprehensive urban transport policy, which in this local area also means better buses and rail transport, including a railway link to the airport. Such a policy will prevent our cities from being completely taken over by the private car and protect the quality of life all local people deserve. (Time expired) Rugby League",98
219,Mr ABBOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"Warringah) (7.41 p.m.)You can forget about a republic. Where I come from in the northern suburbs of Sydney, the one topic on everyone's mind is Super League and the damage that it is doing to the great game of rugby league. It is a tragedy that some of the game's finest players were not able to participate in this year's State of Origin. It is a tragedy that some lifelong friendships, the best friendships, those friendships forged in the cauldron of sport and the comradery of sport, have been put under severe strain and even sundered by what is going on. It seems to me that there are two big problems with what is happening at the moment. First, it is all very well to pay a tiny, elite group of players enormous amounts of money to be gladiators, but what is going to happen to the junior game, the nursery of the game, and what is going to happen to the community clubs, which are part of the game's great mystique? Secondly, it is all very well one man owning an individual and it is all very well one man owning a club, but for one man to own not only the individuals and the clubs but the whole sport lock, stock and barrel is simply outrageous. I believe that first and foremost these people are sportsmen before they are employees. If they are going to be employees, let them not be the employees of just one individual. I want to quote the words of my colleague opposite the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). Talking about the Super League, he said: The administration of the game should involve much more than maximising profits for either Rupert Murdoch or Kerry Packer. The interests rugby league supporters and the code's junior players should not be sacrificed for the sake corporate dollars. I say, 'Hear, hear!' to the member for Werriwa. I think he has hit the nail on the head. If what was happening here was a businessman trying to comer all the outlets in an important market, at the very least it would be referred to the Trade Practices Commission for investigation. I am an ex-employee of Rupert Murdoch and I am an admirer of the man, who I believe is a great Australian, but I do not believe he should employ every single first grade rugby league player, just as I do not believe he should employ every single Agrade journalist. I am also, as it happens, a former employee of Kerry Packer, and I am conscious of the exquisite irony of Mr Packer's troubles from a latter-day version of World Series Cricket. Nevertheless, one old wrong never justifies a new one. I want to say to this parliament that rugby league is a people's game, not a magnate's game. It should always remain the property of the Australian people and never the property of simply one man. Nuclear Testing in the South Pacific",99
220,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I want to talk about thinking the unthinkable. I am not suggesting vive la force de frappe, although I would like it on the record that I have never heard so much bunkum, hyperbole and pure hypocrisy from this House and from the press gallery. People in this House and the press gallery who have gone out and absolutely racially vilified the French will very shortly be applauding the passing of the racial vilification bill. Tonight I want to talk about declaring bankruptcy in drug administration. Society has progressed a long way from the Ten Commandments, a long way from the simple basic laws of 'Thou shalt not kill' and 'Thou shalt not steal'. Any visitor to a law library is witness to a massive display of man's ingenuity in refining and inventing social solutions and social ills. The drug industry, which of consumes whole national economies, fills the world's streets with crime and its gaols with of inmates and corrupts police forces and officials ruthlessly, is a social and economic cost that is unmeasurable and can no longer be ignored by society. The Ten Commandments are silent concerning substances that alter moods. The prophets were wise enough to understand the limits of law. Attempts through history to interfere in nature have always led to disaster. This century's other example of such a social experiment was the prohibition era in the United States. This experiment created a huge and bloody social cost and, like drugs today, a criminal underworld that made its own laws until the whole concept of prohibition was bankrupted and banished. The current state of affairs in our society caused by the drug industry brought about by a social problem and its maladministration must lead to a fresh and brave look at this whole philosophy. While substances exist, they will be used. While sub1)tances remain uncontrolled and beyond the pale of regulation, they will create crime, maintain a criminal underworld, promote misery and extract immeasurable social costs. If drugs were legalised, regulated, taxed and controlled, there is a strong case that it would Drugs produce a better society, empty the gaols, free police from corruption and create substantial tax revenue. The combined revenue and deficit reductions are likely to produce an increase of $1 billion to the Australian exchequer-and many people say substantially more. A scenario can easily be created whereby marijuana and its derivatives are available over the counter in bars or special shops, controlled and taxed appropriately, and cocaine and heroin are available from hospitals and clinics to those who are addicted, and in a manner that lends itself to proper Relatively harmless mood changing substances such as alcohol and marijuana need regulation. Addictive substances need treatment or maintenance. Penal institutions should be for crime; they should not be garbage bins of mismanaged social problems at immense cost to the taxpayer. Such a fresh set of laws and regulations would immediately halt the pushers and their corrupt industry. The diminished margins would immediately render the trade uninteresting. By treating cocaine and heroin as treatable and available, it cuts the underworld and the corrupt police from this enormous uncontrolled international industry. The huge margins the underworld lives off disappear and so does the social glamour inherent in illegal use. Availability in hospitals puts a different and less glamorous aspect to the social use of addictive drugs. Whatever its philosophical base, the existing structure is by any standard a bankrupt set of ideas, as was that set of ideas that brought about the prohibition era in the United States. By any measure, they are a set of laws and consequent practices that are a huge net cost to society in both money and misery. Society deserves and needs better than this sordid and miserable result. To think the unthinkable is often a prelude to thinking common sense. I say to members of this House that the problem is so obvious and so widespread in Australia today that we have to apply common sense to it before it consumes us all. Environment",100
221,Mr KATTER,ADJOURNMENT,"It is about time politicians in Australia took some cognisance of the damage being done by the environmental movement in Australia. I stand up as a person that has to make no apologies to anybody. I probably was more responsible than anyone else for stopping the uranium mining at Ben Lomond. I was heavily involved in the fight against logging at Downey Creek. I was also the minister that put in the first stand-alone town electricity solar system in the entire world. So I make no apologies to these people. In the past I have worked with them and in the past I have found them to treatment. have intelligent viewpoints. We have now reached the stage in Far North Queensland where the Rainbow Harbour project in Cairns is held up, some might argue, indefinitely; the Palm Cove project in Cairns is held up, some might argue, indefinitely; and the East Trinity Inlet project in Cairns is held up, some might argue, indefinitely. So too have Clump Point at Mission Beach; the Mission Park project at Mission Beach; the Kirrima project out the back of Cardwell; the Port Hinchinbrook project, which has been the subject of national media attention; the Dungeness project at Ingham; and the Secret Harbour project at Ingham. We are informed by the chamber of commerce that the number of jobs involved in the first three projects in Cairns ranges between 1,500 and 2,000. The Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) is on the record on a number of occasions as saying we desperately need to provide infrastructure for our expanding tourism industry. This is true. The industry is expanding by about 20 per cent a year and has been doing so now for some considerable time. I have no reason to believe that the industry will not continue to expand by 20 per cent a year. But I am not aware of a solitary infrastructure item being built in the whole of Queensland at present. So the 20 per cent increase will not be able to be accommodated. The Hon. Michael Lee is dead right in his statements that something must be done to ensure that we will have these facilities. Here we have people quite happy to risk literally thousands of millions of dollars between Ingham and Cairns in Far North Queensland and they are being stopped at every twist and tum. We are in a situation where not a single project has been allowed to go ahead. The cost is some 1,500 jobs in Cairns, 250 at Clump Point, 30 at Mission Park, 70 at Kirrima, 1,100 at Port Hinchinbrook, 40 at Dungeness and 70 at Secret Harbour - a grand total of 3,000 jobs that should exist at present but do not. Whilst I am concentrating today upon the tourism industry, I cannot help but mention the Tully-Millstream, where a thousand jobs are involved in the construction phase, and the prawn and fish farming industries, where projects with 200 jobs are involved. Again, as with the tourism industry, I am not aware of a solitary project which has been allowed to go ahead at present. We are at a dead stop. This is an industry which in every other country is injecting thousands of millions of dollars into their economy, yet in Australia we are talking possibly about $30 million. Japan or Taiwan can look at maybe $2,000 million or $3,000 million a year coming in from this industry yet we, who are far more suitably attuned to being able to provide this industry, do not have a single project being allowed to go ahead. All of the on-rushing horror and pain in Australia-demonstrated by the suicide rates and the bankruptcies in Australia and the poverty level in my home state of Queensland, which is now the highest poverty level in Australia at over nearly 20 per cent-can be overcome to a very significant degree if these people are simply made to act in a sensible manner and the government takes into account sensible decision making instead of a mad, knee-jerk, emotional reaction to action by the media and action by people whose actions no longer represent to me a scientific or rational approach to serious problems which we all know exist as far as the environment is concerned. The sugar expansion worth arguably 5 million extra tonnes a year is now placed in very serious jeopardy because every proposal that has been put forward has been held up. If we cannot clear these areas and expand our sugar production, our economy will die. (Time expired) Nuclear Testing in the Pacific",101
222,Mr KNOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"In the adjournment debate I rise to speak on the French nuclear tests in the Pacific. I do so because I did not get the opportunity to speak on the questions put before the House previously. Firstly, I have had a 25-year involvement in this issue. Whilst flicking through the minutes of a meeting at a dinner last year which was the 20-year reunion of people who were Young Labor members in New South Wales I noticed a Mr Bob Carr seconded a motion calling for action to be taken against the French for their activities in nuclear testing on Mururoa Atoll. I was the person who moved that motion, which was subsequently carried. Mr Speaker, coming from the same district as I, you would be aware of my involvement over the last 20 years in protest marches and in the organisation of ideas about the proliferation of nuclear weapons and also about the nuclear industry. You would also remember a study of the nuclear medicine facilities at Wollongong hospital. I became involved in the Australian nuclear-free zone secretariat as a delegate from Kiama, my municipality. I was ultimately elected to the position of deputy convenor of the Australian nuclear-free zone secretariat, a position I held with honour. In that capacity I rode from Sydney to Melbourne on a bike to publicise the movement of nuclear material along the Hume Highway without any notification having been given to the municipalities or the emergency services along that highway or any regard having been paid to the safety procedures which should have been in place. As a result, the Victorian local government association and the New South Wales local government association adopted a resolution which I had passed through Kiama council. These were not extremely radical organisations. I was arrested in Redbank, Queensland in 1989 at an Australian nuclear-free zone secretariat function. Perhaps some of the National Party members would recall what their National Party government in Queensland was going to do. Two hundred and fifty metres from the Brisbane river, over the oldest coal mines that are unsurveyed in Australia, 400 metres from a malt brewery that supplies the whole of Australia, 600 metres froin Redbank and a kilometre and a half from the outer suburbs of Brisbane, it wanted to put a radioactive dump. I have been through all these arguments and I have been in the front line. I was arrested and found guilty, but no charges were laid. I have advocated that while we have demilitarisation we should look at the problems that that creates. In the past, when the Soviet Union had all its missile capacity and nuclear potential, millions of dollars were invested in the protection of that military capacity and that nuclear material. Since the end of the Cold War no such funds or energy have been put into protecting our environment from that radioactive material-plutonium, et cetera. I have been advocating that for some time. After what has happened in the House today, I see that the coalition will be supporting me. I ask that members of the coalition, after what they said today in this House, join with me on the safeguards that I want to put on the nuclear industry here in Australia. That includes X-ray sensing of metals-you, Mr Speaker, and I are very well aware of this, having the steelworks and BHP in our areathe safeguards that need to be applied to nuclear medicine and the safeguards that need to be applied to all the applications that are now taking place with nuclear material in this country. I hope that those opposite will join me on that. For 25 years I have been involved in this debate and I have not seen one member of the coalition at any meeting and I have not seen any of their names on any letterhead. Where have they been? For them to find their so called conscience now when public opinion is rife is hypocritical. I find it very difficult to believe. I put this to the coalition: will any members who have signed any letters on this issue over the last 25 years please give me copies, so that I can take back my remarks and not tar you all with the same brush of irresponsible, hypocritical, political activity over this issue. But you will not get any consolation from the people of Australia, because they know where you have been for the last 25 years. You have not been in this debate in any way, shape or form. Aged Care",102
223,Mr LIEBERMAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I could not speak today on the debate relating to France because time ran out, but I will not try to do that now. I want to record that last week a veteran aged 70 or more with lung cancer was transported from a public hospital in my electorate to a bush nursing hospital some 40 kilometres away, then told that no arrangements had been made for his admission. Then he had to go to a specialist in Albury and eventually back to the bush nursing hospital. This gentleman's plight, and the concern to his family, worries me greatly and highlights the problems with caring for elderly people, not just veterans, in Australia. It also highlights the urgent need for the government to provide some additional resource and funding for dementia care and respite care for people who do not fill the category of wanting an acute bed but who need respite and other care. I ask the House to support me in the plea for an urgent review in these matters.",103

228,Mr BRERETON,SWAN,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: . The Civil Aviation Authority has provided the following information: (1) Constraints were imp?sed on t-e operation. of Nomad aircraft in AustralIa following the major inflight incident in the West Indies referred to by the honourable member. The aircraft operating constraints, as detailed in Airworthiness Directive AD/GAF N22/69 are: (i) Maximum flap deflection-10 de-rees. Prior to the Directive, maximum flap deflectIon was 38 degrees. (ii) Maximum flap extension speed-95 kn?ts. Prior to the Directive, maximum flap extensIOn speed was either 107 knots or 111 knots depending on the particular aircraft model. (iii) Maximum manoeuvre. speed-13- - ots Indicated Air Speed (lAS). Pnor to the DIrective, the maximum manoeuvre speed was 139 knots. While Aerospace Technologies of Australia (AST A) and the C.AA have not ye- b-en a-le to determine the precIse cause of the mCIdent m the Caribbean, the CAA's investigations hav- identified operating conditions under which thIS t-pe of problem is likely to o-cu- with the No-ad atr-raft. The operating constraInts Imposed by Airworthiness Directive AD/GAF N22/69 avoid these high risk conditions. (2) At this time Nomad aircraft are considered by the CAA to be safe when operated in accordance with existing limitations. (3) ASTA is continuing to investigate the safety of the aircraft. However, the operational constraints, imposed by the CAA, will not be remove- until questions surrounding the safety of the atrcraft without the constraints have been resolved to the satisfaction of the CAA Better Cities Program: Koombana Bay and Carey Park, WA.

(39) (a) Yes details of which can be made available upon request to the South West Development Commission. (40) Each year, under the terms of the Better Cities Agreement, a report on the evaluation of each Area Strategy is made publicly available. The report includes the approach/activities undertaken to implement the Area Strategy, an account of actual outputs and outcomes achieved during the year in relation to agreed outcomes and a report on the assessment, modification or continuation of each Area Strategy. In the case of Western Australia, these details are prepared by each Area Strategy and provided to the Better Cities Secretariat located within the WA Ministry for Planning. The Secretariat in tum compiles the information and after obtaining the necessary State Ministerial endorsement submits it to me for approval. This report can be obtained through my Department upon request. (41) The Better Cities Program is untied and the program funds are allocated on an Area Strategy basis, rather than by individual projects. On that basis I am able to advise that under the Better Cities Program a total of $1O.64m was allocated to the Bunbury Area Strategy in Western Australia. I am, however, advised that upon request to the South West Development Commission further details can be provided. Child Support Agency: Payee Statements (Question No. 2101)  upon notice, on 1 March 1995: (1) Does the Child Support Agency provide child support payees with statements indicating sums received and outstanding; if not, why not. (2) Does the Child Support Agency issue statements to payers who do not pay via employer deduction. (3) How many stage 1 cases is the Child Support Agency administering. (4) Is the number of stage 1 cases declining; if so, at what rate.",110
230,Mr GEAR,SWAN,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The CSA does not issue a monthly payee statement. However, the Department of Social Security provides written advice to payees each time they are due to receive a payment. All correspondence used by the CSA either in providing information to clients or requesting information from clients is currently being reviewed. However, at this time no decision has been made to produce payee statements. (2) The CSA does issue monthly statements to all payers who do not pay via employer deduction unless for some reason the payer requests otherwise. (3) The CSA administered 60684 stage 1 cases as of 28 February 1995. (4) Stage 1 cases are declining at the rate of approximately 100 per month. Deceased Persons and Multiple Voting: General Elections (Question No. 2238) Mr Hawker asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 27 March 1995: How many votes were recorded against the names of persons (a) subsequently found to be deceased before polling day and (b) more than once in each federal electoral division during the (i) 1987, (ii) 1990 and (iii) 1993 general elections.",111
231,Mr WALKER,SWAN,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The Australian Electoral Commission is not able to provide information for the 1987 and 1990 general elections as the required records are no longer available. Investigations undertaken after polling in 1993 did not find any instances of votes recorded after the elector had died although there were 18 cases in which the evidence was inconclusive. (b) Following a general election letters and reminders are sent seeking information as to why a name was marked off a certified list more than once. Some replies often provide information which when compared with information provided by other electors in response to non-voters notices, reveal cases of polling official error, by which the name of the wrong elector is marked on the certified list, resulting in that elector having hislher name marked twice and no mark against the name of the other elector or the elector claims to have voted only once. In such cases, there would not be multiple votes recorded. Other replies indicate evidence which is inconclusive, that is where the elector does not reply to correspondence or letters are returned unclaimed. In these cases there is no evidence of a multiple vote, simply a multiple mark that cannot be further investigated. There are also other replies where the elector admitted to voting more than once.

Australian Bureau of Statistics: Funding from Office of Status of Women (Question No. 2239) Mr Campbell asked the Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 27 March 1995: (1) Has the Office of the Status of Women (OSW) provided funds directly or indirectly to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS); if so, what sum was provided in each year it has been provided. (2) Has the OSW funded the establishment of a separate section in the ABS; if so, (a) what is the nature of the work performed by the section, (b) how many persons does it employ and (c) will he provide a list of all work undertaken by the section. (3) If a separate section has not been established, has the OSW funded tasks under its direction to be performed by ABS staff; if so, will he provide a list of the work performed under OSW funding and direction. (4) Do other Commonwealth agencies (a) fund separate sections in the ABS or (b) pay the ABS to conduct projects; if so, which agencies.",112
232,Mr GEAR,SWAN,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The amounts provided were: 1993-94-$250,000 1994-95 (to mid May)-$44,932 Total expected for 1994-95-$274,932 (2) and (3) The OSW has contributed funding for the establishment of a Women's Statistics Unit, forming part of the Social Analysis and Reporting Section within the ABS. The cost of the Women's Statistics Unit is shared equally by the ABS and the OSW, at $250,000 per year each. The work program of the Women's Statistics Unit is under the direction of the Australian Statistician, who consults with OSW in the formation of the program. The Social Analysis Section is responsible for developing indicators for monitoring the social well-being of the population and for the preparation of social reports drawing on data from ABS collections and other sources. It produces the annual Australian Social Trends publication. The role of the Women's Statistics Unit is to develop, maintain and extend statistical indicators to measure and monitor the socio-economic status and progress of Australian women. The unit employs five staff and produces the Australian Women's Year Book. (4) (a) There are three other units currently operating within the ABS, funded in a similar manner to the Women's Statistics Unit. These are: (i) National Criminal Courts Statistics Unitjointly funded by the Commonwealth Attorney General's Department, the State and Territory Attorneys-General Departments, and the ABS; (ii) National Crime Statistics Unit-jointly funded by the Commonwealth Attomey-General's Department, the State and Territory Police Departments, and the ABS; and (iii) National CulturelLeisure Statistics Unitjointly funded by the Statistical Advisory Group to the Cultural Ministers' Council, the Statistical Working Group to the Sport and Recreation Ministers' Council, and the ABS. (b) Yes. The following list includes agencies funding projects where the ABS has either undertaken or extended a collection, or added questions to a collection, on the agency's behalf in 1994-95.

(2) If aquaculturalists are not recognised as primary producers; (a) why not and (b) what action will the Government take to ensure their recognition.",113
233,Mr GEAR,CSIRO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) & (2) The Sales Tax (Exemptions & Classifications) Act 1992 provides sales tax exemption for goods for use mainly in carrying out primary production activities. Primary production activities are defined in the sales tax legislation to mean 'agriculture, forestry, fishing (including fish farming) or pearling'. Fishing activities mean the taking and catching of fish, the farming of fish, oysters and crustaceans and the processing of fish on non-recreational vessels. Pearling activities mean the taking of pearl shell or oysters for culturing purposes. The term 'aquaculturalist' can cover a range of activities and it is not clear from your question precisely which activities you are referring to. To the extent that an aquaculturalist is engaged in primary production activities as defined in the sales tax law, he or she would be entitled to the general sales tax concessions available to primary producers. The only special sales tax concession for primary producers that an aquaculturalist would not qualify for, is the sales tax exemption for certain vehicles (including four wheel drive vehicles, motor cycles and trailers) used in agricultural activities. This concession is restricted to this narrower group of primary producers in recognition of the special needs of the agricultural industry. Trade Union Movement: Government FundingÂ· (Question No. 2305) Mr Hicks asked the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 9 May 1995: Did the Government provide $3 million to the Australian trade union movement to fund the travel and associated costs of sending three trade union officials to Indonesia to train Indonesian trade union officials.",114
234,Mr BRERETON,CSIRO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No. Commonwealth Grants Commission (Question No. 2307) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 9 May 1995: (1) What assessment has the Commonwealth Grants Commission made of competitive federalism practices by the States, particularly the financial cost to the public sector of (a) taxation discounting designed to attract investment, (b) subsidies on government business enterprise pricing and (c) local preference clauses in State tenders. (2) What adjustments in Commonwealth financial payments are made in response to the practices referred to in part (1).",114
235,Mr WILLIS,CSIRO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) The Commission monitors developments in State taxation by collecting information on: tax revenues; tax rates; the size of the major tax bases; and concessions or exemptions. Initiatives designed to attract investment are covered in the collections but are not accorded special status. (b) Pricing policies of government enterprises are not sought on a systematic basis, although the Commission collects information on the community service obligations performed by some State enterprises. The Commission measures the net financial transfers between States' budgets and their business enterprises, but takes account only of States' relative funding needs for passenger transport and country water services. (c) Information on such detail is not collected. (2) The Commission's recommendations on the distribution of financial assistance grants are based on the principle of fiscal equalisation: ie each State should be given the capacity to provide the average standard of services, assuming it does so with the average level of efficiency and makes an average effort to raise revenue. In principle, the grant share recommended for a State is not influenced by its policies. For example, the grant for a State making a below average effort to raise revenue from a particular tax is based on the assumption that it is making the Australian average effort. Any revenue shortfall it suffers must be accommodated by its making an above average effort from other taxes, spending less than average on services, or borrowing. (a) Because the Commission's assessment are 'policy neutral', a State's policies have no direct effect on its grant; their only influence is their effect on the Australian average revenue raising effort. (b) The effects of these subsidies are not ed in the Commission's assessments. They do not influence the distribution of grants and their effect is borne by the State making the subsidy. The community service obligations of government business enterprises could involve subsidies. The effects of community service obligations met by passenger transport and country water enterprises are reflected in the Commission's assessments, on the assumption that all States provide such benefits at the Australian average level. Differences between the actual benefits provided by any State and the average level of benefits do not influence the State's grant share. (c) Where such clauses relate to capital transactions, they are not in the Commission's assessments and do not influence the distribution of grants. If the tenders relate to recurrent expenditures, their effect on a State's expenditure would be reflected in the Australian average levels of expenditure used by the Commission, but they would be a small proportion of expenditure and would have only a very small effect, if any, on grant shares. Australian Bureau of Statistics: Housing (Question No. 2319) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 10 May 1995: (1) What methodology does the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) use in determining the housing cost component of the CPI. (2) How does the ABS methodology compare with those used by other OECD nations. (3) Has the ABS considered replacing mortgage costs with a measure of imputed rent for determining the housing cost component; if so, with what outcome. (4) What impact would replacing mortgage costs with a measure of imputed rent have on the differential between headline and underlying measures of inflation in Australia. Mr WiIIis-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (3) In the CPI the major costs of home ownership are represented by mortgage interest payments. The ABS conducts reviews of the CPI about every five years. The ABS gave extensive consideration to the issues raised, in both the 11th and 12th series reviews. During the 11th series review in late 1986 and following extensive consultation with a broad range of users, the ABS rejected using imputed rents as a measure of the reflect- costs incurred by home ownership. Mortgage interest charges were introduced for this component in the March quarter 1987. This decision to reject the use of imputed rents was widely re-endorsed by users and the CPI Technical Consultative Committee during the next (12th series) review in 1992. The use of an imputed rental measure was rejected largely because it is not consistent with the outlays approach used to construct the Australian CPl. These issues are canvassed extensively in the CPI Technical Consultative Committee's Report of the 12th Series CPI Review, dated July 1992, and summarised in the ABS Information Paper The Australian Consumer Price Index, 12th Series Review (Catalogue No. 6450.0). (2) Individual OECD nations' treatment of the housing cost component varies widely. Based upon available information, treatment of home ownership costs can be summarised as follows: A number of countries exclude home ownership costs from their official CPI. These include Austria, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg and Spain. A number of others use the imputed rent method to represent home ownership costs. These include Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Costs Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Switzerland and the USA. The remaining countries include some kind of direct measure of owner occupier housing costs. This group includes Australia, Canada, Iceland, Ireland, New Zealand, Sweden and the UK. All of these countries include mortgage interest charges in their CPIs, but their approaches differ in other aspects. Differences between countries reflect the different uses to which the CPI is put, the operation of housing markets, the size of the private rented housing sector and the availability and reliability of data. Due to the legitimate differences in the treatment of housing costs in national CPIs, the International Labour Organisation recommends that, for the purpose of international comparisons, countries also construct a CPI which excludes the housing component. (4) As the question is hypothetical it is not possible to answer it without making a number of assumptions (about how the ABS would implement an imputed rental measure, and about how the Treasury would respond in relation to the scope of its underlying rate). Such assumptions cannot be made with sufficient confidence.
