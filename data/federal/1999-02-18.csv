Main Committee adjourned at 1.00 p.m. NA The following answers to questions were circulated: World Expo, Lisbon, Portugal (Question No. 192) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 24 November 1998: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 3086 (Hansard, 15 July 1998, page 6271), will the Minister inquire into the success of the 1998 World Expo in Lisbon, Portugal, in particular the trading and tourism opportunities available to participating nations; if not, why not. (2) Would an inquiry similar to that referred to in part (1) assist the planning of Australia's exhibit for Expo 2000 in Hanover. Mr Tim Fischer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Australia did not participate in the 1998 Worid Expo in Lisbon and the Government has no independent means of assessing the success of this event. The Portuguese Commissioner-General presented a final report on the Expo to the International Bureau of Expositions (BIE) General Assembly meeting on 27 November 1998. I understand that the report focuses on the urban development impact of the Expo and does not contain substantive discussion of its trade or tourism impact for Portugal or for the participating countries. (2) No. Australian Competition and Consumer Commission: Monitoring Price Changes (Question No .. 224) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 30 November 1998: Will the Government release the advice it has given to or received from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission about how it intends to monitor the price changes that will occur because of the implementation of the GST. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government has not given to or received from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) advice about how it intends to monitor the price changes that will occur because of the implementation of the GST. NA The Government has introduced a number of tax reform bills including A New Tax System (Trade Practices Amendment) Bill 1998. This Bill will amend the Trade Practices Act 1974 by inserting a new Part to provide the ACCC with power to monitor prices, in order to prevent the possibility of consumer exploitation and excessive profit taking in the transition to the new tax system. The Bill will prohibit price exploitation, which will occur where a corporation supplies a good or service at a price that is unreasonably high, taking into account the various tax changes, provided the unreasonably high price is not attributable to the supplier's costs, supply and demand conditions or any other relevant matter. The price oversight regime will begin 12 months prior to the implementation of the GST and will continue for a further two years after the date of introduction. The ACCC will publish guidelines about when a price may be regarded as being in contravention of the prohibition on price exploitation. The ACCC will report quarterly to the Minister on its operation under the new Part of the Trade Practices Act and these reports will be made pUblic. Goods and Services Tax:' Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (Question No. 247) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 2 December 1998: (1) Did the Commonwealth announce after the special premiers' conference in November 1998 that it would give the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission statutory authority to formally monitor prices and take legal action against businesses taking pricing decisions in a manner inconsistent with tax reform. (2) Is the Government taking steps to curb GSTbased profiteering. . (3) Has the Government introduced formal monitoring of bank fees and charges; if not how will the Government prevent profiteering by banks. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The Government announced in A New Tax System (page 85) that it would legislate to give the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) special transitional powers to formally monitor prices. The ACCC will be required to monitor retail prices in order to identify instances where consumers have not fully benefited from reductions in the tax. rate, or have been exposed to greater than necessary price rises. The Agreement on Principles for the Reform of Commonwealth-State Financial Relations, which was endorsed by the Premiers and Chief Ministers in November 1998, states that the Trade Practices Act 1974 will be amended to insert a new Part giving the ACCC statutory authority to formally monitor prices and take legal action against business practices that take pricing decisions in a manner inconsistent with tax reform. In order to ensure that the measures apply to the whole economy, the States and Territories agree to apply the Commonwealth legislation, and extend it to cover those areas outside the Commonwealth's constitutional power. In general, it can be expected that the competitive pressures that already exist within the economy will ensure that a fall in the tax rate on a product will flow through to consumers in the form of lower retail prices. However, the Government recognises that with the transition to a new tax system, there will be legitimate community concern regarding the possibility of consumer exploitation and excessive profit taking. Accordingly, the Government introduced into Parliament, on 10 December 1998, A New Tax System (Trade Practices Amendment) Bill 1998 that amends the Trade Practices Act 1974 to provide the ACCC with powers to monitor prices, in order to prevent the possibility of consumer exploitation and excessive profit taking in the transition to the new tax system. The Bill requires the ACCC to publish guidelines about when a price may be regarded as being in contravention of the prohibition on price exploitation. The ACCC will report quarterly to the Minister on its operations under the new Part and these reports will be made public. The price oversight regime will begin 12 months prior to the implementation of the GST and will continue for a further two years after the date of introduction. (3) The Government will maintain its policy of informal monitoring of bank fees and charges. The major banks voluntarily inform the ACCC of their movements in fees and charges. These arrangements would not preclude the ACCC from formally monitoring bank fees and charges, along with other prices in the economy, as provided for in the A New Tax System (Trade Practices Amendment) Bill 1998. Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Budget Allocation (Question No. 337) Mr Forrest asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 10 December 1998: (1) What was the budget allocation for the ABC TV (a) news and current affairs and (b) documentarics and features departments in 1997. (2) How many documentaries were commissioned solely within the ABC in 1997 and what was the subject in each case.

(7) Is the information requested in the preceding parts collated in some publication or format in the ABC; if so, (a) in what publication or format and (b) is it available to the public.

News and Current Affairs produced documentary episodes for programs such as Australian Story. (3) In 1997 thirty one single episode documentaries and five documentary series were commissioned in this way. The projects generated fifty five episodes of documentary material commissioned by the ABC and funded in part by other funding bodies in the year. (4) Sixteen individual programs and seventeen documentary series (excluding Natural History) were purchased from overseas for inclusion in documentary timeslots such as The Big Picture and Inside Story in 1997. (5) and (6) Arrangements made with producers outside the ABC are considered commercial in confidence. (7) Apart from published program guides this information is not available in a collated/published form.",170
