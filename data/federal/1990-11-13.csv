2,Dr HEWSON,PARLIAMENTARY BUSINESS,I ask the Prime Minister whether he recalls his statement to this Parliament on the election of the Speaker that: Our responsibility is to give this Parliament its proper status as a forum which commands respect within the community. How does the Government's policy of guillotining 39 Bills through this Parliament in three days fit in with the Prime Minister's stated policy to give this Parliament its proper status?,9
3,Mr HAWKE,PARLIAMENTARY BUSINESS,"This Government is very active and has a large amount of legislation which has to be passed for the benefit of the people of this country. I concede to the Leader of the Opposition that I would prefer to have a situation in which there was more time available. But if we are going to get all the important legislation which is necessary to protect and advance the interests of the people of this country, unfortunately these measures are necessary. NA",9
4,Mr GIBSON,VOLUNTARY WELFARE,My question is directed to the Minister for Community Services and Health in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Social Security. The Centre for Independent Studies has published a monograph called Voluntary Welfare: A Greater Role for Private Charities. Would the Minister inform the House what the implications would be for the health and well-being of all working Australians if the recommendations were adopted?,9
5,Mr HOWE,VOLUNTARY WELFARE,"The question is not unimportant in that it helps us, I think, to fill out some of the details of the approach which is implicit in the Opposition's views about privatising the Department of Social Security. I point out that one of the authors of this monograph is currently a research officer for the shadow Minister for trade and trade negotiations. The central point of the monograph is that the role of the social security system is simply to give out welfare benefits and that the recipients of social security benefits are encouraged to be passive in receiving these benefits. In fact the monograph resurrects the old argument, drawn mainly from the United States, that the public provision of income support leads to a degenerate culture of dependency amongst the recipients. That is, that in so far as payments are provided through the welfare system, as a result of such payments, people become addicted to welfare, as they would to a drug. The authors refer to some sketchy case studies of Australian non-government welfare agency programs to show that behavioural change in overcoming this culture of dependency is most efficiently achieved by the private sector. I must say that I am disappointed that the work that· this Government has done to' introduce an active income support system over the past five years has been ignored by the authors of this monograph except for a brief and approving reference to the Newstart program. The critical difference between the Government on the one hand and the authors and the Opposition on the other lies in our basic analysis of the causes and the ways to address the problems of long term unemployment and traumatic events in people's lives,. such as disability and sole parenting. No-one, including those who are of working age and receiving social security payments, believes that long term dependency on income support is a desirable state of affairs. The work of the Social Security Review shows that those who are of working age and out of the work force are keen to get back in. The t--. Government has restructured the unemployment benefits system, the sole pension system and the system of payments to people with disabilities to introduce a case manager approach which is coordinated with the labour market programs available through the Commonwealth Employment Service, with child-care services, with rehabilitation services and so on. This restructuring of income support and labour market assistance provides opportunities and incentives to engage in work. Diverting tax revenue to private welfare agencies, as is proposed by the Centre Independent Studies,' makes no sense whatever. No non-government welfare agency can pick up the functions Leader of the Opposition would want thrust upon them. They themselves say they are not equipped to do more than work in partnership with government by providing counselling and some specifiuted cally tailored support and training grams. This monograph and the views of the Leader of the Opposition are based on dubious assumptions which have not tributed. been made clear in the public statements so far made by the· Leader of the Opposition. Those assumptions are that all cial services and income support provided directly or indirectly by the Government are somehow not important and do not deserve the serious attention to policy administration that the Government it. To expose the hypocrisy of the Oppoment sition's position on this issue, I simply point out that the Opposition is not vocating - ",9
6,Mr TUCKEY,VOLUNTARY WELFARE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on the matter of relevance of the answer. As you know, Mr Speaker, there are a number of precedents in this place, particularly the ruling of Speaker when he responded to Mrs Child that it is irrelevant for a Minister to waste the Parliament's time on the matter of Opmatter position policy when he might tell us what the Government is going to do to get us out of the mess.",10
7,Mr SPEAKER,VOLUNTARY WELFARE,"Order! There is no point of order. If the honourable member --for O'Connor makes any further interjections such as that, I will deal with him.",10
8,Mr TUCKEY,VOLUNTARY WELFARE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a furposite. ther point of order. Is it or is it not a fact that the Standing Orders say the answer must be relevant to the question?",10
9,Mr SPEAKER,VOLUNTARY WELFARE,There is no point of order. The honourable member for torian O'Connor will resume his seat.,10
10,Mr HOWE,VOLUNTARY WELFARE,"The issue that I am attempting to expose, an issue which flows directly from the Leader of the Opposition's suggestion-and it is proper that he should make suggestions, should make policy-is that we could devolve the sofor cial security system to non-government agencies. He is not suggesting that taxation ought to be involved but he is sugthe gesting that social security-income to security, on which we spend in the order of $25 billion in this country-being less important, can be devolved to non-government welfare agencies, can be distribwithout concern about issues of proprivacy, and can be administered without question as to the attitudes that might be implicit in the way that moneys are disIndeed one might argue, flowing from sothe Centre for Independent Studies paper, that what the Opposition would like to see is a social control exercised by nongovernment agencies on the basis that and somehow they are more likely to weed gives out cheats, that somehow non-governagencies are better equipped to run a properly audited system. When comadpared with taxation, that kind of suggestion is a serious topic so those kinds of suggestions are not entertainedalthough within the Centre for Independent Studies policy paper it is proposed that a percentage of people's tax ought to be turned over to non-government agencies Snedden for welfare purposes. What we hear from the Opposition, no how quietly and sotto voce it may come, is a return to poor law. If that is not' the Opposition's policy, it ought to take the advice that is implicit in the intervention of the honourable member for O'Connor and start spelling out its policy in greater detail so we can have genuine policy debate, something we have not had in eight years from this lot op_· NA",10
11,Mr REITH,LOAN COUNCIL BORROWINGS,"I refer the Treasurer to my question without notice on 10 October 1990 in which I referred to the VicAuditor-General's report that some $760m of sale and leaseback transactions should have been taken into account for Loan Council purposes. I asked the Treasurer why he failed to ensure that these borrowings were included within Loan Council global borrowing limits for Victoria, and the Treasurer replied: If Victoria has undertaken borrowings which have been ultra vires the global resolution we will be raising that with the Victorian Government. I now ask the Treasurer whether the Commonwealth Government has raised the issue with the Victorian Government and what further action, if any, he proposes to take on this matter.",10
12,Mr KEATING,LOAN COUNCIL BORROWINGS,"I have had the Treasury look at this matter, but I was not sure whether the conclusions that were drawn in the question were correct. At this stage the Treasury has not recommended any action to me. Again, I will ask about it. NA",11
13,Mr FITZGIBBON,GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT,"Is the Minister for Finance aware of claims that a further substantial reduction in the public sector would provide beneficial results for the economy? Mr Fitzgibbon continuing to address a question to the Minister Jor Finance-Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I submit that this is now getting completely out of hand. I put it to you that on this occasion the honourable member for Hunter is clearly asking for an opinion in the second part of his question. Unless some clarification is given and ruling made, the situation is going to deteriorate further. I invite you to consider that point-that the second part is contrary to the Standing Orders as it asked for an opinion, and that you rule it out of order.",11
14,Mr SPEAKER,GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT,I take the point raised by the Leader of the National Party of Australia. The first part of the question is in order; the second part is not. The Minister may respond to the first part of the question.,11
15,Mr WILLIS,GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT,"I thought it was in order for a Minister to advise the House, Mr Speaker. In responding to the first part of the question, I am aware of claims that have been made by the Leader of the Opposition that we could achieve a substantial reduction in external debt, inflation and unemployment and sustain economic growth by cutting total public spending by 2 per cent of gross domestic product (GOP) and, accordingly, we should get the States to agree to this and give a lead by revising the Federal Budget. Such a policy is deficient in a number of respects. It ignores the fact that under this Government the public sector has been very substantially reduced. As the House is aware, the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) has been reduced by 5.7 per cent of GOP since the last year of the previous Government. Federal Budget outlays have been reduced by virtually the same percentage of GOP as the PSBR, representing a cut of about $22 billion in expenditure in this year's Budget compared to what it would have been had it contained the same percentage of outlays as in 1982-83. The Forward Estimates reflecting the out-year effects of the expenditure cuts already made show another 2 per cent of GDP reduction by 1993-94, taking us_back to the level of the early 1950s. The total public sector, including the Commonwealth trading enterprises and the States, has shown a reduction of almost 4 per cent of GOP to last year and probably by more this year, given that the States have tightened their expenditures. Because public expenditure has been so tightened, it is now much more difficult to make further major reductions without abandoning or dismembering necessary programs. An $8 billion reduction represents a further 9 per cent cut in Commonwealth Budget outlays, or a 20 per cent cut in Commonwealth outlays on health and welfare or, if it were focused on the States, a 12 per cent cut in State government outlays. To suggest, as the Leader of the Opposition did, that the Prime Minister should have sought the agreement of the States to cuts of this order is absolutely naive. Of. course, it is also incredible for the Opposition to propose this kind of policy, anyway, given that at the last election it promised to cut expenditure by $2.7 billion, and then give it all back in tax cuts. It then added $6 billion of expenditure promises on top of it. We now see that it is so full of determination to slash the public sectqr that it announced today that it will oppose the sale of the pipeline Authority, which would be a negative outlay worth many hlmdreds of millions of dollars which will now not be a reduction of outlays, if it gets its way. So we see how much resolve it has to reduce the size of the public sector. The Leader of the Opposition is quite wrong in claiming that such policies, even assuming that they could be implemented, would enable a sustained reduction in unemployment and inflation and sustained economic growth. He bases this claim on a study conducted by the Institute of Public Affairs (IPA) which models that kind of approach and compares it against the current policy stand over five years from this year. The study shows that inflation, GDP growth and unemployment outcomes would all be worse than outcomes under current policy, in the early years least. Under the Hewson-endorsed model, inflation would be higher, until 1993-94, than it would be under current policy, according to this IPA model. The GDP growth would be notably less, particularly this year and next year, than it would be under current policy. The very model that the Leader of the Opposition endorses shows 'that unemployment, which he says would be showing sustained reductions, would be higher in each of the five years from this year. The Opposition is endorsing a policy which for the next five years would slow GDP growth and give us higher unemployment than could be expected under the current policy, according to this model which the Opposition endorses. I think we can see that the Opposition is now in the rather curious position of trying to attack this Government for a deteriorating economy, as it sees it, and higher unemployment and at the same time proposing policies which would make the slowing of economic growth more substantial and the level of unemployment higher, not just now and not just next year but for the next five years. The least we can expect from the Opposition in the future is some degree of consistency. If it is going to promote those policies, that is fair enough; it is entitled to its policy approach, but for God's sake it should not criticise us for unemployment. NA",11
16,Mr TIM FISCHER,PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES,"My question is directed to the Minister for Small Business and Customs. Is it a fact that the Deputy Official Receiver has attributed a 34 per cent rise in the number of personal bankruptcies to high interest rates and a decline in employment conditions? Is this the Government's position? If not, how does the Minister account for this extraordinary rise in personal bankruptcies? Is it a fact that this arises from the Government's one-dimensional approach to quelling consumer demand through high interest rates?",12
17,Mr BEDDALL,PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES,I thank the honourable member for his question.,12
18,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES,Order! The Leader of at the National Party will not hold up signs.,12
19,Mr BEDDALL,PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES,"I have not seen the actual figures that he refers to but there has been a continual amount of speculation about increasing business bankruptcies. The figures I have. seen show a certain increase in bankruptcies over the last quarter for which figures were released in comparison with the same quarter last year. The statistics are very unsure, but what appears to be happening is that unfortunately there is very much an increase in personal bankruptcy rates rather than in business bankruptcy rates. The historical indicators certainly indicate that the business bankruptcies that can be identified are about level. Unfortunately, we have very much an increased level of personal bankruptcies and that is very concerning. There is no real indication that there is an increase in business bankruptcies of the order of magnitude indicated by the honourable member. NA",12
20,Mr MELHAM,COMMUNITY SERVICE ORDERS,"My question is directed to the Attorney-General. Given recent estimates that put the cost of keeping a person in full time custody in New South Wales gaols at more than $40,000 per year per prisoner, can the Attorney-Oen"" eral please tell the House what progress has been made on the negotiations with the States and Territories to allow courts sentencing Federal offenders to impose a community-based sentencing option rather than a prison sentence in appropriate cases? .",12
21,Mr DUFFY,COMMUNITY SERVICE ORDERS,"I thank the honourable member for Banks for his question because I know that in his previous work as a public defender he took a particular interest in this topic, even before he .arrived in this place. I am pleased to be able to inform the honourable me'fube,r for Banks and, of course, the House, that as of yesterday the Commonwealth hanow successfully negotiated withjill Stites and Territories to enable courissenten-­ ing Federal offenders in each jurisdiction to impose a community-based sentencing option as an alternative to imprisonment in appropriate cases. Yesterday the arrangement to which the honourable member made particular reference was finalised with New' South Wales"""":""""the State with the highest number of Federal offenders. 'This .arrangement marks the end of negotiations which have' gone on for far too long and follows'the making of similar arrangements with:tpe new Labor governments in Tasmania last year and Queensland earlier this year. necessary arrangements are now in place with all Australian States and Territories. Community based orders are a particuthe larly effective penalty in certain circurt17 of 500,0007 stances, particularly· where an offender cannot afford a fine and the punishment of last resort, imprisonment, is out, of proportion to the offence. They are a very real punishment, while stopping short the deprivation of liberty and loss of come and of family contact involved with imprisonment. One of the principal benportunity efits will be to ensure that, where approthe priate, the families of people who commit, social security offences, for example, not suffer because of a conviction. Until now there have been insufficient alternatives available to imprisonment Federal offenders appearing before courts in New South Wales charged with what are quite often income related offences, and in some ofthose cases, tragically, this has .caused mothers to be separated from their children, making the innocent children themselves the victims. Obviousry,the Commonwealth cannot condone--'-'and having regard to steps we have put in place we obviously feel very strongly about this-the deliberate defrauding of the social security system, but, equally, the Governmlfnt has been concerned to ensure that the suffering of individuals and their families is not out of proportion to the offence. The figures. quoted by the honourable member for Banks; from my recollection of what he said, are correct. On the latest figures available for New South Wales, a comniunity service order costs around . $1,800 a year to administer, compared . with qver $40,000 for keeping a person in I prison in tpat State for a year. to conclude, I welcome the new arrangemerit with New South Wales and trust that the availability of new sentenc· ing options will be fully utilised b-y the courts in appropriate cases.

22,Mr ALDRED,COMMUNITY SERVICE ORDERS,"I refer the Prime Minister to the ooricerns expressed by Arch.: bishop Hollingworth and Father Brian· The Lucas on child poverty. What is the Government's estimate of the number of chil- "" dren living in poverty at present in Australia, arid ,how dqes this compare with Brotherhood of St Laurence estimate",13
23,Mr HAWKE,COMMUNITY SERVICE ORDERS,"I would have to refer to my colleague the Minister for Social . Sellurity for. the precise number that he . would use to answer the specific question of from the honourable member. As the in· honourable gentleman has 'referred to ArChbishop Hollingworth, I take this opagain of reminding him of what Archbishop has had to say on this issue, because it seems to be the case that do the honourable member is implying that, . in some way, the Government has not honoured the specific commitment we for made in this area. Mr Downer-He is not implying it; he is stating it.",13
24,Mr HAWKE,COMMUNITY SERVICE ORDERS,"The Opposition cannot have it both ways. If the Opposition is relying on Archbishop Hollingworth, I will quote him right back to the :Opposition. Let me quote what Archbishop Hollingworth has said: In strict income security termsthis is Bishop Hollingworth,. as he then was in May 1989it is true that the prime ministerial promise 'that no children shall live in poverty in 1990' . . . will be achieved. This is Bishop Hollingworth, as he then was. Mr Aldred-That is not so.",14
25,Mr HAWKE,COMMUNITY SERVICE ORDERS,"If the honourable member wants to say that he does not know what he is talking about, that is all right with me; let him say it. On this issue I shove his words right down the honourable member's throat. I repeat: . In strict income security terms, it is true that the . . . promise . . . will be achieved. This represents significant progress, and demonstrates that governments can meet some modest social justice objectives, even at a time of economic restraint when they are involved in public sector cutbacks and tax reduction in order to improve their economic efficiency. Then, again, he said in August-and let me repeat to honourable members opposite the advice that they consistently refuse to take: The Government has made real advances . . . These reforms are too important to· be caught in the cross-fire of political conflict. The Opposition ought to openly acknowledgeand honourable members opposite have never done this, not once. They have never acknowledged the fact that, as a result of the reforms introduced after 1987, an additional $1 billion was added to the incomes of low income families on with children. They have never once lian Council acknowledged it. If they are going to quote the Archbishop, why do they.not acknowlto have set, and now edge the obligation that is upon them that for child payments for low-income he outlines and stresses? I repeat it. He, said: The Opposition ought to openly acknowledge the merit of such reforms and move towards a more bipartisan stance on welfare policies for children as they have with immigration policy. Honourable members opposite are very one-sided. They quote the Archbishop. when it suits them but, on the basic issue of the fact that the income promise has been delivered, they refuse. to acknowledge it. Let me go again to-Mr Reith-What about your famous' promise? What are you doing about it? No child will live in poverty-that is what you said.",14

31,Mr HAWKE,COMMUNITY SERVICE ORDERS,"Honourable members opposite are laughing. ;Either honourable members opposjte are saying the Brotherhood means what it says or it does not. Are honourable members opposite saying that the Brotherhood of St Laurence is lying? Are they sayingthat Archbishop Hollingworth is lying when he says this? At any rate, that is what the Brotherhood says, Mr Speaker: We congratulate the Federal Government on its work on child poverty, which represents a historic breakthrough in the national attack on child poverty. The Federal Government has now built a solid foundation of income security for. Australian families. . . Let me quote the others who have spoken a this matter. Julian Disney, writing in letter of 14 July on behalf of the Austraof Social Service, said: . It is without doubt an outstanding achievement reached, the benchmarks families. ACOSS and our members believe these initiatives represent a major contribution to tackling the problems of child poverty and working towards a fairer society. The Australian Institute of Family ies, in May of last year, said: By these means the Government's pledge to the benchmarks has been met. The new levels FAS represent rises in real terms since 1,983-84 of 41 per cent for younger children-I ask honourable members opposite to go back and look at what they did over their' seven years. They did not come within bull's roar of the massive increases that have been brought about,by this Governindustry."" ment. The Institute concluded: Fo,"" low income families especially, of the Government to annually adjust all familyrelated payments in accordance with movements in the consumer price index, is the most significant long term reform of the talf, package. Mr Speaker, I go to those quotes from Archbishop Hollingworth; from the Brotherhood of St Laurence, from the Australian Council of Social Service, from' the Australian Institute of Family Studies for no other reason than to reveal the total hypocrisy of the Opposition, because it has been instructed that the Government, in regard to the income commit-, ments tpat it made, has delivered. Members of the Opposition ought to acknowle-ge openly, what we have' dQne. They refuse to.do it and in fact they come, up with half-baked ideas"" firstly, in regard to a consumption tax, and then in regard to a flat rate tax, the inevitable effect of which would be to impose massive hard-, ships upon the very people at the lower income level of this society whom they, purport in these questions tei protect. Having said all that, we do not pretend that there are not still people who need assistance and, in fact, I will be meeting with the Australian Council of Social Service next week-with its, President Merle, Mitchell and otbers-so that we can discuss the ways in which not only this Government but also other governments in Australia can do more in terms of making the services available to those people in this community who are most in neeq., We have delivered in terms of income the promises that we made. This fact has been acknowledged by everyone in the welfare industry. We have delivered on those promises, but we are not sitting pat Stud- and saying, 'All right, you have told us we have delivered'. We believe there is meet more to be done. We are not about rhetof oric, we are, not about trying to score political points. As the Brotherhood of St Laurence has said, we are about undertaking historic change. It has said, correctly, that we have delivered historic change. a We are going forward from that in further discussions with those ,at the forefront of ' Mr Hawker-Those behind you are the decision laughing at, you, Bob.",14

35,Mr GORMAN,COMMUNITY SERVICE ORDERS,"My question is to the Treasqrer. Has the, Treasurer seen reports advocating a flat rate ta?,-? Can the Treas'urer inform the House if such a proposal will improve the equity of the taxation system?' .",15
36,Mr KEATING,COMMUNITY SERVICE ORDERS,"A flat rate tax would not improvt; the equity of the tax system. ,In fact, as I demonstrated in the House yesterday, a flat rate tax in combination with a consumption tax would deliver ,substantial tax - uts to those on the highest incomes at the expense of those on lower incomes. As such, the equity of the tax system would 'be substantially upset compared to the kind of equity which is in the tax system today, not only from cuts in marginal rates of tax-particularly at the lower .level of incomes-but also the introduction of the capital gains tax and other measures which guarantee the equity of the system. I notice the Leader of the Opposition was complaining on radio this morning about my attacking' his propositions on tax; and he said that the Government just uses Question Time with this whole string of dorothy dixers to drop buckets on them, designed to raise doubts about some the policy proposals put. The fact is they are not designed to raise doubts; they raise doubts about the policies which put. Yesterday we had the Deputy Leader of, him the Opposition after Question Time say- flat rate ing that the Treasurer claimed, and then implied, arid then inferred I had advo-' cated a tax policy incorporating a flat gime. This is obviously untrue. I was inferring; I was quoting him directly, cause what he said on the ABC news on 9 November was that a flat tax the table. The answer was simply, 'Yes'. Then he went on to say on ABC radio, also on 9 November, that if you are having a comprehensive review of the options for reform of personal income tax, then direct tax or a uniform rate, a flat rate, a possibility. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition gets up and says that 1 claimed, and then implied, and then inferred something which was obviously un:.. true, then the Leader .of the Opposition complains we are raising doubts about ing Opposition policies. The Opposition is raising the poliCies, and then raising doubts about them by running away from them. It is this old problem again-the Op- ;. .. .. our position is not, sure whether)t is an idea or a policy. The Leader of the was asked why he turns his back in the House. He said that last week he did turn his back at Question Time because I was just ranting and raving and throwing verioned bal abuse at them and was not answering the question. I will read the last several priorities? sentences of the question: That is what I meant when I made an expression of that kind. I was referring to that kind of the-collapse. We have not allowed a wage explosion to occur. There is still a good balance in the factor shares between profits and wages; the Commonwealth Budget is in surplus. The honourable member asked me a question. does not want to listen to the ansWer . . . There was no abuse. Opposition members have a very scant regard for the truth. The Leader of the Opposition turns his back because he is a coward and cannot cop it when the answers come his way. He gets on a radio station and says he of was abused when in fact I was dealing with the substance of the question. Then do he complains about his poliCies being upare braided by us in the House, designed to raise doubts, and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition then said I misrepresented when I directly quoted him on the tax. It is time that the Leader of the Opporesition. decided what his poliCies are' and not what his ideas are, and sorted but one be- from the other. Then he should stand up for them and not cowardly turn his back was on or try to run away from them: NA",15
37,Dr KEMP,EDUCATION STANDARDS,"My question is to the Minister for Employment, Educati()n and a Training. I remind the Minister of his is claim to this House during Question Time on 21 August that Australia's education system is amongst the world's finest and . that to pinpoint problems such as the significant minority of students who have passed through the system without acquiradequate literacy skills is to knock the ' system. I also remind the Minister of his , speech on 1 November to the conference of the National Board of Employment,' . Education and Training where he claimed: scl).ools systems are in crisis. there has never been a greater questioning by parents, teachers and employers of where Opposition our schools are going. I ask the Minister: Are his assessments of the state of Australia's schools based on objective analysis or are they merely fashto support what are his often contradictory educational and political",16
38,Mr DAWKINS,EDUCATION STANDARDS,I must say that this question comes from a gentleman who is . Mr Downer-Answer the question.,16
39,Mr SPEAKER,EDUCATION STANDARDS,Order! Members on If he my left will cease interjecting.,16
40,Mr DAWKINS,EDUCATION STANDARDS,"This question comes from a gentleman who is the spokesman for the Opposition and who has done nothing since he assumed that position earlier this year-nothing but knock the education system in this country and all those who work in it. Meanwhile, we have been administering, or at'least presiding over, programs which have seen participation rates grow to record levels. If one is talking about the area of university ucation,some 150,000 more students are now enrolled than when we came to office; that is the equivalent of creating in seven short years 10 fully fledged universis ities in this country, We have also seen the number of students enrolled in' each of years 11 and 12 increase by 100,000 compared with the period when we came into office. We have seen the participation rates in technical and further education, that is, our young people going into industrial training of one kind or another, increase to record levels during the period of our Administration. We are the Government that at least has programs that are design-d to increase participation within the education system. With our income support, which is now at record levels and has a record number of beneficiaries under it, we have been able to encourage and increase the number of kids, particularly those from lower income families for whom the Opposition has scant regard, in the education system, particularly beyond the compulsory years and particularly on into the university years, where they had been massively underrepresented ever since universities started in this country. Of course, we are now making important shifts in terms of increasing opportunities for kids regardless of their background, and also improving opportunities for those with geographic disadvantage. In relation to the question the honourable member raises in relation to quality, as he would know if he read the speech I made at Coffs Harbour, it was to the question of quality within our school system that I was particularly addressing my remarks. I was asking whether the States were interested in developing a truly national system where we could' see improvements ,in the quality of teaching, improvements in the curriculum that was being offered around the country, and improvements in the way in which students performed and the way in which students were assessed. That is exactly the point that I was making in the speech, I was saying that it is high time that we· took that next step and developed some edcurriculum guidelines for this nation which took into account the obvious concern which exists amongst students, parents, teachers and employers about what happening, particularly in the postcompulsory years of schooling-years 11 and 12. There has been a massive increase in the participation rates in those years, something of which we are entitled to be justly proud. But there is a question about what is happening to some of those kids, particularly those who are not part of the 20 per cent or so who go on to university, That is why, in conjunction with the States, we have proposed that there should be an examination of postcompulsory schooling, whether. it is in school, technical and further education; or in a combination of training and the work force. This is the next major issue for us to confront and it is an issue that we are trying to confront collectively with the States. The honourable member for Goldstein can sit there smugly in between his tirades of abuse against teachers and others who work in our education system, but the fact of the matter is that the teaching profession-and I have made this point many times-has become the area of the work force where people least want to go and first want to get out of. That is an issue' involving not only the level of salaries that have been offered, but also the career' oppprtunities that exist. The Commonwealth Government does not employ a single teacher in this country, but we do have a concern for the quality of teaching in our schools. Indeed, at the time of the last election, I announced that there would be a national negotiation on the question of the quality of teaching. It is a negotiation which has proceeded to the ppint where a national project on the quality of teaching has now been launched which, for the first time, brings together the States-that is, those who employ most of the teachers-those who employ the teachers in the non-government sector and the teacher unions to address some of these crucial issues. It concerns how we can attract some of our best and brightest back into the teaching profession and, once having got th-m there, keep them there to ensure that they can provide the extraordinarily valuable service which teachers have provided to this country over the years. The honourable member for Goldstein sauntered in here out of some cloistered university existence and tried to tell me and others about what it is like to teach a in government high school in the western suburbs of Melbourne or Sydney where we have seen the enrolments in years 11 and 12 spiral as a result of our reasonable expectations of giving kids these opportunities. He has no regard and no sympathy for the kinds of increasingly complex circumstances that teachers in those schools are trying to contend with as .a whole new population of kids stays on at school in order to secure a better future for themselves and make a greater contribution to this country. It is about time that the honourable member for Goldstein and others like him started to participate sensibly in a debate about the education of our kids rather than continuing. their campaign of knocking this Government and everyone who works within the education system.

41,Ms CRAWFORD,WOMEN IN THE DEFENCE FORCE,My. question is directed to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. Many of us in the House will remember the Minister's decision in May this year to open combat-related positions in the Australian Defence Force to women. What effect has 'this had on the numbers of women now being recruited?,18
42,Mr BILNEY,WOMEN IN THE DEFENCE FORCE,"It is a genuine pleasure to answer this question because the honourable member for Forde has been assiduous in pursuing the question of career opportunities for women in the Australian Defence Force. I thank her for the interest she has taken in that. It is also a pleasure to be able to the House that the decision the Government made in May to open up combatrelated positions to women has had a highly beneficial impact on recruiting. The decision was not made for that reason. It was made because we wanted the defence forces to be of a piece with the equality of opportunity for women that we have opened up elsewhere in the work forcesomething of which I know everyone in this Government is proud. It is the case now that in the Navy 95 per cent of occupational categories are open to women and in the Air Force around the same. In fact, in the Navy the only thing a woman cannot do is go to sea in a submarine. In the Air Force the only thing a woman cannot do is fly a combat aircraft.",18
43,Mrs KELLY,WOMEN IN THE DEFENCE FORCE,"Why not? Mr iULNEY-That is not a bad interjection, and we will be reviewing those things in a couple of years time. In the Army something like 55 per cent of positions are open to women now. That presents women with much greater experience, better promotion opportunities and a more satisfying career path. As of September this year the number of women working in the permanent defence forces comprised 11.7 per cent of the forces. That figure has been more or less the same for some time. However, the most recent recruiting figures, about which the honourable member asked me, show a very different story. From July to September this year, the first three months of the financial year, women comprised 21 per cent of recruits to the defence forces, that is, nearly double the number in the existing forces. Of that number, 17.7 per cent were recruits to the Army; 23.3 per cent were recruits to the Navy; and just over 27 per cent were recruits to the Air Force. In some occupational categories those figures were much higher. It is very topical, in view of the ships going to the Gulf that the Prime Minister saw off yesterday, that of Navy officer recruits women comprised almost 50 per cent. Of Air Force officer recruits, nearly one-third were women. Those figures demonstrate that our curtell rent policies are attracting more women into the Services and they give the lie to the myth that has been peddled in the past that women did not want to do those jobs. My experience is, in fact,the reverse and all the comments I have had are the reverse. Perhaps also worth mentioning in this context is recruitment in general, which has been a thorn in the side of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) for some time. The picture there is also a great deal brighter, with an overall increase in recruitment of 17 per cent for the first quarter of this year compared with the same period last year. Mr Ruddock-It always goes up with unemployment.",18
44,Mr BILNEY,WOMEN IN THE DEFENCE FORCE,"On the other side of the ledger, separations have fallen. The ADF separation rate for the first quarter is 11 per cent less than for the corresponding quarter last year. Clearly, the ability of the Defence Force to attract and retain personnel, including women, has improved considerably over recent months. As interjections point out, there could be a number of reasons for this, but it is obvious to any member that the Government's policies of increasing opportunities for women, of improving conditions of service for people in the armed services, and of providing maximum support for defence families have played a large and favourable part. NA",19
45,Mr RUDDOCK,FUNDING OF ETHNIC PROGRAMS,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer him to a press release issued by the then Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs on 10 January this year announcing the first of a series of grants under the migrant access projects scheme (MAPS). I also refer him to the other decisions made in the Cabinet meeting of 12 December 1989.I ask: In which press statement or statements were these other decisions announced? Can the Prime Minister assure the House that these other decisions were announced publicly before the March election?",19
46,Mr HAWKE,FUNDING OF ETHNIC PROGRAMS,"The implication of the question by the honourable member is that we were withholding information about funding for ethnic community groups. That is a ridiculous suggestion. The grants program referred to in the Age article involved only one new component-what is referred to as the MAPS scheme, the migrant access projects scheme. As I indicated to the House yesterday, the grants for this scheme were announced by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs in his press release on 10 January-the one to which the honourable gentleman referred. Initially that covered 17 grants worth over $800,000. The other programs involved nothing more than the provision of additional money for existing programs, the grant in aid program and the pilot equity and access program. Consideration was given later to issuing a press release on further funding under the MAPS and grant in aid programs as flagged by the Minister in his press release, but it was not considered to be sufficiently newsworthy. As honourable members would know, not all grants are the subject of a major press release and there is nothing unusual or unique in that. It is interesting that there was. absolutely no pressure to hand out money before election day. In fact, substantially less than $2.7 5m was actually spent in 1989-90; $1.7m having been carried over into 1990-91. Accusations that the Government was involved in some kind of secret funding are clearly at odds with the contention also being made that this was some kind of election ploy, because it is extremely difficult to see how anybody could buy votes using funds that voters, it is claimed, were totally unaware of. The fact is that substantially less than this $2.7m out of a total funding of around $5m was spent in 1989-90, and if the honourable member takes account of what I had to say yesterday and today in response to his two questions, he will see that once again the Opposition has engaged in a tremendous . beat-up. NA",19
47,Mr NEWELL,BANANA INDUSTRY,Can the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy explain to the House recent developments affecting the Australian banana industry?,19
48,Mr KERIN,BANANA INDUSTRY,"I thank the honourable member for Richmond for the question. As the Prime Minister said to the bishop, he is the member who hardly posted a letter during the recent election campaign. I know the honourable· member is very concerned that banana growers in his electorate may be unnecessarily worried at reports that a yellow wave of Ecuadorian bananas is soon to break upon these shores. I recently addressed the Australian Banana Growers Association in Mullumbimby in his electorate. These fears-and it is very annoying that they should be peddled-have been generated by some uninformed comments, some by peopJe who should know better, and inflamed by media reports. For example, the latest one I saw was that 'bananas are coming in a matter of weeks'. The fact of the matter is that an application was received last year from a New Zealand company to supply Ecuadorian bananas to the Australian market. This company has been importing bananas from Ecuador into New Zealand for some time, and New Zealand does not grow bananas. This request was referred to the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) in the normal way and that organisation published a preliminary report last month. I gave it to the Australian Banana Growers Association. It details the potential risk to the domestic banana industry from pests and diseases which may be transmitted with Ecuadorian bananas. It identifies 25 possible and the two very serious diseases of bananas, which you, Mr Speaker, know are moko and black sigatoka. We have had incidents involving both diseases in Australia: one on Thursday Island and one in Cairns where the disease was imported with a plant. Further detailed investigation-",19
49,Mr SPEAKER,BANANA INDUSTRY,Further details might reveal our private conversations.,20
50,Mr KERIN,BANANA INDUSTRY,"Some members of the Opposition have been going bananas, too. Further detailed investigation by AQIS, including a bioeconomic study and on the-ground research in Ecuador, will be necessary before any decision is taken. As part of this process, AQIS will consult directly with the local industry. My colleague the Minister for Resources, who has responsibility for quarantine-I run the industry; he runs the diseases-is going to keep me fully informed on this issue. We do not anticipate any decision on this matter until 1992 or 1993, and the industry has been told this. So I say to the honourable member for Richmond: yes, we have no Ecuadorian bananas. To the best of my knowledge, no bananas have been imported into Australia since the 1940s. The only banana products that may have been imported since that time are banana chips. I understand that old 10-80 over there likes them with his Weeties! The Australian industry has been free of import competition. Last year Australia produced about 200,000 tonnes of bananas and exported only 86 tonnes. Expenditure in research and development in the industry amounted to $230,000, half funded by industry levies and half from government funds. There is a big scope there. If the industry imposes compulsory levies, as we are encouraging it to do in order to take its full entitlement to government support, the research budget could amount to $1.8m. We are doing what we can to assist the banana industry. It has come a long way, it is efficient and it tailors its product to local needs. But it also has a long way to go. Unfounded cries to use quarantine measures as de facto protection will not pests be heeded, particularly when we are at such an early stage of quarantine assessment. Despite all the cards and letters that are tumbling in, I believe it is just too early to panic yet. NA AUDITOR-GENERAL",20

ECONOMIC POLICIES: SMALL BUSI-ESS AND HOUSING Discussion of Matter of Public Importance,22
63,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I have received a letter from' the honour""ble"" member for  inite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of'the Government to change economic policy in tl)e light of the collapse small business and housing sectors: I call upon those members' who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in theit places- '  small business sector in Australia is in a crisis which has been deliberately brought on by this Government's economic mismanagement and incompetence. A"" high interest rate policy, a l:Jiased tax system and a deliberately induced recession have left this sector in tatters. It could be argued that worse is yet to come. Company tax payments are due by mid-December and the payment of holiday and leave loadings and additional burdens are yet to be faced by the, se-tor. This, coupled with a decline in consumer spending and the flow-on of what will happen after Christmas, means that many business owners will simply close their doors and walk away. Many will find the going too tough and will walk away from a lifetime of work. Others will be added to the growing list of small business bankruptcies. Those in the small business sector are suffering from a loss of confidence-a loss of confidence which has been deliberately induced by, this Government and which is killing off their livelihood. Yet what has the Government done to help this sector? Absolutely nothing- It was the Government's policies' that caused the problem in the, first place. Its incompetence and mismanagement have succeeded only in making things worse. The Government started out with grand plans. The response tabled today by the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), who is at the' table', contained 66 recommendations. It is interesting to note that finally today the Minister has tabled his response and he is holding a press conference on the matter. At this point I would like to comment on the Minister's naive reaction to what is happening out there in the real world. In reSponse to a question asked today, the Minister said that most of the small busiof the ness bankruptcies were not small business bankruptcies; they were personal bankruptcies. In fact, the small business report to which the Minister tabled a response indicated that the bulk of small businesses trade in their own personal names. If the Minister goes out ,into the community, he will see that small businesses are going broke in their droves. The Minister ought to look at the closed factories, the shops that are not trading, and the factpries which are operating three or four days a week. If he thinks they are not going broke, he is living in a fantasy land. Mr Jull-He should go out into his electorate-27 per cent have gone to the wall. MrPROSSER-As the hono-rable member quite rightly said, he ought' to go out and have a look. In regard to bankruptcies, in Victoria-another great Labor State-in the July to September quarter, the number of bankruptcies increased by a massive 61 per cent. In Western Australia, they increased by 44 per cent. With regard to the previous quarter, the figure .for Victoria was 44 per cent and Western Australia, 56 per cent. If the Minister does not think that bankruptcies are on the rise, as I said, he is not living in the real world. I would like to read from an article in the Sydney Morning.Herald today relating to bankruptcies. It states: Few o.f these bankruptcies are being caused by perso.nal financial inco.mpetence,. acco.rding to. a senio.r Federal Government o.fficlal, who. billmed high interest rates and deterio.rating take-ho.me wages. The statistics, which are expected to. get wo.rse, give so.me idea o.f the hardship many are facing, but give little insight into. the lengths to. which people are go.ing to. avo.id bankruptcy-in one case, eating to.ast fo.r dinner several times a week. That is what this Government is doing to the small business sector, and the Minister sits at the table and does not really care. On.e could ask whether the Government really cares about whether people will lose their jobs as a result of the collapse of the small business sector. ' , , This Government does not really care what is happening. It is not interested, in the small business sector, in the welfare of small business employees or th- well-being of the Australian community. It is the Government's economic mismanagement and its bungling of policies which have caused the problem in the first place. The Government's absolute reluctance' to change its policy to stop this collapse is evident here today, and it is a disgrace. Some of the burdens that have been faced by the small business sector-'-and I would like to run through them-include record high interest rates. Last year interest rates reached a peak of 26 per cent. Today they are only down to 16 or 17 per cent. There are also substantial loadings which are forced onto small business. What about compartytax? Of course, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) wanted more money from the small business sector and the business sector and he brought forward the payment of tax by nine months. The real cruncher, the real whammy, that . will hit small business and business next month will be their tax payments. At the very time that businesses do not have enough money to pay wages, at the very time that they do not have enough money to pay leave loading and holiday pay, at the very time that many of them do not have enough money to pay their rent, and at the very time when many small business owners, as the newspaper quotes, are eating toast to survive, the Government wants more ta-x from them. The Government is going to hit them with a tax payment on 15 December. The training levy that this Minister did 110t even respond to put an additional one per cent of payrolls over $200,000. In relation to capital gains tax, if the people could ever get out of their business, if they could ever sell it at a profit in this particular climate and if they had any goodwill left in the business after this Government has destroyed it, and they made a profit on· the sale, the Government would want its fair share. The Government will take that out of what is left, out of what the people want to pay to their creditors, out of what they want to keep their families going and walk away from it. It is a disgrace. The Government is destroying the very infrastructure base of this country. Unemployment is going up substantially. At present unemployment is pushing 8 per cent. The ANZ employment advertisement series figure fell by 8 per cent in October alone. The job scarcity ratio is now at its lowest level since the 1982-83 recession. The index has fallen 51 per cent this year alone. In February this year 542,000 people were unemployed. This rose to 650,000 in October, a 20. per cent increase in the last six months. It is going up and it will probably hit 10 per cent before it has finished. What is this Government doing? Absolutely nothing. Mr Chaney-It is making it worse.  two major banks have also confirmed that it will probably hit the 10 per cent figure . . What is more of a disgrace, and it indicates an absolute waste in this country, is the capacity utilisation figure. That is how much machinery.works in this country. We talk about manufacturing, and the utilisation of capital investment. I can remember the Treasure,rsaying that we have had a great deal of investm!!,nt in new capital in this c;outitry. That: hils beeh wasted, because the capacity ijlWisatiqn rate in March fell to 80.3per.cent.ln - p.e June quarter it fell anothl(f 1A per cent, so it is now dow!). to ,78:9 per-cent a.fld falling. If the Treasur¢rgcit out/-nd went around the factories of this' couptry and visited the industrial areas 'ofiVi¢toria he would find that the compalliesare working three and fourdaysi a Week. The unemployment figures do;not pi¢k .that up. It is a waste of capacity .l,md it i$a dnHp on this community. This is not the only area where we have seen this Government's p()licies and incompetence and mismanC\gement ,affect the sector. It is a sad indictmeht that its policies have affected many A,qstraiian fami. lies, forcing them out' onto the streets because they cannot afford the' home· repayments and denying mllnYYOl.lng couples the opportunity to purch,as-their own home. For many Australian families the Government has ttirned the dream of owning a home into a nightmare. One of the burdens that face the hOqle ownership sector is high interestr;ltes. These w¢nt from 12112 per cent and reached· 17 Pier cent and they have only pegged back slightly now to between 15· MQ 16 per cent. . In r-lation to mortgage affordability, - he hIgh mterest rates hC\vemeant .masSIve increases in monthly repayments on the average home loan. I will give the House an indication of what this Government has done in regard to home affordability. In March 1980 17.4 per cent of a family's income was needed to service the average home loan. In December 1986' the figure was 27.1 per cent. By December 1989 the figure was 36.4 per cent, and currently the figure has been Pegged back slightly to 35.2 per cent. In Sydney the figure hit 44.3 per cent. House prices have also escalated, putting home ownership beyond the reach of many ordinary Australian families. The national median house price increased by over 5 per cent in the last tWo' quC\rters, from' $114,000 in the September 1989 quarter to $119,000 in the June 1990 quC\rt-'r. House prices have now only just dropped back very slightly. An amount of $1.8.7 billion was lent in the sector in 1'989-90, down 18 per cent from $22.8 billion in 1988-89. , Dwelling approvals, which are a good indiCator of how thi's Government has Qlah,aged the economy, went from 120,000 in 19-t>-87, up 20 per cent, to 151,000 in 1987-88- to 186,000 in 1988-.89 and down to J40,000 in 1989-90, a fall of 24-9 per cent. That is a good indicator of what a lousy job this Government has done of mC\naging the economy, what wild fluctuations'it has been able to impose upon the iirdustry. The Government wonders why it is a very difficult' period in that industry to induce training and to hold tradesmen. Preliminary indicators are that this trend is dropping, with approvals falling further, an- the market unfortunately has yet to bottom out. Employment in ,the building sector has also declined significantly from 617,000 in the March quarter to 573,000 in the June quarter-a drop of 7 per cent in just three months. The Government sought to rub further salt into the wound' when it abandoned the first home owners scheme this year and massively cut by about half-$33m to $14m-the funds which are,passed on to the States. At the very time when the industry needed confidence and the support of government, the Government shirked its responsibilities and in fact' went back on its commitment to hand over ,at an affordable price the support to the States; it chose not to do that. The wildly fluctuating economy and the Government's policy of very high interest rates 'have . had a devastating impact on the small business sector, the manufacturing sector and the housing sector; One has only to go round some of the factories , in country Victoria and some of the rural areas of this nation to see the heartbreak and the years and years of work that are how being destroyed as a result of not only falling consumer spending but also a lack of confidence. This country now needs confidence; the Government ought to change its policy. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has already called on the Government to reintroduce a better policy mix, to reintroduce confidence into society and bring down a May statement so that the economy and people in the small business sector can get back confidence. This Government has not realised how important confidence is. The Government and, of course, more importantly, the Treasurer chose many times to blame in part the banks, to blame someone else, for the crisis and to say that they were not passing on the real margins. Of course, if the Treasurer thought that the banks were ripping off the sector, were not passing on the full margins that they had and that people were entitled 10, he should have had a chat to his very own bank, the bank that the Government owns-the Commonwealth Bank. If he thought that the banks were ripping off the small business sector, perhaps he should have had a chat to the Commonwealth Bank first. But, of course, that is not the case. The point is that this Government's policies are making it very difficult for people out there. This Government's policies have brought about a collapse in business and consumer confidence, and we are now paying a very real price for that in the community. We are paying a very real price because people do not even know what next month will bring. People borrow money, build factories and houses and buy machinery. They take the punt, all on confidence, that they will have the ability not only to service that debt but also to repay the loan and go out and get the market. When that confidence is taken away, the system starts to collapse. One needs to look only at what happened when confidence went from the Victorian financial sector. There was a run on banks and building societies collapsed, yet the same thing is happening in the small business sector. We. have had a complete collapse in confidence in the small business and manufacturing sectors from which many will not recover--n enormous waste in the capacity of this country. If this country is ever to get out of its problems, it has to trade its way of them. We cannot trade our way out of our problems if this Government has destroyed the very infrastructure base that we need to do just that. The Government has a very real price to pay. It has brought about the greatest destruction we have seen in our business infrastructure base in this country. While the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has got some hang-ups about that 'R' word, recession, people in the community are very aware of it. It is on not only their lips but also their bank statements, because their bank statements are all in red. The banks are calling in their loans because people cannot service their debts-and it is because of the Government's policies. Any government that could not predict what a period of high interest rates and loss of confidence would do to that sector by anyone's standards is very naive and out of touch. That is the problem: this Government is out of touch, devoid of policies and vision, and it is about time it did something about it or moved over and gave someone else-the Opposition-the chance to put this country right. Nothing will happen until our vision for this country has been put in place and confidence is restored to the sector.",22
64,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,25
65,Mr JJEDDALL,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"1 really do welcome this opportunity to address the issue of small business. Of course, this being the first opportunity the shadow Minister for small business, housing and customs, the honourable member  in this place to debate, I was disappointed that, in fact, nothing came forward from the Opposition. All it did was berate the Government, and its argument was ba-ed on points that are mostly inconsistent, mostly incorrect. What I would really like to do is outline what the Government's proposals are and what the Government has done about small business. What the Government did back in 1988 was establish a parliamentary committee out that I had the great pleasure of chairing. Unfortunately, the shadow Minister was not a member of that committee, but another shadow Minister, the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) was, and played a very valuable role in bringing forward as part of that committee-Mr Costello-We are going to have a committee led recovery. ",25
66,Mr BEDDALL,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Honourable members opposite must be quiet. The shadow Minister went through a number of points on which I think we must actually correct him. I start off with his housing starts, because this motion was supposed to be one about small business and housing, and he paid little respect to the housing sector. He quoted 1984, but he forgot to quote 1982-83, of course-the last year for which the Opposition was - esponsible and when there were 105,000 starts in Australia. The housing industry collapsed under its previous policies .. This year, have 137,700 starts predicted and the Indicative Planning Council is actually predicting 144,000 starts in 1991-92, which indicates obviously a very stable, very good housing sector. That is reflected in what would be a significant boost to the economy. The shadow Minister talked about record high interest rates. He also forgets that this Government has never reached the interest rates that were recorded in that 1982-83 period. He also talked about the training levy and indicated that he had a very strong position on the training guarantee levy. Perhaps he should consult with his other shadow Minister, because the honourable member for Forrest is quoted in the House, on 10 May this year in the grievance debate, as saying that the exemption should apply to a business with a pay-roll of more than $200,000, whereas the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), only six days later on 16 May this year, said that perhaps firms with payrolls below $200,000 should pay the levy. So the Opposition should really get its facts straight. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to outline now some of the things that are in train. The Government's response, as I said, has been tabled today by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), and the fact is that the Government has a very sustainable policy for small business. What we have had from the shadow Minister today is a knee-jerk reaction-nothing at all about the long term structural problems facing the small business sector in this country. If interest· rates were 5 per cent tomorrow, if there were maximum employment-all of those things in place...:... - there would still be fundamental structural problems in the small business sector. None of those have been addressed by the Opposition. In the last election campaign, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) responded positively to the small business communi-- in relation to the report. The OpposItIon Leader of the day, the honourable mem respond at all. Nothing has come from the Opposition-no policy, no direction, we nothing-since the report was released. But it is imperative now that we get on record what is in train. I would like to address a range of issues the Government has been working ori. In relation, firstly, to policy coordination and development, one of the things that we feel is very important in addressing the long term and medium term l?roblems faced in the small busmess community is a common national approach. Following on from the Special Premiers Conference and in relation to the recommendations in the report of the inquiry into small business, I have today written to all State Ministers inviting them to attend a ministerial meeting, because it is important that we get a coordinated approach around Australia. I have talked consistently with a number of Ministers from all States 'about this, and there is a great degree of support from them. Also, we will continue the policy of the small business forums. The first 'one was in February of this year, and we will convene another small business forum with all the peak councils of the employer groups. throughout Australia. That will again give the industry the time and opportunity to develop programs and policies. We will have an improved information base because it is important for the small business sector to be able to identify the particular areas of government that are important to it, and also for a government to be able to identify the areas of concern to the small business sector. One of the problems that the small business sector has consistently had is that it has been unable to identify for government various concerns that it has because it has been unable to get access to a database, and that is very important if we are to make responsible concerted decisions about the small business sector. It is also important that we address the way that government imposes on small business through paper work and through regulation. That is why we have developed a paper work reduction strategy. Mr Costello-How many pages does that cover?",26

71,Mr BEDDALL,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The unfortunate thing for the shadow Minister is that although I gave him the opportunity to speak and to put forward alternative points of view-of which we heard nothing-he does not like to listen. That is why the shadow Minister is not taken seriously in the small business community. If one mixes with members of that community one finds that they do not even know who he is. That is unfortunate because it is important that we get not a bipartisan view but some sort of common ground. If the shadow Minister wanted to put in some work, that would be fine; but unfortunately he does not. He just wants to interject because he has no constructive propositions to put forward. That is a practice that many Opposition members adopt, unfortunately, but it is not one which is very helpful to the small business sector.  policies.",27
72,Mr BEDDALL,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,No policies!  have-,27
73,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Order! The honourable member will cease interjecting.,27
74,Mr BEDDALL,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The issues are identified in the report. It is a shame, but I do not think that the shadow Minister has ever read it. As we went around the country, we tried to find out what was needed. We are not about imposing a view on small business but trying to bring together the views of the small business community. As the shadow Minister said in his tirade, there were 66 recommendations. Those recommendations were about finding ways the Government can assist. Government cannot tell small business how to operate. What it can do is try to create a better framework for business to operate in. I have consistently said it is the responsibility of government to get off the back of small business. Perhaps Opposition members do not like to hear words like 'paperwork reduction strategies' or 'activities designed to reduce the burden on small business'. What they should try to understand is tijat that is one of the ways government can most assist. When we went around and talked to members of the small business sector, that is what they said to us-that the best thing government can do is get off their backs. Unfortunately, members of the Opposition have a little speech that they make every time about how the small business sector is very important, but is just a motherhood statement-they do not really understand the problems. That is why we are trying to address, on a whole range of issues, how government impacts on small business-certainly relation to finance for small business, which is a very important issue for the small business sector. We are moving towards addressing what we believe are the major problems facing the small business sector. These have been principally defined as the lack of finance and the lack of managerial training. It a truism to say that being a good tradesman does not necessarily make one a good small business operator. We have said it is important, therefore, for there to delivery mechanisms for management training. We have said consistently that this delivery mechanism should be proa vided through the States. It is not the Commonwealth to set up those mechForrest, anisms because many States have exthat tremely good small business development corporations. They provide management training for people on how to run a small business, and even starter courses people contemplating starting a small business. The Queensland Small Business Develber for Forrest! opment Corporation and the Western Australia Small Business Development Corporation in particular perform a very useful role in addressing the fundamental management training problems of the small business sectors. The other are not as good but, hopefully, after cussions with Ministers we will be able encourage them to deliver those services. The great tragedy of the small business sector-and no-one denies the number of tion is very clear-failures in that sector-is that many of those failures could be avoided by people knowing what was involved before they started a business. By ensuring that, could provide a very helpful policy framework for them to operate under. In the Budget, in relation to that, decided to continue and expand the tional information and awareness proest gram because it is aimed at delivering those services to the small business sector through the three most important confor it tacts that it has: the bank manager, the accountant and the lawyer. If we can make those people aware of what is available to advise small business, we will be able to help those people in most need, and that in is extremely important. In relation to the availability of capital, we recommended during the inquiry-this has been taken up by the Governmentthat the Industry Commission also take on the issue of capital availability of the small business sector. It is proposed that the inquiry commence before the end of is this year and report within 12 months. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has anthat nounced that the House of Representabe tives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration will inquire into and report on the banking sector. We had very strange comment from the shadow up to Minister, the honourable member for about the banks when he said we should not blame the banks for high margins; that we should have gone and talked to the Commonwealth Bank.  for those blamed the banks.",27

But I do not think he would have much support that in the small business community.  Mr Deputy Speaker. The Minister is deliberately misreading. I did not say that wanted to reregulate the banks.",28
79,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Order! There is no point of order. I remind the honourable member for Forrest that he is sorely trying the patience of the Chair.,29
80,Mr BEDDALL,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Not only does he know little about small business; he also knows little about the Standing Orders. The strategy that we have tried to develop and that we hope will now come to full fruition has been long and arduous. I am extremely pleased that we have been able to produce what I feel is the most comprehensive Government response to any report that I have seen tabled in this liament. It is a unique report in the sense that I as the Minister do not actually have a great deal of carriage of each individual recommendation, so it has involved a great deal of cooperation between me and other Ministers, particularly the Treasurer and the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy). In the report we have outlined many of the ways that we can progress those recommendations and bring them to fruition much quicker than would normally be the case. As I have said, the whole framework is of great importance to the small business sector because the problems facing the small business sector are always cyclical. But in terms of medium to long term problems we have a great deal of opportunity now to address those problems. I would like also to touch briefly on some of the tax recommendations because without doubt the tax recommendations in the report were the most contentious. It was interesting, as we talked to people around Australia during the inquiry, that the area on which we received most representations was that of compliance-the cost of compliance and the difficulty of complying with tax regulation. That is why I am pleased that the Australian Taxation Office has now undertaken a series of measures that will very quickly address those compliance issues. The Government has already announced that reducing compliance and reporting costs will be a high priority for the sales tax and pay as you earn (P AYE) I taxpayers. We have also announced that on two of the recommendations in the report action will be taken as from 1 July 1991. We will continue a series of measures, in particular a major review of the wholesale tax system and a small business working group on compliance within the Australian Taxation Office. The Australian Taxation Office is also examining options for integrating the PAYE, prescribed payments system and fringe benefits tax business systems so as to improve service and reduce compliance costs. One of the most important things that the Australian Taxation Office has been Parable to do is to set up small business liaison committees in each branch office of the Australian Taxation Office. This is a revolution in terms of thinking in the Australian Tax Office and will be greatly welcomed by the small business community, as it is a move towards getting a better understanding of the small business community. This has been a wonderful opportunity to see two things-the Government's commitment to small business and the lack of commitment by the Opposition to the small business sector.",29

82,Mr FORD,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Small business has been decimated and continues to be decimated. It is a matter of public importance and it should be addressed today. It does not matter where one looks in primary production-farmers, fruit growers and potato growers are in deep trouble everywhere. In the manufacturing industry businesses are closing everywhere. As the honourable member  the construction and housing industries are decimated. In the service industry many businesses are closing each day, even the small computer companies and hightech companies. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) talks about some business casualties. We are not talking about a few casualties, we are talking about the annihilation of a huge sector of the community. It would be the biggest knee jerk in industry-Mr Rocher-Who is the jerk?",29

84,Mr FORD,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The honourable member for Forrest is right. In many instances the such red tape. lives of these people are shattered. I will use an actual example-one Beverley Marshall, a single parent who has raised two great children. Her children are now grown up. She commenced and ran the Secretarial Diploma College Ltd in Frankprise ston, in the heart of Dunkley, all without any assistance. She did not receive one dollar. The college no longer exists and 25 full and part time lecturers are gone, most without their full entitlements. Why has this college disappeared? It started with the withdrawal of subsidies to local students, the coup de grace being the solute fiasco with overseas students two Ministers got their wires crossedand all this on top of the high interest rates. I use this example because the Educashould tion Services (Export Regulation) Bill 1990 on the have is currently before this House. the earmarks of another fiasco concerning there is an alarming Is control of the colleges. What about the the community and particularly students and, more importantly, about the Government? Will this Bill create more Beverley Marshalls? What decimated this industry was government action, not industry problems. This Bill represents more regulation. What training does the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) offer to prevent further Beverley Marshalls? Such people would never survive such a debacle. I now come generally to deregulationa misused word if ever there was one. It short for 'devouring regulations', I am sure. Red tape is surely strangling small business. Instead of being able to concentrate on new enterprise, whether it be in selling, growing, building or manufacturthere is always somebody wanting a The form or giving a reason why a person cannot do what seems most logical to him a or her. Affirmative action; bounties-if one is entitled to them-permits and liccompany laws; excise duties; the fringe benefits tax; employment records covering annual leave, long service leave and sick leave; payroll tax; sales tax; prescribed payments; product liability; tax file numbers and the training levy-the new regulation the Government has just brought in-are just a few examples of Micro-economic reform could help. If ever it could be applied, it could be applied to small business. In Queensland, the Goss Government has banned enterbased employment agreements. I ask the Treasurer and the Minister whether they realise that many of the 61 companies with such agreements lifted productivity by as much as 80 per cent. Do they also realise that the employees in these companies were better off under enterprise based agreements and that the emabployees are now paying less tax because when they are earning less? Far from progressing, we are going backwards. If we look at the Government's attempt on the wharves, we see that this is also a problem. By now we reduced the number of people wharves by 500, yet we have emIt has all ployed another 200. it any wonder that lack of confidence in in the what small business community? Apart from the industrial relations fiasco, there are many others-too many to address today, but some are common to all industries. Interest rates may be down some four or five points, but for small business they are still 16 per cent to 20 per cent. Perhaps the Treasurer can explain how small business can compete with interest rates of, say, 6 per cent to 8 per cent in Asia? He cannot. Can he explain how primary producers can compete on world markets? He cannot. What about Government-controlled charges and taxation? The system is ever more compli. cated and the money is due very much earlier, as the honourable member for Forrest just indicated. Unless the Treasurer has a very special crystal ball, his Budget may be very wrong. His income, his tax take, may take quite a beating. Sad dam Hussein forcing up oil prices may be the Treasurer's only salvation. Small business certainly will not be. Look at inflation-another massive problem for small businesses. I hope the current trend continues, but for many it is too little, too late. What is happening in regional areas throughout Australia, but particularly in Victoria, is a debacle. I ask the Treasurer: How can a regional enterprise prosper or even survive with high interest rates, high inflation, high fuel costs, high freight costs, and a huge number of rules and regulations? I ask the Minister for Small Business and Customs, who was at the table, what the national approach would do, what a peak body meeting would do, what an information base would do, what a paperwork destruction strategy would do for these people in regional areas? Nothing. I ask the Minister: Will the small business training program also ensure that these people survive? I think not.  make any more money.",30
85,Mr FORD,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"It certainly would not. Mr Speaker, I am talking about real people. They are Australians like you and me. The misery the Treasurer has caused in this community is something he should be ashamed of. Maybe it has something to do with the white limo with dark windows. Maybe it is a reflection of his selfdoubt. Apart from individual business proprietors, what about the staff of failed businesses? They did not get their termination redundancy payments. The money was not there. It went on high interest rates. These families continue to suffer, through no fault of their own. One criticism levelled at small business is that we do not update our equipment. If small businessmen do, it is likely to make their miserable lives even more miserable. Try making ends meet when lease payments hover between 20 and 30 per cent. Most small businesses have not even re-equipped; that is, 50 per cent of our industry has not generally re-equipped. If the Treasurer is to be believed, with all the capital equipment that has been flooding into this country for the last few years the other half must be in great shape. I think the reality is hidden, as many other things in this society are hidden.

Mr Atkinson-In the public sector.",32
97,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Order! The honourable member for Isaacs!,32
98,Mr MELHAM,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"No honourable member comes into this place and says that times are not tough. Of course we are going through tough times. Of course times are difficult for small business, but the Government has a strategy. There are no quick fixes. There are no short term political solutions. There needs to be a strategy and the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) has put forward a strategy on small business, and I commend it to Opposition members. What has the Opposition put up? Nothing! Only empty words and rhetoric have come from the champions of free market economics, the economic rationalists on the Opposition benches. What are they calling for? More government intervention? What is it? Free market forces or government intervention? Of course, there has been some rationalisation in small business. But let us have a look at the figures because the Opposition misquotes them. the Total bankruptcies in the quarter from June to September 1990 were certainly up by 29 per cent. But what the figures include, and what the Opposition does not tell us, are personal as well as business bankruptcies. Those figures are separated only at the end of each financial year, and we are still waiting for the business bankruptcy figures for 1989-90. What is established is that historically over the last decade the level of business bankruptcies has been very stable. Personal bankruptcies are the ones that account for the most changes. In any event, bankruptcies account for a very small proportion of small business closures or failures and bankruptcy figures are not a reliable indicator of the state of small business. Another myth that the Opppsition brings into this chamber is that there has been a collapse in the housing sector. One statistic for the Fraser years that is beyond dispute is that in the seven and a bit years of the Fraser Government the maximum figure for dwelling commencements was 108,000. That is the great record of the conservative forces. In 198990, under this Government, dwelling commencements were 137,710. That compares favourably with the average number of commencements over the last 10 years of 137,700, remembering that the best figure under the Fraser Government was 108,000. . In 1988-89 there was a record high commencement of 175,000. The historical high of 1988-89 was a boom that had the housing industry operating at unsustainable levels and placed large cost pressures on consumers, and everybody concedes that. An activity level of 137,000 does not place any supply side pressures on housing costs and it is a sustainable industry level. What are the forecasts in terms of housing? Opposition members come in here with their matter of public importance and say that there has been a collapse in the housing sector. The forecasts by the Indicative Planning Council (lPC) are for commencements of 131,000 in 1990-91, a drop of only 5 per cent. However, 131,000 is still a moderate level of activity. It is much better than the 105,000 commencements that occurred in 1982-83, the last year of the Fraser Administration. The Opposition does not like to hear those figures, but that is its record in government. The Opposition had its opportunity and it blew it. It had no strategy and that is why it was thrown out of office. That is why for four successive elections the coalition has been rejected by the people of Australia; if it keeps this up, its fifth defeat will be around the corner. The IPC forecasts housing commencements to increase to 144,000 in 1991-92, with activity beginning to pick up in early 1991-that is the so-called collapse in the housing sector that the Opposition proffers. The recently announced further reductions in home loan mortgage rates, coupled with the easing in housing prices, should encourage prospective home buyers back into the market. The IPC predicts that underlying requirements, long term projections of housing demand based on socio-demographic changes for new dwellings, will average around 153,000 or a little bit lower over the next five years. The historical high demand of 1988-89 certainly soaked up a lot of these requirements. But 144,000 in 1991-92 represents a return to balance. The Chicken Littles of the Opposition who come in here and tell us that the sky is falling in need to step back a little bit and take a breath because although they talk about encouraging confidence in the community, the way in which they carry on does nothing at all to encourage it. They run around as prophets of doom. I can tell the House that the recipe for disaster is there if a conservative government comes into power. Mr Bradford-Don't quit your other job, Daryl.",32

103,Mr HOLLIS,AUSTRALIA,"In accordall;ce with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, I present the report relating to the following proposed work: Refurbishment of Head Office, Reserve Bank of Australia, Martin Place, Sydney, New Wales. Ordered that the report be printed.",33
104,Mr HOLLIS,AUSTRALIA,"by leave-The eighth report of the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works which I have just presented deals with the refurbishment of the head office of the Reserve Bank of Australia in Martin Place, Sydney. The proposal which the Public Works Committee examined is for the removal of asbestos, the refurbishment of the facade, the upgrading of the building services and fire sprinkler system, and the installation of new ceilings, lighting and carpets. When referred to the Committee, the cost estimate for the proposed work was $86m. This estimate was reduced to $77.2m during the course of the Committee's inquiry. Mr Simmons-A wonderful - ommittee.",34
105,Mr HOLLIS,AUSTRALIA,"Yes, a good committee. Before arriving at the recommendation that the work proceed, the Committee undertook a thorough analysis of matters relating to the location of the bank and the practicality of selling off the building in Martin Place and relocating the head office on a green fields site. The Committee concluded that in order to carry out its supervisory responsibilities in relation to the banking system and to provide banking service to its clients, it is desirable for the Reserve Bank to be located in the central business district of Sydney, especially in Martin Place. In terms of the green fields option, the Committee concluded that the higher capital cost of relocating the head office to a green fields site and the low rate of capitalisation do not compare favourably with the benefits in terms of bank operations and capitalisations associated with remaining in the central business district. The scope of the Committee's inquiry, which is covered in the report, was prompted by the relatively high cost of the refurbishment. None of the components of the refurbishment, asbestos removal, facade re-cladding and internal refurbishment, come cheaply. There is also a need for the Reserve Bank to continue operating while the refurbishment is being undertaken. I can assure the House that South the Committee went to some lengths to ensure that the internal refurbishment will not be lavish and will conform to current standards for modern offices. The Reserve Bank assured the Committee that all finishes will be consistent with those of a good quality commercial building, and the refurbishment has been based on a design life of 15 to 20 years. The Committee has recommended that during the life of the project it be advised by the Reserve Bank on a regular basis of progress and actual expenditure on the proposed work. It has also recommended that the Reserve Bank investigate the concept of joining with other banks located in the central business district to provide a child-care facility for their employees. I commend the report to the House. NA (PLANNING AND LAND NA BILL 1990 Bill presented by Mr Simmons, and read a first time. Second Reading",34
106,Mr SIMMONS,MANAGEMENUAMENDMENT," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Amendment Bill is to amend the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988 by extending from one year to two years the period within which the National Capital Plan is to cover the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). Subsections 57(1) and 57(2) of the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act provide: (1) When the Governor General is satisfied that the National Capital Plan sufficiently covers the Territory, the Governor General shall, by Proclamation, declare that the transition period ends on a day specified in the Proclamation. (2) The day specified shall not be later than one year after Self Government Day. The drafting of the National Capital Plan was completed in February 1990 following a process of public consultation. However, the approvals processes, which include consultation with the ACT Executive on the Plan, its approval by the Minister and consideration by the Parliament, could not be completed, largely because of the intervention of the Federal election and the application of the convention that Ministers do not take policy decisions which may commit an incoming government. My Department, the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, received advice from the Attorney-General's Department which indicated in part that, although the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act shows a parliamentary expectation that the National Capital Plan will sufficiently cover the Territory within one year after self-government day-that is, by 10 May 1990-the Act does not impose on anybody any duty in this regard. It also indicated that if the National Capital Plan was not in effect until after 10 May 1990, the Governor General could declare the end of the transition period, under section 57(1) of the Act, to be later than 10 May 1990, notwithstanding section 57(2) of the Act, and that the transition period would not automatically come to an end on 10 May 1990. However, it is possible that a court may decide that this is not the case, and that the transition period has ended. Such a judgment would mean that the Australian Capital Territory has no valid planning. system. In order to remove any possible doubt as to the status of decisions taken in the period since the expiration of the oneyear period set out in the Act-that is since 10 May 1990-this Bill seeks tprovide a period of two years rather than the existing one-year period. The draft National Capital Plan has been recently submitted to me for approval and is now under consideration. I present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill and commend the Bill to the House.

The main proposals contained in the Bill relate to: (1) amendments to the Customs Act 1901 to provide the legislati ve framework for the introduction of an electronic entry and cargo reporting system for exports (Exit) and the consequential repeal of the export return scheme (clauses 15 to 23); (2) the repeal of sections 64 and 74 of the Customs Act 1901 and the introduction of new sections to provide for the advance reporting of ships and aircraft and their cargo and crew, including the electronic reporting of such information (clause 10), and the corresponding tightening of Customs control over the un shipment of imported goods, especially where no cargo report in respect of such goods has been provided, or where such report is not provided sufficiently in advance (clause 12); and (3) the saving of the prohibited imports status of dangerous goods under item 18 of the second schedule of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations, which was declared invalid by the Full Federal Court in the recent case of Owen v. Turner and Jones· (clause 49). I will now refer briefly to each of those proposals. Introduction of Exit and Repeal of the Export Return Scheme The public and private sectors have for some time been pursuing the considerable cost savings available through the use of electronic technology to improve the flow of cargo documentation and information. The Australian Customs Service is playing a crucial role in this reform through its development of a number of electronic initiatives. Exports integration, or Exit, is one of these initiatives, and is one of the largest electronic data interchange initiatives undertaken in Australia to date. The reports and clearances which the Exit system allows to be computerised provide the basis for Customs control over Australia's exports. They are also the main source of data for the export component of the periodic balance of payments assessments. Prior to Exit it waS'the export return scheme which provided the principal reporting mechanism for export trade statistics. Administration of the export turn scheme over the past 12 years has shown the scheme to be an unsatisfactory arrangement which does not meet Australia's basic control and statistical requirements. Firstly, Customs control over high risk exports is undermined, as most exports are not reported to Customs until after cargo has left the country. Secondly, over the past few years inadequacies have become apparent in the statistical information provided through the scheme. It is for these reasons that the Government has proposed the repeal of the export return scheme and the introduction of the Exit system for electronically reporting exports prior to shipment. Given the economic significance of Australia's balance of payment figures, it is considered that export trade statistics should be collected on a similar basis to imports. In other words, they should be recorded on computer prior to Customs clearance. Despite the introduction of an electronic option under the Exit system, exporters will not be forced to become direct participants in the new regime. Exporters may either join Exit directly, engage the services of a registered Exit user-a freight forwarder, Customs agent, et cetera-or utilise the traditional paper based preshipment export entry scheme. To facilitate the latter process, exporters will be permitted to lodge paper entries by facsimile. Close to 1,000 exporters have voluntarily joined the Exit system since trials began and, as a result, in July 1990, over 65 per cent of our export trade was reported electronically. The Australian Customs Service and the pioneering members of industry who have participated in the development of Exit have tackled an ambitious program aimed at taking export reporting into the twentyfirst century. Clauses 15 to 23 of the Bill seek to provide an appropriate legislative basis for the continued operation of the Exit system. Those clauses are explained in greater detail in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. As a result of the proposed new export reporting regime for the Customs Act re- 1901, consequential amendments are necessary to the Excise Act 1901. This will provide uniformity in the treatment of all exported goods, whether excisable or otherwise, and is effected by the proposed amendments contained in part 3 to the Bill. Repeal of Sections 64 and 74 and the Introduction of New Sections Clauses 10 and 12 of this Bill propose the repeal of sections 64 and 74 of the Customs Act 1901 and the introduction of new sections to provide for the advance reporting of ships and aircraft and their cargo and crew. Clause 10 also proposes an electronic reporting option for this information in line with other initiatives of the Customs Service, and amendments to the Customs Act to provide for paperless reports and entries. This will expedite the clearance of inward cargo, and benefit the importing community and Australian consumers generally. The Government considers that the requirements for advance reporting of cargo will also tighten Customs control over the unshipment of imported goods and aid in targeting risk cargo to protect the Australian community against the illegal importat ion of narcotics and other prohibited imports. Item 18 Amendments The purpose of the amendments contained in clause 49 of the Bill is to valicould date past seizures of dangerous goods, which had been seized on the basis that they were prohibited imports pursuant to item 18 of the second schedule to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. Item 18 was introduced into the Regulations on 14 December 1956, and prohibited the importation of 'goods which, in the opinion of the Minister, are of a dangerous character and a menace to the community'. Since 1956 item 18 has been used to prevent the circulation into the general community of dangerous goods such as machine guns; land mines; flame throwers; flick knives; toys contaminated with dangerous levels of lead, heavy metals other poisons; unsafe children's toys which do not meet Australian Safety Standards; and many other dangerous goods. The Federal Court of Australia has cently found that item 18 is invalid. basis of its decision is that item 18 is unauthorised delegation of the Governor35, General's power in section 50 of the toms Act 1901 to prohibit the importadum. tion of goods. The result is that goods previously understood to be prohibited memorandum. imports under item 18, and therefore able to be seized by Customs, are in fact not prohibited imports at all. .. , The Government has already addressed the future control of dangerous goods by repealing item 18 and inserting new items into the Regulations to prohibit the importation of most former item 18 goods. This was effected by Statutory Rule No. motion by Mr Crean: 324 of 11 October 1990, less than one month after the Full Federal Court's decision. The present amendment in this Bill is intended to address the status pre-11 October 1990 action under the item 18 prohibition. This House has long been careful when faced with provisions which are retrospeccolleagues tive in effect and operate to remove zens' rights, and properly so. In this circumstance, however, the Government is of the view that the amendment is both justified and necessary. The alternative would be the possibility that Customs be required to release into the general community the bombs, guns, unsafe toys, flick knives, et cetera, that had been seized in good faith in the belief that item 18 was valid. Both the necessity of this provision, and the suggested commencement date for it, have been the subject of advice from the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department, a copy of which was provided as a matter of courtesy to the Opposition spokesperson for small business, housing and customs, the honourable member for  Other Amendments In addition to the amendments already outlined, the Bill also proposes three furor ther amendments which deal with the control of narcotic goods, and the consequences of their illegal importation. The need for these amendments arises from matters identified by the courts and the reOffice of the Commonwealth Director of The Public Prosecutions. These amendments, an which are contained in clauses 26, 27, 30, 36 and 38 of the Bill, are explained Cusin detail in the explanatory memoranI commend the Bill to the House and present its accompanying explanatory Debate (on motion by Mr Jull) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1990 Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 October, on That the Bill be now read a second time.",35
108,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"Dawson) (4.07)I note that we have 12 minutes in which of to debate the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 because of the guillotine imposed by this Government. 'I think it is a tragedy that some of my who would dearly like to speak citiin the debate on this Bill will not be afforded the chance. The Opposition is not going to oppose the measure, but I think it is fair to look at the history the Child Support Agency, because those of us who have been in this House for number of years will recall with some horror the early implementation of Family Law Act. Many problems relating to custody and maintenance were dismonthly cussed with us on a weekly basis by disor satisfied constituents. At that stage system that allowed the court to ignore the income of the parties and relied on the payment of a sole parent benefit needed a lot of improvement. As a result of those things, the Act has been changed considerably, and hence the child support program was initiated. It is interesting, when one looks at the genesis of this scheme, to see what objectives were and see what was happensigned ing under the Family Law Act at the time. The objectives were that non-custodial parents should share the cost of their dren according to their capacity to pay; that adequate support be available for children of separated parents; that Compressed monwealth expenditure be limited to what was necessary to ensure that those needs be met; to ensure that neither parent would be discouraged from participating in the work force; and that the overall arrangement would be simple, flexible, efficient, and respect personal privacy. The other point that should be mendures tioned is that the objectives set out the duty of the parents was to maintain the child and that this duty took priority over all other commitments, save only that of self-support. I think they are very noble objectives. When we look at the operations of the Agency over the last few years we realise that there are still considthat erable concerns, particularly with those areas where former parents have been able to make some voluntary arrangement and ensure that the maintenance arrangethis ments are being kept up. We have the insistence of the Child Support Agency which still renders accounts asking those people paying maintenance to pay up or else, even though the satisfactory resoluacross tion has been reached and payment has been made. The other problem that I have noticed concerns the Agency, apparently as a matof ter of principle, transferring a weekly maintenance order from the court into a a monthly payment, thereby ignoring the fact that payments of salaries and wagesthe from which maintenance payments are normally taken-are not made on a basis. They are made on a weekly fortnightly basis, but not on a monthly the basis. Because of this change of procedure, I have seen considerable corresolely spondence entered into between constituents and the Agency, quibbling over matters of $1 or $2. I think there should be some rationale and sense brought into the system to make sure that this does not recur. The particular amendments at which the we are looking at the moment are deto achieve quite a few of the matters to which I would like to refer. The following changes are contemplated. One chilis to allow the amount of child maintenance payments, pursuant to a private all agreement between parents, to be exin periodic terms agreeable to the parties, rather than by an annual amount as currently required by the Registrar of the Family Court. I want to go to the analogy that I gave before. When they are expressed as a weekly amount they should not be converted to a monthly amount. Another change is to bring the procerelating to the enforcement of the that orders upon the Child Support Act into line with recent amendments to the Family Law Act. Another is to amend the secrecy provisions of the Child Support Act so as to allow counsellors to report suspected cases of child abuse to State child welfare authorities without feeling they are offending those secrecy provisions. I think that there is a lot to be said for this. There is also a lot to be said for the counsellors applying themselves to area of child abuse. All child abuse, particularly with custodial arrangements, does not necessarily come from physical abuse; it can apply in other areas. Again, I give an example of something that came my desk recently in which the counsellors were involved. The child was to be placed in one home or the other. It was allowed to remain in the home of one of the parents under a great deal of-I will not say harassment-mental anguish. When we are defining child abuse I think we have to go further than the normal definitio- and look at what happens to those chIldren affected by separation and how they might suffer. There are many c.ases known to the counsellors. This partICular state of affairs to which I have r-ferred was allowed to go on for some SIX months. It eventually involved the separation of two of the children to the discomfort of both. I believe th-t a lot should be said in this regard. The amendments also allow the Registhe trar of the Family Court to inform custolined dial parents of progress in relation to recovery ?f amounts owing to them, also !o prohIbIt .the Co-rt from making, revivcreased mg or varymg mamtenance orders on the application of a non-custodial parent where there is power to award maintement nance by administrative assessment, and also to provide that liability to pay tenance shall automatically cease on the death of a custodial parent unless maintenance order otherwise provides. I have a colleague who is most anxious to speak on this debate. In view of the fact there are only six minutes left for the debate I will conclude my remarks beting cause we are not opposing the Bill and think Opposition members should be given the advantage of further debate this matter.",37
109,Mr LAVARCH,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"1 will difficulty n,?t take up much time of the House. will try to give the final Opposition speaker a few minutes. In his contribution !he shadow Minister for community servhave Ices and aged care, the honourable memand ber . for Daws0ll: (Mr Braithwaite), outlmed the mam purpose of the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill and !he - act th-t the Opposition is not opposcurrent mg It. I WIll not recanvass those issues. He also outlined a number of the probent's lems which. exist with the child support scheme as It currently operates. I generlowed a-ly also concur with some of those expenon-pension nences that he has had. I think all is honourable members would have received looked at. numerous representations about the operation of the scheme. Generally speaking, I suppose the scheme has, in a major sense, been successful. The compliance with maintenance orders has increased from the very poor levels under the Family Law Act to something approaching 70 or 80 per cent. Also, the amount of maintenance awarded under stage one by the courts has increased significantly. It is estimated that the common figure of about $39 per week per child is about $10 ahead of what it would - ave been had the previous system stayed m place. In other words, the courts, given assessment procedure which is outin stage two, have taken more regard to the actual cost of maintaining and rearing children and as a result have in the awards. That is a positive advancement. A further positive advanceis the savings to the taxpayer, in that this scheme is, in a very real sense mainmaking parents become more responsiblf()r the care of their own children. That is the where the primary responsibility obviously rests. . .. Some of the problems that should be dealt with include the question of delay. There are still considerable delays in getawards settled with the Agency. I also L have great difficulty witli the assessment forms which are sent to non-custodial on parents. They are extremely complicated. I have a legal background and I have also practised in family law, yet I have some' in understanding these forms. So I one can imagine the confusion of someone who has just picked up the form and who tries to make head or tail of it. I ""a lot of sympathy for those people I would like to think that the assesshas ment forms could be simplified. A further problem that exists with the scheme is the way it operates with the incomes test on the supporting parpension. I think it is a bit harsh in as much as there is a lesser amount alfor custodial parents by way of income before their pension reduced. I think that that could also be I certainly support these amendments. I do believe that the scheme could be modified and improved, but it is certainly going in the right direction.",39
110,Mr ROCHER,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"The coalition has no substantive objections to these amendments to the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about some aspects of the operation of the child support scheme and its administration by the Child Support Agency in the Australian Taxation Office. Since the scheme commenced on 1 June 1988 it has been an administrative and bureaucratic nightmare, particularly from the point of view of many of the custodial parents and ultimately the children whom the scheme is ostensibly meant to benefit. Honourable members are no doubt familiar with many of these problems as a result of difficulties brought to their attention by some of their constituents. Honourable members opposite, however, might feel constrained in criticising the operations of one of the creatures own Government. The common complaint levelled against the Child Support Agency is that of harassment involving people who are content with their own private maintenance arrangements and yet have been pestered by the Agency for their failure to take up the option of having the Agency act on their behalf. This harassment reflects the principal incentive of those in the welfare bureaucracy which is to maximise the number of clients they supposedly serve and to increase the extent of their bureauare cratic empires. If there is one thing that characterises the public service literature on the subject of the child support sch'eme it is the desire to extend this scheme to include the maximum number of eligible children. Although it is desirable that scheme be extended to such an extent as will relieve the taxpayer of the burden of otherwise unsupported children, the scheme should not expand at the expense of pre-existing arrangements that are satisfactory to the parties concerned. In August the report of the child support evaluation advisory group on the child support scheme recommended that stage two of the scheme be made retrospective to include children born before October 1989. The objective of this move is to make all children eligible under the Child Support Assessment Act 1989. Despite an initial promise by the then Minister for Social Security that this would never occur, the pressure is clearly on from the welfare bureaucracy to extend the scheme retrospectively beyond its present limits. In addition to the desire of the welfare bureaucracy to extend the scheme, numerous administrative difficulties have emerged with the operation of it. There have been outrageous delays-",40

113,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Dawson) (4.21)It appears that this time every year we caught in the situation of rushing particularly important Bills on social security, and a lot of the other social legislation, through this House. On this occasion we have b:uely got an hour or so to debate the Social Security Legislation Amend the ment Bill and discuss its many implications. Many millions of Australians will be affected by it, and the Opposition believes that this practice of guillotining important legislation is scandalous. It is scandalous that this Government is again trying to bulldoze through legislation that will affect family allowance and family allowance supplement recipients, claimants for unemployment or sickness benefits, sole parents, temporary entry permit holders-that is, Chinese nationals and certain refugees-people suffering as a result of the occurrence of a major disaster, people living in remote areas and people eligible for special benefit because they are caring for a severely handicapped person who is not an invalid or age pensioner. Yet on many of these very important matters to millions of Australians in need and to those many Australian families, this Government is allowing us only this short period of debate. In addition to those persons that I have just mentioned, the Bill requires persons who claim or are in receipt of an age pensi,on, in,:alid pension, wife's pension, carer s penSIOn, widowed person's allowance, special benefit, family allowance, sheltered employment allowance, rehabilitation allowance, widows pension class B or mobility allowance to supply their tax file number and that of their spouse, if applicable, as a precondition for receiving or continuing to receive payment. We will be mentioning something about this later on. Also, from 1 January 1991 unemployment and sickness beneficiaries will also be required to supply the tax file number of their spouse as a precondition to receiving or continuing to receive payment. Also included in the Bill are the deeming provisions on pensioners' cash and deposit holdings. It is very important to indicate to the House how serious this matter has become in the electorate and how much confusion has been spread throughout the beneficiaries and through quite a few of the financial institutions. I quote a copy of a letter that was delivered to my office on 18 September, less than a month after the. Bud.get. The letter is from a building socIety m Mackay and says: The Society is now experiencing a small number of enquiries from its pensioner members, which shows that pensioners believe they will be in a better position if they withdraw their funds in 'cash' and hold them at home so as not to lose any pension benefits. You will understand the risks associated with practice if pensioners continue to adopt this proach. This type of transaction at an institution can also be treated as a 'Suspect Transaction' and will need reporting bringing possibly further pressure on pensioners. That was just one isolated call from a building society saying what was happening right throughout the whole pension area-the needless confusion that was being inflicted on pensioners because of the Government's lack of detail at that time and the lack of understanding by pensioners of what the Government was doing. As from 1 March 1990 the Department of Social Security will deem an interest rate of 10 per cent on pensioners' cash and deposit holdings above $2,000 where such moneys are earning less than 10 per cent. The $2,000 threshold applies equally to single pensioners and married couples. The deemed return will be assessed as income for the purposes of the pension income test, although not for income tax payment purposes. Returns on sums amounting to less than $2,000 will be assessed at the actual rate of return. One particular area of concern here is loans to charitable organisations on which the organisations pay low rates of interest. This is of concern particularly in my own area of interest, aged care. We understand that, where an interest free loan is paid as part of an entry contribution at the time of entry to a hostel, deeming provisions do not apply. However, many organisations involved in providing hostel accommodation for the aged rely on an ongoing flow of cash by way of loan or by gifting an order just to survive in that establishment. The resources of these organisations are strictly limited. The importance of interest free or low interest loans being made available on an unrestricted basis is extremely critical to their survival; yet when different transactions are designed to meet exactly the same purpose they stand a real chance of being treated differently in respect of deemed income with a consequential loss of income to the resident involved. Representations from charitable and similar voluntary organisations to the this Minister for Social Security (Senator ap- Richardson) requesting consideration of exemption for truly benevolent, not-forprofit organisations in aged care from the imputation of interest at 1 per cent on pensioners' loans have apparently fallen on stony ground. The Minister fails to understand the very important part played by the charitable, non-profit sector in viding care for our elderly-a job which is becoming increasingly difficult in the present economic circumstances and with an· increasing aged population. The Minister has refused to consider such exemption. As I have said, the Minister and the Government fail to understand when it comes to social justice the implications of what it is doing to those Australians in need. To deny the use of pensioner loans at little or no interest without penalty to pensioners needing ongoing care does not make any sense whatsoever and has been' described by the voluntary care industry as tantamount to a death threat. Without a large amount of voluntary help, benevolence and low interest loans, it is not possible for the industry to comply with outcome standards demanded by the same Government, through the Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health, which is bringing this situation about. The requirement that care be provided within a homely environment requires capital expenditure considerably in excess of the cost of bare bones buildings, ment and furnishings. Voluntary help is vital in any high quality care system. Ability to attract such help depends very much upon adequate buildings and facilities and maintaining a well ordered adequate routine, evidenced by contented patients, despite the burdens of ills associated with the ageing process. We must not and cannot afford to restrict support of aged care organisations to the fees of pensioner patients and government grants. Whilst we wholeheartedly agree with the principle of requiring pensioners to maximise their returns on investment, the provisions in this Bill are only appropriate if a 10 per cent return on any level of funds at call is readily available from the major commercial banks. This is certainly not the case at the present time, and the requirement laid down by the Treasurer ° (Mr Keating) at the time of the Budget is already outdated. Pensioners ought to be expected to maximise their returns in a minimal risk environment, but if the prescribed rate of prointerest is not available at call, then at least an amount should be exempted which is sufficient to enable pensioners to have funds on hand to meet emergency requirements such as illness, funerals, home repairs and council and water rates. We propose that this be accomplished by raising the threshold to $2,000 for single pensioners and $3,000 for married couples-and I foreshadow that we will move such an amendment at the committee stage. This Bill sets the assets test threshold for the payment of family allowance at $500,000. At Budget time, the threshold was nominated as $300,000. The assets test threshold for payment of the family allowance supplement will be indexed to increase from the present level of $322,750 to $347,500. Again, a threshold of $200,000 was announced in the August Budget. The threshold for payment of Austudy and assistance for isolated children will also be indexed to increase from the present level of $322,750 to a figure of $347,500. Again, a threshold of $200,000 was nominated for parental asequip- sets at the time of the Budget. The Government did not even think this through right at the beginning before spending about $400,000 for printing, handling and postage of family allowance and family allowance renewal forms incorporating the assets test changes as an-, nounced in the Budget. The Department will now have to send out new forms and, of course, this is an additional cost to government of $400,000-a further waste of taxpayers' money. The Government has stated that these changes will principally benefit farmers and rural communities. But I ask whether the Government really appreciates the difficulties of the rural and the farming community. Again, I read from a letter sent by one of my constituents that sets this out in its proper perspective. In writing to me, my constituent said: I am. writing to you about the new Family Allowance laws, which seem to have no standing of people on the land or others their assets totally tied up in their businessllivemental lihood. I recently received a letterit was apparently from the Department of Social Securityasking us questions about our combined income and assets which has obviously been sent mothers. From now on there will be no Family Allowance if your assets are over $300,000again, it has been increased(not including your house) and your combined income is over $62,057. This sounds fair not to accept help from the Government in economic times however $300,000 doesn't go very far in land, stock, fencing, machinery etc needed to run a property, and we realise our assets are over that figure. I hasten to add that, all same, we could not make a living out of this property to support our family on and my husband has to work at the mines. Even so our combined taxable income for the past three is considerably less than the amount allowed. Upon checking those· figures, I find that she is absolutely right. The figures go from $16,600 in the 1987 year to less than $30,000 in 1988-89. The letter continues: We have no beach house, boat or money invested, everything we have is tied up in the erty. We work 7 days a week very long hours as the property does not support us let alone employee it makes it very hard for us to get together. The Government is denying these stretches people-the real salt of the earth, the real people in the runtl and country commutheir nities-access to a family allowance cause of the value of their property. again: Does the Government really underLiquid stand the plight of people in the rural farming communities? I suggest that if the Government really wanted to help these farmers who have been hit hard by the severity of the rural downturn and by the deterioration in the estimated farm income as a result of Government's own economic policy it would abolish the assets test on the family allowance. The Opposition will move an amendment in committee to do just that. The Opposition regards the family allowbenefit ance as a very important source of ingifted come for many farmers. Therefore, we do not think it is appropriate to have an assets test which has a very different imunderpact depending upon where people are, with all and which does not address the fundaquestions of targeting, which is addressed by income tax. While I have been talking in this respect of farmers and people in the country areas, I also want to emphasise that the same lot has befallen many of the small to all businesses right around Australia. The problem exists where property is owned which is not easily disposable, which is in excess of what the Government wants to target and which is returning a very meenough diocre income. Some small business tight people, as has been mentioned in debate today, are facing the threat of bankruptcy. Under this legislation, applicants for the either sickness benefits or unemployment benefits will be required to wait an additional four weeks before receiving assistyears ance if they have $5,000 or more in liquid assets, defined as cash or other readily realisable property, including shares and· debentures, deposits with financial institutions, and amounts owed by a person's former employer where such amounts are able to be paid. Assets such as superanpropnuation roll-overs will not be counted. and The idea that shares and debentures are an readily negotiable and readily realisable away in the current zero economic growth that this country is facing at the moment the imagination of Opposition members. In fact, if people were to take shares out of some of the companies be that they might be lodged with at the I ask moment, there would be a severe loss. assets held by or on behalf of a and spouse or dependent children will also have to be taken into account. We believe that this provision does not go far enough. This tightening of eligibility criteria could be evaded by temporarily giving liquid assets to a close relative the or friend. To ensure the Government's intentions are not frustrated, in committee the Opposition will move an amendment to require a four-week wait if, within three months of the initial application for being lodged, an applicant has an amount in liquid assets so as to come below the $5,000 threshold. The proposal is primarily aimed at catching persons who engage in casual employment for a limited period, accumulate a substantial amount of money and then apply for benefits whilst awaiting the next season. However, we would not want to cause hardship to low income earners who accumulate modest savings or sole parents-and here I foreshadow an amendment to exempt persons who would otherwise be placed at a long term disadvantage by the four-week waiting period. New residency requirements are proposed for the receipt of the special benefit. These extend special benefit eligibility to applicants for refugee status and Chinese nationals who were in Australia on 20 June 1989 and who have a temporary entry permit. We support this extension of the special benefit eligibility, but point out once again that this Government has pre-empted its own legislation: Chinese nationals have been allowed to receive the special benefit since 1 August 1990. Yet again, this Labor Government has bypassed Parliament and is seeking its retrospective approval for eligibility that has already been granted. It is treating the Parliament with the same contempt by bulldozing through all this legislation under the guillotine. The Opposition also welcomes the proposed employment entry payment to sole parents and the payments to persons who have suffered an interruption in their livelihood as a result of a major disaster. Finally-we might say last but certainly not least-I want to turn to the tax file number (TFN) extensions. The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) requires sole parent pensioners, family allowance supplement recipients and new family allowance applicants to provide the Department with their tax file number. This Bill proposes that all other social security recipients will be required to supply their tax file numbers plus those of their spouses as a precondition to receiving or continuing to receive payment. This applies to those persons in receipt of either the age, invalid, wife or carer's pension, widow's pension, family and sheltered employment, mobility or rehabilitation allowees and those in receipt of a widow's pension class B. Currently, unemployment and sickness beneficiaries must supply the Department with their tax file numbers. The Bill also proposes that, from 1 January 1991, they must also supply the tax file number of their spouses. The Bill also allows the Department of Community Services and Health to require those eligible for assistance under the first home owners scheme to supply their tax file number as a pre-condition of payment. During my speech in the House during the second reading debate on the social welfare amending legislation in September, I expressed concerns about those tax file number extensions. A range of important privacy issues must be considered in relation to data matching and the TFN extension involving using personal information for reasons other than those that were intended when the information was originally provided. At first,' the TFN was used only for tax purposes. In 1988, its use was ex'"" tended to verify the income of employees and investors. Now·the Government wants it used as an identifier in welfare eligibility checking. The Privacy Commissioner is concerned about the widening use of TFNs. On 23 August, he stated that the term 'TFN' was a misnomer as the number is now being applied to a significant social security population, some of whom have never had any contact with this tax system. He said he was most concerned that pensioners were being caught up in the operation of the TFN for purposes that were not in any way connected with tax. Again, I protest that I have to cut my time short to allow other members to speak, and I indicate that I will be moving amendments in committee.",40
114,Mr GRACE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The Bill before the House today deals with a number of measures announced in the February economic statement and the 1990-91 Budget. It contains specific measures which are part of the Government's continuing process of reform within the social security area and involves amendment to the following items: the Social Security Act 1947; the Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements (Maintenance Income Test) Amendment Act 1988; the First Home Owners Act 1953, the Health Insurance Act 1973; the National Health Act 1953; the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, and the Taxation Administration Act 1953. In today's debate I would like to deal with the specifics of one of the measures contained in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill but before I do, however, I think it would be appropriate to spend a moment or two in discussion on the background of the Bill, particularly the relationship between the Bill and the wider issue of the Government's long standing commitment to economic rationality and social equity and fairness. As members of this House would be aware, the last 7 112 years have borne ness to the unprecedented degree of reform and reconstruction at the Federal level in this country. Under the Hawke Labor Government there has been a fundamental reappraisal of the manner in which the Commonwealth conducts its business, a reappraisal based on Labor's ideals of fairness and equity, and the perate need of the 1980s and 1990s for government policies which are compatible with Australia's economic and social circumstances. Unfortunately, when it came to the treasury bench in March 1983, the Hawke Government was faced with a federal system which had been allowed to limp along with policies which belonged to an older time-a highly regulated economic framework which was out of step with modern business and trading conditions, a taxation system which discouraged effort and encouraged tax evasion on the part of the wealthy, and social policies which did not meet the necessary constraints of fairness and equity. From 1983 onwards it has been Labor's duty to make amends for the lost yearsthe 30 years of almost unbroken rule which the conservatives enjoyed since the Second World War, and which they wasted looking after the interests of their mates while Australia slipped further and further away from the pack on the back of a terminal case of policy inertia. As would be expected of a party of reform, the Australian Labor Party came to power in 1983 with a very well defined plan for the administration of social policy in Australia. Unlike honourable members on the other side of the House, who demonstrated no real commitment to the concepts of equity and fairness during their years in government prior to 1983, Labor had in place an all-encompassing social reform program which included, amongst a number of measures, the reintroduction of Medicare, the gradual winding up of pensions to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, an increase in family assistance, and a new emphasis on training and education for the unemployed and other disadvantaged groups. witThis approach to social reform compared more than favourably with the record of the conservatives, who wound down social policy and who stood by and watched as the gap between the advantaged and the disadvantaged widened. However, in looking to implement its social reform package, the Hawke Govdesernment recognised that a coordinated approach was necessary. Labor understood that it was useless to talk of equity and fairness if the economy was falling to pieces and large sections of the community were not paying their way. The Treasurer (Mr Keating), in talking about 'a levelling of the playing field', was indicating the Government's belief that policies needed to be enunciated which put fairness and an opportunity for all back into the economic system, at the same time as providing a framework for economic growth. Two of the great strengths of this Hawke Government have been its ability to understand the flow through effect from one section of the community to another, and its determination, to proceed with measures which have been right for Australia, if not necessarily popular. Of prime importance in the Government's program of reform has been the concept of targeting government initiatives, whether it be in the economic in introducing new taxes or incentives, or in the social policy area of providing programs of assistance. The approach since 1983 has been to tailor reforms according to the needs of and benefit to Australia. This has been a very successful approach which has ensured that resources have b.een allocated effectively and most fiably. As honourable members would know, in its first three terms the Hawke Government concentrated on implementing long overdue macro-economic reforms in order to get our stagnant economy moving. Measures at the time included the floating of the dollar, the deregulation of the nancial system, the implementation of a workable wages policy through the accord, and the overhaul of the taxation systemachievements which the conservatives had talked about over the years, but which had been beyond them in the actual doing. Unlike members on the other side of the House in their dying years, Labor has recognised that the economic and social reality of the 1980s was that Australia could no longer ride on the back of the 'Lasseter's Reef type of resources boom which the conservatives had fostered as the means to our salvation. Labor understood that Australia would need to compete effectively in the new world marketplace, and that it would have to develop value added industries that did not have to hide behind a wall of protection but which could stand in the international marketplace on their own. It also knew that to achieve a social policy which effectively dealt with the disparate needs of the community-such as education, health, child-care, income security, social justice and family support-scarce financial resources would need to be targeted to where they were most needed. It was the funding which was generated by the Government's macro-economic reforms which allowed meaningful social policy reforms to be implemented. Over more recent times, with policies well and truly in place which have given business the appropriate infrastructure for growth and profitability, the Government has turned its attention on the economic front field, towards Issues of a micro-economic nature. The process of structural change has become an important adjunct to the process of business growth and export expansion, which will occur despite the present difficult economic circumstances. From the Government's point of view, the procjustiess of structural change could be described as the last great frontier in the reform battle. It has been logically not possible to deal with the structural issues until all of the preceding macro-economic steps have been put in place. In some respects the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 could fi- be described as one of the last steps in the process of reform of the social policy area. All of the other steps, which have included the introduction of the concept of targeting of scarce resources, and the building of a comprehensive social policy across the full range of issues, have been necessary for the reforms of the last 12 or so months t6 take place. Since 1983 social policy has come a long way, particularly income security policy. Whereas in 1983, despite the economic shambles of the time, it was acceptable that social payments should be made, virtually regardless of income or personal wealth, in 1990 it is taken for granted that such payments should rightly be targeted to those most in need. As I have said before, Labor has understood that economic and social issues are closely interrelated. If we are to achieve economic growth in a difficult international climate, it simply must be that our resources are allocated strictly on a basis of need. It has been in response to Australia's economic circumstances that the Hawke Labor Government has been prepared to take unpopular decisions, such as its move to introduce a $2.50 fee for National Health Scheme pharmaceuticals for pensioners. Labor has had the courage to do what is right and in the interests of this country, unlike our Liberal predecessors, who, in 1982-83, when they froze pensions, still allowed those with massive assets behind them to claim a pension. It was this muddIed sort of thinking which made the Hawke Government's job much harder than it should have been when it tried balance the books and undo the damage of those wasted seven years. As I said at the commencement of speech, there is one measure contained in the Social Security Legislation Amendbanks ment Bill 1990 that I feel ought to be canvassed in this debate. It is a very publicised Budget 1990 decision to deem at a value of 10 per cent, for the purposes of pensions and benefits income tests, cash on hand and money above $2,000 ited with financial institutions. As honourable members are aware, since this decision was announced in the Budget, . there has been a great deal said about Government's pinching the savings of relating pensioners. Unfortunately, people making such statements completely misundersecurity stand both the effect of the measure and the reason for its introduction in the place. The first point that needs to be made is that a great number of pensioners will not allowance. be even remotely affected by the deeming provision, even if they have an amount above $2,000 in an account paying interpect est of less than 10 per cent. The reason for this is that pensioners are allocated income tax free zone which is $40 a week for single people and $70 a week for ried couples. Further, no tax is paid within those income limits. Therefore, for the vast majority of pensioners who do not earn substantial income apart from their pension, it is of academic value as to what amount is deemed to have been earned. I do not believe that the popular press has given as much coverage to this aspect of the decision as it has to the more sensational picture of a government with its hands in the pensioners' pockets. This measure has been introduced the Hawke Government to encourage sure pensioners to maximise their income. my electorate I have come across numerthere ous examples of pensioners who have given interest-free money to the banks and therefore deprived themselves of elderly legitimate, and probably much needed, income. One gentleman in my electorate, who had $20,000 in a cheque account and who had earned no other income, deprived his wife and himself of up to to $3,000 a year, with no effect on their pension. That is a very regrettable situation which will now come to an end as a this result of the Government's moves. The new provisions may not make the happy as they have been getting a free ride for years on pensioners' money. well But they should work for, not against, many pensioners who have unwisely misunderstood their income rights. Owing to time restraints, at this stage I commend deposthe Bill to the House. .",44
115,Mrs GALLUS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"ln speaking to the Social Security Legislation the Amendment Bill, I will address the areas to deeming of a 10 per cent interest rate on the deposits and cash of social beneficiaries, the delayed benefit for those people who are eligible for either first unemployment or sickness benefit and who have more than $5,000 in the bank and, finally, the assets test on the family The deeming provision has caused a great deal of concern to pensioners. I susthat the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) has little contact an with retired people, or he would not have introduced the provision in the way he mardid. Retired people do not like uncertainty and they are not all that keen about change, especially when it is thrust upon them and affects them directly. It is bad for their health and general well-being. But this is exactly what this Bill provided...,. - change and aggravation. When the deeming provisions were announced in the Budget, pensioners were extremely concerned. On the days following the Budget, they went to their banks by wanting to do the right thing, to make that their accounts were earning the In required 10 per cent. But when they got they found that for accounts under $10,000 they could not get 10 per cent at call. Following distress calls from my constituents, I contacted the banks in my electorate to be told that, although 10 per cent could be obtained for amounts over $10,000, not one bank in my electorate would provide 10 per cent at call for amounts under $10,000. I have since talked to other members and found that the same is true in other electorates. Consequently, I have a question to ask the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe), representing the Minister for Social Security: did the Minister presume that all pensioners had amounts above $10,000 in the bank? If not, why did he not get his Department to check that 10 per cent would be available at call for amounts below $10,000-or did he not realise the importance to pensioners of keeping money at call, that is, when the pensioners want Let me follow up this point. Unlike the Minister; pensioners do not have large sums of money coming in each month. All they have is the pension every fortnight, which they need to buy food and to pay immediate bills. Therefore, their savings play an important role as a security backup. Savings are kept in an accessible form in case of catastrophe, for a major repair or replacement, or for a funeral. But, most importantly, pensioners want the security of knowing that they can obtain their money any time they want it. For many pensioners money tied up for three months is a frightening prospect. The next point I wish to make relates directly to this previous point. Why did the Minister make no provision for in-· forming pensioners at the time of the Budget of the implications of the legislation? I am aware that a package has since gone out; but this package is three months too late. For single pensioners with no non-pension income and less than $20,800 in the bank, and married pensioners with no non-pension income and under $36,400 in the bank, the 10 per cent deeming will have no effect on the pension. Therefore, as far as the reduction of the pension is concerned, it does not matter whether pensioners are earning 4 per cent or 10 per cent so long as they earn no other income or have less than these amounts in the bank. Unfortunately, many pensioners did not realise this and spent fruitless and concerning hours trying to obtain 10 per cent-when they could not-on deposits that were not actually affected. Now there are two questions for the Minister: why did he not check out the 10 per cent interest rate; and why did he not take steps to see that pensioners understood that the deeming did not affect those with potential income under $2,080 and $3,620? Such action by the Minister would have saved many pensioners from running around from bank to bank, and from sleepless nights. What I have said so far has simply addressed the sloppy, uncaring and generally unprofessional way that the Minister went it? about introducing the legislation and assessing its effect on pensioners. Four more points need to be made on the content of the legislation. Firstly, the 10 per cent interest is fast becoming a fantasy and, as Australia sinks into recession, will have to be reduced. Secondly, for reasons that I have alluded to earlier, the $2,000 that is free from deeming is not sufficient if other money on deposit in banks cannot be invested at call. Thirdly, the legislation does not make any allowance for indexing this $2,000 to the consumer price index. That is another example of how sloppily the Minister has gone about preparing the legislation. Fourthly, in relation to the deeming provision itself, it concerns me that the Minister is telling pensioners how much they can put in their cheque account and that, if certain conditions prevail, they may have to tie up their money for at least three months. However, although I do not believe that governments should tell pensioners, or anyone else, how they should invest their money, it is appropriate that those receiving benefits should maximise their non-pension income. The Minister has taken the easy route by being heavyhanded with pensioners. Considering what has been going on, it may have been more appropriate that he looked at how the banks had been dealing with pensioners' funds. The deeming provision has revealed the extent of what I can call only a failure of duty of care by the banks. The banks have been taking advantage of pensioners. Because pensioners did not want to lose their pensions, some of them invested in low interest accounts, not understanding that for many of them their pensions were not in jeopardy-not at 10 per cent, not at 14 per cent. Pensioners have been leaving in the banks amounts up to $20,000-this is to my knowledge; I have heard that in some cases the amounts have exceeded this-at up to 4 per cent interest with the compliance of the bank managers. This has given the banks a windfall profit and has left pensioners much worse off than they needed to be. For instance, $20,000 invested at 4 per cent earns only $800 a year. Had the banks advised such a pensioner correctly, he or she would have got an extra $2,000 or more without affecting eligibility for the pension, and that pensioner would have been $1,200 better off, excluding tax and, for the moment, the pensioner health benefit card. To a pensioner $1,200 is a lot of money-an extra $23 a week; and I have watched pensioners count out every dollar. It is a reflection on the banks that they have let this type of thing go on for so long and, in many cases, encouraged it. Even pensioners who had lost part of their pension if their deposits earned the market rate of interest would have been better off by obtaining the market rate and taking a cut in the pension than by accepting a lower rate of interest. For every dollar in interest that they moved above the limit, they would have lost only 50c in the pension. The pensioners trusted the banks and their trust was misplaced. The banks should examine their record on this matter and consider the obligation that they have to advise their clients rectly, rather than using their clients' norance and fear to increase bank profits. There is one other matter of concern on deeming and that is the Minister's assurance in the Budget Papers that no pensioner currently with a pensioner health benefit card would lose that card so long as he or she kept a pension because of the deeming provisions. This means that a single pensioner who previously had an income below $5,148-which is the pensioner health card benefit limitis entitled to retain that card, even though his extra income is now considerably above that limit. For example, take two pensioners who receive $4,000 a year in superannuation. On top of their superannuation, pensioner A has $20,000 in the bank and pensioner B has $35,000 in the bank. Pensioner A gets 10 per cent interest, taking his total extra pension income to $6,000 a year, thus missing out on the fringe benefit card. Pensioner B arranges to get 3 per cent on his $35,000, giving him a total income of $5,050 a year, which enables him to get the fringe benefit card. With the Minister's assurance that no-one will lose their fringe benefit card because of the deeming, pensioner B, earning $7,500 above his pension, will still retain his fringe benefit card, while pensioner A, with $1,500 less after-pension income than B, will still not be entitled to the card. This is a crucial point as the pensioner health benefit card can be worth as much as $50 a week. The Minister has created two classes of pensioners, one more privileged than the other. By his statement in the Budget Papers, he has created an inequitable situation. I ask the Minister whether he has actually thought through the clause about pensioners not losing their fringe benefit card or whether he simply added it to avoid an electoral backlash. The second aspect of the legislation I wish to address is that regarding the delaying of payment of sickness and unemployment benefits to people who have $5,000 in liquid assets. We accept that this provision has been included to exempt from unemployment and sickness cor- benefits those people who take on high igpaying casual jobs and then decide to have a few months rest at the taxpayers' expense. It is important that we stop this type of misuse of social security payments. But the legislation may not catch these people. If that is the way they want to live, they will simply put the cash under the bed, spend it on luxury items or hand it over to someone else before they apply. for the benefit. There are currently checks on those who can obtain benefits. There is the income test and the assets test and income derived from assets is deemed to earn 10 per cent per annum. I have two fears for this present piece of legislation. Firstly, those at whom the legislation is aimed will avoid it; and, secondly, it will add hardship on families hit by unemployment or sickness. When I talk of families, I refer to both two and one parent families. These two fears have not been addressed by the legislation in its current form and I fully support the amendments foreshadowed by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) which will address these problems. I understand that the wording of the amendment is only an indication for the Minister and that a final amendment will make it clear that both single and two parent families will be covered by the hardship clause. The legislation as it now stands has the potential to harm those who are most vulnerable-the man or woman on a low income with a family who becomes sick or loses his or her job. In these hard economic times, with government induced recession, unemployment is rising. Over the next year or so we can expect to see many men and women lose their jobs. When a person loses a job, it is not an easy transition to make from a good income to unemployment benefits. Expenses cannot be simply stopped from one week to the next. A whole change in lifestyle needs to be arranged. It is during this transition period that people use some of the savings that they have to help them into the new lifestyle. By forcing the unemployed and those who get sick and have more than $5,000 in the bank to wait another four weeks in addition to the one week wait, making a total of five weeks, the Government is ensuring that their savings buffer will be considerably depleted. This provision in the legislation, as it stands, leaves those people who are hit by unfortunate circumstances with no hope at all. It is bad enough to lose a job and the income that provided without at the same time losing the savings of a lifetime. I give an example of how this liquid asset provision might work with a real life family. lam indebted to the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) for the substance of the example. Mr and Mrs Jones have two preschool children. Mrs Jones used to work and, from her working days before the children were born, has put $3,000 in the bank parent towards the down payment on a house. Since Mrs Jones left work, Mr Jones has added $1,000 a year to that amount so that Mr and Mrs Jones have $6,000 in the bank when Mr Jones loses his job in the current recession. He applies for unemployment benefits and is told that he will have to wait five weeks instead of the usual one week because of the $6,000 in their joint bank account. Because of the payments system of social security, Mr Jones does not receive his first unemployment cheque for seven weeks. In that time the family have to spend a large percentage of their savings. For the remaining period of his unemployment, Mr Jones uses the rest of his family savings to pay hire purchase on the car and make up the difference between the benefit and his li ving expenses, as modest as they are. The hope of one day buying a house is not just put on hold because of the recession, but with the loss of all their savings, is totally destroyed. The amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Dawson is necessary to protect people like Mr and Mrs Jones and sole parents in similar circumstances and to close the loophole which enables those who earn high seasonal or casual rates to take a couple of months holiday at taxpayers' expense. Finally, I would like to address the assets test that has been imposed on the family allowance. The family allowance is already subject to an income test. The addition of an assets test at this time will directly affect small business people, including farmers, who are struggling to survive in these bad times. I remind the Minister that assets in a small business are not equivalent to income. In the current situation there are many people who are failing to realise as much as 4 per cent on their assets and are therefore living close to the poverty line. It is for these reasons that we are opposed to an assets test on the family allowance. It can only further disadvantage those children of families who are already in difficult cial circumstances. It is one thing to be efficient in the outlay of taxpayers' money by the Department of Social Security and quite another to achieve a reduction in outlays at the expense of families.",47
116,Mr SNOW,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus) has touched on a number of aspects of this Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. She is someone who communicates the concerns of vulnerable people to this Parliament, but her Party wants to put the vulnerable in a box and label them as not being a Federal responsibility. The Opposition is telling us that it is too busy worrying about the serious people who want to make money and therefore the vulnerable and those who are going to receive benefits should be pushed aside. The Opposition has floated a number of ideas. It did not have the guts to float the dollar, but it is great at floating ideas about social security and health. It has talked about accountants paying benefits for the Government. It has talked about voluntary organisations paying benefits for the Government. Voluntary organisations do not want to pay benefits for the Government. They are too busy doing the job they have the best talents to do. That does not include the assessment of people for social security or health benefits. I ask members of the Opposition: Will funds be guaranteed, whatever voluntary organisations payout, for the payment of benefits? Voluntary organisations are well aware that there are very big problems with the sorts of ideas that are being floated by the Opposition. Another idea in the last election campaign was that there should be no unemployment benefits after nine months. Surely the action taken by the Government to abolish unemployment benefits next year and to require people to train is far better. Under the Government's scheme, people will receive training allowances as long as they are prepared to train, to move to a job and to .eport. Surely that is better than to say, 'Sorry, after nine months you are gone. We will forget about you'. What will voluntary finan- organisations think of that? This is typical of the Opposition's approach since it has been in oppositionthat is, since 1983. We can remember National Party members in this House saying, when the idea of an Australia Card was floated, 'Oh, yes, we will support it, but we insist on a photo'. Originally the card was only to include a number. We gave them a photo and then they said no. Then they floated the idea of supporting the card if there was a tax file number so that social security benefits and tax could be put on a database. We brought before the House a proposal for a tax file number, and some of them even opposed that within their own Party. The Opposition is great at exposing fraud, but it will not agree to any way of dealing with fraud. In this legislation we see a very good method of detecting incorrect payments through marrying data held by the Australian Taxation Office, the Department of Social Security, the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department Of Employment, Education and Training for Austudy and other payments made by that Department. I believe that the fact that we are going to tackle fraud is an important aspect of the legislation that the Opposition is overlooking. The legislation also toughens up the assets test. Here I feel that the Government is bordering on being too tough. It is now saying that a certain type of beneficiaryand it seems to me quite discriminatory--,-if he is unemployed or on sickness benefit and has $5,000 liquid assets, or money, has to dig into his savings until he starts using up that $5,000. So the tests have actually been toughened for those two types of beneficiaries. Governments of all complexions, State and Federal, have for a long time been looking at criteria for welfare payments. This Government started off with· only income tests. Some countries are finding big problems because they have no tests, and there are valid arguments used for this: the .drunk who gambled everything away and did not pay for the upkeep of his children should not be helped at the expense of some frugal person who worked hard, scraped and saved his money. Now we are discriminating against that frugal person because we are applying income tests or assets tests. The argument is that the person who scraped and saved, worked hard and did not drink or gamble is just as entitled to benefits as the former. I suppose that that could be held if we based the payment of benefits on those moral considerations. Of course, the poor person may have been a frugal person who gave much of his or her income to the poor and ensured that his or her children had a good education, while the richer person may have been a thief and a rogue. So one can see arguments for and against having no tests at all. The ultimate problem for a government, and I think both sides of the House recognise this, is that it just cannot afford to pay everyone on the basis of whether or not the person deserves it. As well, there is the terrible job of assessing who does or does not deserve the benefit. That is not really a job for government. So we have tests which prevent the diversion of money to assets by the application of the assets test and we have had some problems come before us. The Government has tried to deal with those problems through hardship and other such provisions. These do no apply to Austudy and some of the other payments. We have had complaints about Austudy. We have had complaints about assets not being defined to include the home. Someone in Double Bay or Toorak could have a home worth $1 m and still receive a full pension, perhaps with full benefits. A farmer with a house valued at approximately $30,000 or $40,000 may not receive the full pension and benefits because those assets are not enough to be counted. The test is somewhat discriminatory, but do not ask me to support change, partly because city members dominate this Parliament on both sides of the House and partly because there are old people in places such as Double Bay and Toorak who have lived in the area all their lives. They could say that it is not their fault that their home suddenly has become extremely valuable; they might not particularly Want to move from somewhere they have lived all their lives. Inevitably, there will be some anomalies and areas· of unfairness in the system. Now we have taken a further step. We have restricted payments even further for people on sickness and unemployment benefits. Here pensioners and veterans are the deserving beneficiaries and people on unemployment and sickness benefits are the undeserving beneficiaries. This is an all too prevalent attitude in our community. Perhaps I am a little unfair in saying that because we do want to keep people off unemployment and sickness benefits as far as possible. The counter-argument to that is that we ought to encourage beneficiaries into the work force and reduce long term dependence. Some positive measures have been taken in this legislation. It has allowed for an employment entry payment of $100 for people who. are long term unemployment beneficiaries, people who have been on a job search allowance. They are able to recei ve assistance with clothing- tools, equipment, transport and union fees when they enter the work force. They receive $100 so that they can get back into the system. This is extremely important. Only a fortnight ago I had someone come into my office saying that he had a job offer but he could not take the job because he could not pay union fees and he could not pay union fees because he did not have a job. That is the sort of situation people are in. This legislation is going to prevent that situation occurring. Another important measure that has been indicated by the Government is that family allowance and Austudy assets tests are going to be relieved. The very problem that the honourable member for Hawker mentioned is being overcome somewhat by the action recently taken by the Government to ease the assets test so that people will' be able to have quite considerable assets, particularly in business. There will still be some problems on the farm-although I have had only three people come to see me about such problems, even before that adjustment-but there will be far fewer problems in business because the easing of the tests is nondiscriminatory and does not apply just to farmers. It also applies to other people with assets. Another important aspect of the legislation is the provision of disaster relief where there has been interruption to the normal source of Ii velihood for a person and significant damage to a home or to a workplace in a major disaster. So there have been some extremely important actions taken by the Government. I did want to mention something raised by the honourable member for Hawkerdeeming. It appears to me that the honourable member has a valid argument when she points out that it is very difficult for people to obtain 10 per cent on call for money deposited with a bank or other finance institutions. However, I say to her that at the time of the introduction of the 10 per cent deeming proposal one could receive 10 per cent if one had money invested for a month. As one who has moved along with the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) in the committee area in developing policy, I think we can expect a drop when interest rates drop. We can then expect the Minister to consider the relevance of 10 per cent. The honourable member for Hawker touched on one of the very reasons for the deeming provision when she said that banks were not advising people properly and that they were allowing people to receive 4 per cent interest, perhaps even 2 per cent, on deposits and that the banks were wrong not to encourage people to invest in higher interest bearing deposits. The legislation will encourage the banks to do that; it will encourage the client to ask the bank to give the best advice for investment. So these measures will encourage the banks to advise people correctly. I believe the legislation is tough. In some cases it is going to be too tough. Already we have people who are having problems in reporting for unemployment benefitssometimes having to travel some miles in country areas to report, as they are required to do. There are people who have problems in travelling perhaps 100 to 125 kilometres from Cooma to Canberra to take a job because the job was available and they are told, 'Sorry, you have a carno benefits unless you are prepared to travel to Canberra to that job'. I think that is pretty tough. It is not all that easy for people, especially when they have families, to travel that distance to and from work each day. It is also tough to require people to move when it is sometimes not all that easy to get accommodation. So I hope there continues to be some of the compassion which has been evident to date in local Social Security offices. I look forward to the application of the legislation but will watch very carefully the degree of toughness, particularly on the unemployed and sickness beneficiaries.",51
117,Mr TRUSS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"ln this debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill I should like to refer particularly to the assets test as it applies to family allowances. The fact that family allowances are dealt with under social security legislation reflects how much family policy has changed over recent years. Family allowance is all that is left of the once universal child endowment arrangements that helped every Australian family with some of those extra costs that are associated with raising children. Now it seems that family allowance is seen merely as a welfare measure, put in the same category as unemployment and sickness benefits and the like. Instead, it should be seen as an investment in the next generation of Australians. I can think of few better investments than in the young children and the families of Australia. In our immigration program we pay to bring in children from other nations. It would be surely far better for us to support Australian families and to encourage them to bring up Australian children in the great traditions of our national way of life. These days it appears that government policy is emphasising much more the provision of childcare centres and extra child-care places. Indeed, one of the boasts of this particular Budget was that there were so many extra child-care places provided; so many additional resources for child-care measures. So the Government cuts its support to the families, forces mothers to seek jobs to balance the family budget, and then needs to provide more child-care places to support the children whose parents need to go out to work. The Government appears to prefer to raise our children in child-care centres, like battery hens, than support the families of this nation. The coalition policy prefers to encourage the family as the fundamental unit of society. Indeed, we ought to encourage children to be raised not in child-care centres but within the traditional family units of our nation-families, parents and childrenwhere child-care is seen as a worthy career and indeed an honoured role. There can be no doubt that a dollar spent on family allowances is a far better investment· than a dollar spent on child-care centres. I want to emphasise that I am not antichild-care centres. There is clearly a role for these kinds of facilities in our community. I have been critical of the Government for its failure to provide additional child-care cel1tres, particularly in the city of Hervey Bay-a city in my electorate with a population of well over 20,000 which cannot seem to get its name on the Government's priority list for childcare centres. But the Government fundamentally has its priorities in this whole area of family policy completely wrong. Parents with incomes of over $60,000 are entitled to subsidised fees at a child-care centre and there is no assets test. However, this Bill places tough assets tests on family allowance and family allowance supplements. Families that are denied the family allowance will be able to get subsidised fees at a childcare centre. The Budget announcement placed an assets test on family allowances of $300,000 and cut the assets test on the family allowance supplement to $200,000, and it also cut the assets test applying to Austudy. Ironically, there is no assets test on Abstudy. So if people are white, they are not allowed to have too many assets if they want to take advantage of the Austudy arrangements, but if they are black, it does not matter about their as"": sets. There was a considerable outcry in the community about the injustice and the insensitivity of these new assets test arrangements, particularly coming as they rather did in an announcement at a time when there was a massive rural crisis starting to unwind, which I think even the Government is now starting to acknowledge actually exists in this community. I can recall that even some Government members, including the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil) and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), eventually started to acknowledge that yes, there was a very real problem with the assets test arrangements. Months later, as the pressure intensified and became irresistible, even some members of the Caucus primary industry committee of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) seemed to wake up, and it issued a press statement last October to the effect that, if the National Farmers Federation (NFF) could persuade the committee there really was a problem, it might even be prepared to make a submission to Cabinet. The NFF did make some recommendations but they were not taken up by the Government and in fact the final arrangements announced by the Government are considerably short of what the NFF submitted and expected. So as always; the ALP's Caucus rural committee proved to be completely useless and made no impact on the essential merits of this particular argument. Of course, many members of the ALP were only too keen, including the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) yesterday, to jump up and down and to take credit for it but in actual fact their role in this was completely negligible. It required an enormous outbreak of public support and outrage over these particular measures before any action at all was taken. Finally the Government relented and made some changes. Those changes were not announced in this Parliament, as one would have expected. The Government admitted that it got it all wrong, but it did not announce the changes here. It went down the road to the National Press Club to make the announcement. Three or four Ministers lined up to take credit for some small changes. In so doing, the Government treated this Parliament with the same kind of disregard as it is treating this House today as it 'rambos' through 39 Bills in less than four days-the same kind of treatment that it handed out to this House, to the people's representatives, in two days in May when it guillotined another 34 Bills. That is the kind of treatment it gives this House. The Government presumed that this Parliament would pass its legislation and it spent $400,000 sending out application forms for Australians to fill out on the assets test requirements. It wasted that $400,000. I suggest that the Government should not waste another $400,000 sending out another assets test form because the Opposition and the Australian Democrats have indicated their opposition to even the current arrangements; so any further expenditure would clearly be a waste of money. Finally the Government announced that the family allowance assets test would be raised to $500,000 and the family allowance and Austudy would revert to the old assets test arrangements. Those changes are welcome but they are not good enough. There are still serious problems with the assets test arrangements, even set, as they are, at $500,000. Wage earners are permitted to earn $57,620 and still receive the full family allowance-even more if they have more than one child. There is a clear problem with relativity and the relationship between the earning limit and the assets test, and the relationship is clearly grossly distorted. A business or farm would need to be returning something over 11.5 per cent on investment, excluding capital gains, before the assets test would trigger the income test. In Paul Keating's Australia very few businesses are returning anything like 111h per cent. The situation on Australian farms is infinitely worse. The Government's own Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) has estimated that the return on farm investment in 1991 will be only 0.5 per cent. The downturn in farm income is estimated at over 60 per cent this year. The average return on a farm with an asset value of $500,000 will be less than $2,500-something like $50 a week. Yet farmers earning less than $2,500 are considered to be too rich to receive the family allowance while the salary earner on $57,620 or more continues to receive the full allowance. Farmers on their knees at the bank manager's table after years of negative income, pleading for cash to survive, will be denied the family allowance while the bank manager on the other side of the table will continue to receive it. Many doctors, lawyers, senior public servants and university academics-probably even members of this House-will continue to receive the family allowance while destitute farmers will be denied it. The man living in the million dollar house earning $60,000 a year will continue to receive the family allowance; destitute farmers will be denied it. On ABARE's figures a farm would need to have an asset value of something like $10m with current returns to achieve the income test. Clearly there is a gross distortion between the two figures that have been set to trigger the family allowance exclusion levels. What is more the income test increases with every child. The assets test is absolute. It stays on $500,000 whether the recipient has one child or a dozen. Many debt-stricken farmers whose assets have not yet been eroded below $347,000 will also be denied the family allowance supplement. All these kinds of things clearly indicate the inequities of the arrangements that are being proposed by the Government. What makes it more difficult is that there are no hardship provisions, no shading provisions, nothing which would enable any kind of special consideration when it can clearly be demonstrated that families are in particular need. On the revised figures for the new triggering limits for the assets test it is still estimated that 60,000 Australian families will now be denied family allowance. It is also estimated that three-quarters of will be farm families which do not have child-care centres and have to rely on their own resources. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics said last year that 50 per cent of farms have a net asset value of $700,000 or more and that the average net asset value for farms is $910,000. I freely acknowledge that those kinds of returns are not realisable or tainable in current circumstances. Most of these farms are, quite frankly, unsaleable. If they were put on the market there would be no buyers. Even the banks recognise that and are clearly not moving against farmers as rapidly as their economic circumstances might permit. Assets are there, but there is no capacity for them to earn. There is no option to sell; the buyers are just not there. Many Government members are clearly acknowledging this kind of situation. I was pleased to note many of the comments of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), who spoke earlier and acknowledged clearly the discrimination associated with the assets test arrangements and pointed out how unfair they are to the rural sector. It also needs to be remembered that in the past traditionally the family allowance, the old child endowment, was paid to mothers. Mothers received this income as the people particularly associated with child-care. But it is not just the mother's assets that are taken into account; it is the family assets-another clear example of the way in which the policy has changed. But the assets test is distorted against asset owners as distinct from income earners. The assets test has placed absolutely no relevance whatever on the capacity of the assets to earn. Clearly it is income earned ) that ought to be taken into account in establishing family allowance entitlements rather than how many dead assets a particular person may happen to have in his ownership. I would like to make a final point. On 22 August the Federal Government announced that it had signed the United those Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and also, in spite of the widespread public opposition to this document, was considering ratification of that Convention. Indeed, on the very day that the Government announced that it had signed the Convention there were thousands of names attached to petitions tabled in this House. This assets test legislation clearly consustravenes the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Article 2 makes it quite clear that state parties undertake that they shall: . . . respect and ensure the rights set forth in this Convention to each child within their jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind, irrespective of the child's or his or her parent's or legal guardian's race, colour, sex, language; religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, disability, birth or other status. In signing this Convention the Government undertakes that it will not discriminate against a child on the basis of the property owned by its parents. Article 27 says in part (1): States Parties recognize the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child's physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development. In Part (3) it says: States Parties . . . shall undertake appropriate measures to assist parents arid others responsible for the child to implement this right and shall in case of need provide material assistance and support programmes . . . When we link article 2 and article 27 it becomes quite clear to us that this Convention places an obligation on signing parties not to discriminate against children on the basis of the assets that their parents happen to hold and, in particular, their property assets. Mr Webster-They won't sign it, though.",53
118,Mr TRUSS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I hope they will not sign it. Clearly the Government, if it chose to sign it, would be acting completely contrary to the wishes of the vast majority of Australians. The Government has committed itself to a convention, yet it brings into this House legislation clearly in contravention of that convention, which shows its callous disregard for the children of Australia. It is bad enough that this Government chooses to beat farmers and small businessmen. Its economic policy has been ruinous to anyone trying to contribute to the productivity of our nation. That is bad enough, but now the Government is turning its anger on the families of Australia, particularly the farm children who are to be denied some of the basic n-cess­ ities of life at a time when many farm families are living in abject poverty. Already, farm children are significantly disadvantaged. Without question they have reduced opportunities for education health services, cultural experience and: of course, future employment. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said that no child shall live in poverty by 1990, and that was clearly an empty and cruel farce. In Question Time today we heard further reference to the 500 000 children in .Austra.li- already living in' poverty. Pnme Minister took a role in condemning more Aus-ra-Ian children to live in pov-rty by hIS Involvement in drafting this Infamous Budget provision and even these amendments. Sadly, under this Government, child endowment seems to be lost in history. The days when policy was built around families and their children seem to have been completely lost. We will have to wait for the return of a coalition government to see the return of the real importance of the family and the vital role that families should play in raising the nation's children. I call upon the Government to review the asset.s test arrangements yet again. It has admItted that it got them wrong once. The G<;>vernment has gone only a very small dIstance towards correcting some of the anomalies, and there is a long way to go. If the Government were really concerned about the issues confronting real Allstrali.as .today, it w.ould be amending thIS legIslatIOn yet agaIn to show that it ha- some concern, at least, for Australian chIldren. ",56
119,The SO,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Ial Security Legislation Amendment BIll makes a number of significant changes to social policy and as such it has implications for millions of Australians. Yet here we are, in the fading days of the 1990 parliamentary year-the least number of sitting days since the 1930s-and the Government chooses to suppress debate, not only on this legislation which has been limited to two hours bu't on 38 other significant - ills. Therefo;e, I restrict my remarks tomght to three aspects of this legislation. The House is well aware of the Hawke Government's Budget decision to tighten the noose of the assets test on the family allowance, the family. income supplement and Austudy. The outrage that this discriminatory and biased action produced in the community and the sustained action that took place in this House has forced the Government to make changes. The Bill that is now before us has been amended. It now sets the assets test threshold for the payment of family alThe lowance at $500,000. A threshold of $300,000 was announced in the August Budget. T-e family allowance supplement threshold In this amended legislation is to be increased from the present level of $322,750 to $347,500. A threshold of $200,000 was announced in the August Budget. Austudy and assistance for isolated children will also now be indexed to increase from the present level· of $322,750 to $347,500-again, from a threshold of $200,000 for parental assets, as was announced by the Government in its Budget. The Government has stated that these changes will principally benefit farmers and rural communities. If the Governmef,lt really wanted to help farmers, small bUSIness people and communities in rural areas because of the severity of the rural downturn and the deterioration in estimated incomes as a result of its economic policy, it should abolish the assets test altogether. I ask those very courageous members of the Government, particularly the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil) and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), to support Opposition amendments which will seek to do that in this place and in the Senate. The amendments, of course, will be moved in respect of the family allowance. I believe that, if we can restore some justice to this particular aspect of social policy, it will bring great benefit many families throughout rural Australia. The Government should have thought about the implications of this policy some months ago. As other honourable members have said, it has already spent $400,000 for printing, handling and postage of family allowance and family allowance renewal forms, incorporating the assets test changes as they were announced in the Budget. The Department will now have to send out new forms and, as other honourable members have pointed out, I hope that process has not already started and that the Department will wait, at least where this legislation concerned, until the next few weeks before sending out the forms. Therefore, the Government has wasted $400,000 of taxpayers' money on this issue. On 11 October the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) moved a motion in this House, seconded by me and supported by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie and the honourable member for Grey, about the impact of this assets test change on rural families and rural communities. Of course, over the years we have already seen how the impact of the assets test has brought disruption to many families, and to aged parents who were previously on a pension and in retirement, many of whom have had to move back to farms to work. Worse still, the young people who should have been working these farms and who represented the future of farming in rural Australia have moved off the farms and into other pursuits in urban Australia. I again ask the House· to compare the situation provided by the change in this legislation, even the amended change in this legislation, to that of a wage earner or salary earner-and I include many of us in this House-who, under the ceilings for these allowances, are allowed to earn up to $57,620 yet still qualify for a family allowance and have this amount increased for each child. I also emphasise the important statistics referred to by my colleague the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), who spoke before me, when he pointed out that, for a farmer to have anywhere near this level of income to under existing circumstances, his farm would need to have an asset value of about $10m. Of course, this applies to small businesses as well. We already see record numbers of small business bankruptcies throughout Australia at this point. This legislation in many ways affects small business people and their families to the same degree as it affects farming families. As I have said, the threshold placed on the value of farms under this amended legislation is such that there is simply no capacity to generate income at this level. This means that many thousands of rural children will remain in poverty and will is be unable to afford the education which the rest of Australia quite properly takes as its right. At a time when Australia's rural economy is facing its worse outcome, the Hawke Labor Government continues to discriminate against farmers and people in small business living in rural Australia. The Government has estimated that the changes it has made to the family allowance will benefit an additional 25,000 families; under the family income support scheme, an additional 4,000 families; and under Austudy, an additional 10,500 families. We can well ask: How many families will still be left without any family allowance support? The estimate I have been able to determine is somewhere between 55,000 and 65,000, which illustrates the discriminatory aspect of this legislation. I now turn to another aspect of this legislation in relation to deeming. As the legislation points out, from 1 March 1991 the Department of Social Security will deem an interest rate of 10 per cent on pensioners' cash and deposit holdings above $2,000, where such moneys are earning less than 10 per cent. The $2,000 threshold applies equally to single pensioners and married couples. The deemed return will be assessed as income for the purpose of the pension income tests, although not for income tax payment purposes. Returns on sums amounting to less than $2,000 will be assessed at the actual rate of return. I acknowledge that this legislation contains a legislative assurance that no existing pensioner will lose his or her pensioner health benefit card as a result of rearranging his or her assets on account of deeming, unless the individual loses totally the entitlement to the pension. The impact of this proposal is significant. Information provided by the Department shows that of the claimed $8.7m savings from deeming in 1990-91, 90 per cent will be generated from age pensioners, with the balance being derived from invalid, widow and sole parent pensioners. The Department also estimates that for 1990-91 not more than 2,000 age pensioners will lose the age pension entirely. Up to 300,000I emphasise that figure-age pensioners will have their pensions reduced owing to the deeming arrangements. I raise one area of particular concern, that is, loans to charitable organisations on which organisations pay low rates of interest. I understand that where an inter,est free loan is made as part of an entry contribution at the time of entry to a hostel, the deeming provisions do not apply. However, many organisations providing hostel accommodation for the aged rely on an ongoing flow of cash by way of loans and gifting in order to survive. The resources of these organisations are strictly limited. The availability of interest free or low interest loans on an unrestricted basis is extremely critical to their survival. I wish to quote from a letter that I, and I guess most other members of this House, have received from Lutheran Homes Inc. H provides Christian retirement villages. I wish to read some paragraphs from that letter in regard to the concern it has about these deeming arrangements. It states: . . . self help has been a lifeline vital to the maintenance of a truly caring society in which the sick and frail aged are not treated simply as ""things"" in the system, but as people hurting from the ageing process and, above all, as possessing precious blood bought souls with an eternal destiny. History will show that failure to understand the need to kindle and nourish the spirit dependence between elderly people and within society generally will have been counter-productive. Generally elderly people have been robbed of their savings during many years of inflation. Tighten the means test if you must, but leave freedom for people to breathe. Relatively small though they may be, the savings of pensioners, applied compassionately and sensitively for the common good, serve as a catalyst for mutual concern for each other's welfare and for people generally, and promote optimum interdependence during the twilight years. The letter goes on: Without a large amount of voluntary help, benevolence, and low interest loans, it is not possible to comply with outcome standards demanded by the DCSH. The requirement, which we concur, that care be provided within a homely environment, requires capital expenditure considerably in excess of the cost of bare bones buildings, equipment and furnishings. Finally, from the letter: Voluntary work, gifts and low cost loans to aged care organisations are a measure of the approval and appreciation by patients and their families and friends of the standard of care provided,much more reliable than SUbjective snap judgments by Standards Monitoring Teams who sometimes do not see the wood for the trees. I think that raises some of the difficulties that this deeming legislation introduces for the first time and which I believe the Government should seriously look at in correcting some of the anomalies that will ultimately eventuate. Finally, I raise the issue of the tax file number that this legislation proposes to introduce. The Bill proposes that all other social security recipients will be required to supply their tax file number, plus that of their spouse, as a pre-condition to receiving or continuing to receive payment. This applies to those persons in receipt of the age, invalid, wife or carer's pension, widowed persons, family, sheltered employment, mobility or rehabilitation allowances and those in receipt Of widow's pensions class B. Currently, unemployment and sickness beneficiaries must apply to the Department with their tax file number. The Bill also proposes that as from 1 January 1991 they'must also supply the tax file number of their spouse. The Bill also allows for the Department of Community. Services and Health to require those eligible for assistance under of interthe first home owners scheme to supply their tax file number as a pre-condition of payment. As to the tax file number, particularly as it relates to these Bills-as I understand it, the additional public servants and those people outside the Australian Taxation Office who will have access to the tax file number of an individual are now officers in the Department of Employment, Education and Training, with 12,000 employees, and the Department of Social Security, with 16,000 employees. That to me is a massive extension of the use of the tax file number. The Privacy Commissioner hims-lf has publicly stated that it is a misnomer to continue to call this a tax file number. It is in every respect, I believe, what Australians fear and what they rejected two years ago, that is, an identification in itself. I ask the Government to reconsider the changes that it has already made and· to accept the amendment that will be moved by the Opposition in this Parliament to ensure that the assets test in particular totally removed from family allowance.",57
120,Mr WEBSTER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"1 came into the House earlier in the afternoon to participate in the debate on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill, and discovered to my great horror and grief that this very important Bill and all its implications were allocated only 10 or 11 minutes for debate-thanks to the Government's great concern for these very impQrtant Bills and issues in this Parliament. In actual fact, I was going to say some nice things about the Government because I think a lot of the child support legislation-I am going to lead right into what we are talking about in this particular Bill, Madam Deputy Speaker-deserves commendation. Some of the nice t4ings that we can say about that particular Bill are, for example, that it was overdue and, that the bill to the taxpayer, in terms of supporting parents' benefits and so on as a result of marriage breakdown and other failures in our society, will be reduced. In other words, the taxpayer will not have to wear such a burden, because 60 per cent or so of the money needed to support the children involved will come from the other party responsible. That is. a very good thing. I commend the Government for that Bill. I was also going to say how good it was to see that the Government had allowed the secrecy provisions to be removed if the court so pleases in terms of revealing information about child abuse when matters' came before the Family Court. I think that provision also has a great deal of merit. There are a number of other things in that Bill which I cannot mention here, as we are on another topic, .another Billthe Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill-and that perhaps prohibits me from proceeding too much further into that previous legislation, because you, Madam Deputy Speaker, might ask me to get back to this particular1 Bill, which I will do. Mr Dobie-You've already done so.",60
121,Mr WEBSTER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I have. I am really very delighted to be able to support the  Fisher) and certainly the honourable 'lnember for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), who made excellent speeches. They have drawn to the attention of the House the tremendous plight that is confronting families and they have expressed their very deep concern for the farmers in their constituencies. In my own constituency I have quite a few farmers who are expressing to me exactly the same sentiments as the honourable member for Mallee and the honourable member for Wide Bay have spoken about at length. The thing that really concerns me about this legislation is the fact that the Government is not getting its priorities right in terms of the kinds of things that it is talking about. We know that we have tremendous problems with regard to the long economy at the moment, largely due to the policies that have been adopted by this Government over the last eight years and which it will not face up to and come to some realistic decisions about. The real problem that nobody on the Government side is saying anything about is that the family, which is under attack in this legislation, is the basic unit of our society. Many people in .this country are running round trying to distract us from that very important principle; nevertheless, the family is the basic unit of our society and legislation. should be the unit that this Government stands up for as much as it can. ' When we stand up in here, it does not matter what we say about the economy, the needs of people, the frightening things that are occurring and so on. In fact, does not matter how good our economy is if we do not have stable, secure and worry free families and parents; we still go down the gurgler. So it""is veryimpormentsmade tant that the Government diverts much families...,....areas of its attention to the issues in our society where we have failed. For example, we have failed in the area of censorship. This country is awash with the pornography that is running through it. We mous difficulties. The Government is failing dramatically to come to grips with these issues, and it needs to be reminded of those things when it brings in this kind of legislation, which is just another attack on families-weakening the capabilities parents to encourage and nurture their children and preventing mothers from staying at home for as long as possible, that is their wish. We are being attacked for our policy on $39,000 a goods and services tax, yet that is a tax three teenage and a concept that will allow more widely and generously at matters society, and the Government such as income splitting and other aspects something about it. of the taxation package that will be of great benefit to the families who are i.nider attack from this legislation. Before the assets test on Austudy, example, is looked at, the Government should be looking much harder at all the rules and regulations governing who gets Austudy and who does not. The current requirements-and I know this from perdebate sonal experience as a result of some stituents in my electorate approaching me-allow children to leave home and receive Austudy without what I consider proper investigations being made into the real circumstances that exist in those families. I think that is avery serious concerti that ought to come before the Governreflection ment. It is more important to deal with those issues and the stability and strength of the family than it is to worry about matters such as the assets test and so on which are under consideration in this Mr Dobie-The Government is not listening.",60
122,Mr WEBSTER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The Government is not listening, as the honourable member for Cook has just said. The Government it must do something about these things. I am not suggesting that the Government does not have to exercise good housekeep'ing in coming to grips with welfare .payor assistance given to in which we are failing. In the past, some of those areas have been dealt with, and that has been appropriate, but we have to get. into perspective all these issues and details that are putting have enorthe family under attack. When the means test for family allowance was first brought in, I remember a study by ithe Australian Institute of Family Studies which compared a family comof prising a husband, a wife at home and three teenage children at school with a single parent with a four-year-old child. if At the end of the day, the single parent with the four-year-old child. was $50 to $70 a week better off than the family on with the mother at home and the children at school. Of course, us to look that kind of anomaly is occurring in this must do . This afternoon in this. Parlia-ent there was a meeting of the United Nations for Children's Fund (UNICEF).' That is the flrea of the United Nations that concerns itself with the welfare and plight of children around the world. We have heard a lot about poverty in this country. The about the promise of the Prime conMinister (Mr Hawke) still continues and will go on for some time yet. When we look at what the Government is doing 'about UNICEF, which is concerned with families, we see that this has much to do with its social security legislation at the moment, because that is a of the Government's attitude to families in this country. Last year the goodwill ambassador of UNICEF asked the Government to double the allocation of money to UNICEF Australia fro$3.3m to $7m. lJefore the last. Budget. I asked the Prime Minister a question about this. He said that it was a good question and that, if fiscal policy allowed it, he would be glad to put a tick beside it. When the Budget was announced, of course, we saw an $8 billion or $9 billion surplus, a laudable allocation of $44m .to sport and $80,000 to $100,000 added onto the $3.3m. Again, in this year's August Budget, after Ken Done asked the Government for double the amount of money to help do something about the 40,000 children who die every day in the world from poverty, malnutrition and disease, we saw a Budget surplus of $8 billion or $9 billion and the allocation to UNICEF increased by $100,000'to about $3.7m. These are indications that tell uS all that we have to question whether the Government really has the interests of the stability and well-being of families in this country at heart. I know that it is easy for Government members to get up and refer to what we did eight years ago and all these kinds of-Mr Andrew':""""-Cheap shots.",61
123,Mr WEBSTER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Cheap shots and arguments that try to steer. us away from the real issues. But we do have major problems in this Parliament. I share the sentiments of the honourable member for Wide Bay about the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. I do not want to add to that. The last point I make is to remind this House, and the Governmerit in particular, that we come in here every day and at the very beginning of the proceedings we hear the Speaker pray this prayer: ' . . . direct and prosper our deliberations to the advancement of Thy glory and for the true well-being of the people of Australia. As hard as I look at this legislation, I cannot see that it is designed for the true well-being of families, who are the most important people i- Australia today.",62
124,Mr ANDREW,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"1 acknowledge the graciousness of the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) in allowing me to speak in the remaining time allotted for this second reading debate. The legislation before the House is the Social Security Legislation Amendment' Bill, and in my comments tonight I want to deal specifically with the provisions in that the Bill that relate to the original assets test that the Government proposed on the family allowance, Austudy and the family allowance supplement. , I support the honourable member for  member for Macquarie (Mr ,Webster) and the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) in the remarks that they have made on this particular legislation. This legislation must be one of the most tatty exercises in s,ocial security that the Government has been involved, in. It goes back to the August Budget of this year when the Government announced that family allowances would, be subject for the ,first time in their history to an assets test and that the assets test would be deemed to be what we felt was a totally non-representative, $300,000. Furthermore, the Minister announced that the assets test applying to Austudy would be reduced from $300,000 to $200,000. Only a government that was smug, self-satisfied ,and out of touch with the electorate could have proposed changes such as this. The Governmep.t was so out of touch with the electorate that it took the further step, as outlined by the honourable member for Mallee, and, in fact sent a form to all rural Australians and said, 'Fill this form out and tell us whether or not your assets happen to exceed $300,000': As we have discovered as a result of probing in the Seriate by Senator Alstori, that mailing cost the Government $400,000-$400,000 that has gone down the chute. Almost half a million dollars disappeared because the Government was totally out of touch with what was happening in rural Australia. The indignation of this side of the House W;lS matched by that of those on the other side of the Bouse who were also prepared to stand up and be counted. I have to acknowledge the role of, the honourable' member for Grey (Mr O'Neil) and the role of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) in standing alongside honourable members on this side of the House and saying that such a proposal to assets test the family allowance at this level and' reduce the; assets test on Austudy is gross1y unjust: As a result of their efforts, as a result of the efforts of. the National Farmers Federation and as a result of the efforts of the Federal coalition, Senator Richardson was forced to review, and perhaps even more pertinently Cabinet was forced to review, the Government's stand. Mr Trllss-It took them two days.",62
125,Mr ANDREW,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"As the hon,ourable member for Wide Bay has pointed out, it took them two days. It should havt: .taken them two minutes, if they had had any consciousness at all of what was happening in rural Australia. What we have before us tonight is the Government's response to those pleadings and the reviewed legislation. I suppose, without being too dramatic about it, one could observe that the Government which was suggesting to Australians in general and rural Australians in particular 'We're going to kneecap you', has now said, 'Well, we won't quite be that severe; we'll settle simply for breaking an arm instead'. I have ,long been indignant about tl1ese proposals because rural Australia would have been krieecapped by the original submission, and what we have now is far from perfect-hence the amendments that the Opposition is intending. to move. ;' I want to say to both Ministers and backbenchers in this c4amber that they m-st appreciate that, even if rural Australia was 'enjoying good seasons, even if in ,economic terms all was well in fural Australia, the original proposals to assets test the family allowance and reduce the accessibility of rural Australians to Austudy were grossly unjust-and our indignation this evening is built solely on the fact that' this is unjust legislation. It does ance. not matter so much that things are grim in the bush. Even if they were good, to propose an assets test of $300,000 or'-as we have ,now-$500,OOO on the family allowance does not reflect justice for rural Australians. But there is a second point I want to make, and that is that there is a real anomaly in the legislation that still exists, particularly in the legislation to assets test the family allowance. The family allowance has long been built on the understanding that· the cheque for family allowance went to the principal carer. , One willr,ecall that the family allowance was designed to replace the old child endowment scheme qr, even more significantly-as Madam Deputy Speaker pointed out to me earlier today-to replace the dependent child rebate, and the dependent child rebate of course tended to favour those who had the most income because it was a tax .rebate. The family allowance was designed to replace both of those with a fairer scheme that helped low income Australians, and that is what it has done for years. The Government proposes to assets test it and, in proposing to assets test it, effectively it is denying. to families now who have over $500,000 in assets the family· allowance. In rural Australia $500,000 is a meaningless sum, particularly in 1990. Many of them cannot raise $20,000, let alone the $57,000 income-tested amount for the family allowance. But let me come back to my point of real indignation about this. In fact, as honourable members all know, the family allowance the que is made out' in the name of tile principal carer. The money goes specific-lly;. normally, to the wife-it is her income. But under the Government's proposal, her assets are being measured against the' family assets-not against her own. How does the Government answer that in terms of social justice? The Government has said the principal carer will be denied the family allowance not because of the assets in most cases she has, but because of the assets the family hashardly in accord with what was in fact the original motive for the family allowFor that reason, the Opposition finds itself unable to support the proposal that the family allowance be assets tested. We are a bit uncomfortable, I have to say to the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, with the proposal that Austudy should be assets tested. But we recognise that that is a historic situation and that children under Austudy at least have some capacity of their own to be independent and to raise money of their own. What the Government is proposing to do is to assets test the family allowance so that dependent children-as the honourable member for Macquarie has said, that resource Australia most needs-will be a burden to every Australian family, What we are saying to the Government is that this is not some form of welfarethis is an entitlement, and it is an entitlement that it is proposing to assets test. That is why we are suggesting that the assets test on the family allowa.nce ought not to apply. We recognise that in the case of Austudy at least, thanks to the pleas of the Opposition, thanks to the pleas of a few-all too few; less than a handful-informed Government people, thanks to the pleas of the National Farmers Federation, and thanks to the pleas of indignant farmers all around Australia, the assets test on Austudy is now marginally more realistic. ",63
126,Mr LLOYD,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,The CWA was also volved.,64
127,Mr ANDREW,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I must also acknowledge not only the farmers, but those farming organisations and rural bodies such as the Country Women's Association, as the honourable member for' Mallee has pointed out and the honourable member for Murray' has emphasised. But, thanks to that, the Government has been forced to rethink the assets test on Austudy. We have been prepared to tolerate that, but we cannot tolerate an assets test on the family allowance because of all of the social injustice that is inherent in that. Why are we not standing up here indignant about the assets on Austudy? Largely, I suppose it is because as a responsible Opposition we recognise that there is a bottom line, and that that bottom line finally means the Government has to make the Budget balance. But ,may I say to the Minister, there is a bottom line for farming families as well. Mr STAPLES, (Jagajaga-Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services) (6.18)-1 would like to thank the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) for cutting short his speech. I' appreciate the fact that all honourable members had to shorten what they would have wanted to say, but I think there are a few points in the minute and a half I have left that need to be responded to' for the sake of the debate and the questions raised. In relation to the matters that were raised particularly by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) and the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus) regarding confusion among pensioners about the $2,000 limit and the 10 per cent rate not being readily available, I would like to point out to honourable members and of course the general public that this was announced on Budget night to take effect from 1 March 1991, effectively six months away. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) has already indicated, as he did, on Budget night and in another forum, that should the interest rate be not obtainable due to the general market-and that is certainly spowing declines in interest rates at this Instage-then the Minister does have the power to and would effectively move to adjust that interest rate figure so that it reflected more what was available in the market. ' As far as the issue raised, from my hearing principally by the honourable  concerning hostels, I point out to the honourable member that there are aspects of that cov-red by the Bill already, and it is certainly not meant to discourage that very important thing. But I would also point out that he should request his advIsers to refer to those people as residents, not patients. Madam DEPUTY, SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Order!

129,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Dawson) (6.22)The Opposition opposes the amendment because it feels that the Government has abused the family allowance, firstly, by means testing or income testing it and, secondly, through this clause through which it seeks to make payment of it subject to an assets test. Although the Government's amendment seeks to increase the ceiling, there is no appreciation on the part of the Government as to what the family allowance is and means to families throughout Australia. It will not do any harm to go back in history. Child endowment, when first brought in in the 1940s and 1950s, was not asset or means tested. The rebate for dependent children was also put on the basis that it should not be means or assets tested. We are saying that this Government fails to understand the plight of small business people and farmers who are denied access to the family allowance even though they are income poor. We have given illustrations of farmers with properties they cannot sell-but with asset values out of reach of the ceiling even now proposed-who are living on a $16,000 to $20,000 income. It is just an impossible situation. It is not the first time farmers have felt the brunt.",65

135,Mr BEDDALL,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"I move: Customs Tariff Proposals No.6 (1990). The tariff proposals which I have just tabled relate to a proposed alteration to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Customs Tariff Proposals No.6 (1990) is operative on and from 17 October 1990 and reduces the rate of customs duty from 16 per cent to 8 per cent on fabrics covered by item 40E in Part III of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. This change gives effect to the Government's decision on the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority recommendation on this fabric. A summary of the alteration contained in these proposals has been prepared and is being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposals to the House.

138,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WOOL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"We will proceed, taking note of the honourable member's comment.",91
139,Mr LLOYD,WOOL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The point I just made. I meant seriously because we really do have a scandalous situation. We have less than two hours to debate the Wool Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 and the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Further Amendment Bills 1990, which are Bills about the greatest industry that Australia has had over its history and about an industry in a period of deepening crisis. Yet, because of the inefficiency and lack of sensitivity of this Government, there is less than two hours to debate this great industry. The wool industry does face a very difficult and stark situation. Wool production is dramatically ahead of demand and with that is a rapidly increasing stockpile. With that are rapidly increasing wool growers' taxes to finance the purchase and maintenance of that stockpile, and, to a certain extent, that is what these Bills about tonight. The growers' tax or levy was 8 per cent in total until 1 July. It then rose to 18 per cent; in October to 25 per cent; and, according to the wool industry projections, it will rise to 40 per cent from 1 July next year, which is a massive increase in taxation for wool growers already struggling and also an indication of the massive increase in the stockpile. At the beginning of the 1989-90 wool selling season, 200,000 bales were in the stockpile. At the conclusion of that wool selling season in June of this year, 3.1 million bales were in that stockpile. The projection for this year is somewhere between 5.3 and 5.7 million bales by the end of this wool selling sea sop. in June next year, which is an increase of up to 2.5 million bales in 12 months. If the increase continues at anything like the same rate, obviously it will be between seven and eight million bales at the end of the next wool selling season. The only way that that can be halted or stabilised is through a combination of a dramatic upsurge in buying and a dramatic reduction in supply. It is not just a matterof the purchase of the wool and the cost to wool growers; there are the interest and storage payments, which basically reduce the value of that wool to zero over a few years, and they are hanging over the market and maintaining a depressant effect on the market. There was the belief in the industry-and there still may be some who believe it but I think not many, and that would include many of us here, including me-that at one stage that stockpile was similar to the previous stockpiles. For ample, it rose to 1.6 million bales at the end of the 1974-75 wool selling season and the next highest figure was 1.2 million bales at the end of the 1983-84 wool selling season. At those times there was this temporary shortfall in demand, and equilibrium was restored into the market. Supply and demand were back reasonably close together. Following the 1983-84 season with the clearance of the stockpile, there was the belief that the three great boom years of 1986-87, when we exare ported-and I know that that is not total sales, but it is close-785 million kilograms of wool from this country; 198788, when we exported even more-876 million kilograms; and 1988-89, when we exported 861 million kilograms, heralded a new norm, a new level of clearance for the industry. There were new markets, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and China between them taking 20 per cent of production. Wool promotion had moved the long term wool syntheti- fibre price ratio from 3: 1 to 5: 1. If one looks further at those figures, one sees that the best year's clearance we ever had-which I indicated was 1987-88approximated something approaching five million bales of production. The average has been slightly under four million bales. The production of wool this year will be almost six million bales. In other words, as we now know with hindsight-and some people have been warning of this for some time-what was conceived as the new norm, this newer higher level of clearance, was not the norm but an aberration and an aberration that, since then, has been exacerbated by a world textile recession and by the high value of the Australian dollar, which has added to the lack of competitiveness of our wool against products of other countries. Recently when on a visit to China, it became apparent to me that China was one of the major causes of that aberration. There was a dramatic upsurge in buying, not only by China for itself but also by others for China, in a situation which was called the 'wool war'. This not only resulted in a dramatic increase in the clearance of Chinese wool and increased ex- production in China, increased wool textile capacity in China and an increased price of wool domestically in China, but it also meant that imports from Australia increased to almost 120 million kilograms a year greasy. This calendar year, China will be buying, at the most, 20 million kilograms greasy. So there is a dramatic change. I believe that China's wool purchases will increase and that eventually China will be the major market for Australia's wool exports, but that will take some time. What has also taken some time. I include myself in this; looking retrospectively at the situation, it is somewhat easier to understand-is the realisation that what the industry thought was a higher level of clearance was not a sustainable level of clearance. That means that new thinking is necessary because the past stockpile situations of the early to mid-1970s and the early to mid-1980s are not repeated on this occasion. We have a far more serious situation in which there is no way in the near future that demand can pick up the oversupply. We need not only new thinking, as opposed to that of the past, but also urgent action if our industry· is to survive in any sort of reasonable shape. In that context, the coalition parties many discussions with industry people. Certainly there were hours of debate and discussion within the coalition. We hope and believe that demand will improve. It is important for the industry and the Government to do everything possible to increase the demand for Australian wool, whether by credit, export insurance arrangements, promotion, barter trade or whatever, and to ensure that the major buyers of Australian wool improve their purchases over the next few weeks and months and on into the future. Allowing for all of those things to happen at the optimistic end of the projections, there is no hope for that stockpile even to be stabilised because production at the present time is running close to 50 per cent above demand. The combination of no profitable alternative land use because of the problems internationally with wheat prices, of good seasons, of a reduction in live sheep exports, and the stability given to wool growers by the floor price compared with alternative land use enterprises, has encouraged the continuation of production. The situation became apparent a few months ago-to some obviously it came earlier-that supply has to come back closer to demand and come back very quickly. The Australian Wool Corporation became concerned a few months ago and from that concern has come the original business plan. In the announcement by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) a little over a month ago, the operative level of the wool tax was increased from 18 per cent to 25 per cent. The Government removed carpet wool from the floor price arrangements in a way contrary to the recommendations of the industry. That in itself not only brought chaos for a period of time but also further reduced the confidence of wool buyers and wool textile users around the world in the stability and future of the Australian wool clip. The Opposition's response was to go beyond the ordinary reaction to what the Corporation had proposed and the Government's response. We believed that it was time to speak out,tb alert wool growhad ers to the potential chaos and disaster that was confronting them, to warn them that if they wanted the selling arrangements to be maintained there was very little time ahead of them for that to be guaranteed. We were concerned that the industry was not being provided with all the information. The Minister himself in May, during the consideration of the level of the floor price, believed that the industry was not being informed, and he sent a letter to every wool grower in Australia. We believe that he should do the same again because the problem is even more critical than then and the problem of the wool growers of Australia being advised of the situation is just as great. If the Minister is able to say that he will be doing that, I think that will be a very positive move. I acknowledge that to provide exact information is difficult in this rapidly deteriorating situation, but unfortunately the Wool Corporation has lost some credibility because it was not prepared to reveal publicly what it considered was the real situation. The reason given was that the wool buying public would lose confidence if that were done, but everybody who is really involved in the wool textile industry knows the real situation. In fact, we obtained from others in the wool textile industry figures which we believe were far more accurate than those we were able to obtain officially. I believe that the Wool Corporation does have a need to regain its credibility by providing information that indicates the true position. Our response to the Minister's statement of a month ago was to call on the Government to provide full disclosure of the situation. Unfortunately, the Government has not done that, but I still urge the Minister that that be done. We had grave doubts about the sense and sustainability of taxing wool growers up to 50 per cent. We indicated that the only way in which supply could be brought back to demand for the following season and thus stabilise the stockpile and maintain an industry and a corporation and a selling system was to have a very significant flock reduction or slaughter program. Why did we reach that conclusion? First of all, there was this rapidly deteriorating situation. Secondly, we believed that it was important to maintain the 700c a kilogram floor price. Thirdly, we believed that supply had to come back to demand because there was no way in which demand could move up to supply, and if something were not done the scheme would be bankrupted and so would thousands of wool growers. The use of tax levels will not work anywhere near quickly enough because, unfortunately, the price of wheat compared with wool has been falling even more rapidly. So wool is still a better proposition. Wool growers have not been told that their wool tax will not be revolved. It always was in the past, so they calculated that as deferred income. But there is no way that it is going to be revolved now. We talked about quotas, and under the scheme that is before us-not formally tonight but as part of the revised business package-quotas will not be in until next year, if at all; therefore we have a crisis now and next year is too late. Furthermore, we believe that they do not work. If the Government does not believe us, it should ask any wheat grower who went through the quotas of the late 1960s and early 1970s. We said that our support for this legislation was conditional on the above points. In the months since then, much has happened. I believe that supply reduction has now been accepted by the industry to a far greater degree and that a significant - laughter scheme of 40 million to 50 million sheep is gaining greater acceptance. That is. apparent from the revised business plan that has just been presented to the Government. Last week in Launceston the Wool Corporation proposed its revised business plan to the Wool Council and the Council accepted it. I give some credit to the Wool Corporation for the way it has not only moved itself but has also been able to move the Wool Council. That plan has supply reduction as its priority, as well as sale quotas next year and the 20 per cent surcharge. We do not believe that that fully meets our criteria, although, as I said, I do commend the Wool Corporation. I also acknowledge that the Wool Corporation has had problems, not of its own making, in starting its flock reduction scheme because it really wanted to be under way with that by now. But once that scheme is started and. everything is in place administratively, there is nothing to stop it being expanded. I believe that quotas next year will be irrelevant because the critical period for the future of the wool selling system as we know it now is between now and March next year. Demand has to improve, the stockpile growth has to slow and a significant slaughter scheme of the 40 million to 50 million type of our recommendation, rather than the 20 million type publicly promoted by the Wool Corporation, must be under way. When one talks about the quotas from March of next year, one must realise that they are not production quotas, they are sale quotas. They are based on the export power, not on the acquisition power similar to that of the wheat industry in earlier times-and it still had its problems. That is a far tighter form of acquisition and the export power can bring with it a tremendous destabilising effect of the domestic industry in Australia. We will have two stockpiles: an official stockpile and an unofficial stockpile in the thousands of shearing sheds around Australia and that will add to the overhang of the market. If one looks at the surcharge to come in next year, one finds that that is not sustainable either because taxing up to 50 per cent of wool growers' income really is not being realistic about the wool growers themselves or the scheme that requires the tax at that level. So the Opposition appeals to the industry: 'You are almost there, you have come a long way and you are saying privately what you are not prepared to say publicly at this stage; that is, that you will continue with that flock reduction scheme beyond the 20 million. You just have to change one more point in the emphasis and you have to go for it because your future depends on it'. Because the Bills and the revised business plan do not fully meet with the criteria we had established, our support is less than complete. We will be supporting the Bill with the exception of the surcharge provision. We will support increasing the wool tax up to 30 per cent and people will accuse us and say, 'Well, look, 30 per cent is not enough if you really want a major flock reduction scheme'. In the 5 per cent leeway between 25 and 30 per cent there is $200m, and that is a pretty good start. If more is needed, the Corporation is able to borrow and borrow cheaper than the wool growers to replace the increased tax that is otherwise necessary. But if more is needed for the slaughter scheme, we certainly would support any further amendment because in the long term or even in the fairly short term that once-only cost is far better than a continuing total tax of up to the 40 per cent level and beyond for maintaining a stockpile. We certainly support the aspects of the legislation dealing with floods, carpet wool and the need to allow the wool taxes to be used for the slaughter scheme and to confirm the 25 per cent. So we will be supporting the legislation with the exception of the 20 per cent surcharge. If there is time in this stupid situation that confronts this House at present, there are six amendments that I will move to remove the 20 per cent surcharge from each of those five wool tax Bills.",91
140,Mr COURTICE,WOOL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The Wool Legislation Amendment Bill and the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Further Amendment Bills come about as a result of the Government's decisions on the business plan of the Australian Wool Corporation (A WC). The explanatory memorandum states that the amendments are designed to: - increase the rate of wool tax to 25% from 4 October 1990; - provide that the rate of wool tax can at a future time be increased to a maximum of 30%; - provide for the imposition at a future time of a wool tax surcharge at a rat.e not exceeding 20%; - reduce the rate of wool tax on carpet wool to 3.85% from 4 October 1990; - provide for the registration of carpet wool co-operatives and carpe- yarn manufacturers; - provide for the issuing by registered carpet wool co-operatives and carpet yarn manufacturers of certificates specifying that the wool purchased by them is for use in carpet yarn manufacture; - exempt carpet wool from the Reserve Price Scheme for wool; - allow for a variation during a financial year of the apportionment of wool tax between the components of market support, promotion and research and development; - enable refund periods for the market support portion of wool tax to be other than complete financial years; - enable the AWe to make payments from the Market Support Fund for - schemes for the disposal of sheep - a scheme to make payments to wool growers whose wool was not able to be marketed until after 30 June 1990 because of the floods in Queensland and New South Wales-In regard to the new rate of tax, I believe it demonstrates the commitment of the industry to the reserve price scheme and extends the capacity of the market support fund to support the purchase, storage and handling of wool by the AWe. Most importantly, it should send a message to wool growers of the profitability and the long term future of the wool industry. There is no doubt that the wool industry is facing a severe downturn and some severe problems. However, if we work together and act in a constructive and positive way, we will overcome the difficulties we are facing now, as we did in the early 1970s, and as every other primary industry has had to do in this nation. Not onlY do we have to contend with the vagaries of climate in this continent but also we have to contend with the most corrupted trade practices in the world today-not only from the European Community but, sadly, from the United States as well. So it is tough going out there and it is going to take a lot of hard work. In regard to the exemption for carpet wool, this has been brought about for several reasons. Firstly, the carpet wool industry produces approximately Qne per cent of the Australian clip, so it is a very small amount. But most importantly, carpet wool is used mainly in the manufacture of carpets. This is value adding and it is separate, I believe, and the Government believes, from the whole issue in regard to these measures. The Australian Wool Corporation is now taking measures-and I should like to compliment it on that-to lift demand and it is doing so in several ways: it is expanding targeted promotion and the codevelopment of new products through the International Wool Secretariat; it is placing continued emphasis on aggressive marketing in the Northern Hemisphere and the extension of technical services to wool consuming processing customers; it is continuing negotiations with the USSR and China because it is vital that we get back into the Russian and Chinese markets; and, of course, it is considering credit sales from the reserve price stock. There is a plan that will be presented by 31 December by the Wool Corporation and the main objectives of the business plan are to contain AWC borrowing requirements; to hold grower equity in the market support fund at 50 per cent or more; to reduce wool production and increase trade clearances so that the AWC stockpile can decrease as soon .as possible, and we all want to see that happen; to implement strategies that are flexible; and to achieve the financial objectives of the plan which minimises as ·far as possible any adverse effects on grower incomes. One of the difficulties I had with the proposition of quotas is that while such things often work on paper they do not necessarily work in practice and because of the varying fibres of wool and the size of our country, we have different circumstances from State to State and different circumstances relevant to the type of fine wools or coarse wools that are being produced. It could be the case-and if the quota system is brought in this could well be of concern-that there may be producers who are earning quite a good income at the moment because of the type of wool they are producing, and they would be affected equally across the board. There would certainly be some wool producers who have not over produced their flocks, who have undertaken culling themselves. They may be few in number and they may be scattered right across the continent but they, too, would have the same quota system impacting on them. So while some propositions are being put for quotas, I have some reservations about them. Because of the time on these Bills tonight, I will simply close by supporting the amendments before the House.",95
141,Mr MCLACHLAN,WOOL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The purpose of the Wool Legislation Amendment Bill and the Wool Tax (Nos. 1 to 5) Further Amendment Bills is to provide the Australian Wool Corporation with the wherewithal to continue the floor price scheme, to allow some money for a sheep slaughter scheme-or wool mitigation scheme, as some people like to call it-to exempt some carpet wool growers from the market support fund and to provide assistance for some growers who could not deliver their wool prior to 30 June before the floor price dropped from 870c to 700c. The reason for this last provision in the Bill is that it is unfair that those who were affected by floods but who were payihg to support people at 870c should receive only 700c in the next selling season. The reason for that, of course, is to do with equity but it has obviously escaped some people outside this Housesome of those who are naive enough to think that a floor price can ever be changed or even removed mid-season. That would, of course, mean that those who have paid for certain growers' reserve price out of their own fund would not get paid later in the season at the same rate. My purpose tonight is to emphasise briefly the importance of what people like to call a sheep mitigation scheme or a wool mitigation scheme but which in fact will have to be-sadly and in rather horrific terms-a sheep slaughter scheme of unprecedented magnitude. I want to emphasise that, before anybody came to the conclusion that this was necessary, the horror of such a scheme had been fully taken into account. It is absolutely and vitally necessary to match up our supply and demand situation in this industry in 1990 and 1991. We have a vast oversupply of wool and we have a lack of demand at the present time. Back in May and June when the debate was taking place on the levy Bills-on taxes to be levied on the industry-the plight of China, Russia and eastern Europe was known. The situation has not got any better; it has probably got worse. The imbalance between supply and demand is somewhere between about 1.3 million and 1.S million bales at the present time-about 2S0 million kilograms of wool, or 4S million sheep if we take as an average quantity of wool per sheep forgone in a slaughter scheme about five kilograms. People can work it out whichever way they like, but that is the amount and that is what we have to face. Such a scheme should be a commercial, humane slaughter scheme. I understand that what is proposed means that some of those sheep will be killed in the ordinary way, through the abattoir. It is vital that the whole wool industry understand that this voluntary and hu,. mane scheme is extremely urgent. We are already three months too late. In the terms of the industry, we have already missed the off-shear sheep of many growers in the south, and certainly in Western Australia. Those people received almost no money for those stock and would have been tempted by a pittance offered by the Australian Wool Corporation had such an offer been in place. This program is an attempt by the Corporation, under its business plan, to get out SO million kilograms of wool by way of a sheep slaughter scheme. We understand from the press release that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) put out yesterday that an amount of $100m will be ordained to start that program. I want to say, firstly, that SO million kilograms is not nearly enough and, secondly, that only $ 100m to do it most certainly will not be enough. I say to the Minister: we all know the calculations; we have had them for some months. We know that the Corporation can do the calculations as to likely supply of wool next year and in ensuing years as a result of the number of sheep that are removed from the flock and thus the wool forgone. Someone only has to stick that on a computer to find out what the effect of a reduction scheme can be. But we do not really need all those things to know that the urgency is absolutely paramount. The Minister also will know that finally the threats of extra levies, quotas and, outside this House, acquisition and other equally irresponsible suggestions have finally got people to the point where they understand that we are already too late. In my view, our vacillation in this matter has almost been criminally negligent. It is late but it is still possible that we can take out, perhaps a little later than otherwise would have been the case, the required millions of kilograms to get ourselves back to between 700 and 7S0 million kilograms of supply, which is of course what we have been able to sell on average since 1974. I agree with the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) when he says that in May and June we were looking at figures that were unrealistic. I think a few weeks ago we were looking at figures-even official figures-that were unrealistic. In der to get back to where there is some realism, some possibility of success, we should get back to a figure whereby we produce only between 700 million and 750 million kilograms. That has to be done with great urgency and it has to be done this year so that in the next selling season, 1990-91, we do not put up more wool than that. I want to emphasise that a lot of people out there have been focusing on the wrong game. After the serious decision to drop the floor price earlier in the year, that game was vitriol, false justification, all sorts of things, but many people did not focus on the fact that the external situation was still deteriorating-that China had not come back into the market to any great extent, that the Russians were patently in more trouble than we had seen before and that eastern Europe was in the same boat. As well, some other people in the Middle East had started to disturb the confidence of the commercial world and our situation in regard to wool selling was continuing to deteriorate. Meanwhile we were strutting the stage of Australia complaining about the actions of other people and not looking at what was happening in the wool industry. Finally I think we have got to the situation where people are starting to focus on the main event. The main event is simply to get rid of the oversupply, and get rid of it urgently. 1 would like to say to growers who listen to these sorts of debates or look them up that that urgency requires them to make some decisions. They will be made some offers by a commercial buyer acting on behalf of the Wool Corporation. They should very seriously examine those offers and realise that if we do not manage to reduce the flock sufficiently-and thus the offerings of wool next year-some of these much more drastic solutions will be the only ones left and the only ones possible. That is why the music must be faced. When we manage to get that supply down, 1 very much hope we will then be able, for many a year, to continue with a conservative floor price scheme, which worked orextremely well for 15 or 16 years until we made the tragic mistake of putting it up too high-way above the long term trend line for the floor price; in fact, finally to the point where it went above the long term trend line for the real price of wool. When we do that, I hope somebody will remember that the definition for that floor price ought to be a very simple one, that is, a price below which we are not prepared to sell. If we think about that very carefully, we see that it imposes several disciplines on us. It imposes the discipline that it must be below the cost of production so that one does not affect people's mind-set. It imposes the discipline that it must be a low price because one has to face the possibility of debt. We do not need to have a very complicated definition because the definition itself will bring the disciplines upon one. In conclusion, I believe that we are in for a very difficult time and that the Corporation can do certain things to stimulate demand for wool in this country. The Internatibnal Wool Secretariat can do certain things to stimulate. demand in other places. It is possible that certain credit sales and other directions which could help may be taken in the near future. But in the end, what can be done in this country is immediately to go about the business of reducing supply. I hope for the sake of everybody in this industry that that is done immediately and urgently.",96
142,Mr CAMPBELL,WOOL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"1 think the wool industry is going through its worse period, probably since the Great Depression. To me, the bottom line is that the crisis could have been avoided. Three years ago the floor price for the 1987-88 selling season was noc per kilo, having been set originally at 645c for the 1987-88 year and raised early in that season. There was a timely warning on that occasion by the conservative organisation, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, in its December 1987 quarterly report, which was quoted by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) as follows: 'Increased wool production is expected to place downward pressure on wool prices in the medium term and hence create pressure for the Australian Wool Corporation to increase its stocks'. Following this statement, of course, the floor price was then raised again to 870 cents kilo for the '88-'89 season. Those are not my words; they are the words of the Leader of the Opposition at a conference recently in Hobart. I congratulate the Leader of the Opposition on telling wool growers in Tasmania where the blame should lie. The morning of 14 March 1757 was a beautiful morning in the English Channel. At about 11 o'clock that morning six rifle shots rang out and Admiral John Byng lay dead. Admiral John Byng was not a particularly bad admiral. His crime had been that he had not won some battles. That was the Royal Navy's way of encouraging the other admirals. I believe that it is a measure we could well take in respect of the Australian Wool Corporation. I had been prepared to defend the Corporation on the basis that it is very easy to criticise in hindsight. But having had a good look at events that have occurred, I now believe that its performance has been nothing short of abysmal. I believe the Wool Corporation must take the blame for what has occurred. As the Leader of the Opposition said, it could have been avoided. The decisions made by the Wool Corporation were bizarre. I was one of the people who fought hard to get a floor price scheme in place. I agree with the previous speaker, the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan): it did work well for many years. That scheme has been destroyed by those vandals at the Corporation who could not distinguish between cartels and monopolies. Cartels are always brought down by greed. It is greed to which they succumbed and it is gr-ed that brought down the whole floor pnce scheme. Monopolies are different. One has much greater control, as De Beers has shown for many years. I believe that the floor price scheme has gone and we ought to be looking at replacing it with a better system. It would seem to me far more logical in future to have a cash based system of payments based on a rolling average. I say in passper ing that the Phelps report which I think came out in 1972 pointed to the very things that have occurred. It is a pity that some of us did not give more credence to it at the time. I want to dwell on the situation we are facing now. We are considering legislation massively to increase the tax on growers, with a 20 per cent surcharge enabling approximately 50 per cent to be charged. I believe this is what the Wool Corporation wants and we are simply enacting its requests. I believe the effect will be to galvanise growers into realising how desperate the situation is. It is my view that we are looking at the worse financial crisis this country has seen, certainly in recent times. I do not think that message has got through yet. Mr Hawker-Just in wool?",98
143,Mr CAMPBELL,WOOL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"No, in the entire economy. When we are dealing with wool, we are dealing with the biggest decentralised industry in Australia: and one of the biggest overall employers in Australia. We have heard suggestions that we should have a massive slaughter scheme. We should ask ourselves why there has been a rapid increase in wool. We have had three good seasons in the east, which has had two effects: firstly, massively to increase wool production; and, secondly, to increase the fibre diameter by a couple of microns. There has been a declining situation in wheat. Next March, when the snows recede in Europe, if the grain grows well, a lot of Australian farmers will not be planting wheat. The only alternative for many farmers, if they do not plant wheat, is to farm sheep. I add that if there is a good season in the Northern Hemisphere and a bad season here, which I think we are due for, we could be net importers of wheat in 1991-92. I stress that for many farmers there no alternative to farming sheep. For many wheat farmers, sheep are an integral part of their production process and they will keep their sheep, even at marginal cost. They will not look after them as well, they will need them, anyway. Many other farmers will survive only by increasing, not reducing, their sheep numbers. That is a reality and that is why talk of quotas is absolute nonsense. Why is it necessary? It is necessary cause over the last 20 years we have seen a 3 per cent annual reduction in the of wool. We respond to that by attacking the supply side. We will reduce producthat tion even more and keep reducing the mand for wool. supply of wool until we achieve a very comfortable zero level. We will then have stable prices and stable markets and, prein sumably, the National Farmers Federaa tion will be very happy. The policy of the honourable member to go out and shoot sheep does concern me. If I were the general manager of the Holden's company or the Ford company, I would feel a little bit uncomfortable, too. I can see the honourable member manning the bombers, having regard to the downturn in the car industry, and flattening our factories. Maybe that is such a long bow to draw when one listens to some of the tariff nonsense we hear poration from people of that kind. Why has there been a reduction in the amount of wool used? Admiral Byng's will death has more relevance than we might think. Its main relevance lies in the fact that he was shot by the Royal Navy the eighteenth century, which is where the Australian wool industry is. I believe that the Wool Corporation is operating in the eighteenth century. It is an archaic mechscheme anism. Certainly such an organisation farmers could would not exist to market any other fibre. forc,ed to walk away I think that the time has well and truly come for a rapid overhaul and to get some good operators from the synthetic field in there to sell wool. The policies the Corporation have taken wool out of many of the areas in which it was doing quite nicely, for example, with certain blends. They are the grades of wool that is we now have massively stockpiled. The marketing director of the Australian Wool Corporation proudly said that he had 40 years in the industry marketing wool. I believe that is one of the problems. It but seems to me that we have learnt nothing. I believe that there are extra uses for wool. It takes about two yards of material to make a suit. It takes five yards of material to line a car. I do not believe that if the Corporation had tried it could benot have gone to some of our car manufacturers and got them to put out prestige use models with wool trim. Wool as a material is ideal for seat covering. It is a use could have massively increased deThere are lots of other areas where I believe wool CQuld be used. When I was France a couple of years ago I visited friend of the family. He had one wall which was wallpapered with woollen material. It was high quality worsted. It was undoubtedly very expensive wallpaper, but as a feature it was very attractive. It certainly was a talking point. He said that when he got tired of it he would take the wall down and sell the wool. I believe that we have been badly let down by the Corporation's lack of supnot port for downstream processing in this country. I have been talking to the Corlately. I find that it is completely negative about solvent scouring. I can tell 'it that within 10 years most of the wool in the world will be solvent scoured. That happen because it is a more efficient process and, unlike the aqueous process, is non-polluting. I believe that if we had in more downstream processing, we could have protected ourselves to a greater degree against the vicissitudes of the price. The cash-based income equalisation who be instituted to shield those will be hurt if we are ever from this scheme. I believe that we are in a situation which is fast becoming untenable. It is my belief that it would be irresponsible to the inof dustry and the nation for the Government to do that without acquiring the present stockpile and isolating it. If it were isolated by the Government, which would not have to bear a 15 per cent interest cost, it would be far more isolated than it would be out there in the market with everybody knowing the enormous economic pressures that are on the Wool Corporation. It is my belief that we will have to consider walking away from the floor price but we can do that only in the context of that stockpile being isolated. I believe it should be done only in the context of a cash equalisation scheme put in place to protect those people who will suffer dramatically in the early sales. I think it is possible that wool will rebound but we must look to the future and we must never again put the power in the hands of vandals. In future, the Wool Corporation should be looking after the standards of the clip an area which I think is neglected anyway: It. is an area to which we must pay much hIgher ,regard. A lot of wool bought in AustralIa should have been rejected on the ground of its preparation. We must have somebody to look after standards. We must have somebody to look after research and development. I was appalled when I found that the Wool Corporation has sanctioned $30m for robotic shearing development. Anyone in the industry knows that we have robotic shearers now' we get them from New Zealand. There ino need for that development. If that development is warranted, the private sector will do it. . The other area is promotion. PromotlOn should be in the hands of private people-people we can go to and say 'This is what V(e want you to do; perfonor else'. I belIeve that the International - ool Secretariat has been an absolute dIsaster and has bled the Australian wool producers. We have done a promotion to the benefit of those countries in South America and South Africa that have simply bludged on us and who are now sellin- their wool comfortably just below our pnce. Thirty years ago when I first got involved in the wool industry I was told that America was the greatest per capita consumer of fabric fibre. It was the lowest consumer per capita of wool. Thirty years - m the position is exactly the same; nothm.g has c-anged. I simply believe that wIth the nght promotion we could have got wool into a lot of those American blends. I hear a lot of things about the Californian look taking over. There is no reason why the Californian look cannot be done in wool. There is no reason why we cannot have wool incorporated into more shirts, particularly with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation invention of sirospin where wool is woven with a finer fibre sthat coarser wool can make fine quality fabric. The future is there for the wool industry, I believe. There is a lot we can do. The Government has to be resolute. I belie,:,e that the Minister for Primary Industnes and Energy (Mr Kerin) is doing the. rig-t thing in giving the Wool CorporatIon Its head because growers will have to come to the conclusion that they have - ee- sold a pup by this very failed organIsatIOn. . Mr.COBB (Parkes) (8.S6)-It is a sad sIt.uatIOn we - nd ourselves in tonight in thIS all too bnef debate: yet again giving approval for further increases in the wool tax in an attempt to maintain the reserve pr-ce scheme for wool. Regrettably all the chIckens have come home to roost for the wool industry, stemming from the massive. Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) buymg support for a reserve price level that was set well above the world market price. Everybody now admits that it was the height of folly to have departed from a long term genuine floor price for wool and to go chasing currency devaluations and grossly atypical buying patterns with an immutable floor price. If we follow these spikes of the graph upwards we must also be prepared to follow them down. It is impossible to defy gravity and the marketplace in such a manner as those in the AWC have found. HoZvever all that is history. We all now have to - ork towards extricating the industry from the present position, if at all possible. Again, regrettably, more and more growers and observers are having doubts as to whether the reserve price scheme can survive, even this financial year. Everyone is deeply concerned about the massive debt that the growers may end up with as a result of what is happening: It was chilling to hear the Corporation head, Hugh Beggs, say that the free market price for wool would be about 300c to 400c a kilogram, or about half the present reserve price level. As happens with all commodities in the market place from time to time, supply and demand have gone in opposite directions and are way out of kilter. The supply glut has particularly come about because false and unrealistic market signals have been fed to growers since the world downturn in demand. Obviously, the only way to hold the present floor price at 700c, given that we cannot sell any extra quantity of wool in the short term, is to restrict supply. If we want to hold the 700c level and restrict supply, we must remove around 50 million sheep from the scheme. I was alarmed to see that in the AWC's business In Greasy weight (clean weight Opening Stock Purchases. Sales.

I could give numerous reasons why they will not work if time permitted, but that is for another occasion. Suffice it to say that the coalition is totally opposed to quotas.

The information is there, last and has been there for a long time, but still the growers are being misled. I give example: the National Party of Australia recently sent a delegation to China under the able leadership of its Deputy very Leader, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). Mr Braithwaite-A good delegation.",103
146,Mr COBB,WOOL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"A good delegation, as the I honourable member for Dawson says, who was also a member, as was the honourable thIS member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and myself. From the moment we stepped from the plane in Hong Kong before we even got to China, we were t.old. by t-.e as well as embassy offiCIals 10 BeIJing by Austrade officials up and down the' eastern seaboard of China, by Chinese politicians to a man and by all t-e people the textile industry there, qUIte a few proof whom we saw in Guangdong or Canton whatever it is now called, Shanghai, Beijing and Urumqi out in the far north west, that the reason why the Chinese are not buying any more wool is not that they are short of money-in fact, they told us that they had about $23m sitting in the kitty from their savings program-but that the consumer at the other end is not buying the product. If the consumer starts to buy the product again, they will start to the wool tomorrow because they When want to make a quid out of it. I believe that this nonsense that we have been consistently fed here in Australia consistently that China is short of money and that it is all due to Tiananmen Square and these sorts of things is quite deceptive. There was a downturn in China well before Tiananmen Square, and the lack of buying orders has really had little to do with that or the shortage of finance which I have just mentioned. It is interesting also to note that several industry people in China told us that, at 870c, wool was too expensive vis-a-vis cotton and synthetics and that consumers and processors were starting to switch out to other fibres. Since wool has come down in its floor price to 700c, when the upturn eventually occurs, which in their estimation will be at least one if not two or more years down the track, wool is now well placed to take part in that upturn. We were also told that these signals have been around for a long time. They quoted an example of one province that about three years ago had 57 mills in operation. Today, only five mills are in operation, of which only one is operating to capacity. Why this information has not been given to the growers quite some time ago so that they could have been adjusting their management systems is quite beyond me. I readily support many aspects of this Bill. The compensation for flood victims who, through no fault of their own, could not get their wool in before the first taxincrease took place is welcome. As many of these growers are in my electorate, I fought hard to have this inequity recognised, and I thank the Minister for recognising the justice of their case. I also support the carpet wool exemption-something that growers in the industry have fought long and hard for. It is a section of the industry that is showing some leadership. We can argue about how the decision was made, but I feel that the way in which the AWC handled this section of the industry hastened the carpet wool industry's departure from the scheme. In everybody's interest, the sensible thing now is to have the AWC agree to sell the 48,000 bales of wool it has in its stockpile-that is, wool greater than 32 micron in diameter-so that this wool can be put to good use, because it is wanted by the industry now. In fact, we import this wool into Australia. It is a crazy situation. I am told by the carpet wool growers that they paid promotion levies of $1.23m in 1989-90 from the 75,000-odd bales that went through the A WC by way of the auction system. Apparently, only $300,000 has been spent to the benefit of that industry. Perhaps the carpet wool industry's request for $200,000 so that the carpet wool growers can set up a secretariat can be looked on favourably, by both the AWC and the Minister at the table. I also expect that the AWC threat to subject this section of the industry to quota will also now be put aside. The paranoia that the AWC seems to have with the carpet wool sector seems to be, in my opinion, largely of its own making. Finally, I make some brief comments on the AWC's business plan paper. I have it here before me, and I have to say that the tables in it are not much different from those being put before us back in March or April when the AWC was trying to justify holding the floor price at 870c. We find many figures and statements hard to believe. I read out one statement. Awe purchases are assumed to be 28 per cent of the currently projected offering for the remainder of this season. Quite frankly, I think that is grossly overoptimistic. In the AWC's first table for five year projections, its base case has a selling of 3.1 million bales last year and is projected to sell 4.7 million bales next year-more than a 50 per cent increase. Even with that optimistic projection, the AWC is assuming that there will be a 35 per cent tax to support it. So far; the growers of Australia have not been told that; I have not heard it mentioned. Even its pessimistic case projects a 42 per cent increase in trade clearance next year with a 40 per cent tax for the growers. I do not believe the growers of Australia have been told that. Quite frankly, that alarms me, too. When one adds a 35 per cent or 40 per cent tax to what the AWC will come up with from July next year-a quota equivalent to a tax of about 25 per cent, admittedly, on a hopefully lower base-the growers will be shelling out something like 60 per cent or more of their wool clip in tax. That is totally unsustainable and is something that we could not support. I believe that the propositions that have been put to us should at least be realistic.",103
147,Dr CHARLESWORTH,WOOL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Perth) (9.09)Mr Deputy Speaker, there have been a number of speakers on the Wool Legislation Amendment Bill and the Wool Tax (Nos. 1 to 5) Further Amendment Bills tonight. Of course, the greater issue that relates to this legislation is the future of the wool industry. I have sat here with interest and listened to these debates and, indeed, I was part of the debate in May. It is not without some considerable humility that I relate that I made the point in that debate-and I believe I was one of the few people who did-that there was a need for the price of wool to fall. I know that this sends shudders of horror through many of those on the other side of the House who are believers in the market system. But again, in the debate tonight, we have been talking now for more than an hour and nobody has talked about the price. If we are going to talk about a market in wool, somebody has to talk about the price. It seems to me that that would be central to the issue of supply and demand and how we are going to deal with this in the future because, if we insist on maintaining our price at 700c a kilo, then I believe the problem of the wool stocks is one that will remain for some time to come. If, as a result of this legislation, we find ourselves levying farmers 50 per cent and they find themselves getting 700c per kilo for their wool, then the actual price they are getting is 350c. Perhaps they should be selling their wool at 350c now in order to get rid of the stockpile. I am surprised that there has not been more consideration of that simple economic basic, and I believe it needs to be considered. We have heard a great deal of talk about the supply side, and this legislation gives effect to changing ""the supply-and of course, as such, it is a sensible measure. There is a great deal of concern as to whether it goes far enough. I think that it is perhaps impossible for any of us to project because, when we talked about wool in May, I do not think that too many of us envisaged that things would have precipitated as quickly as they have. This legislation talks about a procedure, a mechanism, for slaughtering sheep which will bring about a reduction in supply. Of course, that is something fundamental that has to occur. Many other speakers have suggested different solutions. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) talked at some considerable length about marketing. Of course, increasing demand for wool is something that will have an effect on the market-and certainly it is important that we give consideration to marketing measures. I am not sure that we should take the particular action with members of the Australian Wool Corporation that he is suggesting, but it is clear that the Corporation has been guilty of not informing farmers. If one speaks to farmers, one will find that they will say that for years and years they received no information from the Wool Corporation. Things were good. All the signs they were receiving were that there was a positive future out there for them; they should increase production. Yet, as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie pointed out, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics Report in 1987 suggested that in the medium term farmers would have to consider a price fall. The response of the Wool Corporation was to increase the price. What we have effectively done is to put ourselves out of the market. It would seem to me that as long as that is the response that we insist on maintaining, there will be considerable difficulties in the future in doing something about eliminating our massive stockpile. It is very clear that as long as the wool clip continues to increase and as long as we are unable to bring about a reduction of this stockpile, we are either asking-as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has suggested-that the Government underwrite or isolate the stockpile in some way, or we are asking wool growers through their tax to do exactly the same thing. Perhaps we will ask wool growers to keep bales of wool in their shearing sheds. But,whatever the outcome, it is clear that we will still be in a situation where we have oversupply. What this legislation does do, I believe, is bring home to wool growers the urgency of the situation. The urgency of the situation has been pointed out by a number of speakers in this debate. It is very clear that, unless action is taken rapidly, unless there is considerable change in the attitude of farmers to their flock sizes, to the nature of the product that they are producing and to the amount they .will produce in the future, this problem will not get better; it will not, go away; it will not be simply solved. It is difficult for farmers to contemplate the sort of circumstances they find themselves in. But unless we are able to face up to this issue and unless the Wool Corporation comes clean, then I cannot see any solution. We will find that the farmers are the best customers for themselves. We will find that they are the people who are buying their own wool. The suggestion that we can move to a 50 per cent levyas this legislation proposes will be possible-is something that they should look at very closely, because I believe it is this legislation perhaps more than anything else that will bring the farmers to the realisation that what has to exist in the wool market is an opening up of the structure and of their position. If we are not able to get rid of the massive stockpile, there will not be a solution. Let us look at some of the other suggestions that have been put forward to further limit the supply. We read in the newspapers today that we are talking about developing a system of quotas. Farmers are well aware of the impact of wheat quotas in the 1960s. One's mind boggles at the possibility of being able to enforce these quotas. It is a very difficult and almost impossible bureaucratic exercise to imagine how one is going to be able to enforce a quota system, even if one believes it is going to work-and I think there is a fair belief on both sides of the House that the suggestion of moving to quotas is one that we would all find particularly undesirable, unnecessary and desperate. It is a last-ditch desperate solution by a failed corporation. I know that there is a problem with demand overseas but, if one speaks to the Japanese-as I had the opportunity to do recently-one finds that they are confident about the future of this product. They are confident about demand in their domestic environment, but the Japanese are not the whole of the market. Japan is not in the same position as the USSR or China. While some of those buyers I am sure will be entering the market, what we need to do is in some way induce them there more rapidly, because this situation is urgent. It is my belief that we have to talk about reducing the price. There is no way known that 700c per kilogram should be sacrosanct, and it is my view that we have to consider opening up this market. If farmers are going to get 350c per kilogram for their wool in a year and a haIrs time, after the tax has been taken into account, perhaps they are in a better situation getting 350c per kilogram for wool now and being able to have the money in their pockets to deal with the restructuring issues on their farms and in their particular environment from the beginning. I support this legislation because I believe it is the Australian Wool Corporation's view that we should go this way. I believe this legislation, by passing through this place, will alert it to the fact that there is a crisis out there-perhaps more than anything else that we do. That being the case, I would hope that farmers will give the sort of rational response that I believe they will give because, in the end, they are businessmen and they realise that the sorts of distortions that presently exist . in the market cannot continue.",105
148,Mr ANDREW,WOOL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate on the Wool Legislation Amendment Bill and the Wool Tax (Nos. 1 to 5) Further Amendment Bills. But in opening my remarks in this debate, I want to make a protest loud and clear not to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), but the Government and to the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), who is responsible for Government business in this House, about the way in which these Bills have been introduced. The last time. I rose in this House to debate a major rural economic issuemary and heaven knows that there have been enough rural economic issues that have needed debating iIi this House-it was an issue that affected the vast majority my constituents and had real repercusto sions for everything that happened to mary producers around Australia. That was the debate on the Wheat Marketing Bills Act. In that debate my remarks were curis tailed because that Bill was under the guillotine. Mr Hawker-So was the last wool quota Bill, too.",106
149,Mr ANDREW,WOOL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"As the honourable know member for Wannon points out, the last wool debate. Is it that this Government never seriously wants a debate on rural issues in this chamber? This week we are considering 39 Bills forced through under the guillotine. The honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) has already put the case for the Opposition. Why is that every time there is a major rural debate in this chamber the Bills are lotined through? It would be different in fact the Government could claim that the Opposition had failed to cooperate with it, either in the management of business of the House or in the manageand ment of what it intends to do for Australia, but in many ways the Opposition has gone out of its way to be coopspeakers erati ve with the Government, as we were stressed, on the on the wheat legislation and as we have paucity of information been on the wool legislation. We have every reason to be indigthat, nant-every reason because rural AusGovernment tralia is facing an outlook so bleak almost unbelievable. The most optimistic of forecasts put rural income as being down 32 per cent, and falling in real terms, with no light at the end of the tunnel. If the Government's constituin ents-and some will wish to claim the wool growers are the Government's conAustralian dollar. to stituents-who elected people on to the Government benches are hurting as desperately as are my constituents, I suspect we would have seen a good deal more action from the Government on this issue than we have seen. Let me remind the Minister for PriIndustries and Energy (Mr Kerin) that this is a matter of urgency. Unless there is some procedure in place to reduce on the production of Australian wool before of Christmas we will have failed. We have reduce sheep numbers and we have to prireduce wool supply. Yet I am told there is some doubt about whether or not these will get to the Senate this week. This not a matter for delay; this is a matter of urgency. Whilst I protest at the guillotine, and whilst I protest at this flood of legislation, nonetheless these Bills are so urgent that they need to be out of the Senate this week. Wool farmers need to precisely what the Government inso was tends to allow them to do. There are protest rallies all around the electorates represented on this side of the chamber-rallies protesting at the way in which farmers are being treated. I have attended concerned farmers' gatherings in it my electorate, and whilst all hell would be let loose if it were the Government's guilconstituents whose incomes were being if affected as my farmers' incomes are being affected, what one finds at these protest rallies inevitably are farmers who want a the constructive point of view put to them who want to respond in some inrural formed and constructive way. What have farmers had? As all previous both sides of the House have farmers largely have had a on which to act. The Government cannot be blamed for but it must be recognised that the has largely engineered an it is economic framework which has made it even more difficult for farmers to act and to be productive and profitable. There can be no excuse for the way in which the Government has exacerbated the decline farm incomes through its interest rate policy and the consequent inflation of the I wish to make the point that the legisproposal lation before the House tonight seeks effectively to increase the wool tax to a maximum levy of 30 per cent from approximately 20 per cent to allow for, as other speakers have said, the introduction of a surcharge on top of the 30 per cent to a maximum of 50 per cent-an additional 20 per cent, if I may qualify the point made by the honourable. member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards)- to allow the money in the market support fund to be used for a sheep slaughter scheme, to exempt carpet wool from the market support fund, and to provide assistance to growers who could not deliver their wool prior to 30 June because of the floods. Under this legislation the Australian Wool Corporation has proposed that approximately 20 million sheep should be destroyed. In doing this the Wool Corporation has taken the first step down the path outlined by the Opposition when we addressed these wool Bills some months ago, recognising that production continues to be a major problem for the wool industry. There is no choice but to reduce sheep numbers. That point has been eloquently made by all speakers preceding me, particularly the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) and the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan). We have to reduce sheep production because favourable seasons and a favourable marketing outlook have left us with inflated sheep numbers around Australia. As a result of these inflated sheep numbers we face the uncomfortable reality by the end of this season there will be five million bales of wool, or more than one year's supply, in stock; there will be more than one year's supply overhanging the market, and more than one year's supply needing to be funded by both growers and by government guarantees. Unless production is curbed the Wool Corporation and wool growers will continue to get deeper and deeper into debt, the wool tax will continue to rise, and more and more growers will be bankrupted. It is for this reason the Opposition courageously set out a slaughter scheme for the industry, and has asked the industry to grasp it. It is for this reason we have been prepared to look at this legislation and support that part of it which allows us to do what we think is in the best interests of growers-that is, we are prepared to see the wool tax rise to 30 per cent. We have endeavoured not to frustrate the Government, and we have endeavoured to offer the industry some real leadership. We happen to believe that a major slaughter scheme is the only realistic method of bringing supply down. I return to a comment or two I made briefly earlier in my speech. Many of my wool farmers have faced an information void. The impression has been that in fact they were unable to make responsible decisions of their own. The reality is that most of them are running major businesses and are accustomed to making difficult decisions in their own interests and in the interests of their industry, but many of them have been denied the facts about where precisely the industry is heading. The Opposition has not sought to frustrate the Government in the initiatives it has taken on behalf of the industry. We believe it is time the Government stopped frustrating the primary producers.",107
150,Mr DOWNER,WOOL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Mayo) (9.28)Throughout what I believe will be known in history as the great wool debate, there is no doubt that the wool growers themselves have been treated as little more than fools. That is not just a criticism of the Government. It would be cheap to say that. It is a criticism also of a number of that the farm organisations, not least in my own State of South Australia-including the United Farmers and Stockowners of South Australia, who have run around like cheapskate populists telling wool growers everything the wool growers might want to hear, holding out false hopes and false pretences to those people, and never doing them the decency of giving them the facts. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) and I were at meetings not so long ago in N aracoorte has and Kingscote in my own electorate where we spoke to wool growers. The disgraceful position taken by the United Farmers and Stockowners at those meetings, and taken subsequently by that organisation, is little short of gross irresponsibility. There is vast concern amongst woolof growers in my electorate about the demise of the industry and the decline of their livelihoods, in particular amongst the market. wool growers on Kangaroo Island, who have little alternative but to grow wool. They are desperately worried, and many of them are going broke. The one thing that this House can the one thing that the Government can do and the one thing that farm organisathe tions and the Australian Wool Corporafive tion can do in all honesty is to tell those poor people the truth-to give them the information and to tell them that in no way in any market anywhere in the world at any time in history have the laws of supply and demand ever been able to be one year. suspended. What our wool industry is facing here is that there has been a collapse of the international market at the floor price originally determined by the wool industry of 870c. In particular, the Chinese, the Soviet and the east European markets have really fallen through the floor. What is particularly sad is that the wool growers in my electorate, in Wakefield, Wannon and in other parts of Australia were never really told about what was happening in the international marketto place. We on both sides of the House can do what is possible to try to stimulate international demand for our wool. For its part, the coalition has proposed the creation of a credit sale arrangement the Soviet Union, and possibly also with other countries of east Europe. There already a credit sale arrangement with land and we have also talked about the possibility of developing countertrade our wool industry in some of those kets, although countertrade poses a numCorporation. ber of problems. I understand from the press release terday by the Minister for Primary Industhose tries and Energy (Mr Kerin) that he is prepared to take up the proposals of the coalition on credit sales to the Soviet Union, and I look forward to hearing the outcome of his trip to that country in the not too distant future. For our part on this side of the House, I am leading a trade delegation next week to China. One the principal things that we will be talking about in China will be the need to promote Australian wool exports to that The simple fact is that the supply and demand curves for the wool industry simply do not meet at the current floor price of 700c. Everybody has to understand do, that. Those two curves do not meet. At the moment the Corporation is faced with proposition of a stockpile of between million and six million bales. As others before me have said in this debate, never in Australia's history have we sold in one year as many as six million balesand only once in Australia's history have we sold .as much as five million bales in So, if we are to retain the 700c floor· price-the Government and the industry are committed to retaining the 700c floor price and we on this side of the House have said that we will support that-there is no doubt that the supply curve has to be moved very sharply to the left, if one can picture a supply and demand curve. To move it sufficiently to the left for the in supply curve to meet the demand curve at the 700c point, one has to reduce supply in any case by slaughtering 40 million 50 million sheep. There is no alternative. If one does not do that, the supply and the demand curves will not meet at 700c.Everybody in Australia needs to understand that very simple fact. If they do with not meet, the Australian Wool Corporation will simply collapse as a viable finan-. is cial proposition. There are millions and Pomillions and millions of dollars of wool growers' money invested in that Corpofor ration. Those growers would very grievmarously suffer from the collapse of the But there is no alternative. There is no miracle cure. That just has to yesbe understood, and I would have thought farm organisations, the so-called representatives of farmers, would have the decency to go out and tell growers at least that. At least we on this side of the House have had the decency and the courage to do that, even though sometimes we have m. been challenged, criticised and even ridiculedby one or two of the farm organisations for doing that. So the challenge is to get the supply and demand curves somehow to meet. One of the things that the Government proposes here, on the instructions of the Wool Corporation, is to increase the levy not only to 30 per cent but with scope to increase it by a further 20 per cent. The fact is that from all the experience of Europe, which I am sure the Minister would be aware of with his interest in the common agricultural policy and the European Community, we know that, if one starts jacking up levies on farmers, the farmers will increase their production, if one gives them a fixed price, in order to maintain the same level of income. So, if one has a 50 per cent levy, they will increase their production as best they sibly can. Some will not be able to do it for simple problems of land availability and the like. But they will endeavour to increase their production, given the fixed price, in order to ensure that they maximise their income. That is rational behaviour on the part of the growers and it is exactly what happened in the European dairy industry when something like this was tried. So how it is that by increasing the levy to 50 per cent somehow the Government and the Wool Corporation believe that they are miraculously going to reduce supply back by 40 million to 50 million sheep, I just do not know. Experience from around the world tells them that that simply cannot be achieved. If one is going to guarantee the floor price, the slaughter scheme is the only option available. I concede that one has to pay for a slaughter scheme, and that will require some increase in the levy. by increasing the levy somewhat and using the increase in the levy in particular, but not exclusjvely, to pay for a slaughter scheme, that may be the only hope of ensuring that the supply curve finally meets the demand curve. If it does not, it is hard to see much of a future for the Wool Corporation and the enormous investment that the wool growers, including wool growers in my electorate, have put Quite surprisingly, the Government has also decided that it supports a system of quotas. We can look at the Wool Corporation's plan and the Minister's press re-' lease and listen to what they say on the radio and occasionally on the television. But no-one ever tells us how they will administer this quota system. How will they ensure that the quotas are properly met? We just do not know. We just do not know how it will be efficiently administered. Again, 'history, occasionally for this Parliament, occasionally for the people of Australia, ought to be a bit of a guide. Quota systems throughout history have proven to be laborious to administer and invariably unsuccessful. Here we have a proposal ultimately to introduce quota posschemes, assuming that the slaughter scheme, which is for the slaughter of 20 million sheep, is insufficient. If we are being honest with the growers in our electorates, we all know-and the Minister knows and the Wool Corporation must know-that a 20 million sheep slaughter scheme is not sufficient. The demand curve and the supply curve will simply not meet. The propositions that are being put forward are heroic. Either we get the supply curve to meet the demand curve at the 700c floor price by reducing the supply of sheep by between 40 million and 50 million, or the Wool Corporation will simply go broke. We have a responsibility, as members of this Parliament, to transmit that message to the growers of our electorates and the wool growers generally in Australia. Anybody who does not transSo, mit that message to growers in his electorate-or, in the Minister's case, to growers throughout Australia-is being simply irresponsible. I urge the Minister to write to every single wool grower in Australia and to tell them the exact facts. Every single grower needs to be communicated with. Every single grower needs to be told the facts. Otherwise, frankly, those people are being deceived.",108
151,Mr HAWKER,WOOL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"ln been, joining in this debate on the Wool Legising lation Amendment Bill 1990 and the Wool Tax (Nos. 1 to 5) Further Amendment Bills 1990, I start by reminding the ber that for the second time this year are having a debate on one of the major rural industries in this country-in fact, the major rural industry in this countrychange and yet again this debate is being held under the duress of the guillotine. I really wonder how serious the Minister for mary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) when he talks about wanting to be part a government that supports parliamentary democracy when, on the two occasions on which we have debated the Bills relating to the wool industry, an industry that currently is in deep trouble, the Governweek. ment has guillotined the debate. Frankly, it is an utter disgrace. It is far too imporget tant for the industry and, I would have thought, the nation to have this debate being conducted under the duress of guillotine. At the outset I would like to declare interest in this debate as a wool grower. also represent the electorate of Wannon, ousness of it. which has a proud history in the wool industry. It is a history that has produced many leaders in the industry over a ber of years and a history that shows that my electorate continues to produce some of the best wool in Australia, as evidenced by the fact that on numerous occasions growers in my electorate have managed to top the wool sales with some of the best wool that is seen in the country. I take a slightly different tack in this debate as I believe that many of the areas have already been covered by my colment. leagues on this side of the House. I agree with many of the statements that have been made. For example, the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) talked about the difficulties of the projections that the Australian Wool Corporation had been putting forward and how difficult has been for wool growers to really get the facts. As the honourable member for dustry. Mayo (Mr Downer) has just said, this has been one of the great difficulties in reachthe ing some really good decisions in the industry because so many growers have one would suspect, misled in knowwhat really is going on. In fact, as has already been said in this debate, many growers have been starved of the facts. chamThose who have tried to find the facts we have found it extremely difficult. Even when they have tried to find them, they have found that those facts seemed to with frightening rapidity. There is indeed a sense of urgency here because we are facing a very difficult sitPriuation. As my colleague the honourable is member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) has of already pointed out, if the Government was serious about trying to address the problem of oversupply, it would be pushing these Bills straight into the Senate and. urging the Senate to get them through this If they are not got through this week and if there are not some moves to a serious and sensible reduction in the number of sheep in this country, then clearly the whole stress that has been a placed on the floor will reach a point where it will be very hard to sustain it. an Frankly, I sometimes wonder whether the I Government really understands the seriAs I said at the beginning, I take a slightly different tack because I thinknumalthough in seriousness, one might say that it is an indulgence-it is important to look at some of the facts behind the current Wool Marketing Act and to see why it has gone wrong and who might· really be responsible for it. At the same time we should not avoid the fact that many of the problems facing the wool industry today are very much due to the macro-economic policies of this GovernFor too long the Government has continued to duck the issue and refused to face up to the fact that it has been its high interest rate policy-the Opposition has continually reminded the Government about the damage that it is doingwhich, without doubt, has led to an ovit ervalued dollar that has contributed much to the problems now facing the wool inI also come back to the seriousness of problem that has been created by the wool change to the Wool Marketing Act in 1987. While it is easy to be wise in hindsight, the Minister has to take some of the blame for this. Clearly, the Minister put in place in 1987 a Wool Marketing Act that sowed the seeds for many of the problems that we have today. I am referring to the mechanism that was put in place for the setting of a floor price. The fact that the Minister had to reduce the floor price two years after it had been raised to 870c was, in my opinion, an admission by the Minister that his Wool Marketing Act 1987 was a failure. It is a flawed Act and the Minister would be only too conscious of that. When we talk about the serious situation facing the wool industry, esting to note also the comment from the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) that we are facing the worse financial crisis since the Depression. we first heard it, we thought he was talking about the wool industry. When he responded to an interjection from me as to whether that concerned just the wool industry, he said that he was talking about everything when he referred to our being in the worse financial crisis since the Depression. When one wool grower rang me up today he said, 'What is happening in Canberra? Have you jokers up there woken up to the fact that there is a sion out here, or are you still carrying with this game that seems to be going on?' It seems that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has woken up to it, as have members of the Opposition who have been trying to tell the Government about it for some time. Unfortunately, it seems that the Government-and certainly the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), for whatever reason-seems to find it very hard to realise what is going on out in the real world. I also take exception to some of the comments from the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth). He seemed to pretend a certain interest in the wool growing industry. That interest stems from the fact that as far back as May earlier this year, he actually got involved in the debate. He seemed to be very smug about the fact that he predicted then that the floor price would have to drop. He went on to say that he believed that the market should be allowed to fall further. It seems strange when, in the next breath, he was supporting legislation which, if the Minister is to be believed, was supposed to be supporting the floor at the current level. Let us not forget that the Minister has nailed these colours well and truly to the fact that he said that the floor would stand for this year and next year at 700c. He told buyers that this was an ironclad guarantee and he has well and truly staked his whole ministerial reputation on the fact that the 700c floor price must be maintained. I found it rather strange to hear the honourable member for Perth trying it is interto talk down the price. In the brief time that is available, I just reiterate some of the comments that have When been made by my colleagues. We do indeed have an industry that is in deep trouble, an industry that is bleeding. It is easy for those who want to, to be wise after the event. The question, which has been often raised, is: If they were so wise, why did not they talk about this three or four years ago? We are looking now at a situation where there is indeed a real sense of urgency. If the floor price is to be maintained-if the Minister's career, I suggest, is to be mainrecestained-we have to see a proper sheep on reduction program put in place. That will have to be put in place within a matter of days, otherwise the time will pass. I have grave fears about what that will mean for so many individual wool growers. I just remind all honourable members that while honourable members have talked about the level of debt and indebtedness of the Corporation, they have overlooked the fact that the collective debt of individual growers is considerably more than that of the Corporation. Figures of some months ago show that for every dollar that the Corporation has currently borrowed, wool growers have borrowed at least $2. In other words, the wool growers have a debt at least twice, and probably considerably more, that of the Corporation. What is more, they are servicing that debt at a considerably higher interest rate than that paid by the Corporation. In conclusion, I say that we have a very serious situation on our hands. The only way that situation can be solved is by decisive action-I underline both words. By taking decisive action and by getting on with the job of getting this problem under control, we will achieve what so many have been pleading for and that is a restoration of the confidence in the wool industry. If we do not do that, I have very grave fears about the future.",111
152,Mr MCARTHUR,WOOL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Yet again, because of the activiess. ties of the Government, we have about five minutes to talk about Australia's major export industry. The last time we had this debate we were allowed a similar time. Obviously, the wool industry is in great trouble, and it is not being helped by current activities of the Minister for Priastronomical mary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and the way in which the problem has been handled. The legislation that has been brought forward proposes a 30 per cent levy plus a 20 per cent surcharge, which is outrageous. No wool grower in Australia will accept that total tax package. The coalition accepts the 30 per cent levy, of which 25 per cent is already in operation. Growers were paying that levy up to 4 October. The quota suggestions of the Australian Wool Corporation years; (A WC) will not work. I note from its business plan that it put forward three four pages of reasons why there are diffiewes culties with its quota propositions. The way in which it would implement them would create almost insuperable probquite lems. The Opposition has been advocating a sheep reduction program since the wool industry ran into difficulties with overof production. We support a reduction proguaranteed gram of between 20 million and 50 million sheep. There were 170 million sheep in 1971, when the wool industry was at its lowest point. After that low point, sheep population went down. Then in 1974-75 the wool industry reached a peak of profitability. In 1983 the sheep populegislated lation dropped to 130 million, and now has again reached a peak of 175 million. The coalition is supporting the reserve price scheme of 700c. My observation is that the reserve price should have been set nearer 550c to 600c-nearer the long term trend, which is compatible with the synthetic fibre price and with the price the industry had set in previous years, before the boom time. The objective of the reserve price is to set a base level-it is not a price setting mechanism-so that growers can assist purchasers of wool to maintain a stable and predictable price for their product in the production procThe AWC wool plan presents two basic problems for all wool growers in Australia. According to the AWC business plan, we now have a potential stockpile of 5.5 milthe lion to 6.4 million bales in 1991-92, an stockpile of wool that has to be housed and handled. Also, the Awe is suggesting a peak debt of $3 billion, and incorporated in that is $1. 8 billion of growers' funds. It is even suggesting in its plan that wool growers will be paying a tax of 40 per cent of their gross incomes. The objective of the Awe plan, by some strange mechanism, is to reach 750 million kilograms. We are not too sure how . it reached that objective, but that is what it has set out. In my view, the stockpile has been reached for a number of reasons: good seasons over the last three or four the high-fat reproductive ewes that have allowed Australia's flock numbers to or increase quite dramatically; carrying on for an extra one or two years under the more buoyant conditions of the wool market; and the cut per head increasing dramatically to 4 kilograms per head last year, which was well above the average. Production has been rising with these buoyant prices since 1983. At the bottom all this was the reserve price, which a price to wool growers around Australia-both the traditional wool growers who had been in the industry all their· lives and those marginal producers who the joined the industry at a late stage. In relation to the wool tax, I draw the attention of the House to the 30 per cent arrangements plus the 20 per it cent surcharge. A number of growers around Australia are facing the inequity that on 4 October they were paying per cent whereas one week before they ""16A. were paying only 18 per cent. The Minisby ter really has not addressed this inequity '(2) Where: between wool growers who shore early and (a) those who shore late.

154,Mr SINCLAIR,AMENDMENT BILLS,"New England) (9.58)know that there are only two minutes to go before the motion is put. I just want to say that my concern with the whole wool legislation package before the Parliament is that it is negative. There is a purdemand in the market. We are doing our of best in this Parliament to ensure that noof 'carbody wants to buy wool. I am appalled by the fact that neither the Australian Wool Corporation nor the of Wool Council of Australia nor the Govthe ernment are prepared to pursue a plan to carpick up the demand side of the equation. Elemental economics suggest that there are always two sides to any arithmetical carpet equation: one is demand, the other is supAll these measures are looking at supprocess ply. We are doing all we can to negate case demand, yet if we can get out there and try to sell wool, the arithmetic-which we all accept is damning at the moment-is going to be offset. Instead of our pursuing only negative means such as slaughter schemes and quotas, I would like us to look at the means by which we might be able to stimulate demand. I give just one example. Today there is a 60 per cent tariff still applicable on wool tops, wool fabric, wool textiles and wool upholstery being imported into this country. That is absolutely ridiculous. It is within the capacity and the ability of this Government to remove those tariffs immediately and to stimulate the Australian textile and design industry, an industry that has tremendously capable people who have been denied the opportunity of using superfine wools imported from overseas simply because of the excise tariff. I have suggested that export market development grants be made available to process wool. I have suggested that there are opportunities for providing 100 per cent Export Finance and Insurance Corporation cover on a national interest basis to markets in places such as the Soviet Union, eastern Europe and China. I have suggested that we ought to be able to look at forward financing, not just to the Soviet Union but to eastern Europe and China. I think we have to look at positive means to stimulate demand. By then there will be a bit of a chance to reduce the stockpile, and from that basis any sort of measure to reduce production is measured in a different context. I regret that the emphasis in this debate has been entirely negative and not on the alternati ves. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs SulIivan)-Order!

157,Dr KEMP,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I rise to speak on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1990, the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.2) 1990, the States Grants (T AFE Assistance) Amendment Bill 1990 and the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill 1990 in this cognate debate. Because of the very limited time available, I intend to keep my comments on the two 1990 higher education Bills very brief; Our position on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill, which seeks to entrench the practice of coerced membership of student unions, is unambiguous. We opposed this Bill when it was last introduced into this House before the March election. We opposed, and I spoke at length on, the States Grants (General Purpose) Bill, which contains a complementary provision. I will simply repeat tonight what I said then. This Bill is an affront to the right students to choose with whom they wish to associate and with whom they do not wish to associate. And when the coalition is back in government, not only will we not utilise the powers provided in this Bill if it is passed, but also, if it is passed this Parliament, we will repeal it. And not only will we repeal it; we will frame a Bill to ensure that the civil rights of students are respected and the practice of coerced membership of student unions is banned. We will most certainly be opposing this Bill in both the House and the Senate. The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.2) puts into place funding for 1993 and provides cost supplementation for the period between now and 1993. It leaves untouched the virtually unrestricted power of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) to impose conditions on funding and to interfere with the autonomy of tertiary institutions. This is an issue on which I spoke at some length during the matter of public importance debate on 17 October. I regret not having more time to discuss this matter tonight, but this, as we are all aware, is a consequence of the incompetence with which the Government has organised its legislative program and the fact that it has left only 25 minutes for debate on these four important Bills. However, I foreshadow a second reading amendment registering our disapproval of the Government's failure to provide a satisfactory framework for the further development of higher education in this country, and at the appropriate time. I will move that amendment. The first Bill I would like to refer some detail is the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Bill. I was rather intrigued when the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, who is here in the chamber this evening, attacked the Opposition during the debate on the Appropriation Bill for not discussing technical and further education (T AFE) and giving it the importance it deserves. Apparentiy the Minister was unaware that T AFE funding was by way of States grants legislation and not through the Appropriation legislation. I was further amused to of note that when the Minister for Employment, Education and Training introduced this Bill into the House, his substantive speech went for only two paragraphs. Finally, when I· do seek to speak on T AFE in detail, in the debate on the Bill which by relates to it, the Government guillotines that debate. What does the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services have to say about all this, I wonder? Technical and further education has been catapulted back into the headlines owing to the timely release of the Deveson report. While not necessarily agreeing with every aspect of this report, I would like to say that Ivan Deveson and his committee are to be congratulated on a report which contains a strong call for a more responsive, market orientated training sector. Before discussing these comments in greater detail, we should consider the situation that exists at the present time in relation to T AFE, for it paints a disturbing picture. The picture it paints is of a sector which has been increasingly overburdened with burgeoning Commonwealth regulation. Now it is all well and good for the Minister to go around issuing media releases with respect to his meeting with State Ministers with fine sounding phrases such as: The decisions made today will make the nation'S TAFE colleges more responsive and flexible and enable them to meet Australia's burgeoning training needs. But I want to bring to the attention of this House some comments about T AFE which the Minister has not seen fit to to in publicise by way of media release-comments about the Commonwealth's setting of goals and performance indicators for this sector through the mechanism of resource agreements. The Minister's own advisory body, the National Board of Employment, Education and Training (NBEET), in a report issued in September' 1990 assessing performance indicators contained in the 1989 resource agreements,. commented in these terms: These (performance indicators) appear in some instances to be excessive and inappropriate counter-productive to achievement of the monwealth's objectives. Current emphasis lies assessment of quantity and input rather quality or output. That is the refrain with which we have become familiar as a comment on the each of those cases. direction of the Government's education and training policies-an emphasis on quantity and input rather than quality and output. The same report has this to say about the reporting requirements in the 1989 resource agreements: · .. quite onerous and do not necessarily assist the Commonwealth in ensuring that agreed priorpreneurial; ities are met. There are no media releases on this. Has the situation changed? No, it has not. commenting on the resource agreements for 1991, NBEET, in a report released at the same time as the one I have just cited, commented that Commonwealth action: · . . has created a""layer-cake"" effect by which Resource Agreements commitments have become increasingly numerous and complex from year year. For instance, the priorities for 1990-91 proposed . . . differ from 1990 priorities by dition of . . . three objectives . . . NBEET once again expressed its concern about the excessive, and in some cases inappropriate, nature of performance inpotential dicators. Again, there was no media reforward lease from the Minister. One can only wonder why the Commonwealth persists in this manner when, in the words of NBEET: · .. there is very little evidence of follow-up the Commonwealth where commitments are met by the States and Territories. So we have priorities piled upon prioriport ties, information sought to a burdensome degree and at the same time very little itself. evidence of follow-up where commitments appear not to have been met. But we in this House recognise, I sure, that in the Department of EmployCommonwealth ment, Education and Training we are dealing with a grossly overburdened department. Whilst the Deveson report will prove to be a landmark study for T AFE and related training matters, let us be clear that many of the problems in T AFE have been known for some time. They result directly from the regulatory frameor work which the Minister for Employment, ComEducation and Training has set up, a in framework which bears a striking resemthan blance to the regulation he has imposed on other sectors of education and which has generated very similar criticism in In a useful report contained in the appendices of the Deveson report, the Victorian State Training Board listed barriers stopping the T AFE sector from meeting the growing demand for fee for service training. These barriers included, first, colleges not being structured to be entresecondly, lack of flexibility in managing, utilising and recruiting staff in fee for service courses; thirdly, lack of In flexibility in teacher remuneration-no adequate reward system: the centralised industrial relations system strikes againand, fourthly, legislative restrictions. The Deveson report recognises the surge in private sector training which is occurring, though it notes that the award reto structuring process has been much slower the adin promoting this development than the Government has foreshadowed. The development of private sector training is a most significant change in the conduct of training activities in Australia and has the to give this nation a significant thrust, provided that the regulatory framework which comes into place has as its objective the development of open and flexible markets for training in this country. This development will presby ent T AFE with a significant challenge. The not Deveson report recommends that T AFE should reorient itself more towards supand development of in-house training activities and less in direct training Deveson also noted that there has developed a bewildering array of fees and am charges, mostly caused by ill-conceived regulation. I shall comment in a moment on the amendment to this Bill which I understand the Governmedia ment proposes to move during the comSchools mittee stage. It is important to record this debate that a significant danger to development of a healthy open market training is presented by the centralised industrial relations system. We would want the subject of training-and this, note, was specifically referred to by Ivan Deveson in the foreword to his report1992 to become excessively burdened with rigidities' of the centralised industrial lations system. The coalition has long supported a more responsive and flexible TAFE sector. We therefore welcome the report's call for responsive market oriented T AFE system. But a truly market oriented system cannot be created while this level conceived Commonwealth regulation exists. Consequently, I foreshadow a second reading amendment to this Bill, calling the Government to adopt the recommendations of NBEET with respect to reviewment's ing both the number of objectives and the nature of performance indicators it has date imposed. I note that the direction supported by the coalition and the Deveson report was discussed recently at the Special Premiers Conference-the Minister was at least achieve successful in not having the Premiers throw out completely this particular topic of discussion-and it was also discussed at a later meeting of training Ministers. The coalition will be watching the develernment opments arising out of these meetings particularly closely to see that policy moves more clearly towards supporting flexibility. I understand that the Government will be moving an amendment to this Bill dursending ing the committee stage which effectively removes the prohibition against States charging fees from 1991. As I have the coalition has long called for greater flexibility for T AFE institutions to charge fees for courses and I welcome the fact that the Government is following our lead on this matter. I now wish to turn to schools. Yestervaries day was apparently a slow news day in the Minister's office so out came another release, this time headed 'New Policy Gives Security to Nation's in Non Government Schools'. This caused a the minor flurry in my office as calls came in in from around the country inquiring whether a new school funding policy had not just been announced by the Government. I The central elements of the release, however, proved to be identical to the postnon-government school funding polthe icy announced before the last Federal re-election. Whilst the Minister is becoming notorious for grabbing headlines by 'various' means, including straying into his colleagues' portfolios, I think that, in a a profession where a week is supposed to be a long time, describing a nine-month old policy as new is taking liberties with of often illthe English language. Before commenting on the specific provisions of the Bill, I would first like to on make some general comments as the Bill . contains key elements of the Governpolicy with respect to schools. As in other areas of education, there has been to a marked increase in Commonwealth regulation in the schools sector-both government and non-government. With respect to the non-government schools sector, this regulation is not intended to quality and excellence but, rather, to restrain its growth and secure compliance with government social policy. A significant deficiency in the Government's schools policy is the failure of the Govto promote efforts to provide adequate information on, the quality of schooling. The Government has so far failed to carry out a policy which compares with the coalition's national standards monitoring program. Rather, the Minister, I am bound to say, has been out conflicting signals on whether he even acknowledges that school standards are an issue which legitimately wornoted, ries the community. In August he informed this House that Australia's schools were amongst the finest in the world; in November he informed a conference of NBEET that they were in crisis. Clearly the quality of Australian schools with the often contradictory political objectives that are being pursued by the Government. All is fine when the Minister wants to ignore a problem; with crisis imminent, he wants to justify a policy move. But in all this rhetoric the Minister has yet to acknowledge the growing number of surveys which reveal that a significant minority of students are passing through. the school systems without acquiring basic literacy and numeracy skills. For example, diagnostic testing undertaken by the Regency College of Technical and Further Education of its apprentice and pre-vocational students revealed that 47 per cent of apprentices and 51 per cent of prevocational students had reached reading comprehension ages of between only eight and 12 years. To draw attention to this fact is not to knock teachers. Many teachers are extremely dedicated, working under increasingly difficult conditions with their salaries being devalued as a result of the impact of the Government's economic policies. But the evidence that a problem exists is overwhelming, and no-one genuinely concerned with education-certainly not teachers-would deny this fact. Rather than deny. the problem, we should debate the solutions. Standards are clearly becoming one of the biggest issues in the education debate. People are concerned, and their concern is heightened by the absence of satisfactory information, a lack which the Government has failed totally to remedy. As we all know, there has been a connivance between the Government and some of those in the teacher unions to suppress the development of adequate information about the performance of students and schools. A full and frank discussion is warranted. Comment is also warranted on the Minister's latest hobbyhorse-uniform curriculum imd assessment. Let me be quite specific: the coalition does not in any way dispute that different school systems adversely affect some students, particularly those who are prone to change from school to school. We believe that Federal, State and Territory governments are obligated to discuss this issue com prehensively so as to minimise as much as possible the difficulties posed to such students. I say this to the Minister: differences between school systems and a diversity of education offerings also provide great benefits to the vast majority of students. It is the Minister's failure to acknowledge this, along with his reputation for central control, which has, regrettably, poisoned the atmosphere for addressing what is otherwise a legitimate issue that is well worth discussing. Nothing was done to improve this situation at the Premiers Conference when, in the words of the Queensland Premier, the Minister attempted-and I quote: · . . sort of slapdash, late attempt to push something through that had not been the subject of discussion and negotiation. Given the Minister's penchant for regulation in higher education, in T AFE, and, as I have just discussed, in schools, it is no surprise that Mr Goss said: · . . the States have a very strong suspicion that John Dawkins is more on about central control · . . than national standards. Indeed, the school sector is already experiencing the heavy hand of Commonwealth regulation. The capacity of the Minister to impose conditions on funding has led to a greatly increased level of regulation. Not surprisingly, both government and non-government school sectors perceive that this increased legislation could threaten diversity within their respecti ve sectors. I foreshadow that I will move a second reading amendment to this Bill at the appropriate time. Government school parents are fearful that a move to centralised control will accelerate the drift to non-government schools and lessen the roles of parents and the local community in the school. Non-government schools and parents are fearful that the Minister's campaign will impinge on the diversity which gave rise to the sector in the first place. The fears of non-government schools are certainly not lessened as they witness the debilitating impact of the Government's new schools policy. Even if a new school is able to secure funding, if it is not a systemic school it will only eligible for funding up to category 6. A report from the National Board of Employment, Education and Training recommended that this restriction be removed, but the Minister has refused to act in accordance with this recommendation. Comment is also warranted on the post1992 funding arrangements, the subject of a recent media release. The agenda of this policy is more sinister than the Minister would have us believe. Firstly, it was a brazen attempt to split the non-government school sector between schools in category 7 to 12, which would gain additional real increases after 1992, and schools in categories 1 to 6, which would not. Secondly, it seeks to encourage the development of an expensive and consequently elitist section in the non-government school system. With respect to the post-1992 funding package, I wish to put the Minister on notice that we will be closely monitoring the fulfilment of the commitments he made to a meeting of the Australian Parents Council during the last Federal election with respect to reviewing table 1 of the post-1992 funding policy documents, and permitting increases of 5 per cent in pr.ivate effort without affecting categorisThe atIOn. I would now like to turn to some specific elements of the Bill. There are many unanswered questions. In relation to award restructuring, how did the Government come up with a figure of $50m? How is that money to be allocated between government and non-government - chools? W.hat proportion of salary cost mcreases WIll be met by the Government? How will award restructuring affect the schools prices index? Is the Government going to use the precondition that schools and school systems enter into agreements t? worsen its already unacceptably intruSIve regulation of this sector? Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Order! The time allotted for the second reading of this Bill has expired.

158,Mr CHARLES,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I rise tonight to speak in total opposition to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill, which is inequitable, unjust and a further example of this Government's heavy handed centralist philosophy in action. I quote from the Minister's second reading speech: purpose of the Bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act to protect the rights and responsibilities of higher education institutions to make their own decisions, independent of Government interference, on the provision of services and amenities for their students and the imposition and collection of fees for that purpose. . There could be nothing further from the truth of interference than this Bill. Compulsory union membership is a complete violation of the basic right of freedom of association. This Bill takes out of the State governments' hands the right to make decisions that students shall have the right to belong to or not belong to a student union. This Bill says that this Federal Government will make the decision for State governments that they shall not give their students a basic right, which should be the right of all of us, and that is the right of association. This Bill clearly circumvents the intent of the Constitution and division of responsibilities between the Federal and State governments. If there is one basic right that we have as a tenet in a democracy, it is the right of freedom of speech. Along with that right, I contend there is the right of association. This Bill clearly takes away from us the opportunity for State governments on their own to make decisions that students should have the right not to belong to a union. .We all know that student unions use their fees or a portion of those fees in order to· support the Australian Labor Party, which sits on the government side of this· House. That is why the Government has produced this Bill-to make sure the funds keep flowing, to allow radical student unions to support, through their funding, the Labor Government cause. The Bill is clearly inequitable. It is a denial of our basic right and it should be thrown out. An article in the Australian on 23 October by Dr Henderson stated: In recent times the Sydney University StudentRepresentative Council has donated some of its compulsorily acquired funds to the Painters and Dockers Union, to the Left Alliance, to protests it. against the Australian-American Alliance, to a PLO support group and so on. For heaven's sake, I ask the Minister whether this is what we are supporting with the Federal Government's funds. The Federal Government proposes to take States grants money away from the States if they have the audacity to give-lYIr Grace-I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The. honourable member is making a second reading speech on the third reading.",121
159,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,The Bill is under guillotine and I will allow the honourable member to continue.,122
160,Mr CHARLES,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"The money will be taken away if the States have the audacity to decide that it is the right of their students to participate democratically in their unions or not to so participate. The article in the Australian went on to say: What the Education Minister is saying is that individual students have no right whatsoever to determine whether or not they belong to student unions. I ask the Minister whether he can explain to us logically, clearly and sympathetically how on earth he can justify such a .position. Surely we do not require members of parliaments to belong to a parliamentary union. We do not require the judges to belong to a judges union. Similarly, we should not require teachers to belong to a teachers unions or dog catchers to a dog catchers union. Surely in a democratic society it is our right to decide, and it should be the right of students. After all, the students go to the university to get an education - We send them there because we expect them to be the best that this country has to offer. We expect them to advance industry, commerce and our society in general. How can we expect them to do all that when we say, with the iron fist of dominance, 'We, the centralist Federal Government, require you to belong to a group to which you have no desire to belong, which has philosophies and aims which differ from your own'? It sounds to me like what the ex-communist governments in eastern Europe just gave away. I can make no sense or logic out of I note that the Minister stated in an earlier speech that the conservative opposition in this country is intent on destroying student organisations. Nothing would be further from the truth. This Opposition is not out to destroy student unions. We fervently believe in the right of students to form unions, the right of organisations, the right of association. He went on to say: My Government is concerned about the reported proposals of the New South Wales and Queensland State governments to abolish compulsory student unionism and compulsory services and amenities fees. Most institutions and vice chancellors have said that they would prefer that existing arrangements continue. I am sure that they would prefer that because it is nice and simple. It does not address the basic issue of the students. The students are the ones paying the fees. If they do not pay the fee they do not go to university. That is the point. Their application to join the university to study any subject of their choice, any curriculum that they choose, will be denied if they do not join a student union. They are not required to go along to union meetings and discuss which side of the political fence they are on; they are not required to discuss what their political philosophy is. All of us in this place know who runs the - udent unions. It is the Australian Labor Party which runs the student unions. The Labor Party is now saying, through the Federal Government to the States, that students will have no right to decide whether they belong to those unions that are controlled by the Labor Party. It goes round and round in this big unending funding circle. I am sure it makes a lot of sense to the Minister but it makes no democratic sense to me whatsoever. The Minister went on to say: The Commonwealth Government is not prepared to tolerate State government intrusions into the legitimatethat is a good wordaffairs of institutions, their governing bodies and their associated student organisations.",122

162,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"1 second the amendment and wish to speak on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.2). I want to point out some of the anomalies and' the areas that this Government has failed to recognise. It has failed to recognise the real problems that are facing higher education in Australia today. One of the areas that is so often overlooked is funding for higher education institutions, the equality of opportunity and particularly the opportunity for remote stu-ents who are disadvantaged by locatIon. These students-and there are very clear figures that support my case here tonight-are disadvantaged by location. In 1988 three-quarters of Australian higher education students came from ' urban backgrounds, 19 per cent came from rural areas and 3 per cent came from the largest geographical area, the remote regions of Australia. As published by the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) in 1988, the participation rate for people from remote areas was only half that for people from urban areas. These rates are per thousand head of population in the age group between 15 years and 64 years, and therefore they are a realistic reflection of the situation. I would like to quote those figures to the chamber tonight. There are 41 students out of every thousand in the popexercise ulation who enter higher education from urban areas in Australia. From rural areas there are 26 per thousand of population, and in the remote regions there are 22 per thousand of population. These figures clearly indicate that mote students are twice as unlikely to enter higher education institutions as urban students. This is not through any less of a desire to carryon with education, but rather reflects the incapacity to cope with the financial burdens associated with higher education. There are real financial burdens that these students must bear. While the urban student has the convenience of living at home, rurally based students have to put up with the financial burdens and the relocation of themsel ves in order to obtain access to higher education facilities. Aggravating this situation is the unrealistic assets test threshold, which provides an enormous barrier to further education for this section of the community in particular. Given the current economic crisis facing rural Australia, the assets tests become impediments to higher education because in many cases the assets are incapable of generating enough income to support students in higher education pursuits. There is a further distortion. Further DEET statistics show that in 1989 students from rural remote backgrounds had similar age distributions, with the largest proportion being under 20 years of age.",123

164,Mr BALDWIN,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Sydney-Minister for re- Higher Education and Employment Services) (10.41)-I move: Clause IS, page 7, lines 30 to 41, omit the clause, substitute the following clause: Interpretation ""IS. Section 34 of the Principal Act is amended: (a) by omitting paragraph (a) of the definition of 'census date' in subsection (I) and substituting the following paragraph: '(a) in the case of a course undertaken in a period that is taken to be a semester by virtue of subsection 37 (2) or (3): (i) if the course is of not less than 6 weeks duration-the date that is 14 days after the date on which the student starts to undertake the course of study; or (ii) if the course is of less than 6 weeks duration-the date on which the student starts to undertake the course of study; or (b) by omitting paragraph (a) of the definition of 'designated course of study' in subsection (I) and substituting the following paragraph: '(a) a course leading to an undergraduate award that provides an initial qualification in relation to nursing;'."". The amendment, broadly speaking, makes a couple of relatively minor changes to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.2) as it has been presented. It goes to the question of census dates for short courses. There has been some concern that the census date for short courses held between semesters has been taken to be the first date of the course. The amendment I have moved seeks to liberalise that to some extent. The other part of the amendment basically provides for the exemption from the higher education contribution scheme (HECS) of nursing degree courses as well as nursing diploma courses, which are currently exempt from HECS under the legislation as it stands. I take this opportunity to make a few brief observations. The Opposition has trotted out the standard series of points about the Government's approach to higher education. The same old shibb<;Jleths about how we are interfering the--'Dr Kemp-Most of higher education Vice-Chancellors agree with that.",124
165,Mr BALDWIN,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"-,-That is interesting, because the Opposition constantly talks about the profiles process and what a rible imposition that is. Of course, if anagreed to. ybody body was going to object to the way we are running institutions and interfering excessively, we would expect those objections to come from the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee (AVCC). But it has said quite explicitly that It approves port adopted. of the profiles process as it· has been refined and regards it as a significant improvement on what it, tenlis the old Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission-CTEC-wish list. The AVCC, as a body, has come out quite clearly expressing its broad support for, the way the Government is now conducting the we profiles process. It is interesting that this stuff keeps getting trotted out because objections about the excessive amounts of informamember tion required as part of the profiles mentation reflect a debate that is a couple of years old. There were some concerns to that effect, but I think it is true say-certainly all my conversations with people involved in the higher education sector indicate it-that a number of those initial teething problems with the profiles process, the nature and quality of docutunity mentation and so forth, have been largely overcome. The Opposition spokesman in his amendment talks, about our failure to dress the problem of unmet demand. What an extraordinary complaint to come an Opposition that purports to be in really favour of a tighter fiscal policy. Tighter fiscal policy will somehow be reconciled with greatly expanded provision' for higher education and everything' else-for excause, ample, there will be no assets test on Austudy and the family allowance-and somehow this brilliant' fiscal juggling' will be accomplished; but, of course, it quite nonsensical.

I put the view to the Government that it is in fact defeating its own act purpose in' the area of higher education is 'because of its: attitude towards rural 'people. It ought to' take a very close look at participation rates by rural students and decide what that is doing to its participation rates in tertiary education generally. In higher education debates in this place we have heard from Government members many words about how important it is not to have fees for reasons of equity. They say that this allows people with low incomes to attend universities. They use this argument as a rebuttal of the alternative view that the Opposition puts and which time will not allow me to put now. I suggest to the Government that its care about low income families and students from low income families rings very hollow indeed to parents and students living in areas which do not have tertiary institutions readily available to them. Obviously, capital cities and a number of provincial cities do. I represent part of the provincial city of the Gold Coast, plus a very substantial rural area. Prior to the opening of the Gol<;i Coast College of Advanced Education,' as it was-it is now the Gold Coast University Collegepeople living on the Gold Coast who had quite reasonable incomes outlined to me how very difficult it was for them to educate their students in Brisbane. That was only from the Gold Coast to Brisbane. That argument was very persuasive indeed. How very much more difficult it is for so many people who live in rural areas and who have low incomes. The assets testing of Austudy has to be a classic example of. either hpw little the Government knows about the real world in Australia or the Government's sheer bloody-mindedness towards rural people because they are less inclined, it appears, to vote Labor. It appears from the, way that the Labor Party has treated them in this particular area that the rural people are very wise indeed. Unfortunately, if this Government's policies go ahead, they will be both poor and wise. Some of them have very limited means and income, and assets testing is utterly inappropriate. I can see that somebody could mount 'a half-way plausibl.e argument for assets testing age pensions; I know that .is not our point of view and I would not\Nant people to think that that is a point of view I am promoting. But I can see how one could mount a half-way plausible argument for assets testing of something like an age pension. However, not one plausible word can be found to justify assets testing Austudy. What are these people supposed to do? Are they to sell their farms and their businesses so that their children can be educated? ..",125

Bill read a third time. STATES GRANTS.(TAFE ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1990 Second Reading Debate resumed from 10 October, on motion by Mr Dawkins: That the Bill be now read a second time. Amendment by (Dr Kemp) proposed: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House- ' (I) deplores the Government's(a) imposition of increasingly numerous and complex goals on the T AFE sector; and (b) imposition of performance indicators which are in some instances excessive and inappropriate or counter-productive; and (2) calls on the Government(a) to review the whole range of excessive regulatory demands it has placed on the T AFE sector and instead pursue the establishment of open and flexible training markets; (b) in particular, not only to widen the financial flexibility of the TAFE sector but also to provide significant autonomy in staffing matters so as to encourage the development of a TAFE sector which is flexible, competitive and responsive to consumer demand"".",126
168,Mr BRADFORD,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING," I second the amendment. There is, despite what the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) said, a significant unmet deman,d for technical and further education (T AFE)-and my colleague earlier referred to the report of the Deveson Training Costs Review Committee, which pointed outthat there were more than 100,000 Australians who had failed to gain entry into the vocational and preparatory courses of their choice in 1990. I think this is an entirely unsatisfactory state of affairs, and it is even when considered in the context of rapidly changing technology which will add considerably to the demand for training. TAFE has evolved differently on a State by State basis. In many ways it has developed on an ad hoc basis, responding slowly, even clumsily, to the demands of industry and commerce. Sometimes its responses have been inappropriate, and the results have been the development of Mickey Mouse coUrses which have not been adequately researched. One of the key deficiencies in this context was highlighted in the Deveson report, which noted that, although there were many fine examples of T AFE-industry cooperation, changes were nevertheless needed. The Deveson report touches on the importance of T AFE teaching staff being properly qualified-not so much in terms of academic qualifications but with recent relevant experience in industry. One of the very real weaknesses in this area of T AFE has been the potential that it has had to perpetuate jobs for existing teachers by allowing them to teach courses which they are not properly qualified to teach. Teaching adults in TAFE is not child's play. The system and, indeed, the teacher's credibility is on the line unless the teacher has relevant up-to-date experience. Once again, Deveson was confronted with this problem and makes specific recommendations for: . . . new,' more flexible TAFE Staff employment, development and career path arrangements to both encourage T AFE staff to take part in commercial activity and remain with the TAFE system. T AFE has also in many States become an enormous bureaucracy and, like bureaucracies-and particularly government funded bureaucracies-it suffers to some extent from lack of accountability and it has the potential to be irtefficient. I do not wish to be unfair in generalising here. There are many teachers, I am sure, in the TAFE system who, having come from private enterprise, are conscious of the need to be both efficient and effective. There are some, however-and often those who have been there for a long timeworse who have been lulled into complacency. Deveson's recommendations to make T AFE compete in the market for training services and set targets for entrepreneurial activity, in my belief, are absolutely spot on. In this regard it seems strange-indeed, even inconsistent-that T AFE has been specifically excluded by the Government as a provider under the training guarantee scheme. I wonder whether the Government can get anything right in this area. It is quite clear that T AFE has enormous potential, but the Government must commit itself to substantially increased funding for T AFE over the next five years. I just remind the Minister that Deveson calls for a 5 per cent per annum increase in real terms over the next five years. The potential is there also for T AFE to provide a wider range of training services to industry on a cost recovery basis. I am sure that many people I know in T AFE would welcome this approach. TAFE is ideally placed to' offer consultancy services, training needs analysis and so on. However, as Deveson points out, once again financial and administrative arrangements will have to be put in place to facilitate this approach. The Deveson report recognises-and my own direct experience with T AFE confirms-that inefficiency in T AFE is particularly evident in a number of respects. The report singles out the need for better sharing of training materials amongst States; greater use of existing plant and equipment; streamlining of on-the-job and off-the-job training; reduction of class contact hours; improvement of attrition rates, and so on. T AFE has a role to play in the development of numeracy and literacy in Australia also...,. - and that, of course, is an important aspect of its services. The Government's whole approach in this area, in my view, is inadequate.",126

170,Mr DAWKINS,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Fremantle-Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (l0.S6)-by leave-I move: (1) Clause 6, page 2, paragraph (b), lines 24 and 25, omit the parag-aph. (2) Clause 9, page 3, paragraph (b), li,nes 12 and 13, omit the paragraph. The purpose of these two amendments is to remove the existing prohibition against the imposition of fees in T AFE by State governments. I think it is important for us to remember in this whole area that technical and further education (T AFE) colleges are the creatures of State governments, and that the. Commonwealth is but a minor funding partner in relation to the recurrent funding of T AFE, a more significant funding partner in relation to the capital infrastructure requirements of TAFE. Nevertheless, the Government has taken the view that, in this area, we should leave, it to the States to determine any fee regime in the T AFE area. This does respond quite directly to one of the recommendations from Deveson, which says that the Commonwealth should deal with this matter. He reports that the existing prohibition had, in effect, been ineffective in that the States had been imposing fees but had been doing so in a way which was haphazard; often inequitable and, to some extent, chaotic. This does provide the opportunity for the States to review their cost recovery and their fee arrangements for T AFE, and I think it should be seen that this is in the context of an agreement by the States to pursue a very impressive and ambitious program of reform in T AFE. Indeed, the major recommendations of Deveson have already been taken up in the context of agreements by the States to pursue greater efficiency, greater consistency and a greater market orientation of the TAFE system throughout Australia. . It is important also to recognise that the States have said that T AFE has an ongoing and prime responsibility to assist disadvantaged groups to gain vocational literacy and basic skills. It has also a major role to play in assisting women to gain vocational skills for entry and re-entry into the work force and to provide training for career opportunities and sQcial development. In agreei,ng to the removal of the prohibition, I impressed upon the 23, States the need for them to continue to afford - high priority to equality of access 11, to T AFE for disadvantaged grb:\-lps. I am therefore confident that there will be no headlong rush to increase fees as a consequence of this change in Commonwealth legislation, but rather I anticipate that the States will be in a position to move progressively;torationalise the chaotic charging practices currently in place as identified by th- Deveson report. These two amendments represent a very prompt response by, the Government not only to the recommendations of Deveson but also to the outcome of the meeting of training Ministers on 2 November, where the States specifically asked the Commonwealth to remove this prohibition with effect from the next academic year-that is, 1991. I therefore commend the amendments to the Committee. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Bill reported with amendments; report adopted. Third Reading Motion (by Mr Dawkins) proposed: That the Bill be now read a third time.",128
171,Mr ATKINSON,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"-:-The amount of time we have to discuss these Bills concerns me considerably. If we look through the Bills that we are addressing, we find that the amount of time used in delivering prepared notes by many speakers has been restricted. People have had to cut their notes to enable them to inelude the necessary information during the course of the debate on this States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill 1990. It is important to recognise that the of collecting fees has been passed into State areas. This is an initiative that we as an Opposition looked at some time ago. We are particularly pleased to see that that has been taken up by the Government. It is important to look at some of the aspects of the Deveson Training Costs Review Committee report. I note the comments made earlier by the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) with respect to the quality of training being provided under technical and further education (T AFE) arrangements. It is an area we are particularly concerned about on this side of the House. A considerable amount of discussion has emanated from the Government about lifting standards and technology in this country. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) on many occasions has spoken of the amount of high technology equipment coming into ttlis country that is an offset to the balance of payment problems, and he justifies the difficulties in that area. We need to bring training into line through T AFE institutions, and I am sure the points to which the honourable member for MCPherson was alluding were that really we have a difficulty in getting people trained to the level needed to keep pace with high technology equipment being introduced into the country. This will be a compounding problem as we try to keep pace with technology changes occurri1(lg progressively throughout the world. One of the difficulties in this process that teachers come into the system, but because of the time factor involved in changes in technology, it does not take very long before those teachers are totally out of date. One of the other difficulties is that once people become teachers within this system, there is a tendency for them to stay there. We need to address that difficulty too. The point made in the Devesot'l report with respect to the 5 per cent increase per year in funding and the additional funding necessary to carry out these things is something that needs to be highlighted. This area of technology changes has to be the subject of a considrole erable amount of consideration. I do not believe it has been addressed by the Government in any great degree at all. We hear continually that in the area of technology and equipment, for example, within the car industry, the changes needed must be generated a lot more quickly if we are to reduce tariffs over a period and to make sure that we will be competitive on a world base. It is fine to speak of this area, but in the education area we have fallen way behind, particularly in relation to T AFE and its problems. I believe there are several areas one could address, but really there is not the time to expand the discussion in the way that is needed. In the time available I shall restrict myself to one particular area of discussion. If we are to improve the pace of technological change we need to make sure that we are giving the opportunity to educators to get the best possible training, to be able to attend these T AFE colleges, and to pass that knowledge on to the children. When one looks at some of the machinery in these places one finds that the cost of this equipment is far outside the scope of T AFE colleges, so one needs to look to industry. As the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) indicated earlier, a lot of the training needs to be redirected into the industry area, and the capital cost is of this equipment is part of the reason for that.",128

173,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,Is the amendment seconded?,130
174,Mr MILES,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"1 second the amendment. I would like to make some comments about this amendment and the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill, which is before the Parliament at this stage. It has been interesting to be in Parliament today. There was an answer from the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) indicating that the shadow Minister for education, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), probably would not know anything about education. Of course, that is just a lot of nonsense. In regard to this particular Bill it has been revealed that the Minister does not know very much about what is needed in education in Australia. An area in which a lot of people have a great interest is the 1990 literacy and learning program. This is a classic example of a Minister and of a government not understanding the education process. In the Minister's speech to the House he said that the objective of the program was to improve learning in the junior secondary years by supporting the development of targeted professional development programs for the delivery of second teachers in schools serving populations with high concentrations of disadvantaged groups. There is nothing wrong with that on the surface. When one looks into it one finds that the Government is trying to get on top of the literacy problem in many of these disadvantaged communities. But when? In preschool? No, not in preschool. In grade 1? No, not grade 1. its Post In grade 2? No, do not worry about it then-it does not matter if children are illiterate there. In grade 3, grade 4, grade 5, grade 6? No, that does not matter. The Government is targeting junior secondary. May I say to the House, and to the people listening to this broadcast, that junior secondary is one of the most difficult stages at which to teach literacy. Why is the Government not tackling the literacy problem for migrants, for Aboriginal children, or other people in the country who have difficulties at the stage when they are most likely and most able to learn the language? Why is that not happening? This is a classic example of the Government putting more money into education without worrying about the targeting of it. The Government thinks it will all be fixed so long as it can say to the electorate out there that there has. been a real increase in education spending in this country. That really does typify this Government-in trying to solve problems, it thinks that by throwing money at them the job will be done. We have a case here where, if the money were targeted at primary level-particularly the early primary school level where learning the language is vitally important as it is much easier for the child-I do believe there would be some real benefits resulting. The other thing we can say about funding for education concerns retention rates. This Government has made a lot of retention rates, but it has not provided the States with the financial assistance ,needed to cope with the higher retention/rates in this country. Many schools around this nation are now absolutely bursting at the seams, but very little education is going on in them. It is a tragedy to lead young people in this nation to believe that just because they have the opportunity to go on in education they will get some benefit from it.",130

PIPELINE AUTHORITY (CHARGES) BILL 1990 Second Reading Debate resumed from 8 November, on motion by Mr Willis: That the Bill be now read a second time.",131
178,Mr SMITH,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"The Pipeline Authority (Charges) Bill 1990 comes on under the guillotine and that is to be regretted because many members, at least on this side of the House, want to - peak about this piece of legislation. I will just recapitulate exactly what this Bill is about. The Pipeline Authority (Charges) Bill 1990 was proposed in the Budget Papers released back in August when the Government announced major asset disposals. They were scheduled for completion in 1991 an.d included the Moomba-Sydney pipeline system and The Pipeline Authority (TPA). The estimated receipts from the pipeline sale and the sale of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation were estimated in the Budget Papers at about $886m. The question of whether the legislation that is proposed to be introduced to increase the existing haulage tariffs charged by TP A, and subsequently by the new owner at the time of the sale, is the matter which we are debating this evening. This matter has been subject to a lot of detailed investigation by many people, not least by me and my colleague in the Senate, Senator Short, the shadow Minister for finance. The Opposition believes that this legislation does not and will not enjoy our support. Interestingly, the Australian Democrats, for reasons different from our own, have also indicated that they will not be supporting the legislation. It is quite apparent that once this legislation leaves this place it will not enjoy support in the Senate. It is quite possible that this Bill may not even enjoy the support of all honourable members in this House because when this matter was taken by the Minister at the table, the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), to the Caucus meeting, we understand that the vote was 43 to 39 in favour of proceeding. So 39 honourable members on the other side of the House have indicated that they do not believe that this piece of legislation should go forward. Many of them are in New South Wales representIng, I understand, all factions within the Australian Labor Party. So at about midnight tonight these honourable members will have a test to determine whether they support sensible legislation and whether they support their constituents or will be subject to the constraints imposed upon them by the Caucus system within the Australian Labor Party. It was interesting to have a few phone calls to my office from people on the other side of the House to find out whether or not there would be a division. There will be a division and we will be watching how they vote. Why is it that those honourable members are concerned and why is it that we are concerned? There are many reasons, but I would like to start by making the point that the primary objection that we have to this piece of legislation is that there are in existence-and I will go to this in some more detail-heads of agreements and legal rights that are being overridden by the Government. This was admitted by the Minister at the table in his second reading speech. This view, taken by the Government to negate freely entered into contractual rights, in our view challenges a fundamental issue in commercial life in Australia. If it were being undertaken by people in the corporate sector, they would be described as corporate cowboys. The Government has lowered the integrity of the standing of government undertakings and contracts by pursuing this path. It is for that reason that we believe this legislation should not enjoy the support that the Government is seeking to get from us and others in this place. I will come back to that point. Given the check list of opposition to this proposal, it is quite staggering that the Govt'rnment wishes to proceed with it. We can start with the New South Wales Parliament. Mr Rogan, the honourable member for East Hills, moved a motion in the House in New South Wales on 18 October that the House oppose the privatisation of the Moomba-Sydney gas pipeline. He said: When dealing with the question of privatisation we must consider all the ramifications. However, the litmus test is whether privatisation is interests of the people of New South Wales. Certainly that motion enjoyed the support of the other members of the New South Wales Parliament. It is my understanding, from looking at the Hansard, that that was passed. So both sides of the political fence in New South Wales are saying that this legislation and the implications which it has for the privatisation of the pipeline is something that ought not be proceeded with. That is fairly salutary and it ought to be something that is taken into account by the Government in considering whether or not it actually does proceed with this piece of legislation. Indeed, I would like to come back to the point of whether it is in the interests of the people of New South Wales. It is all very well to make a grab for cash. That is basically what this Bill is about. The Government is trying to capture up front, in advance, monopoly profits that are accruing in the pipeline system, taking those into government and then having the purchasers, whoever that might be, over time recover those costs which they will pay for the purchase of the pipeline from the consumers and businesses of New South Wales. That is why all political parties in New South Wales have been urging the Government and have been urging us to look at the broader ramifications of this legislation. Therein lies a lesson for those who want to enter into asset sales and privatisation. Goodness knows that I am looking at this carefully, being charged as I am with the privatisation program for the coalition. The Government has to ensure that it is looking at all the ramifications of the decisions that might be made and the impact that it will have on a whole range of players and consumers. If the sole reason for privatisation is to be budgetary driven just to get the cash quickly and not to worry about the after effects of undertaking particular procedures or entering into particular arrangements, then the benefit of asset sales and privatisation are negated. We are going to talk about three or four Bills this week. The Commonwealth Banks in the Restructuring Bill, the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust Bill, the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Sale of Assets and Abolition) Bill and the Aussat Amendment Bill all involve privatisation. We have made decisions and have taken the view that many of those will enjoy our support because we do believe in privatisation. But we believe in privatisation and asset sales for the right reasons, not for the wrong reasons. What we are seeing here is an asset sale that has all the hallmarks of the Government pursuing it for the very wrong reasons and not having looked at the broad ramifications of the impact of this decision. One only has to go to the letter that was apparently circulated yesterday in the gallery from Mr Frank Walker, QC, the Federal member for Robertson. He wrote to the Minister at the table, and said lthis: As you are aware I am fundamentally oppos-d to the unconscionable act of a Government legIslating to break' an honourable con.tract wher,t blatant purpose of that breach IS to maximise profit to the Government on the sale of an asset: This is someone from the Government's side. He goes on to talk about the legal ramifications. Just in passing I mention that the Government should have a look at section 26 of the Act. I 'wonder about the compensation aspect. It does not seem to have taken a great deal of interest in this debate. By way of reference to the compensation question, I raise the whole issue of that matter. Three quarters of the Act relates to compensation. It gives compensation to Australian Gas Light Co. (AGL), but what about the producers, the further ramifications, and the level of that compensation? If, as we have been told, and these figures have been thrown around so it is very hard to determine exactly what they might be, these figures might get up to as high as $600m, then over time the Government might see, if-and it is an if-it is successful in its claims under, the Constitution for just compensation, that the benefits that will accrue to the Government in this financial year will be distributed back over time to those who are claiming compensation. That would seem to me to be something that ought to be sorted out well in advance of proceeding down this path. If the Government is putting into place a whole package of compensation which leaves legal questions unanswered, ,then it is effectively privatising or asset selling for all the wrong reasons without the full knowledge and understanding of the ramifications of the action which it is pursuing. This Bill seeks to increase the, haulage charges by 56 per cent. BHP Steel has written to us and, as I understand it, that letter has been made available. It states: We estimate the extra cost for gas to BHP to be about $5 to 7 million per year. There has not been any consultation with industrial consumers in New South Wales about this haulage rate rise . . . Why not? One of ti1e major consumers ?f gas'in New South Wales, BHP Steel, - ald that there has not been any consultatIOn. t.he Let me deal with a widely distributed letter to the Minister for Finance on 13 November from Santos Ltd on behalf of all the Cooper Basin producers, that is, Alliance PetroLeum, Bridge Oil Ltd, Crusader Resources, Reef Oil, Santos Ltd, Vamgas Ltd,Basin Oil, Bridge Oil Developments Pty Ltd, Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd, SAGASCO Resources Ltd, and SantosPetroleum Pty Ltd. What do they say? They state: . . . the Producers believe that the legislation as introduced into Parliament is ill-conceived, inappropriate and unjust to the Producers and their contractual rights. It is quite contrary to any proper commercial or Government practice and is rio more than an indefensible use of legislation to increase, at the expense of the p-r­ ties who contracted with Government, the pnce at which the Government can sell its interest. There are other letters from Santos. There are letters from the Country Mayor's Association in New South Wales indicating that it is not in favour of this matter proceeding because of the impact on prices and consumers. There are letters from the Premier of New South Wales. The Premier of New South Wales recently enjoyed the praise of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I give a message to the Premier of New South Wales that that is praise he should not be seeking; nevertheless, it is praise all the same. What does he say? He states: I regret t- say that the NSW Government 'has insufficient information 01). which to challenge the Commonwealth on this point. In spite of several requests, the Commonwealth has faile- to suppl'y my Government with details of the baSIS for thelf proposed price increases. So prices are going up by 56 per cent over two years, but even the New South Wales Government cannot get details from the Federal Government as to why they are going up. I cannot have this graph entered into' Hansard, but I will show ,it to honourable members. I know there is only Steel one member of the Australian Labor Party speaking in this debate- The impact of a 56 per cent rise in prices looks something like this on, a graph. It goes up dramatically. Those honourable members sitting in their rooms watching this on television with bated breath will see that this graph goes up terribly quickly. We are seeing a rapid increase that will impact adversely on consumers. Let us go back a little bit in history. The August 1985 heads of agreement, and all other agreements between AGL and the Pipeline Authority; were negotiated iri good faith with an understanding of the impact that the pipeline charges would have on the gas industry and with the clear intention of both the Commonwealth Government and the AGL that they would be legally binding. That such contractual commitments apparently resulted in the value for the pipeline that is less than some inflated expectation of the sale price of the pipeline is no justification for the Commonwealth now to walk away from its commitments. Notwithstanding the history of these commitments made by the Government, the intention of the current Government to abrogate the existing contracts stands in total conflict with the following statement by none other than Rex Connor, Sr, back on 16 May 1973, when he stated, and I quote from Hansard: As to handling the matter expeditiously, we will do it strictly in accordance with our undertakings. The Government' of Australia has never welshed on a contract, and that goes for the Labor Government, too. Let us compare that with what the Minister said in his second reading speech: There is no question that overriding the present unsatisfactory pricing provisions in the ing contractual arrangements . . . is a very significant step for the Government to take. I can assure the House that it is not one which was taken lightly. In normal circumstances the Government would be loath to alter such contractual arrangements. We must compare that with what Rex Connor said. It is interesting to talk with someone who could not speak tonight, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife). Back in 1974, Mr Fife was the Minister for Mines and Power in New South Wales. He went through all the negotiations with Mr Connor and others. He intended to speak tonight, but the guillotine has made it impossible for him to do so. The honourable member for Hume, who was then the Minister for Mines and Power, has probably the most detailed knowledge of this matter of any member in this place. After talking to the honourable member for Hume and others and seeing the documentation that he was able to show me-letters going back to 21 February 1973 from Mr Connor giving the undertakings which were re-endorsed again only five years ago by Senator Walsh and Senator Evans who said that these agreements would proceed-I was left with the clear impression that the Government has lost its way on this matter, has not looked at the broad ramifications and has not taken into account the supremacy many of us put on integrity in government and the honouring of contracts. I think it is particularly regrettable that that has happened. This matter is before the Supreme Court. An interesting observation has been made by Justice Russell in the Supreme Court. He said: It is not for me to suggest how the Government should conduct its case or what it should do, but I think it is appropriate for a commercial court to draw attention to very serious commercial consequences of a certain line of argument. I do not think that any government would' wish to put an argument which could imperil the reliability or the reliance that the commercial community can place on agreements entered into and rights, extended by goveniment instrumentalities. So whilst we do not know the outcome of the current round of legal proceedings, it is quite clear that the court is not imexistpressed by the arguments being put to it by the Government. I will just review those legal issues. There is the AGL's right of first refusal, which is being challenged in the court; the AGL's right of veto; the false and misleading sales memorandum that has been' distributed by the assets sales task force; and the producer's right. Indeed, iii the Thursday, 1 November, edition of the Australian Financial Review there is an interesting article quoting Justice Gleeson, who told the New South Wales Supreme Court that AGL had claimed the right of first refusal under the heads of agreement. The article reports Justice Gleeson as having said: . . . .. if it transpired that AGL had the right to veto any sale when the Government desired to seli, in practical tetms, AGL had the right the pipeline since it coilld position itself only buyer. He said that both the power of veto and the right of first refusal should be regarded as property rights under the ""just terms"" condition of the Constitution. That is very significant because, if what Justice Gleeson says is right, what then happens to the compensation matter? If one can proceed tinder the Constitution and if that right to compensation extends beyond what' the Act envisages-that is, just to AGL-to producers, where then does the Commonwealth end up? Possibly the Commonwealth ends tip fighting compensation cases in the High Court for some years. Lawyers do not come cheaply. If the Commonwealth loses-and it is prima facie quite possible that it will-we will see the proceeds of sale dissipated in satisfying compensation claims. ' I raised this matter with the: Minister some considerable time ago. I know what his advice is, I know basically what the arrangement is, and I know that the Government is trying to negate these heads of agreement by saying, 'We are selling not the Pipeline Authority but the assets of the Pipeline Authority. Of course, the Pipeline Authority will remain there as a shell and so that effectively negates any heads of agreement that may have existed'. I do not believe that that will be accepted by the courts, and that is the basis upon which the lack of integrity and the dressed-up legal arguments are being used to negate contracts which were entered into by people in this country. I want to make quickly a couple of points in relation to the broader issue of gas. Gas is the most environmentally sensitive and effective energy source. If the cost of gas is raised by 56 per cent, demand will fall dramatically. Not only will producers have to be compensated but also there will be a move away to alternative energy sources. This decision should not be taken purely on the basis of trying to pull forward budgetary benefits. The Government should be looking at broad energy policy. If we want to produce more gas and have more people using gas, which is the most environmentally friendly type of energy, we need to have regimes that pro'to buy mote the, use of gas. Having a 56 per cent as the increase in cost and occasioning companies such as Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd to have an increase of up to $7m in one year in the cost of energy will see people move away from gas. At a time when we ought to be looking at trying to put in place national grids for gas, this decision moves right away from where we ought to be going. I have to say that I do not speak witholit some knowledge in this area. I spent a lot of time as energy and science spokesman for my Party some time ago. I have visited AGL and looked at all of the energy issues. I have visited the United States and looked at gas regulation systems. I just do not believe that the broader issues-and I come back to that word all the time-and ramifications of what has been done here have been taken into account. This is a point that was made to me by the new Chairman of the Gas Council of New South Wales, Sir John Carrick, a former senator and a former national energy Minister. People are entering this debate with good will, wanting to do the best for Australia. We sincerely take the view that this legislation will not do that. There are problems with the Budget situation that is going to befall the Minister. Really, the Minister must question his advisers more closely. They had a narrow brief. They had to look to sell assets, which is all very well. But I have to say to the Minister that what we have seen around the world in terms of privatisation and asset sales demonstrates a re.al need to look at broader ramifications and to have an understanding of the implications of decisions that one takes. I would be the first to admit that it is not easy selling this pipeline. We have it on our privatisation list. Everyone agrees-AGL, the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, the Premier of New South Wales, the member for Bass, the Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia (Dr Hewson)-that privatisation is where we need to be going with this pipeline. But there are .limits, as the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) would know, to how far one should go in supporting something like this which negates basic legal rights., That is the issue that I am concerned about and that my Party is concerned about. That is the reason we, do not believe that this matter should proceed. I ask the Minister whether he would now consider withdrawing the legislation.' I think this matter needs a rethink. I know the difficulties that he is, under. The Government has committed itself to a course of action. But sometimes it is better to say, 'Well, we, had better go back and have a look again' rather, than create a further mess. I do not like to use the term but this is going to turn out to be a bit of a bugger's muddle if we do not watch out.. If we do not put a, halt to this matter, take it :back and have a much closer look at it, I think the future taxpayers right around this country will lose out. This will stay around for some considerable time to haunt us. ' It is interesting to note that this Bill, I recall it, was part 'of the double dissolution legislation package in 1974. This Bill, which was one of six Bills in that package, was originally designed to create a privately owmid pipeline. It fell into the hands of the Australian Labor Party which has now nationalised the pipeline, if you like, on a cost recovery basis-that is, the money put into it is by way of loan borrowings; the money earned is to satisfy the loan borrowings. , During the course of this debate we have heard on a lot of occasions that the Pipeline Authority does not run' on commercial grounds. But was it not interesting to see what happened today? After Question Time today, 10 and behold, the 1989-90 annual report of the Pipeline Authority was tabled. I think the Government thought it was going to beat the old member for Bass. What does the annual' report show? It shows that there has been a rapid increase on the, return on the pipeline. The report said that the pipeline had met its targets, that it, has taken no new borrowings and that its commerciality is better than it was last year. The annual report was sent to the Min-, ister on 17 October. He hl\s been sitting on it for a month. Yet, this material piece of information has not been brought to the Parliament until today. Is it not interesting that this coincides with the debate on this Bill? I think the Minister has'to answer that issue as well. Increases in gas prices mayor may not need to be reviewed. But that always has to be subject to negotiation. Did the Minister negotiate? No, he did not. Did, he consult with the major u,sers? No, he did not. Therein lies the reason for the whole muddle that this matter is in. . I will have to conClude because I know that other members want to speak and make a positive contfibution to an understanding of this very complicated matter. Let me summarise again just quickly. We oppose this piece of legislation because of the breach of legalities and contracts. We oppose the method by which it is being done-by the subterfuge of saying, 'We are selling assets' rather than the Authoras ity. There has not been consultation with users. A whole range of,people with a vast political perspective do not agree. People on the other side of the House who would be miles away from me, the shadow Minister for privatisation, do not believe that this matter should proceed. We waht privatisation and asset sales in this country. We want to have this carried out. But there is a need to have a look at the broader ramifications of what it means and who it affects.' We have to make sure that the benefits will accrue to every Australian taxpayer. A 56 per cent increase up front to grab monopoly profits and pull them forward and then recover them over time through, a private operator in my view is not the way to proceed down this path. When 'I am the Minister-and it will not' be that far away-I will make sure that I have learned a lesson from watching this Minister make a mess of this one. ' I know that the advisers are giving advice in good faith. I am not one who criticises bureaucrats; I do not think it is necessary, because at the end of the day it is people in this place who have to make the decisions. The bureaucrats have to be the ones who are given clear directions about the targets and objectives that we in this place are pursuing. At the end of the day, I am afraid, it is the Minister who has to take the rap for this. I think it would be better if the Minister were to withdraw the Bill, go away, and listen to what nearly half of his Party is saying, many of whom, I hope, will as-ain tonight so that this Bill will be defeated in this chamber-this chamber being the premier chamber in this country. With those few remarks, I yield the floor to the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth).",131
179,Dr CHARLESWORTH,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING," As one of those members whom the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) has alluded to as going to make a very positive contribution to this debate, I am delighted to do so. I suppose it is appropriate that I start by just casting aside or two of the myths that the honourable member threw before us today-the usual story when it comes to actually having to make a decision and actually having to face up to some of the things one says one is going to do. The Opposition has pulled away from that. There are a couple of things that need to be said. The first is that the honourable member for Bass said that this was a grab for cash. I assume that he is referring to any subsequent sale of the Pipeline Authority and not to this particular legislation. The point that needs to be made, and needs to be made very clearly to those who listen to these debates, is that the Opposition went into the last election campaign with the sale of the Pipeline Authority firmly placed as No. 9 on its list of 12 items that were to be privatised 'when we are elected'. What was the Opposition going to do with the money it obtained from the privatisation proposals? What the Opposition was going to do, according to the Opposition's proposal in the Economic Action Plan, was to rid ourselves of solid, fair and decent items of policy such as our capital gains tax. The way the Opposition was going to make up for this was by selling public authorities and by privatisation. The honourable member for Bass also mentioned that this would raise gas prices by 56 per cent. It needs to be said very clearly in this place that this is completely false. What we are talking about here is the haulage component-a very small component of the total gas price that the consumer pays at the end; and it represents a very small percentage if passed on to the consumer. It does not present a 56 per cent increase in gas prices and it needs to be understood very clearly by those people who are listening to this debate that that is a dishonest comment by the honourable member for Bass. One needs only to look at the past record of demand for gas to notice that the results of price hikes-and these price hikes occur on the core product-have had very little effect on demand for gas one in Sydney. If one looks at core prices for gas as arbitrated on a cyclical basis every three years, one finds that in 1983 the field price of gas increased by 32c, from 69c. That was a 46 per cent increase, and we did not find a fall-off in demand in 1984-85 following that. Again, in 1987, when the field price of gas increased by 57 per cent, we did not find a fall-off in demand. When those price increases occurred, they were very significant and at the consumer end they were much greater than the contemplated effect of this legislation. So the suggestion that there is going to be a rapid fall-off in demand or some excessive cost price passed on to consumers is not true. There will be a price passed on to consumers; we have made that very clear; we would be fools not to admit that; but it is not going to be excessive. Some of the suggestions about this that have been made by members of the Opposition are just dishonest. The honourable member for Bass said, 'What will happen to the consumers of New South Wales?'. I happen to live in Western Australia, and I am a taxpayer in this country, too. My taxes will provide an implicit subsidy for gas users in New South Wales. Opposition members can see there are inconsistencies in their arguments. There is·a benefit in this initiative for all taxpayers. We are putting this government business enterprise on an economic basis. That is perfectly consistent with the approach we have taken in respect of many other government business enterprises. It is appropriate and likely that, if Pipeline Authority (Charges) Bill is passed in this place and if the pipeline is put on a commercial basis, when it comes time to sell the pipeline-that decision is something that we canvassed in last year's Budgetthe Government will get a realistic price for this asset. I have no difficulty with that measure. It is an absurd suggestion that we should sell the pipeline in some sort of damaged state or in a state in which it is crippled with its hands tied behind its back and the price does not represent the commercial value. It would be delinquent of the Government not to make sure that it obtains the best commercial price for any assets that it is intending to sell. The way to do that is to put this pipeline on a commercial basis, to have it operating in such a way as a commercial operator would. There are many projections as to what the pipeline might be worth and as to what would be done were it sold. I can assure honourable members that it would be revalued if it was sold and the person, the corporation or the entity that bought it would use that revaluation to strike a haulage rate which would bring it a commercial return. We have no difficulty with such business practices. Those business practices are consistent. The Government is saying that that is the way it believes these things should operate. The suggestion by Opposition members that that should not be the case leaves us cold. There are concerns about consumers. We do not wish to cause difficulty for consumers. We are suggesting that there will be a commercial contract entered into and a deal with be struck which is commercially consistent. The Australian Gas Light Co. (AGL), the purchaser and the distributor of the gas, will have to make judgments, according to how it sees the market, as to how it will distribute the gas and the price that it will charge to its various consumers, whether they be commercial, industrial or domestic. That is not a judgment we are able to make. On our calculations, if AGL chooses to make the judgments that we think it will, the impost on consumers is likely to be about 8 per cent or 9 per cent in two this years. On the average gas bill in Sydney we are talking about 40 cents a week. I do not think that that is an unreasonable, excessive or dastardly cost to be asked of consumers. We have already said that the Opposition is being inconsistent. It went to an election campaign saying that this was one of its projects. Now the Opposition is stepping away from it. It is not new. It is something that the Opposition has done in many other issues. But we are being consistent in the way in which we are treating government business enterprises. If honourable members look at the Federal Airports Corporation, they will see that it wished to buy the asset value of the airport facilities at the suggested initial price of $450m. The eventual price was $1,1 OOm. It would have been a mistake for the Government not to receive commercial value for that asset. Exactly the same principle applies in this case. The suggestion by AGL and others that the historical depreciated value is appropriate is contradicted by one of its own subsidiaries. If honourable members allow me, I will quote one of AGL's subsidiaries, AGL Petroleum. The view that it put to the Industry Commission inquiry into Energy Generation and Distribution was as follows: AGL Petroleum agrees with the Commission's comment that tariffs based only on historical costs erode the capital base needed to provide ongoing pipeline capacity. . . Historic cost accounting methods are therefore inappropriate when applied to returns on long lived assets whether pipelines, manufacturing assets or public infrastructure. It is saying that it is perfectly appropriate for the Government to put this entity on a commercial basis before it takes the position as to how it will dispose of it. It is perfectly reasonable for us to suggest that. One of the other objections is that this is part of the Government's Budget strategy. The way in which, over a period of seven years, we have turned a huge deficit into a considerable surplus has been historic. The Opposition, in rejecting this legislation, is saying, 'No, we do not $500m or $600m or whatever price we can obtain for this asset'. We will not contemplate the suggestion that we should be selling down this considerable and important asset, and I doubt whether in government the Opposition would contemplate it. It is always important that assets such as this be put on a commercial basis. The Opposition suggests that the TPA is already on a commercial basis. The shadow Minister used today's report to suggest that things were okay. What we have to understand about the agreement at the moment is that we are looking at 16 years before the liabilities of the Pipeline thority have been overcome. With that sort of structure the Authority is not operating on a commercial basis; it is unable to earn any overall profit on the bulk of its business until the year 2006, and only adequate profits are allowed for thereafter. It is clear that the original agreement was unfortunate and the product volumes that were anticipated have not been met. In some ways I agree with the honourable member for Bass. I read through the debates in 1973 and it was interesting to see those from the then Government who supported the original agreement at that time. I would. think in hindsight some 17 years later that many of them would have a different view of the things that they said then. I suppose it is appropriate that we can all change our views. I am saying that the TPA is not operating on a commercial basis now and it is very important that, independent of the sale of the Pipeline Authority, we have to make sure that it is put on a commercial basis. Thearrangement at the moment is unsatisfactory and we are removing an implicit subsidy. The suggestion that we are doing otherwise is something that we would contest and on which we disagree with those opposite. There is an argument about the contractual basis of the position in which the Government finds itself concerning the sale of the pipeline. But that is not covered by this legislation. Indeed, this legislation is about the haulage charges, and want the contractual agreements that will be affected by this legislation will be subject to compensation c-auses within this Bill. The compensation clauses are very thorough. There is a significant opportunity for the aggrieved body, the AGL, to take to the Minister its claims for compensation. I point out again, however, that those compensation claims have to be based on a fall-off in demand that can be proved. It is clear that very significant price hikes in the past-in 1983 and 1987-have not affected demand in respect of this pipeline. When we look at the market for petroleum products, coal and other sources of energy it is hard to imagine that there Au- will be a fall-off in demand. There are significant compensation packages within this legislation. After that process has been passed through, the legislation allows for the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to be involved, and then eventually the courts. We are providing a fail-safe mechanism. If AGL finds itself in a position where it has a case to ask for compensation, then within the legislation there is a realistic way of appraising that and sorting out those difficulties. It would be inaccurate of me to say that this legislation has not been the source of considerable debate within our Party. But when it comes down to it, the Government is realistically appraising this asset, putting it on a commercial basis, being consistent in the way it deals with government business enterprises and, as part of its Budget strategy and as part of a strategy which is directed at maintaining its surplus, being consistent in the way it is dealing with this legislation. There are concerns, perhaps, amongst those in New South Wales about consumer costs. But taxpayers all over Australia have to be answered to by this Government and the number of taxpayers in Australia is vastly greater than the number in New South Wales. They have an interest .in the way in which we dispose of government business enterprises and. they have an interest in our gaining the best possible price for such assets. I support the legislation. I feel disappointed with the inconsistency that the Opposition has shown here. This was part of its very important Economic Action Plan for Australia. Here we are, six months after the election, and we have kicked out of the window-Mr Downer-What a cheek! Where is that so?",137
180,Dr CHARLESWORTH,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"It is there; item No.9. It is just another example of things that are convenient to say at election time but very difficult to do in reality. . MrMACK (North Sydney) (11.52)-1 will be very brief. The Pipeline Authority (Charges) Bill is the worse piece of legislation that I have seen since coming to this House. The provisions of the Bill and their consequences suggest that the dovernment has become obsessed with asset selling. It has reached the point where the sale of a government asset has become an end in itself and apparently no longer in need of any rational justification. This is what happens when government thinking becomes addled by ideology. We end up with .asset sacrifices on the altar of RogerGovernment nomlCS. What are the benefits to the community of the major asset sale contemplated by this Bill? It is a one-off capital gain which does nothing to address the economic problems which created the supposed need for the sale in the first place. A private monopoly is being created. The Government will lose control of an energy facility which is of vital importance to the nation and will increase in importance when the pipeline is linked to the North West Shelf. Natural gas charges to consumers will increase. A 25 per cent increase in' domestic consumer charges is predicted in one independent study. Even the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) admits that there will be a substantial increase in those charges. He has had to abandon his earlier promise to his Party colleagues of a 1.5 per cent increase in charges to domestic consumers. He is now conceding that they will be about 9 per cent. Not only is there nothing in the Bill to prevent these increases, but also provision is made to set aside any existing State legislation or contractual arrangements which would prevent the Australian Gas Light Co. (AGL) from recovering from end users the higher gas haulage charges which the Bill would allow. This is at a time when industry in New South Wales, as in all other parts of Australia, is facing a serious recession. The Bill will expose the Government to a compensation payout to AGL. The amount of this compensation liability cannot be assessed with any confidence. The Minister says that he does not expect that any significant compensation will be payable. As the Bill makes him the arbiter of any compensation claim, I suppose he can have some confidence. However, the arrangements are so crude and so repugnant to ordinary legal and commercial principles that they are unlikely to survive a legal challenge. The open-ended nature of the Government's compensation liability under this Bill undermines the whole point of the legislation. Important constitutional and legal precepts are to be scrapped by this Bill. The is legislating to break legal contracts so that it can get a better price and justify the sale. It is a tribute to religious fervour. If it were not for the proposed assets sale this Bill would never have come before the House. The argument that the current haulage tariffs are not commercially based and need to be increased was never raised and discussed on its own merits. There may be an argument for applying this logic to the Pipeline Authority, but if it is necessary we should have that debate out in the open and not in the shadow of another asset sale. t oppose this Bill and look forward to its rejection by the Senate.",140
181,Mr HICKS,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I am greatly concerned by this Pipeline Authority (Charges) Bill. I am concerned mainly about the increased costs that will apply to gas consumers in the areas of New South Wales that have been mentioned tonight. However,.the shire presidents of the Leeton and Narrandera shires, Councillors Shirley Hocking and Peter'Woods, their shire councillors, and the Mayor of Griffith, Alderman John Dal Broi and his alder-' men, who at tonight's council meeting will no doubt be discussing this issue, art! cerned that' this Bill will destroy' any chance the Murrumbidgee Irrigatiqn Area. (MIA) had of obtaining a natural gas supply. In the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area centres of Griffith, Leeton and Narnindera, the councils have been active in seeking the extension of the Wagga Wagga, pipeline to the MIA for many years. Ho-­ ever, the councils are concerned that If. the increased haulage rates become effec- , tive, the increased charges for gas would not be as attractive to those industries that had expected to take advantage ofit. ' The bottom line would be that the gas line would not be extended to the MIA. As honourable members should be aware, the MIA is one of the most productive areas in Australia and boasts many efficient industries that would be even more competitive if they had access: to a cheaper source of energy. Some of these firms include the very successful poultry firm, Bartter's; the Griffith Producers; tona, which is one of the few canneries in Australia; and the Rice Growers Cb-op­ erative, which .is one of the most successful agricultural marketing industries in Australia, to name·a few. The MIA is also the site for a developing feedlot industry, with two large feedlots already in construction, and abattoirs proposed for both. At the moment, none of these industries has access to a cheap energy source, nor does any secondary industry that could consider establishing in the MIA if· natural gas were available. The availability of natural gas would also encourage decentralisation to the MIA. I ask the Government to withdraw this Bill. If it will not do so, I will certainly oppose' its passage through this House. The whole matter could result in economic disaster, apart from anything else, first to the consumers of natural gas in New South Wales who will have to pay increased charges for fuel, and secondly to those areas, like the MIA that were hoping to obtain a supply of natural gas. If the Bill is passed, such areas will be denied' that opportunity. Finally, the taxpayer could be forced to conpay an estimated compensation payment of. any thing from $200m to $600m to the AGL company, which would destroy any benefit the Government could have gajned. We ali thought at the time the gas pipeline set-up was nationalised by the Whitlam Government that we had seen ev-rything, but I am afraid that what is happening now is that the Government is going to renege on a contractual agreement. I think this is the first time. I have heard of that. I think the situation is very -. grim indeed and, like those members who have spoken before me-the honour-ble member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) and, of course, the shadow Minister, the honourable member for' Bass (Mr Smith)-I ask the Government to withdraw this Bill. If it does not withdraw the Bill, we will be opposing it.",140
182,Mr WILLIS,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"in reply-This is an unexpected pleasure. In the time available to me I will reply to a couple of the points Lethat have been made. The honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith)-the shadow Minister for preventing privatisation-said in the course of his remarks that the pipeline was being run on a com.: mercial basis and making a substantial profit. What he 'entirely neglected to mention was the fact that although it is making a profit this year, is gradually paying off its accumulated losses and will do so over the next few years, the fact is that it has a contract which says that to the year 2006 there shall be no overall profit. So' all it can do under that contract, if it makes profits under current prices, is pay off its accumulated losses, after which it cannot continue to make profits under that contract. The contrflct is, therefore, quite clearly,inherently"" a non-commercial contract. For the Opposition to suggest that it would be able to privatise the Pipeline Authority or the pipeline on the basis of that contract is a joke---'-an absolute joke-and Opposition members are naive in the extreme to think that that would be so. They obviously have no concept of how to go about privatisation. If one is going to privatise, what one has to do is-Mr Beale-Just rip off the consumers of New South Wales.",141
183,Mr WILLIS,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,No; put enterprises on a proper commercial basis; that is what one' has to do. Mr Beale-It is on a proper commercial basis.,142
184,Mr WILLIS,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"It is not on a proper commercial basis. The honourable member knows nothing about it. The fact is that it must be put on a proper commercial basis. I explained that point before the honourable member came into the chamber,. This Pipeline Authority (Charges) Bill is all about putting it on a proper - ommen;:ial basis. Mr Beale....;"",You know· nothing about it.",142
185,Mr WILLIS,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"If we do not do that, obviously we would be giving this pipeline away, if we tried to privatise it with the current contract, for an abysmal price.

In his statement the Ombudsman stated that he had seen and given consideration to the Smith papers. One of the Smith papers-the file marked 'Go vi', kept in the be safe of the Police Commissioner-is said . to contain revelations that would prove disastrous for the State Labor Government. As I stated to the House the other evening, the matters arising from the SmithMartin trial deserve the fullest and most Membership detailed investigation. In the course of the trial, evidence was given by convicted telephone bugger, Robert Smith, to entries in his diary about work done for a person called 'BB'. Smith had been involved in the surveillance of a : Liberal Party member of Parliament and a principal witness in the trial of Len Brush, the former Chairman of the State Superannuation Board and friend of the then Premier. Brian Burke. The diary en- . tries which I read into Hanswd the other evening clearly give risft to the suspicion that the 'BB' referred to. and used Commission throughout the diary may' well refer to Tonight's call by the Parliamentary AusOmbudsman for a royal commission with powers is the, most damning criticism yet of these years of corrupwaste and huge losses associated with WA Inc. and the Western Australian In relation to the references in the diaries that may suggest the involvement of former Premier Brian Burke in the Smith affair, in the light of tonight's statements by the Parliamentary Ombudsman, in the expectation of the inevitable royal commission into the Smith papers and other WA Inc. matters, the Federal Government sh(,Hild perhaps be considering whether or not it is best for the international image of this country for the Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy. See to continue in his duties while the matters are being thoroughly investigated. The people of Western Australia and, indeed, people throughout Australia are calling for action. Now the independent Ombudsman' has indicated his concern-and I repeat those concerns: The public ""'int-rest will, i'n my view, satisfied by a royal commission with extended powers as was the case in the Fitzgerald inquiry investigatirig thisand he referred to the Smith papersand other related matters. This sensational development in the Western Australian Parliament tonight, hopefully, will be the start to the unravelling of the whole sorry saga that is WA Inc. ' Telephone Interceptions Trial: Royal Commission",143
190,Mr TUCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"l wish' to add a few remarks to those of the 'honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), because I think that this issue is now well and truly a matter for this Parliament and the Federal Government. The prosecution that has just been completed against Mr Smith and his colleague Mr Martin in Western Australia, of course, was a Federal prosecution. It was a matter of interfering with the telephones of this nation and, as such', was a matter that should have concerned this Parliament a long time ago. The point that has got to be understood is that the diary referred to by the honourable member for Moore is a diary that refers not only to an individual with the initials BB but also to another person called Vince. It is no coincidence that the very special chauffeur that travelled the world with Brian Burke was Vince Shervington. The coincidences are just too great to suggest that the person mentioned in those diaries is anybody but the current Ambassador to Ireland, Brian Burke. Two men have been gaoled for a conspiracy to tap telephones and a third appears to be implicated and to have knowledge of what occurred-and that is the ex-Premier of Western Australia who, as the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) will tell honourable members, is still campaigning to get a seat in this Parliament, still looking for endorsement from the Australian Labor Party to get a seat in this Parliament. Is it not time that he was told' to come back from Ireland, sacked from that job, and it was made public to Australia that those oponly be posite want no more truck with him? If members opposite have not got that courage, this Parliament has been totally negligent on WA Inc. ' Honourable members can go back through the Hansard-it is' on the record-and see the questions that have been put to the Treasurer (Mr Keating) going back years. I remember particular questions being asked by the then Leader of the Opposition, the honourable mem whether this Government had any interest in what was going on in Western Australia. The answer was, 'No, we do not want to know about it'. It was too bad for the taxpayer- of Australia and Western Australia as a consequence. Hundreds of millions of dollars were lost, having been paid out to entrepreneurs and others. The reality is that this matter has now, eventually, found its way to the Parliamentary Ombudsman. He has seen the evidence and says that there is no solution but a proper royal commission for which, as honourable members know, the Opposition, I and others have been calling for some time. . On occasions the idea of a bipartisan approach is raised in this Parliament on matters of great national interest. National integrity of politicians when it comes ,to the taxpayers' dollar and the tapping of telephones is probably as big an issue as anyone could consider. The Government has closed its eyes to Victoria Inc. It has tried to buy a few of those problems out with the Australian taxpayers' dollar. It has ignored completely WA Inc. One would think, in this Parliament, that it had never happened. The issue has come out where an ombudsman, having viewed the evidence, has made a simple recommendation for a royal commission. I ask the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley): What about it? Why can we not have a bipartisan policy and show that at least this Parliament is above that sort of caper and will chase the villains, whether they be members of his Party or not. The comment was made a little while ago that it might bring a Liberal into it. If it does, so be it. I offer them no succour. They can have whatever comes up. I say that those opposite should do the same because by their inaction in this place we have had these matters go on. It is all right to say that Martin's friend Mr Brush. Mr Brush, of course, was in control at the time this phone tapping was done, because the witness whose phone was being tapped was the person who was telling Western Australians that the then manager of the Superannuation Board in Western Australia was entering into shonky deals with this fellow Martin. Who was Brush's wife? Brush's wife was Brian Burke's private secretary. One wonders how he got the job in charge of the Superannuation Board. His wife was there. This man was knocking off the money by entering into friendly deals, and the money was lost. Of course, when someone decided to tell the authorities on, what did they do? They tapped his telephone and eventually were caught. But the issue now is that an ombudsman has said there should be an inquiry. Tomorrow we will want to know from the Leader of the House and his Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) what they are going t6 do about it.",144
191,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Telephone Interceptions Trial: Royal Commission,145
192,Mr BEAZLEY,ADJOURNMENT,in reply-I have two points on the matters raised by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). Mr Beale - Are you speaking to the adjournment?,145
193,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member for Deakin!,145
194,Mr BEAZLEY,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, I am shutting it up. The honourable member wanted an answer from me and he will get one. Firstly, the Parliamentary Ombudsman has called for a continuation of the police investigation. That is what the Ombudsman has had to say in Western Australia. Mr Costello-No, he has called for a royal commission.",145
195,Mr BEAZLEY,ADJOURNMENT,"No, he has asked for a continuation of the police investigation. If, at the end of that time he feels that th- police investigation does not satisfactorily clear up the matters, he says there was ought to be a royal commission. The second point is that, as I understand it, the particular file that we are all talking about here contains serious allegations that a couple of then Liberal Party councillors, now supposedly members of parliament, were bribed to approve a development in one of the city council areas. If that is what the Opposition is interested in, it might have mentioned that in the references that it made about what was supposedly on this file. That is fine. They did not get much of a mention in the couple of speeches that we heard here. In view of the selective indignation on the other side of the House, I can do no what was going more than move: That the question be now put. The House divided. (Mr SPEAKER - Hon.

(2) By what (a) number and (b) percentage has the total average annual seat capacity varied each year since 1982-83 on each international airline (i) into and (ii) out of Australia.",151
199,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question IS as follows: (I )(a) See Table 1. (I) (b) See Table 1. I am advised that as virtually all international airlines (with the exception of Qantas) only operate one service pattern (ie between Australia and their ""home"" country), the information provided in answer to Question (1) (a) also applies to Question (I) (b). A breakdown of Qantas capacity by route is provided for 1988/89· and 1989/90. Due to changes in Qantas's route structure in recent years, (Question No. 148) further historical data on a route basis would not provide a meaningful comparison with present operations. See Table 2 for the breakdown of Qantas capacity by route. General comment for (I) (a) and (b) In relation to inbound and outbound traffic, I am advised that capacity operated by intern ational airlines into Australia is equivalent to that operating out of Australia (excluding supplementary and charter flights) and therefore the data in Table I is provided on an each way basis. (2) (Ii) See Table I. (2)(b) See Table 1. General comment for (2) (a) and (b) The Department has advised me that not all international airlines have reported data to the (QuestioR No. 205) year ending June 1990. Therefore the annual data for international airlines (with the exception of Qantas) in 1989/90 are estimated figures only. Data for Air New Zealand, Air Niugini, Garuda and Singapore Airlines in 1988/89 includes a limited number of supplementary flights. The general comment on (I) (a) and (b) in relation to inbound and outbound capacity also applies to (2) (a) and (b).

Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The first Access and Equity Plan for the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio was published in October 1989. It is expected that the second will be ready for publication by June 1991. (b) and (c) I must emphasise that when developing policy in the primary industries and energy sectors care is taken to ensure that the views of people involved in these industries, and in rural and regional areas, is known to Government. Consultative mechanisms range widely from the ongoing Primary and Allied Industries Council to such ad hoc arrangements as my Department calling community public meetings to discuss issues such as salinity control and waterllandcare; or providing an 008 readyline service earlier this year to enable producers in the wool industry to register their concerns on an individual basis. In the specific context of consultation on access and equity with community organisations, representatives of my Department attended the 1990 regional access and equity open consultative forums arranged by the Office of Multicultural Affairs for this purpose.

(",156
202,Mr HOWE,EXPENDITURE PLUS NET INTEREST,"The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) (i) The first Social Security Portfolio Access and Equity Plan 1987/88-1989/90 was published in April 1988. The Plan made no separate reference to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal as the Tribunal had not been established as an independent statutory authority at that time. The Australian Institute of Family Studies Plan was published in the Attorney-General's Portfolio Plan in October 1988 as, at that time, responsibility for the Institute lay within that portfolio. (ii) The second Social Security Portfolio Access and Equity Plan will be published late in 1990 and will include strategies for the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Australian Institute of Family Studies. (b) and (c) At the National level, the Migrant Services Section of the Department liaises with the Federation of Ethnic Communities' Councils of Australia (FECCA) about any matters in which the Federation has an interest and is represented at FECCA's Annual Conferences. Officers of the Department involved in policy development and community consultations concerning Reciprocal . Agreements also consult frequently with FECCA and with various migrant groups. State Migrant Services personnel regularly meet Ethnic Affairs' Commissions and Ethnic Communities' Councils and hold regular meetings with Grant-in-Aid and other ethnic community workers. In New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland/Northern Territory, Migrant Advisory Committees, comprising officers of the Department and of Commonwealth and State Government departments, Grant-in-Aid and other ethnic welfare workers and representatives of ethnic and other community organisations, meet on a quarterly basis. Migrant Advisory Committees are soon to be established in Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania. At the Area Office level, an objective of the Area Outreach Officer position is to ensure that, through consultations with Migrant Resource Centres and migrant bodies, clients have the opportunity to make their views on access and equity issues known. The Migrant Liaison Officer network plays a key role in ensuring there is effective two-way communication between Regional Offices and local ethnic communities, particularly recently arrived communities without strong networks, through formal and informal consultations. Through a national network of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Liaison Officers (ALOs), special efforts are made to ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have full access to social security entitlements. This liaison service is supported by the Community Agents Program, the Support Network for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Parents, Remote Visiting Teams and an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Interpreter Program. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community based organisations, councils and individuals are consulted regularly. . As part of the development of detailed strategIes for inclusion in the second Social Security Access and Equity Plan, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal will be developing mechanisms for consultation at the national and regional level. Staff from the Australian Institute of Family Studies have regular meetings with community organisations, participate in regular seminars with other community organisations and ensure those organisations contribute to conferences sponsored by the Institute. Access and equity issues are addressed in those contexts. (d) Mr Brian Wraith, National Manager (Field Services), and Mr Ian Carnell,. Executive Manager, Program Delivery Division, have major responsibility for co-ordination of access and equity strategies within the Department. Mr Graham Willett, Project Officer, National Secretariat, Social Security Appeals Tribunal, is responsible for the Tribunal's segment of the Portfolio Access and Equity Plan. Responsibility for access and equity within the Australian Institute of Family Studies is shared by the members of the Corporate Executive. This comprises: Dr D.E. Edgar, Director, Dr P.F. MCDonald, Deputy Director, and Dr R.K. Kidston, Deputy Director.

Mr Willett can be contacted at the Tribunal National Secretariat on (03) 629 8381. The Australian Institute of Family Studies has only one office. Dr R.K. Kidston, Deputy Director, can be contacted on (03) 608 6802. Uniform Defamation Laws (Question No. 275) Mr Scholes asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 19 September 1990: (1) At what stage are negotiations concerning uniform defamation laws throughout Australia. (2) Is he able to say (a) how many writs for damages under existing defamation laws were issued in each State and Territory in (i) 1985, (ii) 1986, (iii) 1987, (iv)1988 and (v) 1989, (b) how many of these writs resulted in court proceedings and (c) how many writs were withdrawn after six months or more from their issue. Mr Michael Duffy-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) As the honourable member would be aware, the Commonwealth has no legislative role regarding defamation laws."" However, the question of uniform defamation laws is under consideration in the forum of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-Genera!. I have received from the Hon John Dowd, Attorney-Ge!1eral for New South Wales, a copy of the ""Discussion Paper on the Reform of Defamation Law"", distributed by the Attorneys-General of New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria. These Attorneys-General said in the foreword to that Discussion Paper that they were distributing ""this Discussion Paper in the hope that it will stimulate debate about the much needed reform in defamation laws"". At the most recent meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, the Attorneys-General of New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria reported that they had agreed to produce a further discussion paper by the end of November 1990, indicating areas of agreement and canvassing issues not covered in their first discussion paper. (2) Information concerning proceedings in State and Northern Territory courts is not readily available to the Commonwealth. The honourable member may wish to approach the Stllte and Northern Territory Attorneys-General directly for their assistance in obtaining this information. In relation to the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, the Registrar has provided the following information: No. filed 12 66 35 No. resulted in 5 24 15 court proceedings No. withdrawn 2 7 2 after 6 months or more Strawberries (Question No. 303) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 20 September 1990: Has the decision of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to allow the importation of strawberries from the USA exposed the local strawberry growing industry to such diseases as angular leaf spot and Australian consumers to high levels of methyl bromide used to fumigate imported fruit.",156
203,Mr GRIFFITHS,EXPENDITURE PLUS NET INTEREST,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The decision by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to allow the importation of strawberry fruit from the United States has not exposed the Australian growing industry to an unacceptable risk from exotic pests and diseases such as angular leaf spot. Approval to import fruit was only granted after a comprehensive biological risk assessment which formed the basis for developing stringent import conditions involving fumigation and inspection. These conditions provide the industry with a very high level of security against the introduction and establishment of exotic organisms from the fruit. Angular leaf' spot which is an exotic bacterial disease affecting strawberries was considered as part of the risk assessment process. Research on the biology of the disease and its infective cycle indicates that the chance for the disease to enter Australia on fruit and become established is extremely low. The disease is normally spread through the movement of infected plants and there are no authenticated reports which demonstrate that fruit has been the means of establishing the disease in a new lirea. Methyl bromide is a cornmonly used fumigant for treating insect infested foodstuffs including fruits and vegetables. The fumigant is very volatile and is quickly desorbed from the product and diffuses away. This process is assisted by the long period between the fumigation of fruit in the United States and its consumption in Australia. Consequently, when the fruit is eaten it would not contain levels of gaseous methyl bromide which were injurious to health. Social Security Overpayments (Question No. 329) 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 Mr Tim Fischer asked the Minister rep53 50 resenting the Minister for Social Security, 19 12 upon notice, on 10 October 19QO: 10 2 (1) Following the 1990 amnesty on social security overpayments, what sum was identified as having been paid out incorrectly by the Minister's Department. (2) How many individuals' entitlements were affected as a result of the amnesty. (3) For each State and region, what was the (a) number of individuals whose entitlements were affected by the amnesty and (b) sum involved.",158
204,Mr HOWE,EXPENDITURE PLUS NET INTEREST,"The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable Member's question: (1) Processing of Amnesty applications is not yet complete. The Government's objective when it introduced the 1990 Social Security Amnesty was that people being incorrectly paid would come forward immediately and have the matter put right. The intention was to reduce future outlays on social security payments. Estimated savings from the Amnesty included in the 1990 Budget were $55 million. Applicants for the Amnesty were not asked to give historical details of their incorrect payment. This was to make clear that the matter would not be pursued. Details of the payments being saved were collected and are still being processed. (2) Nationally, 22,590 applications for the Amnesty were received. Processing of the applications has not yet been completed. So far 20, I 00 have been accepted and 1,300 have been rejected. Additionally, payments which would otherwise have continued but which were voluntarily terminated by clients in the six week Amnesty period without them formally applying for the Amnesty have to be analysed and included in the results. (3) Because processing of Amnesty applications and analysis of voluntary terminations is not complete, detailed results for each State and region are not yet available. Taxation: Electronic Lodgment System (Question No. 336) Dr Bob Woods asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 11 October 1990: What was the (a) total quantity of, (b) cost unit of and (c) postage paid on the laminated colour poster advertisements for the electronic lodgement system of tax returns, mailed to tax agents throughout Australia in 1990.",159
205,Mr KEATING,EXPENDITURE PLUS NET INTEREST,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The laminated colour posters for the electronic lodgement system of tax returns were produced to advertise the electronic lodgement service to both tax agents and taxpayers. The total quantity produced was 4850 at a cost per unit of $6.14. . The display of these posters helped taxpayers Identify which tax agents offered this service to their clients. The use of the posters was an integral part of a very successful awareness campaign that resulted in a greater than expected number of tax returns being lodged via the electronic lodgement service. The posters were delivered to the ATO branch offices at a cost of $856.00 by the printing company. ATO branch offices then supplied the tax agents with the necessary copies. Victorian Building Societies (Question No. 340) Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 11 October 1990: (I) Has his attention been drawn to an article in the Geelong Advertiser of 22 September 1990 which claimed that a Telecom document leaked to the newspaper through Friends of Pyramid showed that an order was placed by the State Bank of Victoria for special connections to the Geelong City Hall to facilitate the State Bank of Victoria handling first payouts of frozen funds in the Pyramid, Geelong and Country Wide building societies. (2) Did the State Bank of Victoria place an order for the facilities referred to in part (I) on 30 March 1990; if not, on what date was the order lodged. - . (3) Was the document referred to in part (I) dated 30 March 1990; if so, why. (4) If Telecom's documentation is inaccurate, has he inquired (a) why it is inaccurate and (b) whether present methods will be changed.",159
206,Mr BEAZLEY,EXPENDITURE PLUS NET INTEREST,"the answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from Telecom, is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) No. Initially on 30 July 1990 at 2.15pm, Telecom received a request by telephone for the temporary installation of special connections. At 2.45pm Telecom confirmed that they would be able to supply the necessary equipment and as a per result a letter was forwarded by the State Bank to Telecom confirming the order which was dated 30 July 1990. (3) Yes. However this date is incorrect. (4) Upon receipt of an order it is the practice for Telecom staff to search the relevant data base for any previous orders for the particular customer which provides full customer details. Having displayed the old order on screen details of the new order are then inserted. On this occasion that methodology was followed. However, the operator failed to change the date of the previous order placed by the State Bank on 30 March 1990 to the new order date of 30 July 1990. The order of 30 March 1990 was for cancellation of a then existing State Bank telephone service and had nothing to do with the 30 July 1990 order. Mea,sures have been taken by Telecom's Geelong office to ensure that all details of new orders are accurately recorded in the data base. Light Aircraft Accidents (Question No. 358) Mr Jull asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 18 October 1990: (1) How many (a) light aircraft accidents were recorded, and (b) persons were (i) injured or (ii) killed in those accidents in Australia during each year since 1984. (2) What were the findings as to the cause of each of the accidents referred to in part (I) which were investigated by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation.",159
