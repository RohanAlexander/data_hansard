1,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Las t Thursday, in the House of Representatives,, the honourable member for Eden Monaro drew my attention to a report in the Melbourne Herald of the previous day purporting to give the decision ancl details, of the proceedings of the Parliamentary Broadcasting Committee. The honourable member then asked whether the information had been officially supplied to the press; if so, on what authority it had been supplied ; ancl if not, since the information was exclusively the property of this Parliament, would I have inquiries made with a view to having this disclosure of official informaticn investigated. In regard to the first two questions, I . have ascertained that no information concerningthe details of the proceedings of the committee was supplied officially to representatives of the press or to any other persons. The committee's allocation of the broadcasting time between the Senate and: the House of Representatives for the remainder of the week was made public in the usual way by means of: a notification issued by the secretary of the committee. Whether or not the publication of the proceedings of the committee is a breach of privilege is a question, for the House to determine. The relevant extract from May, which appears at page 118, is^The publication of proceedings of committees conducted with closed doors or of reports of committees before they are available to Members will constitute a breach of privilege. The Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Committee, however, differs from other statutory and select committees in that it has executive authority, and there is no provision for it to report to the House, other than in. relation to specified general principles. In the circumstances, I propose to consult the committee on the question raised by the honourable member 1948. for Eden-Monaro. HOUR OF MEETING. Motion (by Mr CHTEEEY) agreed toread That the House, at its rising, adjourn t.<> tomorrow, at 10.30 a.m. BUILDI NG MATERIALS. SHOBTAGE IN TOWNSVILLE .",12
2,Mr EDMONDS,Unknown,"-Will the Ministei representing the Minister for Shipping: and Fuel find out whether that Minister has received a telegram from. Mr L. Lawrence, president of the Federated Chambers of Commerce, Townsville, stating, inter aliaProceedings Lack of building materials has created a chaotic condition of affairs in Townsville; . . . Cement and timber are scarce, steel orders aretwelve to eighteen months behind, and there is also a twelve months' lag in piping and iron needed for repairs alone. The greatest menace is the lack of water.. The city's water supply is cut off now from 9 p.m. to 0 a.m. every day. A prograimne to increase Townsville's wateT supply by the Mount Spec weir scheme is beingdelayed because the City Council cannot get piping. Will the Minister ensure that this matter will receive attention immediately?",12
3,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"I shall ascertain, from the Minister for Shipping and Fuel whether he has received the communication mentioned. If the shortage of materials is due to transport difficulties, I am sure that the Minister will do everything possible to remedy the position. I fully understand why the honourable member is so concerned about the water supply position in Townsville. I shall also endeavour to see whether the Department of Supply and Development caninduce manufacturers to make a quantity of piping available for this essential purpose. SHIPPING. POET DELAYS.",12
4,Mr BEALE,Unknown,"I draw the attention, of the Prime Minister to a press statement"" cabled from London, that excessivedelays in the handling of cargoes at. Australian ports are causing large amounts, of tonnage to remain idle over long periods. and that work that could previously be done in days is now taking weeks to ! complete. Having regard to the grave injury which such delays are causing our interstate and overseas trade, ancl necessity for maintaining regular food supplies to Great Britain,- is the Prime Minister prepared to do anything to imcoal prove the position, and, if so, what?",12
5,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I have not seen the ita.tement in the newspaper, and if I had seen it I would not be prepared to accept it as fact. The matter of the turn-around of shipping is one that has been the ject of discussion by the Minister for Shipping ancl Fuel, the Stevedoring Industry Commission, the unions, and shipowners. There is nothing new in the complaint that there has been delay in turn-around of ships in Australia, This is not entirely due to the men engaged on the waterfront. Delays occurring Sydney have, in some instances, been due to the lack of berthing space. The facilities on the Sydney waterfront are interruptions? not altogether adequate to meet modern requirements. No matter how hard waterside workers may work, it is always possible for them to expedite the turn-around of ships. On occasions the loading and unloading of ships been delayed owing to unfavorable coal weather conditions. That matter has been discussed by the Minister with the responcoal sible authorities, to see whether i possible to devise some means whereby certain cargoes could be loaded or loaded promptly, irrespective of weather conditions. In some instances no attempt has been made to meet that difficulty, in conjunction with the Minister, I discussed personally other aspects of the matter with representatives of the unions, and with the chairman of the Stevedoring Industry Commission. A special survey is being made tralia to see whether the loading of vessels can be accelerated. Whilst I not know anything about the press every possible way. statement mentioned by the honourable member, I do know that there have been delays which have been due not to the waterside workers, but to lack of facilities, or inadequate provision. However, every - endeavour is now being made to accelerate the rate of loading. COAL. SOUTH AUSTRALIAN SUPPLIES.",13
6,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"^Some .time ago to arrangements were made whereby suffithe cient ships and coal were to be made available to meet the needs of South Australia. Recently, however, supplies of have fallen far short of requirements. Is the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Fuel aware that a fortnight ago railway services in South Australia had to be reduced to only a skeleton basis, and that during the past week sufficient wheat has not been available to meet subthe needs of mills for gristing, or for shipments? That was principally because sufficient coal had not been supplied the to South Australia. Will the Minister take this matter up with the appropriate the authorities to ascertain who was responsible for that state of affairs? Will h<also take steps to build up stocks in in South Australia so that there will be ample supplies available in that State for industry to carry on without continual",13
7,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"My colleague, the the Minister for Shipping and Fuel, is not responsible for the co-ordination of shipping, and, of course, the Joint Coal Board is also within his province. 1 has do not know whether the shortage of in South Australia is, due to inadequate shipping, or to the lack of sufficient to meet requirements throughout, the t was Commonwealth. However, I shall ask the Minister for Shipping and Fuel to unexamine the matter, and, insofar as it is within his power to ensure that adequate shipping shall be made available. I am sure that he will do so. But tinhave honourable member will appreciate that there.is not sufficient coal being produced to meet all the requirements of industry. Therefore, it is unlikely that it will be possible to build up stocks in South Ausor in any other State. However. I am sure that the Minister for Shipping do and Fuel will be prepared to assist in MOTOR VEHICLES. HOME DELIVERIES BY TRADESMENALLOCATIONS.",13
8,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"In view of the relaxation of the zoning system and the legislation passed recently by the New South Wales Parliament compelling tradesmen to revert to the pre-war system of delivery for meat and bread, will the Minister for Transport give urgent consideration to granting to tradesmen special priority for delivery vehicles so that they may comply with the desire of the State Government to restore to the general public this most desirable and essential service?",13
9,Mr WARD,Unknown,"I appreciate fully the difficulties confronting proprietors of small businesses in complying with the State law requiring home deliveries. The situation is most difficult because of the Totally inadequate supply of vehicles, but .1. shall give consideration io the point that the honourable member has raised, and ascertain whether some relief can be afforded.",14
10,Mr CONELAN,Unknown,"Will the Minister for Transport say who allocates the number of new cars to the various States, and wbo fixes the basis of the allocation? Can lie say why new American cars are sold for use as taxis in every capital city of Australia except Brisbane'? Who is responsible for preventing taxi-owners in Brisbane from replacing their old cars even with 1946 American vehicles?",14
11,Mr WARD,Unknown,"The distribution of new motorvehicles to the States is controlled jointly by the Department of Transport ancl the distributors, regard being had to population, and the demand before the war. The allocation of cars of a particular type for use as taxis is controlled hy the State authorities themselves. In Queensland, although the allocation of permits for the purchase of motor vehicles has been the responsibility of the Commonwealth, the actual administration has been in the hands of the State authorities, and the Commonwealth has not interfered so long as it was satisfied that the general policy, as laid down by the Commonwealth, was being applied. I shall rake up with the authorities in Queenslaud the matter raised by the honourable member, and shall let him have more information later. S UPERPHOSPHATE.",14
12,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I have received the following telegram from my elector ate :Dairy-farmers south-west Victoria protest sisrtiinst superphosphate subsidy being paid direct to farmers by Government. No claim forms available and delay by the Government in payment for subsidy causing concern. Butter factories involved already collecting fullpayment from farmers. I ask the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture whether a more satisfactory sclieme, acceptable to the dairy-farmersof Victoria, can be devised.  proceeding between officers of my department and representatives of the superphosphate manufacturing companies to ascertain whether a more flexible system of paying the subsidy can be arranged. I have great hopes of a satisfactory solution being reached. I do not think that any farmer is waiting for the payment of the subsidy at present because this is not the time for top-dressing in the district from which the honourable member has received his telegram. SOCIAL SERVICES.",14
13,Mr DALY,Unknown,"My attention has been directed to the fact that a number of post offices in the Sydney metropolitan area are not carrying stocks of application forms for social services, particularly age and invalid pensions. Will the Minister representing the Minister for Social Services urge upon his colleaguethe necessity for maintaining adequatestocks of tliose forms at po9t offices so as to avoid great inconvenience to elderly people ?",14
14,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"I shall take the matter up with the Minister for Social Services - It is well known that not only metropolitan post offices, but also all post offices throughout, the Commonwealth, keep a stock of formsfor individuals who desire to make fresh claims for pensions. There may have been an oversight in the instance mentioned by the honourable member, and I shall a.?'k the Minister to have the matter investigated. NA AUSTRALIA .",14
15,Mr HAMILTON,WATE R SUPPLIES IN WESTERN,"Has the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction seen a press statement that shortage of water in many agricultural towns in Western Australia is necessitating the use of seventeen trains essentially for transporting water?' As it is feared that further trains may have to be made available to convey water to Bruce Bock and Kondinin, for which towns a water scheme has been promised for some time, will the Minister endeavour to arrange for a larger quota of piping for Western Australia? It is the lack of this material which is delaying the provision of these schemes, which involve the supply of water from the gold-fields water supply? Mr Dedman"" - I have not seen the press statement to which the honourable member has referred. I can assure him that while I can organize a number of things I cannot organize the weather and I am not responsible for its effects in Western Australia. It is not possible for me, as a Commonwealth Minister, to direct that quantities of piping be sent to any particular place, but I shall do my utmost, in conference with the manufacturers of such piping, to ascertain whether additional supplies could be sent to Western Australia for the purpose mentioned. RABBIT DESTRUCTION.",14
16,Mr FRASER,WATE R SUPPLIES IN WESTERN,"Can the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture inform me what prospect there is that further imports will, be permitted of larvacide and - cyanogas for rabbit destruction ? Following previous representations some import licences for those items were revalidated, but both larvacide and cyanogas are again in very short supply. I know that dollars are the difficulty, but in view of the simplicity and efficiency - of this method of destruction, can the Minister indicate whether further imports will be permitted?  cide and cyanogas are both very satisfactory gases for the destruction of rabbits. It is necessary to spend dollars to obtain them, but I am quite sure, in view of the menace that rabbits constitute, that the next time the dollar committee meets it will give some consideration to the question of whether additional dollars can be allocated for the import of these gases. It is possible to use alternative methods of gassing rabbits. Plant and equipment for this purpose are already on the Australian market which enable the poisoning of rabbits to be effected by carbon monoxide manufactured' from charcoal. That method, however, requires more effort than is needed in the use of larvacide and cyanogas. However, I shall inquire into the matter to see what can be done. PETROL.",15
17,Mr CONELAN,WATE R SUPPLIES IN WESTERN,"Will the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Fuel say whether taxi cab proprietors in Sydney receive an allowance of 201 gallons of petrol a month whilst those in Brisbane receive only 81 gallons a month? If those figures are correct, will he explain why there is discrimination between the two cities?' Many ex-servicemen in Brisbane are trying to earn a living with taxi cabs but, owing to the inadequate quantity of petrol that is allowed to them, their cabs are idle for a. half of each month.",15
18,Mr DEDMAN,WATE R SUPPLIES IN WESTERN,"I do not know whether taxi cab drivers in Sydney are allowed more petrol each month than those in Brisbane and other Australian cities. If they are, I am certain that there is some valid reason for it. I shall ask the Minister for Shipping and Fuel to examine the matter in order to ascertain whether it is possible to do anything to adjust the position.",15
19,Mr TURNBULL,WATE R SUPPLIES IN WESTERN,"Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Fuel been drawn to an article in the October number of the Australian Motorist, headed "" Australia's Iron Curtain "", relating to petrol rationing in Australia, in which the following paragraph appears:Under the present scale ol rationing, our average consumption per unit is now pegged at between 300 and 304 gallons per unit per annum, against the following ngures for other Dominions, which relate to the year 1947:Canada 726 New Zealand 385 India .. 664 South Africa 612 Australia, now 304 Can the honourable gentleman say why, in comparison with other dominions, Australia is in such an unsatisfactory (position?",15
20,Mr DEDMAN,WATE R SUPPLIES IN WESTERN,"The factor mentioned by the honourable member is not the only one that must be taken into consideration. The only reliable comparison must be based on the number of vehicles to each 1,000 of the population in the countries concerned. In Canada, for example, the number of vehicles to each 1,000 of the population may be fewer than it is in Australia, which may be a good reason why Canadian users have a higher con-' sumption than Australian users on a unit basis. We are not concerned with the position in other countries; we are concerned with our own difficulties which have been brought about by the dollar shortage. In view of the need to conserve dollars the Government has decided what we can afford to expend on petrol this year, and it has divided that amount as equitably as possible between users of petrol and users of other petroleum products. NA MINISTERS.",15
21,Sir EARLE PAGE,CONFERENCE OF EMPIRE PRIME,"Is the Prime Minister able to make a statement with regard to the progress that has been made by the conference of Empire Prime Ministers that is now being held in London? Has the Australian representative suggested any means of overcoming the difficulty of Eire and India remaining within the British Commonwealth of Nations? If he has done so, will the Prime Minister say what the suggestions were and whether they have been accepted ? If the difficulties cannot be rethe game? solved, I ask the right honourable gentleman, in view of the fact that Australia is a member of the International Trade Organization, whether the Government has any plan for the preservation of the advantageous trade arrangements that now exist between Australia and those two countries.",16
22,Mr CHIFLEY,CONFERENCE OF EMPIRE PRIME,"I do not think that this is an appropriate time to make a statement regarding the subjects that have been discussed at the conference of Empire Prime Ministers. The difficulty with regard to Eire and India was, to some extent, foreseen, and I have had an opportunity to express the opinion of the Australian Government upon it. Jt will be understood that the matter, particularly with regard to India, is rather delicate. The Australian representative [50] at the conference is fully aware of the Government's views upon the issues that are involved. Our views are also known to the British Government. When I have received a reasonably clear indication of what may be the final outcome of the discussions that are now taking place I shall inform the honourable gentleman of it by means of a written statement or by communicating the information to him personally. TOBACCO.",16
23,Mr DUTHIE,CONFERENCE OF EMPIRE PRIME,"Is the Prime Minister aware that it was reported in the, press of Saturday last, the 16th October, that there is a racket in tobacco distribution throughout the Commonwealth and that the Australian Government is being defrauded of thousands of pounds each month by the evasion of the payment of excise duty upon such tohacco? Is the right honourable gentleman aware that tons of fine cut and flake cut tobacco produced by illicit manufacturers is being retailed in Melbourne and elsewhere? In view of that report, and of the refusal of the Tobacco Distribution Committee in Hobart and elsewhere to give tobacco quotas to many ex-servicemen who have set up in business, will the right honourable gentleman have a thorough check made of the industry and reinstitute government control of distribution if the present private organization cannot do the job and play",16
24,Mr CHIFLEY,CONFERENCE OF EMPIRE PRIME,"The statement to which the honourable member has referred is a surprise to me, because I have not heard any suggestion that such a set of circumstances existed. However, as the honourable member requests, I shall arrange for the Minister for Trade and Customs to have the matter examined, and I shall later let the honourable gentleman have a full reply to his question. The distribution of tobacco has always been a thorny subject. It was not possible to ration tobacco successfully because the information we had was that only 50 per cent, of the population are smokers. Therefore, any rationing system would possibly result in families with the largest number of non-smokers receiving a greater proportion of tobacco than smokers; and non-smokers would be able to engage to some degree in blackmarketing with their ration. ""We were told by the distributors of tobacco that if the matter were handed over to them they would be able to conduct the distribution satisfactorily. I am sorry to say that under their control the distribution has been worse than it was under government control. However, I see no possibility of reinstituting government control of the distribution of tobacco in the present circumstances. INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS. the",16
25,Mr FRANCIS,CONFERENCE OF EMPIRE PRIME,"Is the Prime Minister aware that within the last few days the American Defence Department has been directed to organize all American reserve units and to commence a vigorous reserve training programme? Does he know also that the United States Air Force has issued an urgent appeal for the immediate re-enlistment of 10,000 of its former air crew ? Does he know that within recent days the United States Atomic Energy Commission has announced plans for two uranium ore processing plants to start operations very soon? Finally, in view of the authoritative statements appearing in yesterday's press from many nations stressing the seriousness of present conditions, and in view of the fact that this Farliament so far this session has not had an opportunity to discuss international affairs, is the right honourable gentleman, as the Minister acting for the Minister for External Affairs, prepared to present to the House a full and comprehensive statement covering recent changes in the international sphere? The last ministerial statement on international affairs made to the House was presented to it on the l l t h March last.",17
26,Mr CHIFLEY,CONFERENCE OF EMPIRE PRIME,"I have given some thought to the presentation of a statement on international affairs to the House, but the conference of Dominion Prime Ministers is still in session and events are moving so rapidly that any statement which might he prepared would very likely be found, in some respects, not to be up to date by the time the statement was circulated. Furthermore, in view of the fact that the General Assembly of the United Nations is still meeting in Paris and is dealing with a number of matters, including the Berlin situation, which are the subject of negotiation and consultation, it may not be advisable to make any statement at this end at this stage. I remember the last statement on external affairs which was presented to the House. I think that it covered 420 pages, but much of the detail it contained was not up to date because of the rapid change of events at the time. I shall consider the honourable member's request. I have heard some broadcast statements concerning the particular matter to which he referred in first portion of his. question and we are, of course, aware of the situation outlined therein. INTEREST RATES.",17
27,Mrs BLACKBURN,CONFERENCE OF EMPIRE PRIME,"Some months ago I asked a question of the Prime Minister relative to the lowering of interest rates on moneys advanced for home building. I now ask the right honourable gentleman what consideration has been given to my suggestion that the rate of interest charged on advances by the Commonwealth Bank for home building should be purely nominal? Would it be possible to follow the present practice in New Zealand where interest rates on capital loans for rehabilitation, farms and houses, are 2 per cent, for the first year, and 3 per cent, thereafter, and for such loans for businesses, and the purchase of stock and chattels, 2 per cent, for the first year, and 4 per cent, thereafter? If the Prime Minister has not already discussed with the banks the possibility of adopting a similar scheme in Australia with a view to helping home builders by lowering interest rates, will he undertake to do so?",17
28,Mr CHIFLEY,CONFERENCE OF EMPIRE PRIME,"Following the honourable member's earlier question on this subject. I caused an investigation to be made of the possibility of adopting her suggestion, and I have also discussed it with, the Minister for Works and Housing because of its effect on war service homes in which he is particularly interested. 1 believe I replied to the honourable member then, and if not, I do so now, that the suggestion that money should be lent at the cost of raising it is not likely to be adopted. A considerable amount of the money advanced by the Commonwealth for home building purposes comes from the Commonwealth Bank which also pays interest on it. Very substantial reductions have been made in the interest rate on advances for war service homes. At present the rate is 3£ per cent. The interest rate on housing loans issued by the Commonwealth Bank is now 3$ per cent. It is true that these charges cover more than the actual cost of the money to the Government or to the bank. They cover also certain administration costs associated with housing loans issued by the Commonwealth Bank. I cannot at the moment promise the honourable member that any further reduction will be effected in the interest rates. I assure her, however, that they have been reviewed from time to time during the life of this Government and that should it be practicable to make further reductions, that will be done. MR. J. A. ALEXANDER.",17
29,Mr LANG,CONFERENCE OF EMPIRE PRIME,"In view of allegations made in this House affecting the probity of Mr J. A. Alexander, an Australian journalist formerly employed by the Melbourne Herald as its Canberra roundsman, will the Minister for In formation inform the House whether Alexander was given an appointment as First Secretary in Charge of Public Relations at the Australian Legation in Moscow in June, 1944, by a Cabinet of which the Minister was a member? Was Alexander taken from his position on the Melbourne Herald to be given that appointment? Was Alexander the Press Liaison Officer to the Australian Delegation to the Paris peace conference and an Australian member of the economic commissions for the Balkans and Finland in 1946? Were all these government appointments made subsequent to the period regarding which the Minister made his charges? Did the present Government make the appointments because it believed that there was no substance in the allegations regarding what was supposed to have happened during the regime of the Scullin Government or, if not, were the appointments made because such conduct was regarded as a qualification for the position?",18
30,Mr CALWELL,CONFERENCE OF EMPIRE PRIME,"The appointment of Mr Alexander to any position in the Department of External Affairs was made by the Minister for External Affairs, and not by the Government. I do not know anything about the other matters men-, tioned by the honourable gentleman. I have heard a rumour that Mr Alexander was offered the editorship of Century, but that he would not sink) so low as to accept this post. ROADS.",18
31,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,CONFERENCE OF EMPIRE PRIME,"Has the Prime Minister given any consideration to the views of local government associations which have declared that, owing to the high costs of road construction and maintenance, the proportion of revenue from petrol tax allotted to them is not sufficient for their needs? If so, has he any announcement to make about the Government's intentions regarding the allotment of receipts from petrol tax for road construction and repair work?",18
32,Mr CHIFLEY,CONFERENCE OF EMPIRE PRIME,"I have received numerous representations regarding the allocation of petrol tax receipts for road works. As the honourable member knows, the method of allocation of these funds has been changed. Previously, the money was allocated by the Commonwealth to the State governments, which were responsible for determining the manner in which the total amount should be expended. However, it was decided last year that the distribution was not being made so as to provide fairly for roads in sparsely populated areas and that a special allocation should be made for such works. On the recommendation of the Minister for Transport, who had discussed the matter with State Ministers for Transport, it was decided to add to the allowances already being made direct to State governments an amount of £1,000,000 a year to be distributed by them for use on outer roads and for the purchase of machinery to be used on roads in sparsely populated districts. The Minister for Transport presided at another conference this year, and afterwards a recommendation was made that this extra amount be increased by £1,000,000 a year. The bill to give effect to this recommendation has been introduced in this House already. This proposal means that the Commonwealth will provide from petrol tax receipts an amount of about £7,300,000 a year for road works. That will be in addition to certain sums that are made available for work on roads which give access to munitions factories and other Commonwealth properties. These funds, added to the amounts which the States receive from motor vehicle taxes and registration fees, will provide by far the largest amount ever made available to local government bodies for road-making purposes. In fact, so much has been provided that I doubt whether it can all be expended. SECRET INFORMATION. ALLEGED LEAKAGES: SEARCH OF NEWSPAPER OFFICES AT PARLIAMENT HOUSE.",18
33,Mr BERNARD CORSER,CONFERENCE OF EMPIRE PRIME,"Since the House adjourned last Friday, have officers of the Commonwealth Investigation Service, or any other persons, raided or entered the private offices occupied by newspaper representatives in Parliament House? Is it not necessary for persons to obtain your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, before entering this building for such a purpose? Did the omcers or other persons ask for, or receive, authority to enter the building for the purpose mentioned ?",19
34,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONFERENCE OF EMPIRE PRIME,"I have read in the press that investigation omcers entered Parliament House, and went to the offices of a certain newspaper. The situation in this Parliament is unique. In no other Parliament in the world' is the press accommodated with offices in the Parliament House. Press representatives occupy such accommodation in this building as a very special privilege, and by courtesy of the Parliament, and they are expected to respect that privilege. I did give authority for the offices to be examined, and I accept full responsibility for having done so. ARMED FORCES. CAMPAIGN MEDALS.",19
35,Mr HAYLEN,CONFERENCE OF EMPIRE PRIME,"Can the Minister for Defence say whether it is true that cammember paign stars and medals issued to exin servicemen are not to be engraved with the names and numbers of the recipients, as was done in the case of medals issued ment. after other wars ? If so, has this decision been reached at the request of servicemen's organizations, in order that the issue of medals may be speeded up, or has it been reached for economy reasons",19
36,Mr DEDMAN,CONFERENCE OF EMPIRE PRIME,"It has been decided that medals will be issued without the numbers andjnames of the recipients being engraved upon them. That is the practice in the United Kingdom. The decision was reached because the issuing of the medals would have been delayed for a long time had we waited until they were engraved. Moreover, the engraving would require the use of labour and resources on a colossal scale, and the Government believed that such labor and resources could be better employed, in the interests of ex-servicemen, on more important work. NA WAR.",19
37,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I desire to ask a question of the Minister for the Army. In 1945, I asked a previous Minister for the Army whether he would put an end to the practice of deducting from the estates of deceased prisoners of war the amount of allotment paid between the date on which they were taken prisoner and the presumed date of their death, and I understood that this request had been acceded to. However, I have been informed by the Prisoners of War Association that that is not so. Last week, I mentioned in this House the case of a man who, with nine other Australian prisoners of war was captured from the Japanese by Chinese guerrillas. Although he was known to have been alive for a considerable time after his capture by the Chinese, he was presumed to have died on that date, and his mother was billed for £234 representine; allotments paid to her after that date. Will the Minister see that this practice is not continued, and that full repayment is made in every case where allotments have been deducted?",19
38,Mr CHAMBERS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I shall have that case examined. I think the honourable is familiar with two other cases which amounts so deducted were subsequently refunded. I shall take the matter up with the officers of my departCIVIL AVIATION. The honourable member for New England having earlier asked a disallowed question,",19
39,Mr ABBOTT,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Will the Minister for Civil Aviation appoint a judge of a Supreme Court to inquire into the safe working of the regulations issued by the Department of Civil Aviation for the oontrol of air traffic throughout Australia? Is it true that the boards at airports purporting to record the movements of aeroplanes are operated on mere assumptions, and do not necessarily record the actual position of aeroplanes during flight?",20
40,Mr DBAKEFOBD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"The answer to the first part of the honourable member's question is, "" No "". I believe that the conduct of air services in Australia is second only to that of one other country in the world. Becently, a man who arrived in Australia from a flight overseas conveyed to me voluntarily-and it was not apropos any accident that had occurred in Australia-that he was glad to get back to this country, because he thought that our methods of control, particularly air radio communications, were the best that he had experienced in any of the dozen or more countries through which he had passed on his journey. Persons competent to judge have expressed the opinion that the methods employed in Australia are safe. Therefore, I cannot see that there is any need for an inquiry. The honourable member referred to boards used at airports indicating the position aircraft in flight. That was the subject of an earlier question by him which was disallowed, and I do not intend to comment on matters which are sub judice pending a current court of inquiry. GUNS AND AMMUNITION .",20
41,Mr EYAN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Can the Minister for the Army say whether it is true, as the press has reported, that the ammunition huts at Mangalore, in Victoria, containing millions of rounds, are not checked regularly? What precautions are taken, in view of the large scale thefts that have occurred recently, to prevent further thefts of the kind? Will the Minister ensure that, in future, such depots will be regularly inspected and properly guarded ?",20
42,Mr CHAMBERS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I did see a press report that the ammunition huts were not inspected or guarded, but the report appeared in only one newspaper. No such report appeared in this morning's newspapers. I understand that continual inspections are, in fact, made. The honourable member will understand, however, that it would be impracticable to place a guard at every ammunition hut in every depot throughout Australia. The newspaper report meant, I think, that there was not a guard on every building, and that is true, but there is a guard at the entrance to every depot. Since the theft occurred security measures have been tightened up. MR. J. C. BUXTON.",20
43,Mr HUTCHINSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Will the Minister for Immigration say whether the Department of Immigration has served a notice on J. C. Buxton, a stateless person who served with the Australian special Z force as a member of Intelligence Personnel during the war, requiring him to leave Australia. Has Mr. Buxton's war service to Australia since been recognized by the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which admitted him as a member ?",20
44,Mr CALWELL,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"My department has always had good and sufficient reasons for requiring anybody to leave Australia. I do not propose to state publicly the of reasons in any particular instance, but if the honourable member will call around to my office I shall speak to him privately about the matter. CANBERRA. POLICE UNIFORMS.",20
45,Dame ENID LYONS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Will the Minister representing the Acting Attorney-General say whether male members of the Commonwealth police at Canberra who do not wear a uniform receive a special clothing allowance of £1 a week, and that women police who are not provided with a uniform receive a clothing allowance of 7s. 6d. a week? If so, what is the basis of that distinction between male and female police?",20
46,Mr HOLLOWAY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Whils t I know that some members of the Commonwealth police force in Canberra receive an allowance in lieu of uniform, I am not aware of the amount of the allowance.

However, I shall make inquiries and infonn the honourable member fully on this matter as soon as possible. IMMIGRATION.",21
47,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Will the Minister inform the House whether it is a fact, as reported in the Melbourne Age several days ago, that it is anticipated that Mombasa will become the "" springboard "" for migrants proceeding from Europe to Australia? Is not Mombasa French territory? In view of the condition of world affairs today, would it not be advisable to select some other port for this purpose? Can the Minister say whether the District Commissioner of that area, Mr G. A. Skipper, to whom the statement is attributed, had any authority for making the announcement? Can the Minister also say whether Major General Lloyd, or Brigadier White, of the Australian Army, discussed this matter with Mr Skipper or anybody else in authority, other than in Cairo and Kenya? Will the Minister undertake to keep the House fully informed of the latest developments in this matter, particularly in the light of Mr Skipper's remarks that a decision would be made in the near future?",21
48,Mr CALWELL,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I have told the House on several occasions recently that the Australian Government is examining a scheme for an air-sea lift of migrants from Britain and from displaced persons camps in Germany. I have said that Brigadier White has gone to Cairo, to Geneva, and that later he would go to London to make certain investigations about the practicability of introducing a scheme that was brought to Australia by Mr Robert Innes of the International Refugee Organization and Mr Gilbert Christie of the firm of Airworks Limited, London. I have also said that Major General Lloyd who is the representative of the International Refugee Organization in Australia would consult with Brigadier White, the British representatives, and representatives of the International Refugee Organization to see whether the scheme put forward is practicable. Briefly, the whole scheme envisages flying people from England to some part of Africa-it may be Rhodesia or Kenya-and also flying displaced persons from Germany to the same place. Ultimately they will be brought from Africa to Australia by ship. Embarkation ports have not yet been decided upon. The honourable gentleman would be well advised not to take too much notice of newspaper reports that it has been decided to use Mombasa. Considerations of great importance are involved. Large areas of Africa are subject to yellow fever, and the public health authorities in Australia require that adequate steps shall be taken to ensure that that disease will not be introduced into this country. The port of embarkation in Africa has accordingly not yet been determined. As soon as I am in a position to make a full statement on this matter, I shall do so. Major General Lloyd is expected to arrive back in Australia at an early date, and Brigadier White should arrive here within two or three weeks afterwards. AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS' REPATRIATION BILL 1948. SECOND READING . Debate resumed from the 15th October (vide page 1746)', on motion by Mr . BAKNAKDThat the bill be now read a second time. Upon which Mr White had moved, by way of amendment That all words after ""That"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:- "" the bill be withdrawn and referred to a parliamentary select committee of ex-servicemen appointed to inquire into and report upon the present repatriation pension rates with a view to better adjusting these rates to present living costs "".",21
49,Mr BOWDEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Gippsland) [3.58].TI n the few minutes available to me today I shall recapitulate the aspects to which I should like the Minister to give further consideration. When speaking on this matter on the last sitting day of the Parliament, I confused the term "" service pension "" with "" services pension""; I wish that term to be applied generally rather than particularly. Doubtless some honourable members will make capital out of my error and try to justify a course that Opposition members regard as unjustifiable. I hope, however, that Government members will adopt a more realistic approach to this matter. At the time, I was preoccupied with the principle involved rather than vvith the correct terminology to describe particular types of pensions. I appreciate fully that the term "" service pension "" applies to a pension which is granted to ex-servicemen on their attaining the age of 60 years. That would be five years before ex-servicemen became eligible for an age pension. ""When referring to this matter, I intended that my remarks should apply to ex-servicemen generally. The first point I emphasize is that the proposed pension rates for totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen, who are most deserving of consideration, should be increased. Those pensioners should receive at least the 10 per cent, increase in pension rates which is to be given to other classes of pensioners. Only a 5 per cent, increase is proposed in the bill under debate. The proposal that this deserving body of pensioners should be treated less generously than other sections of pensioners is wholly indefensible, i emphasize, also, that, although an ex-serviceman may be classified as totally and permanently incapacitated, he has no assurance that his pension wili be permanent. On this subject. I have received the following letter from an ex-serviceman who states that:. . . the worry and uncertainty of losing the Totally and Permanently Incapacitated Pension through one of these compulsory examinations still applies and I would hc grateful if you could ventilate this. It is a sword of Damocles perpetually poised nver one's head, and makes one fear thatsliould one be actually a bit better on the day one is examined, the pension will go. This' actually happened to me twice when I was on the ordinary pension. I was reduced from £4 4s. pcr fortnight to 20s. 3d., and only recovered the full amount upon appeal. So you wil l appreciate that my fear is not ground. We can assume that an ex-serviceman is not classified as totally and permanently incapacitated while there remains a lingering doubt about his chances of recovery. Therefore, there should not be any doubt about the permanency of his pension. Also, we should remember that worry about matters such as this may make a bad condition very much worse. An increase of strain on the heart, or an increase of blood pressure may be fatal to a patient. I urge the Minister to have this matter examined again with a view to ensuring that an ex-serviceman who is classified as totally and permanently incapacitated shall not be in danger of losing his pension completely or of suffering a. reduction of it. I do not suggest that a blinded soldier who regains his eyesight is in this category. Obviously, if a disability is removed, the entitlement to a pension no longer exists. I am referring particularly to patients suffering from heart disease, blood pressure, or spinal disablement. Once an ex-serviceman in this category is classified as totally and permanently incapacitated, his pension should be secure for the rest of his life. I draw attention to the fact that, in relation to the basic wage, the present 100 per cent, pension payable to a serviceman is 17^ per cent, less than it was fourteen years ago. The scale should be revised to ensure that the pension shall be increased at least by that 17-J per cent, to restore its former relationship to the basic wage. The point to be remembered is that a soldier's pension should always be regarded as compensation rather than as an economic unit. This question has been debated in this House on several occasions. Opposition members have endeavoured to induce the Government not to regard a soldier's pension exceeding £1 a week as income for the purposes of the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Act. Certain superannuation payments of up to £2 a week are not regarded as income, and I contend that a similar concession should be granted in respect of soldiers' pensions. At the very least, an ex-serviceman should be treated as well as any other member of the community. without In fact, he should be treated better, because the service that he rendered in time of war made possible the continuance of emoluments to all sections of the community. However, if we cannot secure better treatment for ex-servicemen, we insist upon equal treatment at least. Again I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to this matter. Another Minister has said that it is not possible for him to amend legislation in this chamber. I have every confidence that the Minister for Repatriation, who has a propensity for sticking to something that he starts, will succeed where his colleague has failed. I come now to widows' pensions. I have said on former occasions, and I repeat now, that these pensions present a social problem so full of complexities that the whole matter should be submitted to an all-party parliamentary committee, with a view to the removal of the anomalies that have become apparent. I am sure that it is the wish of the Minister that war widows and their familiesI stress the word "" families ""-should not be at a disadvantage compared with other people in the community, because their husband, father, and breadwinner lost his life in the service of this country. The schedule of war widows' pensions is a formidable document and, at first glance, one might be inclined to ask, "" What is there to complain .about ?"", but a close study reveals many inconsistencies. I spoke with several war widows yesterday, and while stressing the difficulty of adequately stating their case in a few minutes, they said that the whole schedule required reconstruction. They urged that we should divorce from our minds the idea that a war.widow could supplement her pension substantially by her earnings. Everybody should know that a widow with two, three or more children has no time to earn money. In relation to both the widow's pension, and that payable to totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen, I point out that the basic wage is to be increased soon by 3s. a week. Will that increase be reflected in those pensions? That is an aspect of this matter to which more consideration should be given. Increases of the basic wage are granted to offset increased costs of living. Surely there is every justification for granting similar increases to pensioners. TJnder the new proposals, a widow with three children will receive £5 2s. 6d. a week, plus child endowment of £1 a week, making a total of £6 2s. a week. If the husband and father were alive, it is most unlikely that he would Mr Bowden. be earning less than £6 2s. 6d. a week, because that is approximately the basic wage, and few workers today earn only the basic wage. In all probability the breadwinner of the family would be earning £7, £8 or £9 a week. In addition, of course, the family would be receiving child endowment. Therefore, if the Government considers that that family requires a basic wage of £6 2s. 6d. a week, plus child endowment of £1, why not continue to make that payment in the absence of the breadwinner? Since I spoke on Eriday last, I have received several letters on this subject. Naturally a good speech brings some response. One letter from a war widow describes what appears to be unwarranted discrimination between widows of World War I . , and those of World War II . The letter points out that the widow of World War I . suffers the disadvantage of being considerably older than the average widow of World War II . Attention is also drawn to the fact that a widow of World War II . may choose her own doctor, receive medical attention at such places as - Yaralla Hospital, .receive legal aid, be assisted to learn some occupation which will be of assistance to her in supplement her pension, or obtain a grant for home furnishing. The writer of the letter refers in those words to the widow of World War II . She goes on to say that the World War I . widow must rely on a lodge for medical attention.",21
50,Mr BARNARD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,We are adjusting all that.,23
51,Mr BOWDEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Widow s of World War I . have not the privilege of entering military hospitals as patients, and they have no legal aid benefits.",23

53,Mr BOWDEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,They are not adjusted in this bill.,23
54,Mr BARNARD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,Most of them are.,23
55,Mr BOWDEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Then I am very pleased to hear it. It appeared to me that there was an unwarranted dis6d. crimination between the widows of the two world wars, and the fact that that discrimination has operated up to now certainly has not been warranted.",23
56,Mr BARNARD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,I am not responsible for. that.,24
57,Mr BOWDEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I hope that the Min1914-18 ister will give some attention to the clearing up of the anomalies pointed out by honourable members of the Opposition, who are ever on the alert to ensure justice shall be given to the community, and more particularly to the more deserving sections of it, the war widows and other pensioners.",24
58,Mr THOMPSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Hindmarsh) [4.11]. sioner - We must consider whether service penage sions, and particularly war widows' pensions, should be governed of the individual or simply iby the fact that the recipients are war widows or other pensioners. I was pleased to the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Bowden) this afternoon correct a that statement that he made on Eriday repeople garding a means test for recipients service pensions. I was very concerned on Eriday, when the honourable memgetting. ber appeared to be giving the country to understand that an innovation was being introduced regarding gibility for service pensions. I was amazed when he made the stateinadequacy ment to which I refer as, about ten years ago, during the term of office of Labour government, a man told me that he could obtain a pension that was equal to the age pension, at that about f l a week, and that in addition he would be able to earn 25s. a week12s. 6d. on his own behalf and on his wife's-withou t his pension affected. When the honourable member for Gippsland made his statement Friday I felt that he must have been under a misapprehension. He has stated today that he made his statement error, and I hope that those who may have read or heard his statement on Friday will become aware that it was made in error. We must appreciate that a service pension is not a pension given disabilities in the general sense. When a person applies for a general pension is necessary that the medical officers examine applicants must be satisfied his or her disabilities are due to service before the pension can be granted. The Government agreed about ten years ago that a man who had served in the war would, as he grew older, show the effects of that war in a reduced expectation of life and in a diminution of his ability to perform work that he that would otherwise have been capable of performing, and it was therefore decided that if men served in certain areas where war operations took place they would be entitled to receive, at the age of 60, the same rate of pension as the ordinary penwould be entitled to receive at the of 65. I believe that that is the origin of what is commonly known as the by the needs "" burnt-out"" pension. A number of references have been made during this debate to the adequacy hear of the pensions. I believe that the honourable members opposite will agree no matter who they are, are never satisfied with of the amount they are receiving. They always desire more than they are already We in Parliament have even been challenged because we considered ourselves worth more I, .an we were elireceiving in emoluments. Numerous instances have been cited to show the of the amount of pension received. If we take the war widow's an antipension as an example, I think we will have an illustration of how then difficult it is for any Minister, or time any government, to arrive at a rate of pension that can be considered as equitable. All the arguments put for12s. 6d. ward on behalf of war widows being and widows with children are arguments against bringing any means on test into operation with respect to the granting of these pensions. The honourable member for Gippsland, when in he spoke under a misapprehension on Friday, argued that a means test should not be brought intc operation in relation to service pensions. I agree that in anything the Minister does with regard to general pensions he must not make provifor war sion for a means test. Many war widows are young women it who married only shortly before their who husbands went overseas to fight, and to that die. Many of these women remained war after marriage in the occupations in which they had worked when single, and did not set up a home for themselves, but continued to live with their parents. We cannot compare the position of such war widows with that of a war widow with three or four children. When the Government assesses the war widow's pension it must either make a very big amount of money available to people who, from an economic point of view, really do not need it, or penalize some who are suffering real hardship. I contend that the Minister has endeavoured to meet that position. In the scale set out increases have been given to war widows with children, and provision has been made for their education. In many cases a widow with children is receiving an amount equal to that which she would have been receiving if her husband were still alive. I know many such instances. Many people appear to believe that the Minister for Eepatriation (Mr. Barnard) does not appreciate the position of service pensioners, but he does, there is one in his own family. A member of my family is also in receipt of a general war pension. I have personal knowledge of the difficulties of family men who were partially incapacitated during World War I . I am concerned about how we ean alleviate the distress of those who are suffering real hardship without substantially increasing the pensions of many other people who are not in need of such increases. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Bowden) said that a war widow with three children would receive a pension of £5 2s. 6d. a week plus £1 a week child endowment payments, making a total weekly income of £6 2s. 6d. If her husband were alive and at work, his expenses in connection with fares, wear and tear of clothing and food would not be less than 37s. 6d. a week. That is possibly an underestimate. Therefore, if the widow with one child received a pension of £5 2s. 6d. a week, and no child endowment, her total weekly income would be the equivalent of £7 to a woman with a husband and one child. Many men who are working today do hot receive £7 a week. It is easy to say that the basic wage is £5 16s. a week and that a man may supplement it in various ways.",24
59,Mr BOWDEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,The basic wage now is £6 a week. Mr Thompson.,25
60,Mr THOMPSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Assumin g it to be £6 a week, which I think is a trifle in excess of the exact figure",25
61,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,The basic wage for New South Wales is now £6 2s. a week.,25
62,Mr THOMPSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"It varies almost from day to day. Whatever the figure may be, many men do not receive more - than the basic wage. I am attempting to show that it is difiicult to compare the weekly income of a widow with three children with the amount of money that might have come into the home if her husband had not been killed. My opinion is that the widows of men who were killed in the war and men who were incapacitated in the course of their war service are entitled to a standard of living that is equal to that of the ordinary citizen. The general rate of war pension for 100 per cent, incapacity was £2 2s. a week prior to the as Labour Government taking office in 1941, and it has now been increased to £2 15s. a week. There is an allowance of £1 4s. a week for a wife and 9s. a week for the first child. A man who has been assessed as suffering from a 100 per cent, incapacity will, if he has a wife and one child, draw a pension of £4 8s. a week, and, in addition, be entitled to receive what he can earn. Many such men are receiving full wages in addition to their pensions. A war pension is, as the honourable member for Gippsland said, really a compensation for war injuries. A member who has been blinded, or is totally or permanently incapacitated, or who is seriously incapacitated from tuberculosis, is entitled to a pension of £5 6s. a week. That is not an unreasonable amount for a single man.",25
63,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,The increase in that case is only 5 per cent. All the other pensions have been increased by 10 per cent.,25
64,Mr THOMPSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I shall deal with that aspect of the matter later. Such a man, if he be married is also entitled to an allowance of £1 4s. a week in respect of his wife and 9s. a week in respect of a child. A married man with a wife and one child would, therefore, draw £6 19s. a week. In addition, he is entitled to free medical benefits, which a man in ordinary employment has to provide for himself. When the position of such a pensioner is compared with that of a man in receipt of the basic wage, and who has a wife and one child, for which he receives no child endowment payments, it is seen that the plight of the pensioner is not so deplorable as honourable members opposite have suggested.",25
65,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Such a man and his wife are worse off than a married couple who are drawing age pensions, for which they qualify merely by reason of their age.",26
66,Mr THOMPSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,The age pensioners would receive £4 5s. a week between them at the new rate.,26
67,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,Plu s what they can earn. Totally incapacitated men cannot earn anything.,26
68,Mr THOMPSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"As a rule, an age pensioner is not able to earn much. The maximum that he may earn without affecting his pension is £3 a week. A war pensioner, however, may earn an unlimited amount without affecting his pension. There again, we shall fall into a trap if we try to compare one section of the community with another.",26
69,Mr BOWDEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,My view is that it is not possible to place a monetary value upon health.,26
70,Mr THOMPSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"The invalid pension does so. Recently I received a copy of a circular letter in which it was stated that disabled ex-servicemen should be paid pensions that are commensurate with their earnings before the war. If that were done, the pension payable to one ex-captain might be lower than that payable to another ex-captain, because their pre-war earnings were different. Such a system would entail asking every applicant for a pension what his income was before the war and assessing his pension upon that basis. That system would earn the condemnation of the whole of the community.",26
71,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,The First Schedule to the bill provides that the pension payable to the widow of a member of the forces shall be based upon the rate of pay of the member at the time of his death.,26
72,Mr THOMPSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"That will not mean that an applicant for a pension must appear before a tribunal and prove what the man was earning before he joined the forces. The honourable member for Gippsland has claimed that the pension should be paid to ex-service personnel as a compensation for war service and not on an economic basis. In that event, it is illogical to argue that the pension should be adjusted to meet, in full, variations of the cost of living. I shall not labour the matter further, because the Minister has thoroughly considered it. Many organizations concerned with the welfare of war widows, ex-service personnel and their dependants have forwarded to him their representations as to what they consider should be done. I have discussed the subject personally with the Minister and placed my views before him. He has fully considered all those representations and endeavoured to do the best he possibly can while, at the same time, dealing with the problem in a realistic way on the basis that war pensions are not founded on the pensioner's needs but as a recognition of war service and incapacity due to war service. Unless honourable members opposite are prepared to advocate the application of the means test to applicants for war pensions it is useless for them to base their arguments upon cases of individual hardship. I oppose the application of the means test to these pensions in any way whatsoever. I accept the principle that they are equitable payments, bearing in mind the needs of other sections of the community who depend upon social service benefits, and that they are made available to ex-service personnel until their demise. I oppose the amendment moved by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr. White) which, if adopted, would delay these increases being made available to pensioners.",26
73,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"If the Government accepts the amendment, the Opposition will allow the bill to pass immediately.",26
74,Mr THOMPSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"But the amendment proposes that the bill be withdrawn. Therefore, the honourable membeT is inconsistent. The Government desires that the bill be implemented as soon as possible with a view to these increases being made available to pensioners by next pension day. The honourable member's amendment appears to me to be rather humorous because, in effect, it proposes that a committee consisting of private members should determine the expenditure by the Government in this matter.",26
75,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,This is exactly what the Government itself did in 1943.,27
76,Mr THOMPSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"The committee appointed in 1943 made certain recommendations dealing not only with the rates of pensions but also with other matters. I prefer that the measure be implemented at the earliest possible moment. Therefore, I support it. It r . FRANCIS (Moreton) [4.35] - I am amazed at the lack of knowledge displayed by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Thompson) concerning the report of the all-party committee which was appointed in 1943 to examine the Australian Soldiers' Eepatriation Act. He said that the recommendations made by that committee did not relate to the rates of pension, whereas, in fact, they included an all-round increase of 20 per cent. That recommendation was accepted by the Government. That committee, which was composed of three members of the ministerial party and three members of the Opposition parties, concluded its deliberations in record time. The House will be merely wasting its time if it pays any attention to the fallacious statements made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh. The report of the committee appointed in 1943 is still available, and I shall be happy supply him with a copy of it if he cannot obtain one from the Clerk. The members of that committee were the present Minister for Commerce and  Lamp, Senator Allan MACDonald, the late Senator Collett, the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr. Watkins) and myself. Having been privileged to serve as a member of that committee, I can speak authoritatively on this matter. The Government's present proposals, which we are told are designed to help ex-service personnel and their dependants as well as war widows and orphans to meet the increased cost of living, are most niggardly. They have already brought down upon the Government's head the condemnation of every section of the community. These proposals are parsimonious. No section of the community . deserves greater consideration and assistance than those men and women of the armed forces who served in two world wars. Is this the best that the Government can do in recognition of the sacrifices they made in saving not only this country but also other countries and civilization as a whole? The Government's maladministration and extravagance in one hundred and one ways have contributed to the present high cost of living. Although the Government announced that it proposed to increase pensions by 10 per cent., the increase now proposed in respect of pensions for totally and permanently incapacitated ex-service personnel is only 5 per cent. I shall be interested to hear what explanation the Minister for Eepatriation (Mr Barnard) has to offer for that fact which can be amply proved by figures available to all honourable members. The Minister should not sit so complacently at the table and with such a self-satisfied look when these proposals do not, in fact, give to pensioners the assistance which the Government professed it would give to them. I repeat that these proposals are niggardly and totally inadequate to meet the needs of these classes of pensioners. I emphasize that the increase of pension proposed in respect of totally and permanently incapacitated ex-service personnel is only 5 per cent. The proposals generally will not nearly meet the increase of the cost to of Jiving which has represented considerably more than 10 per cent, since the war ended. I regard the proposals as hopelessly inadequate and I condemn the Government for being so inconsiderate of the needs of disabled ex-service men and women. Accordingly, I heartily support the amendment that the bill be withdrawn and referred to a parliamentary select committee of ex-eervicemen appointed to inquire into and report upon the present repatriation pension rates with a view to better adjusting these rates to present living costs. That was the effect of the recommendation of the No. 1 War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal. The recommendation of the tribunal readsThe tribunal recommends that a general inquiry into the administration of the Repatriation Act, including an investigation into the matters raised in this Eeport, be conducted by a competent authority having no association with the Bepatriation Department. Mr WHlTE-^That was the recommenWaf dation Of a tribunal which was estabFrom lished as part of the Bepatriation Deseries partment.",27
77,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I do not say that i is part of the Repatriation Department, but it is certainly a part of the organizathe tion of that department which was estabare' lished for the purpose of hearing appeals against the rejection of claims for pensions by the department. An applicent cant for a war pension first submits his claim to the State branch of the Repatnounced riation Department. If it be rejected, may appeal to the Repatriation Commisservicemen, w'ho gave ef their best when sion and if he is not satisfied with the decision of the commission he may appeal to the Entitlement Tribunal. The No. 1 Tribunal has denounced the Minister and the policy of this Qovernment more trenchantly and scathingly than has other tribunal or instrumentality"" history of this Commonwealth. Its rebnt port amply supports the amendment befof-e moved by the honourable member for Balaclava.

Delegates from all States indicated a nationwide resentment expressed at 1948 State Conferences of the League, that succeeding Commonwealth Governments had failed to show a true appreciation of the unanswerable claims of a section of the oommunity apparently foi gotten by the Government. ihis attitude can only be interpreted as a complete negation of the promises made when those who are now incapacitated as a result of wnr service were in uniform. The general public will be astounded to learn that a comparison of increases in war pensions with the basic wage shows that whereas in the last 25 years the basic wage has increased by 40 per cent., the pension rate for war disabled ex-servicemen has only increased by 19 per cent. For over 20 years up to 1043 no increase was made in the pensiou rate, whilst the basic wage has increased by over 20 per cent., but the war pension has remained --tntiunary. It is pointed out that the basic wage is fixed by a judicial body after a scientific inquiry which considers the purchasing power of the £1. As war pensioners, too, have to bear the increased living costs, the RSL. asserts that inuruases enjoyed by other sections of the community should, likewise, be grunted to this most deserving class, to whom the nation owes its very existence. This letter and otlier letters wliicli I have received on this subject show the utter dissatisfaction of ex-servicemen generally with the Government's niggardly proposal. The Minister for Eepatriation (Mr Barnard) sits in the House in selfsatisfied complacency. He should hang his head in shame. He cannot mention one factor which would justify this niggardly proposal. The Australian Legion of Ex-service Men and Women has pointed out that in 1920 the federal basic wage was £3 17s. a week. In that year, the totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen's pension rate was fixed at £4 a week, representing 104 per cent, of the basic wage. To-day the federal basic wage is £5 13s. a week, but the proposed rate of pension is £5 6s. a week, which represents only 94 per cent, of the basic wage. In order merely to maintain parity with the 1920 standard, the new rate of pension should be approximately £5 17s. a week. Will the Minister explain why this substantial reduction of the value of the pension paid to totally and permanently incapacitated ox-servicemen has been allowed to occur? How can he be satisfied? No other section of the community has a greater ifr. Francis. claim upon our sympathy than this group of pensioners. Such men are not able to earn income for themselves because of their complete incapacity. These needy citizens should receive much more than the 5 per cent, increase which the Government proposes to give to them, notwithstanding the Prime Minister's statement in his budget speech that pensions would be increased by 10 per cent. The Government has been dishonest in its statements. I do not know whether the Minister for Eepatriation has made a serious mistake or has deliberately provided for this inadequate increase. He should explain why the Government is discriminating against this one class of people who cannot help themselves. These men suffer day and night as the result of the services which they rendered to their country, yet this Government shows its regard for them by .reducing the standard of their pension to less than that of 1920, although the Legion of Ex-service Men and Women claims that the original rate of pension, representing 104 per cent, of the basic wage, was inadequate in any case! I shall now deal with war pensions generally. In 1920, the 100 per cent, rate of war pension was fixed at £2 a week, representing 54 per cent, of the federal basic wage. To-day, the 100 per cent, rate is only £2 10s. a week, representing only 44 per cent, of the basic wage. What is the Minister's explanation of that? The proposed 5 per cent, increase will bring the 100 per cent, rate of pension to less than 49 per cent, of the present basic wage. In order to maintain parity with the rate fixed in 1920, the pension today should be £3 2s. a week. I was a member of the parliamentary committee which recommended in 1943 that the pension rate should be increased. That committee compared the situation which existed in 1942 with that which existed in 1920, when war pensions were introduced. In 1920, the "" C "" series price index for the six State capital cities was 1,166. B y June, 1942, it had decreased by 85 points to 1,081. Nevertheless the committee recommended, from its general knowledge of conditions and in the light of all factors affecting livin g costs, that the rate of pension should be increased by 20 per cent. That recommendation was adopted by the goquires ' vernment of the day. The committee stated in its reportTlie Cominittee found that there waa reasonnow able ground for a general increase of the rates of war pension. An outstanding factor in regard was the comparison of rates of pay to members of the Forces and allowances to week. their dependants with the same items in respect of the 1914 war. tt considered that the relationship between allotments made to dependants of servicemen in World War I . and World War II . respectively justified an increase of the pension rate by 20 per cent, spite of the fact that the "" C "" series index had dropped by 85 points between the two wars. The report addedThe Committee considers that it would reasonable to approve of a general increase of 20 per cent. . . . Since that report was made, the "" C "" aeries index level has risen by approximendations mately 18 per cent. The basic wage payable in capital cities has increased 22 per cent. In the light of the greatly changed circumstances since the date that committee's investigation, the vernment should provide for a much more substantial increase than is contemplated. The longer one examines this bill, more one is convinced that its provisions are niggardly and parsimonious. I with this statement in a recent issue Smith's WeeklyTo hundreds of sick and wounded servicemen who, in the battle against poverty, have to drag their aching and mutilated to work,"" this "" five bob"" insult is a ing humiliation. That reflects the opinion of all intellimen gent people who have considered this matter. I ask the Minister to re-examine his proposals with a view to prevailing upon the Government to do something discerned worthwhile for service pensioners by fixing a rate of pension more in keeping with the basic wage and the general cost dependants. of living than is the proposed rate, which is hopelessly inadequate and has no relaon tion to increased costs. The last report furnished to the Parliament by No. War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal is a severe indictment of the Minister - and his department; so much so, in fact, that the Minispatriation ter kept the 'report from the Parliaout ment for a long time. His action was unworthy and improper. The law retrated that such reports be tabled in this House, but the Minister hung on to this report from the end of June until",28

81,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"It would not be difficult to find out from the members of the committee when the report was sent in in. The report which I have before me is for the period from the lst July, 1947, to the 28th February, 1948. Why has that report not been placed before us bc until now? I can tell honourable members the reason. It is because the report is itself an indictment of the Minister's inefficiency and futility. The recomof the committee on the subject of onus of proof have been ignored. by The report of the tribunal, the members of which are Messrs. G. J. O'Sullivan, of E. J. Dibdin and M . A. Hickey-al l of Gothem ex-servicemen who have given long and faithful service-state d that the purport of section 47 of the Australian the Soldiers' Repatriation Act was not fully appreciated by the Repatriaagree tion Commission. If it had been, a of considerable number of claims would have been allowed by the commission, exand there would have been no need to appeal to the tribunal. Thus, the Minisbodies ter and the department, by not applying crownthe provisions of the act, have caused much delay and suffering to ex-serviceand their dependants. The Minister ought to be ashamed of himself. I quote the following from the reportNot only has no improvement since benn but the position has deteriorater! and is adversely affecting widows, sick and wounded ex-members of the forces and their Obviously, the Minister has fallen down his job. He has denied justice to sick and disabled servicemen, and to the 1 widows and orphans of servicemen, and has made it necessary to carry appeals to the entitlement tribunal when pensions should have been granted by the ReCommission. That was pointed to the Minister last year, but the same form of injustice has been perperight throughout this year, and the tribunal found it necessary to emphasize that the position is deteriorating. The report statesThe provisions of Section 47 may be summarized as follows:(1) The Repatriation Commission, a Repatriation Board and a Tribunal shall(a) act according to substantial (6) give to the claimant the bene(o) draw all reasonable inferences (2) It shall not be necessary for the claimant to furnish proof to support his claim; (3) The onus of proving the claim to be outside the provisions of the Act shall lie ou the Repatriation Board and the Repatriation Commission.

This ex-member of the R.A.N.V.R. served with distinction for over four years. He was engaged on special duties behind the Japanese lines in New Guinea from, A p r i l. 1942, to August, 1943, and was evacuated by submarine in an emaciated and starving condition. In December, 1943, he again went into enemyoccupied territory and was evacuated with pneumonia in February, 1944. In November, 1944, he re-entered enemy-occupied territory mid organized a guerrilla force, returning to allied territory in May, 1945. Ho was awarded the British Distinguished Service Cross and the United States Distinguished Service Cross. During his service he had suffered from decayed teeth nnd defective vision. He appealed to this Tribunal for Defective Vision, ""Loss of Teeth"", and stated his grounds of appeal to beDefective Vision-""That it was aggravated by eye-strain, starvation, privations and nervous strain caused by work done for the allied cause."" Loss of Teeth- "" That it was due to bad food, ill health and lack of dental justice and the merits of the attention."" case and ehall not be bound On discharge from the Navy he had claimed . . . defective eyesight and teeth - by technicalities or legal and the lack of them, caused by three years' forms or rules of evidence: service in enemy-occupied territory, probably malnutrition (definite cause unknown). . . . f it of any doubt; There was no evidence of a prior to enlistment condition affecting his teeth. The dental in favour of the claimant. condition, therefore, was an occurrence on service which should have been accepted on first application. As to his vision, whilst he stated he had worn glasses prior to enlistment, there was no evidence of the extent of his prior to enlistment incapacity; nor was there evidence to negative the man's own clear statements that his onerous service had seriously aggravated the condition. On discharge, unaided by glasses, he wus blind in one eye and had a defect in the other eye. The Repatriation Board and the Repatriation Commission rejected both claims without comment. The Tribunal upheld the appeal for both conditions. This gallant ex-serviceman was greatly upset by the initial rejection of his claims, which on the evidence should have been accepted when he first applied. (2) L.A.C. , RAAF. (file RX.102569 -193 9 W a r ) . The ex-member appealed to the Tribunal for acceptance of Anxiety Neurosis. His Grounds of Appeal were that his Anxiety Neurosis was associated with injuries received by liim on service. withdraw my During service the appellant had received injuries including a fracture of the upper spine. He spent over ten months in plaster jacket, and was then discharged permanently medically unfit. The Repatriation Board accepted "" in j u r y to neck"" as attributable to service and granted him a pension. He continued to receive hospital treatment after discharge, and during this period complained of "" feeling very j u m p y in so m n i a , ueckpains, headaches and difficulty in swallowing. He was given sedatives to relieve his pain. Two years after discharge he was diagnosed as suffering from Anxiety Neurosis. Hie applied for acceptance of this condition but was rejected by the Repatriation State Board, a Repatriation medical officer having certified that his anxiety neurosis was due to ""post war stress of life "". His wife, alarmed at the deterioration in his mental condition, visited the Repatriation Hospital and stated that "" something will have to be done for him before he gets worse "". He was then examined by a Repatriation Psychiatrist who noted his history and expressed the following opinion : "" This' patient appears to have au anxiety state which has followed on his neck injury-no w losing weight and insomnia "". He appealed to the Repatriation Commission, but the Commission rejected his appeal without comment, despite the evidence of the Commission's own expert witness that the Anxiety State had followed on the neck injur y which was attributable to service. Hc then appealed to this Tribunal. His appeal was upheld. (3) Sergeant , RAAF. (file RX.G1993 -193 9 W a r ) . This ex-member of the RAAF. served for four years in Europe and was, therefore, eligible for the acceptance of any illness occurring on service. He appealed to. this Tribunal for the acceptance of a stomach condition which he did not have prior to enlistment. At a medical examination before discharge, after serving for over five years, he complained of "" vomiting and burning below throat"". He repeated this complaint at the Final Medical Board immediately before his discharge. Within four months of discharge he claimed the disability of "" nervous condition affecting the stomach and throat accompanied by fever"", and referred to the fact that "" these complaints were all mentioned at Final Board "". He was investigated, aud the disability was diagnosed as Hyperchlorhydria (an excessive secretion of acid in the stomach). A Repatriation medical officer, in answer to a formal question whether the disability resulted fro m an occurrence happening on service, stated "" No "" , despite the plain evidence to the contrary in the records. The Repatriation Commission then rejected the claim without comment. Clearly this disability was an occurrence on service. Claims such as this should be accepted at first application. The Tribunal allowed the appeal. (4) Private (file RX.7812). This ex-member served in the 1914-1918 war and also in the Middle East in the 1939 war. He appealed to the Tribunal for the acceptance of a stomach condition. The Repatriation Board had accepted Anxiety Neurosis and Hypertension (High Blood Pressure) as due to war service in the 1939 war and the member was being pensioned for these conditions. Subsequently the ex-soldier claimed for the acceptance of Duodenal Ulcer. On being examined by the Repatriation Local Medical Officer his complaint was diagnosed as Gastric Neurosis? Peptic Ulcer. Later the diagnosis was amended to Functional Dyspepsia and a Repatriation medical officer certified the cause to be ""psychogenic"" (of psychic or mental origin), "" post-war development no record on service"", and negatived any contribution or aggravation by war service. The Repatriation Commission then rejected the claim. No advertence was made to the fact that the one psychic or mental factor in evidence in this case was Anxiety Neurosis. which had already been accepted by the Repatriation Board as due to war service. Clearly, therefore, oti the evidence of the Commission's own witness, the stomach condition claimed was also due to war service. The Tribunal allowed the appeal. No controversial or difficult questions either of law or fact, which could justif y the original rejection of the claims, arose in any one of these cases. They were simple and straightforward, and, on the evidence before the Commission, fell fairly within the entitlement provisions of the Act. But they were rejected out of hand by the Repatriation Commission without auy reasons being assigned. An intelligent marshalling of the facts, and a proper application of the relevant provisions of the Act to those facts in the first instance would have obviated the necessity for any appeal. The report states that the question of onus of proof had been a matter of conflict between the tribunal and the Minister for a long time. It was submitted to - the Attorney-General for his opinion, and stated emphatically that the Eepatriation Department was wrong, and the tribunal was right.",31
87,Mr BARNARD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,It took the Attorney General's Department four years to say it.,32
88,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"The question, as I have said, was referred to the Attorney General's Department and, after a long delay, the following interpretation was received over the signature of the Attorney-General:I refer to your memorandum of 23rd March, 1944, No. G/907, in which a question is raised as to whether ihe Appeal Tribunal under the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act is bound by all the provisions of section 47 (2) of, that act. I desire to inform you that wit h reference to the objection taken by Mr O'Sullivan, Chairman of the War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal, to a statement in the Commission's annual report to Parliament for the year ended 30th June, 1943, I am directed by the Attorney-General to inform you that the Attorney-General agrees entirely with the views expressed by Mr O'Sullivan. It is evident that the entitlement tribunal has been trying to serve the interests of ex-servicemen, but the Repatriation Commission and the Minister have been standing in the way. The Attorney-General's Department, which is the correct authority to express an opinion, declared that the chairman of the tribunal, Mr O'Sullivan, was right. Thus, it becomes evident that, not only are the pension rates inadequate, but also that many persons who were entitled to pensions have for a long time been prevented by the Minister from getting them. There are deserving ex-service personnel who have been denied pensions altogether. In some instances appellants have died before their appeals have been resolved. This is one of the saddest aspects of this matter. The tribunal recommended that there should be set up an independent body with power to examine all instances of delay, the unsatisfactory manner in which these matters have been handled, and the administration of the Repatriation Department generally. It further recommended that the investigation should be conducted by a competent authority having no association with the department. I contend, therefore, that a royal commission should be appointed immediately to inquire full y into this subject-matter. I cannot recall ever before having heard of a recommendation being submitted by a branch of a department for an investigation into the administration of the entire department because it had fallen down hopelessly on its job. I emphasize that, although the Government professes in the present proposals to grant increases of 10 per cent, in the pensions to ex-servicemen, totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen will get an increase of only 5 per cent, under the terms of this bill. The Government has made no satisfactory explanation in this connection. A letter from the Chairman, No. 1 ""War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal to the Chairman, Repatriation Commission, dated the 2Sth February, 1948, included the following:4. At yesterday's conference, time permit discussion of every phase of matter, but two major points were stressed(1) Inaccuracies in the prepared summaries of appellants' service medical history, forwarded to Tribunal by your Commission the purpose of an appeal; and inadequacy of these records clearly to demonstrate to the appellant, and to this Tribunal, the reasons your Commission for rejecting war pension claim. That was a denunciation of the commisDepartment. sion. That letter says clearly that the medical history sheets to be placed before the tribunal were inefficiently and inadeassociation itr. Francis. quately prepared, with the result that the commission rejected the applications for pensions. The commission's obvious lack of understanding of its fundamental responsibilities is distressing. The letter continues5. With regard to (1) above we emphasized that no attempt was being made by the Bepatriation Commission to assist either the appellant or the Tribunal by properly present*ing the Commission's case-eve n in documentary form; that no statement of the case on which the Commission relied to justify its refusal of a pension and to discharge its <mu> wae ever prepared. Have honourable members ever before heard of such inefficiency? Obviously, there was room for much improvement in the preparation of documentary evidence. Such an unsatisfactory state of affairs militated unfairly against the incapacitated ex-servicemen appellants to the t r i bunal. The facts I have cited are a complete denunciation bf the Minister and the Repatriation Department. The letter continues0. We pointed out in particular that appeals were not being presented at all at the hearing by any person on behalf of your Commission. This proves conclusively that the department is not carrying out the provisions of the act. If the Minister has any sense of responsibility *>e should make sure that any further delay in dealing with these matters is obviated, and he should see that the allegations and charges which have been levelled against the Repatriation Department are investigated. I contend that the Minister, having had this report in his possession for some time, should have stated in this House long ago that he viewed very seriously the complaints that had been made. He should did not also have assured the House that he this would take certain steps to overcome delay in dealing with appeals. It must and be remembered that the allegations conthc tained in this report were borne out by for the opinion of the Attorney-General. In the view of all these circumstances and the fact that this report has been withheld for of such a lengthy period, I repeat that this a must be regarded as a complete denunciation of the Minister and the Repatriation I regret that this is so, because members of the Opposition have, of necessity, to live with, and to work in with, Ministers. I should much prefer to be able to say that I appreciate the difficulty of the problems chat the Minister has had to meet, and that he has done his utmost. However, on behalf of ex-servicemen in this country, I consider that I would be recreant to my duty if I did not suggest to the Parliament that this is a matter which calls for prompt and complete action. This report recommends that an independent committee should be appointed to investigate immediately the allegations contained in the report of the No. 1 Tribunal, because the department has fallen down on its job. That report shows clearly that many ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen in this country, in addition to widows and orphans, have not received pensions hecause of the maladministration of the department. Can honourable members imagine any more serious charge which could be made against any department or Minister? I point out to honourable members that very competent men comprised the No. 1 Tribunal. I know Mr Dibdin very well. He was a fine soldier. I saw him whilst on service and I know that he was held in high esteem by his comrades. He was the State secretary of the Returned Sailors, Soldiei's and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia in Queensland, where he did such a splendid job that he was ultimately appointed as federal secretary of that organization. Following his outstanding work in that capacity, he was appointed to represent the combined ex-servicemen of Australia on this tribunal. That man's word cannot be challenged. His is a lifelong record of service.",32
89,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,What happened to him?,34
90,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Because he had the courage of his convictions and pointed out in the report last year the injustices that this Government was perpetrating on ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen in this country, and also because he repeated thope charges in the terms I have stated today, he was peremptorily sacked, despite the fact that the Attorney-General had endorsed his opinion of the maladministration of the Eepatriation Department. I point out that Mr Dibdin has handled these matters for many years, yet because of his straightforward efforts when standing up for the rights of ex-service men and women, he has been deprived of his job. This is a scandal and the Minister has a lot to answer for to the people of this country.",34
91,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,The honourable member's time has expired.,34
92,Sir EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Cowper) [5.20] I support, the amendment moved by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr. White) for two reasons. The first is that there has been a revolutionary change in the economic condition of Australia in the five years since the Australian Soldiers' Eepatriation Act was last substantially revised, and another comprehensive review of the whole position should be made. The second reason is that, in my opinion, in view of the recommendation of No. 1 War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal that a general inquiry should be made into the administration of the act, including the matters raised in the report of the tribunal, by a competent authority which has no association with the Eepatriation Department, the time has come to examine thoroughly the question whether ex-servicemen are receiving the substantial justice which all honourable members wish them to enjoy. In view of the non-party consideration that has been given to the repatriation legislation since it was first introduced, I urge the Minister to accept the amendment or, alternatively, to make a suggestion of his own which would enable the same result to be achieved. I recall that in the 1920's when the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) was Prime Minister, one night when the House was debating a repatriation measure, a small sub-committee representing all parties met in an endeavour to find some word which, when inserted in the act, would place the onus of proof upon the Eepatriation Commission instead of upon ex-servicemen. The object was to make certain that no technicality would prevent an ex-serviceman from establishing that his disability was due entirely to his war service. I remember that the then Solicitor-General, now Sir Eobert Garran, finally hit upon the word "" substantial "" which, although wide, and difficult to define, was accepted because it was felt that it - vvould enable the act to be administered in such a way that the wishes of honourable members generally would be given effect. The measure was passed, and the pensions were fixed on what was thought, at that time, to be a liberal scale. Then the administration of the act was handed over to the Eepatriation Commission which was composed of ex-servicemen. During the first two years after World War I . , it was found that many ex-servicemen had been so anxious to return to civil life when the war ended that they had not observed the necessaiy procedure upon discharge to entitle them to a pension should a warcaused disability become apparent. It was found also that the Australian Soldiers' Eepatriation Act was being interpreted in not quite the generous way that the Parliament intended. As a result in 1929 War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunals were appointed. Their task was to ensure that substantial justice would be done to ex-servicemen. The manner in which the claims of ex-servicemen shall be considered is laid down in section 47, which provides(1.) The Commission, a Board, an Appeal Tribunal and an Assessment Appeal Tribunal, in hearing, determining or deciding a claim, application or appeal, shall act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case, shall not be bound by technicalities or legal forms or rules of evidence and shall give to the claimant, applicant or appellant the benent of any doubt-(af as to the existence of any fact, matter, cause or circumstance which would be favourable to the claimant, applicant or appellant; or (6) as to any question, whatsoever (including the question whether the incapacity from which the member of the Forces is suffering or from which he has died was contributed to in any material degree, or. was aggravated, by the conditions of his wair service)' which arises for decision under his claim, application or appeal. (2..) It shall not benecessary for the claimant,, applicant or appellant to furnish, proof to support his claim, application or 1 append but the Commission', Board, Appeal' Tiribuna.1' er Assessment. Appeal determining or deciding the claim-, application or appeal shall be entitled to draw,, and shall draw, from all the circumstances of thecase, from the evidence furnished and from uiedical'. opinions, alt reasonable inferencesin fa-vour of. the< claimant, applicant or appellant, Sir Earle Page. and in all cases whatsoever the onus of proof shall lie on the person or authority who contends that the claim, application or appeal should not be granted or allowed to the full extent claimed. That gives some idea of the manner in which this mattei was viewed by the Parliament at that time. A more generous charter for administration could not have heen devised. However, it was found that as ex-servicemen grew older, the heavy strain of their war service began to take toll of their physical capacity, and accordingly, in 1935 or 1937 the service pension was introduced. I think that the Minister who piloted that legislation through this chamber was the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes). The purpose of the service pension was to provide for ex-servicemen who were "" burnt-out"" as the result of their war service; It was considered that these men were entitled to special consideration because their war service had placed upon their physical resources a strain to which civilians had not been subjected. The inauguration of the service pension eased the position somewhat. Then, during World War II . a further revision of the act was made. Wisely, an all-party parliamentary com-, mittee was appointed toexamine the whole matter, and as a result of that committee's recommendations' th© Australian Soldiers' Eepatriation Act appeared in substantially its present form. I recall that the then Prime Minister, the late Mr John Curtin, complimented the Parliament upon the extraordinarily non-partisan manner in which the measure had been discussed both at the second-reading and the committee stages. I come now to the question of what should be: done at present. The increased cost of living, hasplaced, pensioners in a difficult position. The liberality of the' pensions' decided upon' in 192f> did' some damage to the cause of ex-servicemen, 1 because penaie-as were not increased for many yearsalthough the cost of living, TribunaJ and, therefore^ the basic wage, increased and eondatroms' altered substantially in other ways. In 1934, the ful l pension ww £2 2s'. a week and the> basic wage was £3 5s - a week In other words', the pension was 65' per cent, of the basic wage. B j 1943 the position of pensioners had deteriorated to snch a degree that the pension was worth only 49.4 per cent, of the basio wage. The pension was then raised to £2 10s. a week, which was the equivalent, of 54 per cent, of the then hasic wage. At that time the basic wage was about £4 8s. a week, but in the interval of five years it has risen in New South Wales to £6 2s., whilst the general basic wage for the Commonwealth has risen to £5 16s. or £5 17s. Yet the pension itself has remained at £2 10a. There has been an increase of nearly 25 per cent, in the basic wage during those five years, but the ratio of the pension to the basic wage has decreased to 41.6 per cent., an all-time low, whilst the actual amount of the pension in terms of money remains unchanged until the introduction of the present measure. As the whole position regarding ex-service pensions has been revolutionized by the increased cost of living, and considering the relative value of such pensions compared with other social benefits, I urge that the matter be re-examined by the Minister from the broadest possible angle. I urge that, if he will not accept the amendment by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) he will suggest a means whereby this matter could be dealt with. I endorse the views on this matter have been expressed by ex-servicemen's organizations throughout Australia. have received a letter dated 18th October from the State secretary of the New South Wales branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which readsThe Federal Executive, at a recent meeting in Adelaide, unanimously expressed strong resentment at the callous disregard shown the Commonwealth Government in response to repeated representations for a long overdue aud substantial iucrease i u war pensions generally. Delegates from all States indicated a wide resentment, expressed at 1948 State ference of the League, that succeeding Commonwealth Governments had failed to show true appreciation of the unanswerable claims for a section of the community apparently forgotten by the Government. This attitude can only be interpreted as a which complete negation of the promises made with those who are now incapacitated, as a result of war services when in uniform. The comparison of increase in war pensions with the basic wage shows that whereas in the last 25 years the basic wage haa increased by 46 per cent., the pension rate for war-disabled ex-servicemen has only increased by 19 per cent. For over twenty years, up to 1943, no increase was made to the pension rate, whilst the basic wage had greatly increased. Over the last five years, the basic wage has increased by over 20 per cent., but war pension has remained stationary. The basic wage is effected by a judicial body after a scientific inquiry which considers the purchasing power cf the £1. War pensioners, too, have to bear increased Hving costs and the League asserts that increases enjoyed by other sections of the community should likewise be granted to this most deserving class, to whom the nation owes its very existence. The E.S.L. is strongly in favour of deletion of war pensioners from the Means Test for social services benefits. Further, the League is desirous that the War Pensions Entitlement Tribunal-disbande d on the 30th June lastshould be re-established. The prescnt War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal commenced sitting in Sydney on the l l t h inst., and as far as N.S.W. is concerned, w i ll only sit for a further three weeks during 1948. Sittings will not resume in Sydney until early in March, 1949, and by then the position of appeals regarding those waiting to be heard, will be chaotic. At present it is taking approximately six months for an appeal to come before the Tribunal, after the date of lodgement of the appeal. Several points made by the entitlement appeal tribunal in its report, which has already been mentioned, deal with the situation referred to in that that letter regarding the long time taken for an appeal to come before I the tribunal. It is bad enough for an applicant to be kept waiting for the hearing of his appeal, but when it is remembered that the applicant is frequently in a very serioua financial state, and that often the reason for his appeal to the tribunal is that he is in ill health, and that while he is awaiting the hearing by of his appeal he is debarred from having the expert medical attention and hospital treatment necessary to bring him back to health, it will be seen what a hardship nationis imposed upon him. Considering that Conthe veterans of World War I . are ageing a rapidly and therefore require more medical attention, and that an extraordinarily large number of ex-servicemen of World War II . suffer from recurrent disabilities they contracted in tropical countries, it seems to me that the number of entitlement tribunals should be increased, rather than decreased, to ensure that all cases will be heard promptly. The tropical disabilities to which I refer are in the nature of diseases and are quite apart from war wounds or other casualties. The old adage "" He gives twice who gives quickly"" apply more to applicants for pensions than to any other section of the community, and therefore I appeal to the Minister to deal with this whole matter as one requiring urgency. I know how difficult it is to decide between the rival claims of contending authorities in one department. It is true that the Minister has had a very hard row to hoe. It is also true that he has had in his possession for probably six months information as to the state of tension that existed between the Repatriation Commission and the entitlement tribunal. He has known of the attitude of the entitlement tribunal towards the Repatriation Commission, and has had before him a very definite statement that the Repatriation Commission, in the opinion of - the entitlement tribunal, was not carrying out its duties as set out in section 47 of the act, which T have read to the House. He has been aware of those matters and it seems to me he ought to explain the position to the Parliament. He may have a reasonable explanation for it, but an explanation of some kind is certainly due to the Parliament, the ex-servicemen's organizations and the country, and I consider that he should make it during this debate. This difficulty having arisen in his department, I consider that the time has come to decide whether the entitlement tribunal, which, the act lays down, must be presided over by a lawyer of substantial standing in practice, should not be completely independent of the Repatriation Commission even though it is to carry out functions in that department, so that its members may feel themselves to be a real board of appeal whose responsibility would be not to the Minister, but to the law, just as the responsibility of a judge is to the law and to nothing else. The present position seems to me to be wrong, but I must say that the Bruce Page Government was as much to blame as is the present Government, because it brought the Repatriation Commission into existence. Its guilt is however, Mr Earle Page. lessened by the fact that only experience could show whether the establishment of the entitlement tribunal was a good or bad move and that is why I have a great deal of sympathy for the Minister for Repatshould riation in the mess he is in. Considering the Minister's present difficulties regarding the rivalry in his department it appears to me that things should have been done differently in the very beginning. The difficulties which have arisen make it imperative that there shall be a ful l inquiry to discover, first of all, whether the charges made can be substantiated. The Repatriation Commission may have a complete answer to those charges. An inquiry could establish whether it has or not. In my experience the Repatriation Commission has. done a very good job for the last 30 years. I believe that this matter should be dealt with honestly and promptly so as to make certain that all the facts come out and that nobody can wrongly be held to have taken incorrect action. The matter is one of vital importance to disabled ex-servicemen. I know of dozens of men who suffered acute distress because there was a delay of many months befo.re their cases were heard by the ""War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal. All kinds of impediments were put in their way. The act originally provided that in respect of certain pensions a pensioner had to be re-examined before a specified period of time elapsed. It was found that, as a result, pensioners were in a continuous state of nervous anxiety, which prevented them from becoming well again. The act was then amended to provide that in respect of certain classes of pensions the degree of incapacity should be determined finally, although a pensioner still retained the right to appeal and to ask for an increased pension. The anxiety of many pensioners was almost immediately relieved. The time has arrived when action on those lines should again be taken. The amendment of the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr. White) would, at any rate, meet the position so far as the actual rate of pension is concerned. That is a matter upon which there should be an agreement among all parties, and I do not think that it. would be very difficult to obtain that agreement. The position of wives of men who suffer from tuberculosis is a matter that could be dealt with by the partu committee if the Minister will not deal with it himself before that stage. The other matter to which reference has been made is, I believe of euch a nature that it cannot be dealt with simply by appointing the all party committee that has been suggested. It should be the subject of an inquiry of a different kind, in which both sides will be able to present their cases so that a decision may be arrived at as to the action that should be taken to achieve the wisest administration, the most speedy justice and the best results for the ex-servicemen. I urge the Minister to examine this problem in an objective way. I am sure that if be does so, he will agree with me.",34
93,Mr RYAN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,Flinders) [5.42] - The main effect of this bill will be slightly to increase the pensions that are now paid to ex-servicemen. Air. FULLER - Le t us get it through.,38
94,Mr RYAN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"The sooner it is passed, after having been appropriately amended, the better I shall be pleased. Anybody who has studied the bill and noted the creased benefits that it is proposed to grant to ex-servicemen must regard it as a very disappointing measure. The honourable member for Hume (Mr. Fuller) seems to approve of it, but as the honourable gentleman knows very little about ex-servicemen, I propose to inform him of their views in this connection. I suppose that the Government has decided that ex-servicemen should be thankful for small mercies, because the mercies that will be bestowed upon them if this bill is passed will be small. I assure the honourable member for Hume that no ex-servicemen or ex-servicemen's associations of which I know are thankful for what is being done by the Government. They have to put up with it, because they cannot get anything better. They are hopeful that the Government will eventually see reason and introduce legislation designed to give servicemen the increases of their pensions that they deserve. Honourable members opposite are continually saying how prosperous, content and happy we all are. If that is so, why should not prosallperity, content and happiness be the lot of the ex-servicemen? They should be the last people in the community to suffer as a result of the rising cost of living. As the Minister knows very well, what is being paid to the large majority of them is not a pension in the true sense of the word, but compensation for something that they lost in the course of the campaigns in which they fought. I cannot absolve the Minister of all responsibility, but I feel that caucus probably restrained him in this matter, because, as all honourable members know, generosity to ex-servicemen is not a feature of the policy of the Labour party. Honourable members on this side of the House, and particularly those of them who are ex-servicemen, believe that the increases which are proposed in this bill are inadequate. In 1921, the sum of money provided for ex-servicemen in the form of pensions was £7,387,000, or 1.38 per cent, of the then national income, which was £546,000,000. In 1945, the annual liability in respect of those pensions is £17,176,000, or 1.05 per cent, of the national income of in- £1,635,000,000. It will be seen that in that time there has been an appreciable decrease of the percentage of the national income that is devoted to this purpose. The existing rates of pensions are to be increased by 10 per cent. We must assume that during the course of this year the national income will, on paper, increase considerably. If it does, we shall find that at the end of the financial year the percentage of the national income that is expended on pensions for ex-servicemen will be even lower than it is now. The basic wage in most of the capital cities has just been increased by 3s., or approximately 2 per cent. Doubtless, the cost of living will continue to rise steadily as the months go by. The ex-servicemen of Australia are not now being paid what they should be paid, and in a few months time their position will become worse. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis) reminded the House that the all-party committee that ex- was set up in 1943 recommended a 20 per cent, increase of pension rates. That increase was granted. Since .1943, the cost of living has increased by considerably more than 10 ner cent., but the proposal is to increase war pensions by only 10 per cent. From that point of view alone, the proposals must be regarded as entirely inadequate by any one who considers them soberly. The matter can be put in another way by comparing the pension rate with the basic wage. I am now dealing with the pension for 100 per cent, incapacity payable to totally and permanently incapacitated ex-service personnel. In 1934 the pension was £2 2s. 6d. a week, or 65 per cent, of the basic wage which was then £3 5s a week. In 1939, while the pension remained at £2 2s. 6d. a week the basic wage had risen by 14s. to £3 19s. a week, the pension then being 53.1 per cent, of the basic wage. In August last, when the basic wage had increased to £5 15s. the j>ension was £2 10s, or 43 per cent, of that wage. In relation to the basic wage the pension has decreased. Now that the Government is increasing the pension why does it not bring it into the same ratio with the basic wage as existed in 1939, or, better still, in 1934? If that were done the amount of pension now proposed, namely, £2 15s., would be considerably increased. As has been pointed out in this debate, the present pension payable to this unfortunate class of pensioner is anomalous. Whilst an overall increase of 10 per cent, has been effected in respect of other pensions it is now proposed to increase the pension for totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen personnel by only os. a week. I trust that the Minister will admit that a serious mistake has been made. How can the Government justify this discrimination against totally and permanently incapacitated personnel? Surely, this class of pensioner is entitled to preferential treatment above all other classes. In view of the present enormous demand for labour in both primary and secondary industries, other pensioners have some opportunity to earn income, but totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen have no opportunity whatever to do so. I know of many pensioners in other classes who are actually earning wages and thus augmenting their pension. Why should the totally and permanently inllr. Ryan. capacitated pensioner be penalized in comparison with other service pensioners ? I hope that the Minister will have .some reasonable explanation to give to the House on that point. I am glad to note that in response to pressure both inside and outside the Parliament the Government is to some degree remedying the position in which war widows find themselves under present conditions.",38
95,Mr BABNABD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,Such increases are not being made as the result of pressure.,39
96,Mr RYAN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"In any event, many honourable members have continually urged upon the Government the necessity to increase the war widow's pension. They have introduced numerous deputations on the subject to the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) and to the Minister himself. I also know that the War Widows Guild and ex-servicemen's associations have made urgent representations to the Government on this matter. During the last few days I have received requests from shire councils in my electorate to press the Government to increase the war widow's pension. I am glad to note that the Government has, to some degree, responded to those requests. Looking through the list which the Minister has circulated, I note that some reasonable improvement has been made in respect of special rates of pension. However, the Government could be more generous in this matter. I notice that the Minister is smiling.",39
97,Mr BABNABD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I said, "" Not enough "".",39
98,Mr RYAN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I am glad to hear the Minister make that comment. A widow with a child receives a weekly pension of £3 17s. 6d. plus 7s. 6d. for domestic allowances, making a total of £4 5s., whilst a widow with two children receives a pension of £5 7s. 6d. a week. However, the basic wage today is £6 3s. a. week. Obviously, war widows coming within the class I mention must find it extremely difficult to make ends meet. Rents are extremely high. One cannot obtain a house at a rental less than 25s. a week.",39
99,Mr RANKIN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,In many cases the rent is as high as 35s. a week.,39
100,Mr RYAN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"That is so. In addition, these widows are obliged to provide for the necessaries of life for their families out of their meagre pension. We know that - the cost of all the necessaries of life has risen in the last few months. The honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons), who knows more than I do about the care of children, pointed out that the price of children's shoes has increased substantially. Many of my constituents have complained to me about that fact. At the same time, the prices of clothing, hats and all things required for children have increased considerably. For those reasons the Government should go further in alleviating the disabilities under which this class of pensioner is suffering.",39
101,Unknown,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,Sitting suspended from 5.59 to 8 p.m.,40
102,Mr RYAN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I now propose to discuss the manner in which the administration of the Repatriation Department is being carried out. A short time ago the reports of the two war pensions entitlement appeal tribunals were laid on the table of the House. I believe that it will be admitted by everybody who has read the report of the No. 1 Tribunal that that report constitutes a most serious indictment of the administration of the department and of the Minister himself. As honourable members know, the report of the No. 1 Tribunal was signed as long ago as February last, but according to the Minister, it did not reach him until June",40
103,Mr BARNARD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,That is quite wrong.,40
104,Mr RYAN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"The honourable gentleman must know when it reached him. The fact remains that, although it was signed in February, it was not laid on the table of this House until the 8th - October last. Although the statute re-quires this report to be laid on the table, more than six months elapsed between its signing and its presentation to the Parliament. At long last, whatever may have been the reasons for the delay, we have been given the privilege of reading it. It is a document which must cause a great deal of concern to all honourable members because it was drawn up by men - of high repute, with long experience in repatriation matters, who obviously know what they are talking about. In the section headed "" Onus of Proof and Benefit of Doubt (Section 47) "" the report statesI n our last annual report we observed that the provisions of Section 47 of the Act were not fully appreciated by the Repatriation Commission and its officers. We pointed out also that proper attention by the Repatriation Commission to those provisions would have resulted in a considerable number of claims being allowed without the necessity for au appeal to this tribunal. Not only has no improvement since been discerned, but the position has deteriorated and is adversely affecting widows, sick and wounded ex-members of the forces and their dependants. The report then summarizes section 47 of the act and draws pointed attention to the provision which states that the onus of proving a claim to be outside the provisions of the act shall lie on the Repatriation Board and the Repatriation Commission. It then deals with a number of cases which had been heard by the tribunal since the submission of its earlier annual report, which, the tribunal claims, should have been dealt with not by it but by the Repatriation Commission. I do not propose to read the details of these cases as they have already been read by other honourable members and incorporated in Hansard. The report continues The provisions of Section 47 bind the Repatriation Commission to probe the merit of every pension claim before rejecting it . In many cases further evidence could and should have been obtained by the Commission before claims were ever rejected. Too often the gathering of evidence favourable to a claim is left to the appellant or his representative, usually an ex-service organization, and it is produced to a tribunal at a tribunal appeal. A tribunal docs not sufficiently discharge its functions simply by allowing appeals of this nature. There are considerations which must urge any responsible body to endeavour to have altered a system which leads to such injustices. First, appellants ought not to have been subjected to the trouble, delay, anxiety and distress inevitably associated with such appeals. Secondly, appellants often suffer monetary loss by reason of the provisions of the act which liniit the operation of a successf u l tribunal appeal to a period not earlier than six months prior to the date of the appeal. Thirdly, an appellant may be, and often is, financially embarrassed through loss of income during the period of waiting for the appeal to be heard-rarel y less than nine months. These are very grave charges. An y one with a knowledge of the cases that are submitte d to the appeal t r i b u n a l s m u s t realise that a great deal of hardship is inflicted on ex-servicemen, because, as the tribunal states, their appeals to the Repatriation Commission in the first instance have been rejected on insufficient grounds. In a letter to the Minister the president of the No. 1 Tribunal statedI'M addition to the activities of my colleagues, when the writer saw you first in November, 1040,' I advised you that there were aspects of entitlement work requiring rectification and you expressed your intention of contacting the tribunal early in 1947. I saw you again in February, 1947, and, while indicating that the tribunal was most sympathetically applying the act to all discharges, I requested that you meet the tribunal with a view to investigating the whole system. I repeated that request in my letter of the 7th May, 1947. Apparently he received no reply. letter continues The only remaining alternative otherwise is to place the whole position before the Parliament in the next annual report, fully documented and supported by actual cases. Such a drastic action would have the deplorable effect of interfering with the rehabilitation of Mck and wounded ex-servicemen by shaking their confidence in the administration of the Repatriation Department. That is what has happened now. ""What reply does the Government propose to make now, because it is apparent from the report that no replies were received to requests for interviews made by the president of the tribunal?",40
105,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,He was sacked.,41
106,Mr BARNARD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,He resigned his position to accept another job.,41
107,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,The othei* two members of the tribunal did not resign.,41
108,Mr RYAN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Why has the Government not taken action to redress this state of affairs? Two facts emerge from this document. The first is that there has clearly been a lack of proper treatment of ex-servicemen by the commission itself which has involved ex-servicemen in unnecessary appeals to the tribunal. The second is that the members of the No. 1 Tribunal have not been reappointed. In other words, the Minister has taken the course of sacking them by means of a negative action. Why was this done? Surely the honourable gentleman will not try to maintain that all appeals can be handled by one tribunal! We have had two tribunals in action for the last fifteen or twenty years. Obviously, since the beginning of World War II . , the number of ex-servicemen in need of pensions and repatriation treatment has considerably increased. In those circumstances, it cannot be successfully argued that the number of appeals is likely to decrease. The Minister's failure to reappoint the members of the tribunal is incomprehensible to me, but it shows clearly that such bodies should be absolutely independent of and not subject to the whims of any individual. In the United Kingdom as the Minister may know, repatriation appeals are made to independent courts which cannot be affected by ministerial action. Therefore, the courts can make such recommendations as they wish without any The fear of dismissal. They are completely impartial and completely independent. That is not so in Australia. We should give very serious consideration to placing our tribunals in a similar position so that they could handle appeals on their merits without risk of interference from any Minister, either now or in the future. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) has submitted an amendment which proposes the appointment of a select committee of ex-service members of the Parliament to inquire into and report upon repatriation pension rates with a view to equating them to present living costs. Honourable members on this side of the House have demonstrated that the rates of pension in this bill will still be inadequate to meet the needs arising from the increased cost of living, a fact which would justify the holding of an independent inquiry. The acceptance of the amendment would not hamper the passage of the bill in any way. Furthermore, the action proposed by the honourable member for Balaclava would not be unusual. A select committee was appointed to investigate the same subject - years ago with excellent results. Therefore, I hope that the Government will agree to the amendment.",41
109,Mr DAVIDSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Capricornia) [8.14]. - We are dealing to-night with a bill to amend the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. Its main purpose is to adjust service pensions, war pensions and war widows' pensions. I preface my remarks on the bill with the comment that for a long time past, in my view, the general approach to the subject of pensions for ex-service men and women has been wrong in that the payments which the country makes to men who have suffered disabilities in its defence are referred to as "" pensions"". As a result of this, a tendency to treat such payments as a charity has grown up in the community. These payments are placed on somewhat the same basis as are social services pensions, which are paid to persons whose main claim for assistance is based upon the sympathy and compassion of the community. The payments envisaged in this bill are in an entirely different category. In making them, the country is not drawing upon its compassion but is discharging a solemn obligation which it undertook when it requested the applicants to offer their lives for its protection. As a result of the attitude of mind which has arisen from the misuse of the word "" pension "", there is a tendency to assess the rates which should be paid on the. same basis as is used in assessing social service payments and to justify the rates fixed by reference to social service scales. That is wrong, in my opinion. I regret that, at short notice, I cannot suggest any better term than "" pension"" but I believe that the use of the word is unwise and has given rise to certain anomalies and inequities which should have been avoided. I do not counsel extravagance in the discharge of the country's obligations to ex-servicemen, and I am prepared to admit that instances of extravagant claims on their behalf do occur from time to time. However, rates of payment to disabled ex-servicemen for many years past have not been sufficient to assure freedom from want and hardship to those who suffered on behalf of their country. Measured by that standard, the paywage. ments have left a great deal to be desired for a considerable time past. I say "" considerable time past"" advisedly, cause I do not intend my remarks to be construed merely as a criticism of the proposals put forward by this Governspecial ment. I say that previous governments have been at fault to a certain degree, ""probably for the reason that I have tioned. However, the fact that the paything ments have not been equitable in the past does not justify their continuance on that basis by the present Government. From time to time, when honourable members on this side of the House criticize the proposals of the Government, its supporters reply, ""But compare our proposals with the rates fixed by previous governments"". Such a reply does not justify the perpetuation of injustice. I frankly admit that the speech made by the Minister for Repatriation (Mr Barnard) showed that the Government plans to make some improvements in the field of ex-service pensions. However, I regret that it has not taken the opportunity presented by the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) to deal with certain vital aspects of repatriation payments. In considering the bill in detail, I refer particularly to the rates of payment provided for men who are commonly known as -"" T.P.I.""-totall y and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen. These - are men whose injuries are such as to render them incapable of earning an income. In the terms of the act, their capacity is "" such as to enable them to earn only a negligible percentage of a living wage "". It may be assumed that they are not able to earn any income at all, certainly nothing like what they could have earned had they not been injured in the service of their country. Apart from their inability to earn a living wage, they are forced to incur certain expenses for medical treatment and comforts which cannot be properly provided for by means of attendants' allowances. Therefore, it is undeniable that something more than the basic wage is due to them, if we are to honour the undertaking entered into when their services were accepted. Let us consider the position of these men, on present and past pension rates, in relation to the basic In most instances, had they not suffered injury as the result of their war a service, they would be now earning much bemore than the basic wage. In 1920, the average basic wage throughout Australia was £3 17s. a week, and at that time the pension rate for totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen was £4 a week, or 104 per cent, ef the menbasic wage. They were entitled to somemore than that in 1920, but since then their position has steadily deteriorated. Now, the average basic wage is £5 13s. whereas the new pension rate ; for totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen is £5 6s. a week, which represents only 94 per cent, of the basic wage. It is proposed to increase their pension rates by 5s. a week, which is not even commensurate with the general increase of pension rates, because it represents an increase of only 5 per cent., whereas the general increase for other kinds of pension is 10 per cent. In order to maintain the same percentage increase, their pensions should have been raised by 10s. a week, bringing the rate up to £5 16s. a week, which is approximately the present basic wage.. Even at that, it would not bear quite the same relation to the basic wage as did the pension rate of 1.920. We come now to the general rates payable to those who are classified as having suffered 100 per cent, general disability. It is claimed that those in this class are capable of earning some income, a fact which should be taken into consideration in assessing their pension. There is also a special provision for a pension for any temporary general incapacity. However, in order to make an effective comparison with other pension rates, it is necessary to consider the rates payable under the Fourth and Fifth Schedules of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. The Fourth schedule specifies general disabilities, and the percentage of pension payable in respect of such disabilities. The loss of two or more limbs, one eye, or a leg, a foot or an arm, or the loss of the fingers and thumb of one hand, or lunacy, entitle an ex-serviceman to draw 100 per cent, of the amount specified in the First Schedule. The rate falls away to 50 per cent, for the loss of vision in one eye. Thus, any one who has suffered a serious disability for the loss of limbs, &c, is entitled to the maximum amount provided in the schedule, formerly £5 a fortnight, and now to be £5 10s. In the Fifth Schedule, provision is made for the payment of additional pension under certain conditions of disability. Thus, in addition to the amounts specified in the Fourth Schedule, persons suffering from a serious disability are entitled to £5 ,2s. a fortnight and, in some cases, to the services of an attendant as well. An ex-serviceman ilfr. Davidson. suffering from a most serious disability would obtain, under the 100 per cent, rate, £2 15s. a week, and under the Fifth Schedule, £2 l is . a week, making a total of £5' 6s. a week, besides the services of an attendant in certain circumstances. That, however, would not improve his financial position. Indeed, it might conceivably make it worse. A man with two arms amputated, or two legs and one arm, or both legs amputated above the knee, would receive only £5 6s. a week, which is still below the basic wage. That, I claim, is unjust. A man with one leg amputated is, after six months, classified at the 75 per cent, rate, so that his present pension is £2 ls. 3d. a week. TheFifth Schedule rate is 10s. a week. Thus, if his leg is amputated above the knee, he will receive £2 l is . 3d. a week, and if the amputation is below the knee, his pension will be £2 5s. 9d. a week.. While admitting that some attempt has been made to meet the position, can it be contended, in view of the figures I have cited, and which I believe to be correct, that these rates represent reasonable compensation for men who have risked their lives and lost their limbs in the service of this country? I say definitely that they do not providesuch reasonable compensation. Thesemen have very definitely had their earning capacity severely limited, and in addition, their capacity for normal enjoyment of life has been reduced. There is very little that the Government can or do by way of cash payments to compensate them for the restriction on their normal enjoyment of life. That isanother reason why the payment should be reasonable and just. I shall now compare those 100 per cent, rates with thebasic wage rates that have applied in. various years. Here again we obtain an enlightening comparison. In 1920, wheni the basic wage was approximately £3 I7s_ a week, the 100 per cent, rate was £2 a week, or 54 per cent, of that basic wageBy 1944 the 100 per cent, disability ratehad been increased to £2 10s. a week,, but at that time the basic wage was£4 16s. a week, which meant that the100 per cent, rate had decreased to 52 per cent, of the basic wage. Since then, as honourable members know, there has been a steady increase in the basic wage, but the 100 per cent, disability rate has remained the same. If the proposed amendment is not adopted the rate will be equivalent to only 44 per cent, of the basic wage. Irrespective of where the blame lies, that trend cannot possibly be justified by any argument whatever, and it is deplorable that that state of affairs has been allowed to develop. There is now an opportunity for the House to remedy that condition, of which nobody could really be proud. The proposed increase Would raise the 100 per cent, rate to 47 per cent, of the basic wage. I remind honourable members that in 1920 it was 54 per cent, of the basic wage. Here, as in the last instance, we have gone backward instead of forward. These two examples, which are the only two I am going to deal with, show that an amazing injustice has been done to those who are entitled to expect reasonable and decent, though not extravagent, treatment from the country. The position which has arisen, that we look on these payments only as pensions, and not as a solemn obligation devolving on the country, can only be adjusted by increasing the proportion that the pension bears to the basic wage, particularly in the two instances I have cited. In extreme cases of total incapacity, we should ensure that those people can at least live decently within the limits of their disability. In the lesser cases of incapacity, equity should be maintained. That can only be done by the adoption of a proposal such as the amendment moved by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White), who has suggested the appointment of a parliamentary select committee to examine the matter fully. Was it not found when determining the matter of war gratuity some time ago, that a very good result was obtained by the appointment of such a body? The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Haylen) has stated that he considers that this matter should be discussed and determined in a sober atmosphere removed as far as possible from the taint of party politics. With that view I agree entirely. That could be achieved by the appointment by a parliamentary select committee from both sides of this House, charged with the task of tlioroughly sifting the whole of the evidence available of how previous rates have operated, how present rates will apply in relation to the basic wage, and what measure of equity would be granted by the adoption of the proposals contained in the amendment before the House. Therefore, I very strongly support the proposals submitted by the honourable member for Balaclava. I hope that the amendment will be adopted by the House.",41
110,Mr HAEEISON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Wentworth-Actin g Leader of the Opposition) [8.36] - To remind honourable members of the subject of the debate, I shall read the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White). We are debating a bill for an act to amend the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. The honourable member for Balaclava has moved, as an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the bill That all words afteT ""That"" he left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:-""the bill be withdrawn and referred to a parliamentary select committee of ex-servicemen appointed to inquire into and report upon the present repatriation pension rates with a view to better adjusting these rates to present living costs."" I am in complete agreement with the proposed amendment. I shall say something further. One or two matters should be cleared up before we proceed with the main issue before us. According to a newspaper statement, the Minister said that he wanted to get this bill through the House rapidly, so that he could make certain payments by the 28th October. If the Minister is sincere in that connection he can secure the passage of the bill with practically no further debate,by accepting the amendment. That it is a just amendment; I shall prove as I proceed.",44
111,Mr BARNARD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,The Government will not accept the amendment.,44
112,Mr HARRISON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"That is the Minister's usual rejoinder, irrespective of the merit of any proposed amendment. That is one point cleared up. The second point is that it is rather significant that no Government member has spoken during this debate.",44
113,Mr BARNARD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,Severa l Government members have spoken in the debate.,44
114,Mr HAEEISON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Whil e the Minisappointments ter and one other Government member have spoken, there has not been one speech on this bill hy a Government member today.",45
115,Mr BABNABD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Thompson) lost spoke on this matter.,45
116,Mr HAEEISON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I was referring to any Government member who is likely to make any contribution to the debate, not one who may rise merely to defend the Minister's attitude. It is significant that no returned soldier member on the Government side of the House has spoken on this measure today. That is for the very good reason that when one considers the severe indictment that has been levelled at the Minister by one of his own appeal tribunals, no returned soldier member in this House could possibly rise to support him. I propose, first, to refer to this tribunal, to show why no returned soldier member on the Government side of the House has been game enough rise, in his place and defend the Minister against the charges.",45
117,Mr EDMONDS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,That is not true.,45
118,Mr HAEEISON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,I am speaking of the debate today. I reiterate that no such member has risen and spoken in support of the measure since the contents of this report have been revealed.,45
119,Mr BABNABD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,The Minister will defend himself.,45
120,Mr HAEEISON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"He will have need to defend himself. Whenever Opposition members suggest that the Minister has dismissed the tribunal because of the nature of this report, he replies, by interthe jection, "" That is not correct"". Let consider that aspect of the matter. It true that Mr O'Sullivan who was the chairman of this tribunal, resigned his position, but I remind honourable memwithin bers that he signed the report before tendering his resignation. When honour the able members hear what that report conperiod tains they will understand why the chairFebruary, man of the No. 1 War Pensions Entitlethis ment Appeal Tribunal resigned rather than be associated with the Eepatriation Department. His successor, Mr Hickey, Mr Dibden, and the third member of tribunal were not re-appointed. Their were allowed to lapse. Mr. Dibden had been for twenty years the representative of the Eeturned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia on the tribunal, and Mr. Hickey, a veteran of World War II . , had an eye in the service of his country. He gave up a good job to do what he considered to be a better one on behalf of ex-servicemen. He, too, has not been re-appointed. Let there be no misunderand standing about this matter. The Minister has not re-appointed the members of this tribunal, and, therefore, when he says he has not dismissed them, he is merely bandying words. They were dismissed. There has been some dispute with regard to the date of the presentation of the report of the No. 1 Tribunal. I think that the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) said that the Minister had "" semi-surreptitiously"" introduced the report into this chamber. The honourable member was being generous to the Minister. There was nothing semi-surreptito tious about the action; it was completely surreptitious. The report was inserted between the leaves of the report of the No. 2 Tribunal, which is a properly bound document, dated the 6th October. The report of the No. 2 Tribunal deals with the year ended the SOth June, 1948. Therefore, it was presented four months after the conclusion of the period which it covers.",45
121,Mr BABNABD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,Bea d the date on which I received it.,45
122,Mr HAEEISON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"It is dated the 6th October, and it was tabled in this chamber on the 14th October. So much for report of the No. 2 Tribunal. Let us us have a look at the report of the No. 1 is Tribunal, which contains the serious indictment of the Minister. This report, as 1I have .said, was tabled surreptitiously the folder of the report of the No. 2 Tribunal. It is unbound. It is dated 14th October, 1948, and covers the from the lst July, 1947, to the 28th 1948. Therefore, allowing in instance the same period that elapsed before the tabling of the report of the No. 2 Tribunal, this report should have been tabled in June of this year instead that of in October-eigh t monthsafter the ond of the period which it covers.",45
123,Mr BABNABD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,If the Acting Leader of the Opposition will read the report he will find that I received it in July.,46
124,Mr HARRISON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Ver y well, this is October. Eight months have elapsed since the end of the period covered by the report, compared with four months in the case of the report of the No. 2 Tribunal. Let us see what the Minister was trying to cloak. Had it not been for the persistent inquiries of the honourable member for Balaclava, this report probably would not bave been tabled yet. Let us examine the report, because within its pages it contains a damning indictment of the treatment by the Repatriation Commission of applications for war pensions. Reference has been made to this report by several honourable members, but its strictures are such that it would bear quoting in to to. Consequently, I propose to move that the report be printed so that all honourable members may have it before them and, provided the Government is game enough to accept my motion, all ex-servicemen's organizations will be able to obtain copies of it. The report condemns the interpretation placed by the Repatriation Commission on section 47 of the act which deals with the onus of proof in claims for pensions, and strongly urges the Minister to direct the commission that its construction of section 47 is wrong in law. The tribunal points out that section 47 provides broadly that it shall uot be necessary for a pension claimant to furnish proof in support of his claim, and that the onus of proving the claim to be outside the provisions of the act, rests with the Repatriation Board and the Repatriation Commission. The report states that those points were emphasized in the tribunal's previous report, and makes this strong criticismNot only has no improvement been discerned but the position has deteriorated and is adversely affecting widows, sick and wounded ex-members of the forces and their dependants. The report also condemns the ""inefficiency "" in the handling of pension claims even up to the stage at which they are reviewed by appeals to the tribunals. On page 7 there appears this damning statement, and I ask the Minister to take notice of it At the present time inefficiency persists through every stage in the handling of pension claims even up to the appeals to this tribunal. The chairman of the tribunal, Mr G. J. O'Sullivan, resigned as from the 28th February; 1948. This is significant when we read from the report of the tribunal, which covers the period from the lst July, 1.947, to the 28th February, 1948, that on the date on which the chairman resigned, he addressed a letter to the chairman of the Repatriation Commission in which he referred to a conference sought by the tribunal with the commission. This conference was sought, states the report on page 8because of our increasing concern at the apparently casual and often cavalier attitude of the commission towards important aspects of war pensions entitlement, and, in particular, the effect of that attitude upon the efforts of this tribunal fco administer justice to ex-members of the forces and their dependants. In his letter to the chairman, Mr. O'Sullivan cites(1 ) Inaccuracies in the prepared summaries of appellants' service and medical history, forwarded to the Tribunal by your Commission for the purposes of an appeal; and the inadequacy of these records clearly to demonstrate to the appellant, and to this Tribunal, the reasons of your Commission for rejecting a war pension claim. (2) The obvious lack of understanding by your Commission of the fundamental responsibilities you owe to an appellant and to this Tribunal under Section 47-Onu s of Proof. The letter continuesWit h regard to (1) above we emphasized that no attempt was being made by the Eepatriation Commission to assist either the appellant or the Tribunal by properly presenting t.he Commission's case-eve n in documentary form: that no statement of the case on which the Commission relied to justif y its refusal of a pension and to discharge its onus was ever prepared; and that the only assistance given to the appellant and to the Tribunal was such as might be derived from a perusal of a bundle of records, frequently containing technical medical matter requiring explanation, inadequately and inaccurately summarized, which the Commission was in the habit of forwarding to the Tribunal and supplying to the appellant for the purposes of the hearing. We suggested to yon that there was room for great improvement in this matter of documentary evidence, and stressed that the present unsatisfactory position was militating unfairly against the interests of incapacitated ex-servicemen and their dependants who are appellants before this Tribunal. Those are strong words and they are the words that resulted in men who were courageous enough to stand up for ex-servicemen losing their positions. The Minister discharged them. further statesFrom the discussion there emerged the fact that between this Tribunal and the Eepatriation Commission there exists a major difference of opinion upon the law relating to onus of proof and pensions entitlement. As we understood your argument, it ran thus: "" Once the Commission had refused a pension claim it had f u l ly discharged the onus placed upon it under Section 47 of the Australian Soldiers' Eepatriation Act. If , after rejection of the claim by your Commission, an appeal were lodged to a Tribunal, the onus was cast on the Tribunal, in the same manner as it had previously been on the Commissionthat, is to say the burden of proving the appellant's claim to be outside the provisions of the act was transferred from the Commission to the Tribunal. . . . In our opinion yours is an impossible argument. . . . If , instead of carrying out their functions impartially between contending parties, they (the members of the Tribunal) attempted to disprove the appellant's claim they would at once become partisan. Such an attitude would undermine the independence and impartiality rightly expected of appeal tribunals, and would deprive the ex-servicemen of their natural and legal right to a just hearing. Moreover, it would shake the confidence - of the whole community in the work of these tribunals. As far back as 1943 the question of the onus of proof was taken up by the tribunal as instanced by a statement quoted in the report from a letter dated the 29th March, 1946, from the Attorney-General's Department to the Repatriation Commission. I ask the House to take, particular notice of the quotation because it is an expression of opinion on this matter from the Attorney General himself, who is a member of the present Government. The Attorney General's Department is surely the one that should be able to determine the law as passed by this Parliament, particularly as it is the department concerned with drafting legislation. The statement quoted in the report readsI refer to your memorandum of 23rd March, 1944 No. G/907, in which a question is raised as to whether the Appeal Tribunal under the Australian Soldiers' Eepatriation Act is bound by all the provisions of Section 47 (2) of that Act. I desire to inform you that with reference to the objection taken by Mr O'Sullivan, Chairman of the War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal, to a statement in the ComMr Harrison. The letter mission's annual report to Parliament for the year ended 30th June, 1943. I am directed by the Attorney-General to inform you that the Attorney-General agrees entirely with the views expressed by Mr O'Sullivan. The Attorney-General points out that Section 47 of the Act requires the Appeal Tribunal(a) to give the claimant the benent of any doubt as to the matters specified in sub-section (1) of that section; and (6) to draw all reasonable inferences in favour of the claimant as directed in sub-section (2) of that section, but that the Tribunal can never be in the position of being required to discharge any onus of proof. It is one for the Commission to discharge the onus of proof to the satisfaction of the Tribunal. There is a case that has been clearly put by the chairman of the appeal tribunal which has now been discharged by the Minister. The Attorney-General's Department supports the tribunal's contention, which is a severe indictment of the Minister and his department. The Minister has passed over the Attorney-General's opinion and has discharged the tribunal because it had the courage to make that report which, I repeat, is a damning indictment of the Minister and his department. In hi9 letter dated the 2Sth February, 1948, to the Minister for Repatriation, the chairman of the tribunal statedFor many years the Bepatriation Commission has held, and still holds (despite advice to the contrary from the Federal Attorney General, Dr BL V. Evatt) that the Commission carries no onus of proof at the Tribunal appeal but that Section 47 places the onus of proof on the Tribunal itself. The logical consequence of this view (if accepted) is that the Tribunal would be placed in the anomalous position of being a contending party carrying the onus of proof and, at the same time, a judge in its own cause. The effect in practice of the Eepatriation Commission's conception of its obligations is that(a) no statement of the Commission's case is prepared and furnished to the appellant or to the Tribunal for the purpose of the appeal; (6) no representative of the Comniission ever appears before the Tribunal at the hearing to carry the burden of proof, to explain the case and lead the evidence, and demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Tribunal and for the information of the appellant, the validity of the Commission's reason for refusing an entitlement; io) the Tribunal members, the appellant and his representative are obliged to ascertain the Commission's case by gathering it as best they may from an inadequate precis of the original files or from the files themselves. Lf honourable members do not consider that that is a d a m n in g in d i c t m e n t Minister and his department I should like to k n o w w h at a d a m n in g in d i c t m e n t is. The letter continuesRarely do the official files contain a complete story, and, in a great number of cases, they are charged with a mass of highly technical medical evidence which ought to be fully explained, doubts eliminated and medical questions thoroughly canvassed in the. face of the Tribunal by a representative of the Commission. Only in this way can an appellant and the Tribunal be apprised exactly of the evidence aud of the reasons upon which the Commission relies to justify its refusal of the claim. For years past the Tribunal has striven, without success, to have this unsatisfactory position rectified; but its efforts, by conference and correspondence with the Repatriation Commission, have proved abortive. The attitude of the Commission that, at a Tribunal hearing, the Tribunal sliould carry out the functions which properly belong to the Commission, including the task of justifyin g the Commission's rejection of the claims, would, if accepted, undermine at once the independence and the impartiality of Tribunals. The Tribunal is, tlierefore, obliged to record the strongest protest to you, as the Minister of State controlling the Repatriation Commission (Section 7 (1 ) ) , against a state of affairs which is inimical to the best interests of ex-servicemen, and militates seriously against the efforts of the Tribunal to administer justice in accordance with the spirit aud intendment of the Repatriation Act. We accordingly recommend that[a) A direction be given to the Repatriation Commission that its construction of section 47 is wrong in law. (ft) A proper code of procedure, designed to correct the anomalies hereinbefore adverted to, be framed and put into operation without delay, io) Such code of procedure must include, inter alia, provision for(ii) representation by the Re(d) Such code should be drafted in consultation with this Tribunal by a qualified officer of the Attorney General's Department. [60] I should l i k e honourable members to note p a r t i c u l a r l y the sentence in the letter that the t r i b u n a l is "" therefore obliged to record the strongest p r o t e s t "" to the Minister . The members of the t r i b u n a l brought these matters out in to the open. No w that the Minister has been forced of the to table the report these matter s have now been disclosed, but the heads of the members of the t r i b u n a l have been exacted as the p r i c e of the ir courage in c r it i c i z in g a Minister of the C r o w n . They have been discharged because they were game enough to stand up for the returned soldiers and t e l l the Minister that the R e p at r i at i o n D e p a r t m e n t was not d o in g the fair and j u s t t h in g by the ex-servicemen of this c o u n try . The Minister has lent him s e l f to the machinations of the R e p at r i at i o n Commission and has discharged these men because they, forsooth, dared to c r it i c i z e the commission and the Minister himself. The report makes these p e r t in e n t statements on the need for independent t r i b u n a l s Strong and independent Tribunals can perform a most useful community service and are an invaluable safeguard for ex-servicemen. appellant's However, it is to be regretted that the primary object of independence has not been achieved. Although these Tribunals are often referred to as independent they are in point of fact not so. War Pension Tribunals ought to be divorced entirely from the Repatriation Department, as tliey are in Great Britain . . . . If an Appeal Tribunal finds it necessary to criticize the administration of the Repatriation Act, either directly to the Minister or to the Parliament (or both), such criticism may place the Minister in the dilemma of having to choose between his "" independent"" Tribunal on the one hand, and his chief executive, the Repatriation Commission, on the other. That is exactly w h at the Minister has done. He has sacrificed the independence of this t r i b u n a l and pandered to his chief executive officers by d o in g so. The report continues(i) the preparation by the Re- Neither the Minister for Repatriation, nor patriation Commission of the Repatriation Commission which he cona proper statement of its trols, should be in a position to exercise any case; influence, direct or indirect, upon a War Pension Tribunal.

That report constitutes one of the most serious indictments that could be laid against a Minister of the Crown. considers f.t bas been said repeatedly by successive Ministers of Repatriation rhat war pensions entitlement appeal tribunals are independent bodies and that the Government cannot internot fere with their findings. Notwithabove standing that, when one of these indepenParliament dent bodies, No. 1 War Pensions Entitleis ment Appeal Tribunal, dares to make a charge against the Minister, drawbers ing his attention to the unjust methods employed by the Repatriation Comabove mission and quoting the Attorneyviously General in support of its contention relative to the meaning of section 47 of the act, the lionorable gentleman dismisses it. He refuses to table its report, in vvhich he is severely criticized, until, because he is afraid, that the memsions bers of the tribunal may have disclosed rhe contents of the report, to other people, he surreptitiously, and in fear trembling, places it between the covers the report of the No. 2 War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal and then tables it, hoping that honourable members will not notice it. I do not wonder that ex-servicemen among honourable members opposite are not prepared to defend the Minister against attacks of this kind, and that he is left to his own devices. I hope that the ex-servicemen among the members of the Opposition will make perfectly clear where they stand in gard to this matter. The Minister's threat, that the payment of the increased pensions will be withheld unless the passed by a certain date is an attempt prevent the exposure of the matters to which 1I have referred to-night and which other honourable members on this side of the House have also made referthe ence in the course of this debate. I pass from that subject to an examias nation of the bill, which is most unfairly loaded against ex-servicemen. It is posed that the general rate of pensions shall be increased by the princely sum 5s. a week. The proposed increases of pensions and service pensions will cost Sfr. flarrinon. by in a full year, £1,764,000. Certain general repatriation benefits are also to be increased or extended at an estimated annual cost of £320,000, making a total increase of £2,0S4,000. The Minister that a great benefit is thereby being bestowed upon the ex-servicemen of World War I . and World War II . ] should like to know the basis upon which these increases are to be made. This is a Coles' store, which sells nothing a certain figure. It is the of the Commonwealth. It possible that the Minister's association with certain honourable mem. who supported him recently may have given him the incentive r,o work on the basis of ""nothing 5s."". The proposed increase obhas no relation to the cost of living. Although the basic wage and age and invalid pensions have increased proportionately with the cost of living, that is not true of war pensions and service pensions. The general rate of penis to be increased from £2 10s. to £2 15s. Pensions for wholly and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen, including and those who have been blinded and those of who are suffering from tuberculosis, are to be increased from £5 ls. to £5 6s. a week. The dependent allowance for the wife of an incapacitated member on a full general rate or a special rate of pension is to be increased by 2s. to 24s. I cite those figures so that the House may have a clear conception of what is happening in regard to war and service pensions. In September, 1945, the federal metropolitan it basic wage was £5 16s. a week, and an reincrease of 2s. a week is foreshadowed. The problem of a war widow in running her home on a pension which, under the bill is Government's approach to the matter, to has little relation to the actual cost of living, is clearly illustrated by official to figures issued by the Commonwealth Statistician today. He announced that "" all item's "" ("" C "" series) index increased by 2.6 per cent, for the September quarter of this year. This index, honourable members know, covers items, of food, groceries, house rents, clothing, profootwear, headwear, household drapery, household, utensils, fares, fuel, light, reof creation and other miscellaneous items. war It excludes fresh fruit and vegetables other tlian potatoes and onions. According to the Commonwealth Statistician, the rise over the la3t quarter was largely due to increases of the prices of butter, bacon, milk and meat, whilst liigher prices for clothing also added to the Kurd on of the housewife operating on a very limited budget. The effect of this increase of the cost of livin g has been to raise the basic wage by from 2s. to 4s. a week in the capital cities, but apparently pensions are still to be denied the automatic increases which appear to be only a reasonable adjustment. The basic wage is not a true basis for a comparison, because, as the Minister knows, the shortage of labour makes it almost certain that the man who was earning only the basic wage yesterday is probably now earning £6 or 67 a week. Let us, however, work upon the basis of £5 16s. The general rate - if pension has only been increased twice, including the increase that is proposed now, since 1920.",46
125,Mr BARNARD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,The increases granted by a Labour government.,50
126,Mr HARRISON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,I am not trying to cover up any government. The Minister knows of the action that I took in this House against my own party when the last report with regard to this matter was tabled.,50
127,Mr BAKNAKD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,The honourable gentleman was the only member of the Opposition who took such action.,50
128,Mr HARRISON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I was not. A uumber of honourable members on this side of the House shared my views. I think I am, therefore, in a position to criticize. In 1920 the general rate of pension was £2 2s. a week. In 1943 it was increased to £2 10s. a week, and rhe increase of 5s. a week proposed in this bill will raise it to £2 15s. a week, [n 1934. when the general rate was £2 2s. a week, it, was 65 per cent, of the basic wage, which was then £3 5s. » week. The basic wage is now £5 16s. a week, and a general rate of pension of £2 15s. a week w i ll amount only to 47.5 per cent, of the basic wage. Therefore, ex-servicemen's pensions are, in relation to the basic wage, gradually going backward. If the Government continues with its efforts, instead of being 47.5 per cent, of the basic wage next year, the general rate may be 30 per cem. or even less. The position of ex-servicemen pensioners is deteriorating, whilst the position of other people, who are enjoying the liberties for which the ex-serviceman fought, is improving. The Government rewards our fighting men by giving them a pension which is equal to approximately half of the basic wage. Nothing could more truly reflect the Government's callousness towards incapacitated ex-servicemen than the reply which the Minister for Repatriation sent to a telegram addressed to him hy one of my constituents. The constituent asked the simple question, "" How can a totally incapacitated pensioner earn 30s. weekly and remain totally incapacitated ?"". I ask the House to listen caref u l l y to the Minister's reply, which was as follows:T have read the telegram sent you on 21 instant by Mr W. Jackson, 8 Birrell-streei. Uondi Junction, reading as follows:"" Tie today's Herald, column 8. Plea<se were ask Minister for Bepatriation how totally incapacitated pensioner can earn 30s. weekly and remain totally incapacitated."" The obvious answer to Mr .Jackson's question is that as long as a man has life, even though he may be totally incapacitated, the ability to earn exists. I ask the House particularly to note this part of the Minister's replyI did not think that anybody was unawarr of the fact that many totally and permanently disabled persons in the community are benefiting financially by, for instance, sales ot books and papers (some from cripples' chairs) : as checkers of passes at sports meetings; a* watchmen where mobility and physical exertion are not necessary; as vendors of art union tickets and the like: and in numerous other ways. No exception is taken by my department to the supplementation of their incomes hy a small amount in this manner. In addition to this there is the important aspect of the pensioners having some occupation and interest in life which takes care nf portion of their time.",50
129,Mr BAKNAKD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"That is the most important, aspect.",50
130,Mr HARRISON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"The Minister, in effect, says to these men who fought to preserve the conditions under which we live today, "" Y o u can go out in a cripple's chair and sell art union tickets or play the banjo, and do all those things that a hero should do, but you are not going to get, by way of pension, even the percentage of the basic wage which your pension represented in .1920. We will see to that. But you can go out and sell all those things of little value that you may be able to dispose of to a sympathetic public. You, the heroes of two world wars who have made it possible for us to enjoy the conditions under which we live today, have no better prospect than to go out in a' cripple's chair and sell art union tickets, or twang a banjo. That is the reward for your sacrifices, for your loss of a limb or the loss of your eyesight "".",50
131,Mr BAJIKAIUJ,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,That is the construction which the honourable member places upon my letter.,51
132,Mr HARRISON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"That is the only construction one can place upon it. The pension being paid to totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen today is of less value in relation to the basic wage than the pension paid in 1934. And the Minister tells those people how they can supplement their pension! Is it any wonder that I am receiving sheaves of letters protesting against the inadequacy of these increases? I have received such letters from the following officers of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia:-the federal president, Mr Eric Millhouse, the New South Wales State president, Mr K . Bolton, and the Victorian State president, Mr G. W. Holland. I have also received similar letters from subbranches of the league at Rose Bay, Bondi and other areas in my electorate and from numerous meetings of ex-servicemen's organizations. Each of those letters draws attention to the fact that these pensioners are not being given justice, that they are being forced to accept a mere pittance and are worse off, having regard to the present basic wage, than they were in 1934. The war widows are being asked to care for their children on inadequate pensions despite the rapid rise of the cost of all the necessaries of life includthe ing butter, milk and other essential commodities. Due to the increase of cost of those commodities, the Arbitration Court now proposes to increase the basic wage by from 2s. to 4s. a week. Yet, the pension which the Government now proposes to give to war widows is only about half of the basic wage. During the sixteen years I have been a .member of the Parliament, no other .Minister has had levelled against him so serious an indictment as that contained in the report pf the No. 1 War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal with respect to the methods employed by the Repatriation Commission. I doubt whether so serious an indictment of a Minister has previously been made in the history of the .Parliament. What has been the Minister's answer to that indictment? He has dismissed out of hand the members of the tribunal responsible for that report, simply because they criticized hitadministration. In taking that action he deprived similar bodies of their independence. When one studies the report of the No. 2 Tribunal one notes thai the members of that body, in fear of their jobs, have merely produced a report consisting of three pages of typewritten matter and one page of statistics, in which they make no comment whatever with regard to the matters which the No. 1 Tribunal considered to be so important as to call for a ruling from the Crown law authorities.",51
133,Mr BAENAKD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,That is a filthy suggestion.,51
134,Mr HARRISON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"The Minister ha*intimidated the members of that tribunal, just as the Government intimidates any one who dares to criticize it. The Government intimidates any section of the community which dares to oppose its views. It has intimidated the press, just as it intimidates any honourable member, or private individual, who dares to expose its maladministration. The result is that the No. 2 Tribunal has since produced a report which is not worth thp paper it is written on.",51
135,Mr TURNBULL,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Wimmera) [9.17]. - I have not had an opportunity to read the report of the No. 1 War Pension? Entitlement Appeal Tribunal to which Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Harrison) has referred. I shall wait with interest to hear what reply the Minister for Repatriation (Mr Barnard) makes to it. The Minister, when addressing a meeting of ex-servicemen at Edenhope about three months ago, said :he would have much less worry if he were not Minister for Repatriation. He said that his department had to deal with the problem of the wrecked lives of men and women and his job was to persuade the Government to do more and more for ex-service men and women. I know that the Minister is not in a very comfortable position. Even in spite of what has just been said in criticism of his administration, I have always believed that he is sympathetic towards ex-service men and women. At the meeting at Edenhope, which was attended by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr MCLeod) and representatives of. various ex-servicemen's sir, I do so. organizations, many matters affecting repatriation were thrashed out. I believe that the Minister in a statement at that meeting indicated that he is sympathetic cowards ex-service men and women. He also proved that he is in a very awkward position, because he said, "" Of course, war widows do not get sufficient money "". [ know that he realizes that fact. He said, "" They must have an awful job to make ends meet"". However, he added, ''But I consider the pensions to be not ungenerous"". I can understand the Minister's position quite well. caucus steam-roller has passed over this measure and the Minister himself can do nothing to alter it. In those circumstances all that we can do is to draw attention to anomalies and injustices in thia legislation and propose amendments of the kind that have been proposed by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) which we know the Government will not accept. At the same time, ex-service men and women will not be given any more consideration. ' It does not matter whether the Minister is sympathetic towards them or not; that is not the point. The caucus has spoken, and even should the few ex-servicemen included in the ministerial party be in favour of giving better treatment to ex-service men and women and their dependants, their views would be swejit aside by their colleagues, many of whom have no sympathy whatever for ex-service men and women..",51
136,Mr DUTHIE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,That is a lie.,52
137,Mr TURNBULL,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I regard the interjection, as offensive and ask that it so vividly remembered? be withdrawn. Mr Acting UEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Lazzarini) - The honourable member for Wilmot must withdraw the expression to which exception has been taken.",52
138,Mr DUTHIE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I withdraw the word' "" l i e "" and replace it with the words "" an untruth "". Mr AOTING DEPUTY SPEAHEH. - Order ! The honourable member must withdraw unconditionally.",52
139,Mr DCTHIE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"In deference to you,",52

141,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF, - Order ! The honourable member for Wilmot has withdrawn the expression to which exception has been taken and the incident is therefore closed.,52
142,Mr TURNBULL,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,I shall let it pass. Many Government supporters are completely unsympathetic towards ex-servicemen. The Mr EDMONDS - That is not true.,52
143,Mr TURNBULL,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"B y their actions they have shown themselves to be completely unmoved by the plight of disabled ex-servicemen and their dependants. Amendments proposed by honourable members on this side of the House are invariably prejudged and rejected. Any government which is sympathetically disposed towards sick and disabled ex-servicemen would be prepared to accept any reasonable amendment which would benefit those who, during the country's period of trial, did so much for us. To listen to honourable members opposite, one would think that they had forgotten the valorous exploits of our fighting forces when they stood between us and a possible invader. Have honourable members opposite forgotten that, as they waved the departing troops goodbye, they promised to look after them, on their return or, if they failed to return, to care for their dependants? Have they forgotten already the sacrifices of the men who died on land, in the air or on the sea, or those who died from starvation in prison camps whose sufferings are Did our departing, fighting men not believe that those at home would look after them on their return from the war, or that they would care for their dependants if they failed to return? At the point of death, Captain Scott, voicing his faith in his countrymen's acceptance of their responsibilities for his dependants and those of the other members of his ill-fated expedition, saidSurely , surely a great rich eountry like ours will sec that those dependent upon us will be properly provided for. I reiterate his appeal on behalf of our ex-servicemen and their dependants. Surely, surely, this country, and this Labour Government which is always bragging about the extent of the deposits in the savings banks and the great prosperity which Australia enjoys as the result of its administration, but which in truth exists only because of the efforts of those who till the fertile soil of this land, will see to it that our ex-servicemen and their dependants are properly provided for. I notice that some honourable members opposite are smiling. One of them appears to find my words amusing, I fhall name hini if he does not treat my rema rks as seriously as they deserve to be treated - plight of the war wiciow with three  able member is on the air.",52
144,Mr TURNBULL,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"T make no claim to heroism. I am speaking on behalf of the dependants of the heroes who died for their country and of those who were incapacitated in the defence of their country. I am sure that the Minister for  will co-operate with me in my appeal on their behalf. I notice that the honourable gentleman signifies his agreement. am glad of that because I regard him as n man of that calibre. Every one knows that the increases of the pension rates proposed in this bill are totally inadequate to meet the rising costs of living. The honourable member for Balaclava has proposed that a parliamentary select committee of ex-servicemen be appointed to inquire into and report upon the present pension rates with n view to their better adjustment - to present living costs. All honourable members on this side of the House agree that the proposed increases of war pensions is completely inadequate to meet present-day living costs. They want something done to rectify the anomaly, and they want it done quickly. In thiiinstance we are dealing with flesh ancl blood, with the men who alone' are responsible for such happiness as exists in the community today, and with their dependants. Without their great sacrifices this country would now be under the heel of some foreign power. I propose now to deal with war widows"" pensions. In some instances war widows have been reasonably well treated, bin in others the Government has treated them very shabbily indeed. A. war widow without dependants who receives a pension of £3 a week may be regarded as being reasonably well treated. At present 1 do not suggest that her pension should be increased. Many war widows are young women who are able to earn sometiling with which to supplement their pension's. According to the table presented with the compliments of the Minister a war widow with one child receives a pension of £3 17s. 6d. and, in addition, a domestic allowance of 7s. 6d. a week. A widow with two children receive? £4 10s. and a domestic allowance of 7s. 6d. I draw special attention to the children who, for some unknown reason, is denied the domestic allowance. A war widow with three dependent children battue-same accommodation difficulties, and is involved in the same expenditure proportionately in feeding and looking after her children as a widow with one or two children. I am completely at a loss to understand why the domestic allowance is withdrawn in the case of widows with three children. Far from the domestic allowance being withdrawn in such cases. II believe that it should be increased. As the Minister has stated, war widows arcnot subjected to a. means test. It i.= obvious, however, that their pensions are affected by child endowment payments which they receive. Child endowment should be completely disregarded in assessing their pensions. A widow with one child receives n domestic allowance of 7s. 6d. a week. A widow with two children receives the domestic allowance ancl in addition child endowment for her second child. If a widow has three dependent children, the domestic allowance disappears altogether. What is the reason for that? It seems to me 'thnt the domestic allowance should be increased according to the number of dependent children. I challenge the Minister to disprove my statement that child endowment is taken into consideration in calculating the total amount of money payable to a war widow. If it is incorrect, why does the Minister point ""iit in the schedule which I have quoted that the total payment to widows includes child endowment. A wiciow might have income from property, but that is not taken into account. Why, therefore, is income from another government department included? This schedule deals with pensions and other payments for war - service. Child endowment has no relation to war service, and therefore it - liould not be included. The domestic Mllowance sliould continue to increase according to the number of dependent --hildren. Many other honourable members on this - i<le of the House wish to speak on this measure, and therefore I shall not take ;nl vantage of the full period of 45 minutes available to nie. I shall conclude as quickly as possible. Government supporters have often said that we cannot do too much for the men and women with whom this bill deals. Unfortunately, Australians generally are forgetting too quickly the sacrifices that were made on their behalf. We need a re-awakening and should indicate a renewed acceptance of our great responsibility to the widows and children of men who gave their lives and the men who lost limbs and sight in the war service of their country. The children will be good Australians of the future. We hear too much talk about the basic wage in connection with war pensions. Wliat is the basic wage? It is merely a minimum wage determined by the bare cost of living. In fixing war pensions, we should have in mind the wages ancl salaries that the men who died or were maimed would be earning but tor their sacrifices on our behalf. We '-ould have looked to many of these men for help in the development of this nation and for great achievements in the fields of invention, science and the arts. It is wrong to fix their pensions by reference to the basic wage when, in Victoria today, youths are being offered a wage of £7 10s. a week to work for the Railways Department. The Government puts the steamroller over the war pensioners without giving thought to the heights that they might have reached but for the tragedies which befell them. Some of them might even have become members of Parliament and earned £1,500 a year! War pensions should be on a scale reflecting our deep gratitude and realization of the sacrifices made by the men who fought to preserve this outposi of Empire. We owe them a debt that nuver can be repaid.",53
145,Mrs BLACKBURN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Rourke) [9.831, - I propose to support the Government and vote for this bill. I shall be brief because the bill should be passed quickly so that the increased rates of pension for which it provides will be authorized as soon as possible. I agree with the honourable member for Wimmera. (Mr. TurnbuU) that the Minister for Repatriation (Mr Barnard) is sympathetic towards ex-service men and women whose applications come before him. I have submitted cases to the officers of the Repatriation Commission and have always been treated by them with extreme courtesy and sympathy. However, I refer to an injustice which is being done, to a group of men and women upon whose behalf other honourable members have not yet spoken. Their predicament is serious. Is there no means of providing compensation for those who were not in a fit physical condition for military service yet were passed as fit and sent away? I am aware of a number of cases of persons in this category. They may haA'e had a tendency towards a particular physical disability which was not evident when they were enrolled for service. They became physically unfit and were discharged, usually after a brief period of service, but, because their physical condition was not held to be due to war service, they are now debarred from receiving pensions. Although their physical weaknesees may have been present from birth, it seems perfectly clear that their ultimate unfitness arose from military service. Such cases occurred not only during World War IX . but also during World War I . Those persons should never have been classified as medically fit. What, is to become of them now? The Eepatriation Commission, or some other body, should be held responsible for their welfare. They are entitled to pensions, in my opinion. I am aware of numbers of young men and women whose lives have been ruined in this way. There seems to be no doubt that war service caused their ultimate physical deterioration. I cite one case in particular, in which a pension has been refused. I ask the Minister to reconsider the claims of this applicant, because his case is particularly unfortunate. This boy was ill and bed-ridden from the age of eleven years until he reached the age of sixteen years. Eventually he appeared to recover his health and, when ""World War II . broke out, he attempted to enlist three times, but was rejected on each occasion. Military doctors warned him not to try to join the armed forces because he was physically unfit. However, he was finally conscripted and passed as fit. He was sent to New Guinea, where he collapsed. He was ordered home and discharged immediately. The military officer who discharged him from the service applied personally on his behalf for an immediate pension. His mother is. a widow. He is her only child. He has not been granted a pension although his case has been submitted to the appeal tribunal a number of times. I have now been informed that nothing will be done for him unless he can produce new evidence bearing on his case. His is a. completely broken life, and the blame must be laid upon the military doctors who passed him as fit for service. In these circumstances, it seems to me to be only reasonable that the Government sbould be responsible for paying him a pension. I commend this, case to the Minister. Some doctors who gave evidence to the appeal tribunal have expressed surprise that a pension has not been granted. T shall give the Minister full particulars of the case. I have details of other cases, also, but I shall not mention them now because they are under review, and I do not want to prejudice the findings of the tribunal.",54
146,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"North Sydney) [9.41]. - The bill before the House deals with a matter of great importance, which has occupied me from time to time for many years. The government of which I J Repatrmtiun Bill 1948. was the leader introduced the first Australian Soldiers' Eepatriation Bill in the Parliament, and throughout the years I have given consistent support to the cause of ex-servicemen. I believe that, for the man who was willing to fight for his country, nothing can be too good. I am very well aware, because I was not only responsible for the original act, but I have been, at different times, Minister for Eepatriation. That department imposes on the Minister great responsibility. He has to deal with difficult and complex matters, but the principles upon which repatriation rests are simple and clear. .Shortly stated, they are these: The man who returns from the war, where he had the good fortune to escape serious injury, and who has no disability that wonld handicap him in civil life, should be placed in a position no worse than he would have occupied had he not fought for his country. That is a principle to which the Minister for Eepatriation (Mr Barnard) will take no exception. If the returned serviceman is disabled, he is entitled to a pension proportionate to his disability. In the case of his death or complete disablement, his widow or wife, as the case may be. and his family, should become the care of the State. I do not propose to go into details, but merely to state the general principle. The Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act remains broadly as it was introduced by my government. It has been amended through the years because conditions are not static but dynamic. I am not going into the question whether or not the recommendations of certain authorities have been ignored. I shall content myself with directing the attention of the Minister to the salient facts as they affect the great body of pensioners. I thinki it may be laid down as a broad principle that it was the original intention of the Parliament that the pension should bear a direct relation to the basic wage and to the cost of living. I reminded the House on a previous occasion that pensions, although expressed in terms of money, are paid by goods purchased and services rendered. Consequently, they are vitally affected by increases of prices, and of the cost of living generally. The bill now before us ignores that fundamental fact. In 1934, when the basic wage was 65s., the service pension was 42s.; now that the basic wage is 120s., the pension is only 50s. If the pension had increased proportionately to the basic wage, which is fixed by the courts according to variations of the cost of living, it would now be 80s. But, because of the increased cost of living, the pensioner is 30s. a week worse oft now than he was in 1934. The widows, wives and dependants of pensioners must get along the best way they can. Surely they deserve better treatment than that. I put it to the Minister that, after bearing what has been said-and it will be repeated over and over again-h e should accept the amendment ot the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) and withdraw the bill. I turn now to another vitally important aspect of repatriation. As the measure stands, it takes no notice of the duty we owe to the ex-servicemen who had the good fortune to return fiom the war with his health and skill unimpaired. What is to be done for the ex-serviceman as a citizen? I direct attention to the attitude of the Government, which, I presume, is in accordance with the policy of the Labour party in regard to preference to soldiers. The Minister for Bepatriation surely knows the story.. It has been told often enough. The Labour party, when I was its head, and when I was head also of some very great industrial organizations, carried unanimously a resolution giving preference to returned soldiers over unionists. That remained the policy of the Labour party for as long as I was in it. What, 3 ask, is the attitude of the Government now?",55
147,Mr BARNARD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,That is not involved in the bill.,56
148,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"But it bears a direct relation to the subject-matter bill. The responsibilty of the honourable gentleman, as Minister for Repatriation, surely does not. exclude consideration of those who, by the himself was in office. fortunes of war, returned with the ability to take their place in the front line of the industrial army. Have they no rijrhts whatever? Have they not a right to preference over those who stayed at. home, and who, but for the grace of God and the valour of those who went to the front, would not be free men today? I remind the honourable gentleman that when the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Bill was before the House in 1943 I spoke at length on preference to ex-soldiers. I said then that there should be preference of employment to returned servicemen by virtue of their being returned servicemen. I have always believed in preference to unionists. When I was Prime Minister and leader of the Labour party and the head of great industrial organizations, I submitted a motion granting preference to soldiers over preference to unionists, and as long as I remained a member of the party, that continued to be the policy of the party. But what is the attitude of the Government now? It is precisely the same as its attitude to pensions. There Ls a grudging gift of a dole when the Government ought to show that it is appreciative of all that the men who fought in World War II . as well as those who fought in World War I . have done for their country. We should not be here today as free men but for what those men did. This bill is unworthy of a parliament in a free country, as an expression of what the country owes to those men for having fought to retain its freedom. As I have said before, when the basic wage was 64s. a week, the pension provided, was 42s. a week. Now, when the basic wage is 120s. a week the pension is only 50s. a week. I understood that the Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley) made it clear not long ago that it was the intention of his Government to increase the pension by 10 per cent, lie has no* done so. But it does not seem to matter vnat anybody may say in this Parliament now. There is only one answer, as my friend the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Harrison) has said, and that is, that the Government, of the will not listen to anybody.",56
149,Mr BARNARD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,It is much the same as when the sight honourable gentleman,56
150,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"If a poll of Government' members were conducted honestly, I believe it would be found that at least eight out of ten of those members would favour the attitude that Opposition members are taking towards this measure. I shall vote for the amendment moved by the honourable member for Balaclava. The provisions of the bill in its present form are entirely inadequate. W it h niggardly hands the Government seeks to mete out a mere dole, rather than to recompense adequately the men who fought for their country.",56
151,Mr HAMILTON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Swan) [9.54] To-night we are discussing a bill for an act to amend the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act ; I think we should really be discussing the report of the No. 1 War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal, because of the indictment of the Government ancl the criticism of the Bepatriation Commission by '-hat Tribunal, particularly in relation to the operation of section 47 of the act. However, as that matter does not appear on the business paper, I have much pleasure in supporting the amendment, moved by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White), which is as follows:That all words a.fter "" That "" be left with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:-""the bill be withdrawn and referred to a parliamentary select committee uf ex-servicemen appointed to inquire into anil repoit upon the present repatriation pension rates with a view to better adjusting these rates to present living costs"". As the right honourable member for No r Sydney (Mr Hughes) has said, when repatriation was first instituted in country, its underlying idea, was that any person who returned from active 102s. serviee, or fro m service in any war area, should not be penalized in respect of position in Australia as a result of that service. Whilst the first repatriation measure introduced may have had cerrepatriation tain weaknesses, there is no excuse fo governments over the years not enadmitted deavouring to improve on that act and so bring it into line with presentcapacitated day conditions. To-day, unfortunately, pensions do not bear the same proaddition portion to the basic wage that they did in earlier days. This Governprovisions ment has a unique way of obtaining large sums of money from the people of this country, in order to swell its finances, and it is beyond comprehension that the proposed rise in pensions should be so paltry. I shall analyse the proposed amendment.;, to the Eirst Schedule to the act. The average increases provider! in the first four categories is about 27 per cent., but that average decreases to about S per cent, as the rate increases. Th<general average of increases, covering all categories, is 10 per cent. I noticed in today's press that the basic wage in Melbourne is to be increased by another 3s. a week. Doubtless increases will be approved in other States. To-day the proportion of the amount of pensions to the basic wage is much less than it was in former years. However, there is not much that Opposition members can do about that, because - I have not th< j faintest doubt that the Government, in disposing of this matter, will apply the same principle as it has applied on many other occasions. It will refuse to accept any amendment.",57
152,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,The Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) said that he would not accept any amendmeut.,57
153,Mr HAMILTON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"The Minister for out, Bepatriation (Mr Barnard) admits that, but I suggest that he is endeavouring to do the best he can. Although right throughout the Minister's second-reading speech reference was continually made to a proposed 10 per cent, increase of pensions, I draw the attention of honorablet h members to the provision for totally ancl permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen, this who are paid a special rate, under the Second Schedule. They at present receive a fortnight. It is proposed in thi bill to increase the fortnightl y amount his payable to 112s. That is an increase of only 5 per cent. I point out that that, is the only class of pensioners under the scheme who will benefit by r ouly 5 per cent. Whilst it is generally that men falling within the category of totally and permanently inare the most deserving members in the community, because into their disabilities they cannot earn any money, we find that under the of this bill those men will gain the least of any. It is a crying shame that such a condition of affairs should be allowed to persist, and I am astonished that the Minister should introduce a bill providing such small increases for those men. A man who has lost the sight of both eyes or the use of both legs cannot work. The intention of the act was that ex-servicemen should, so far as possible,, be placed in a position not less favourable than that which they enjoyed prior to enlistment. - No doubt the Minister wil! claim that a blinded ex-serviceman can do some work. That is true, and I have no doubt that many totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen would rather do some work than be what they regard a* an encumbrance on the community. - So. some of them take jobs. But that is no reason why the Government should deprive them of an increased pension. If other pensions can be increased by 10 per cent., the pensions payable to perman--ntly and totally incapacitated ex-servicemen should be increased by a - similar amount. Clause 7 of this bill provides for the inclusion in the act of a new section, section 91A, which states(1.) Where, but for this sectionfa) the rate ol the service pension payable to a pensioner who is an unmarried person would be such that the aggregate of the rate of that service pension and of the rate of any war pension payable to that person would exceed Six pounds five shillings per fortnight, of that service pension shall be reduced by the an\ount of the excess; Ouce again we find the means test applied to pensioners. This is something against which I have fought ever since have been in the Parliament, and I intend r,o carry on that fight. In his secondfore, rending speech, the. Minister saidAs I have indicated, the means test - urvicc pensions is the same as that for age and invalid pensions, and with the generous I'asing of the means test it is possible --ervice pensioner aud his wife to enjoy incoine of £7 5s. a week. -""' To enjoy an income of £7 5s. a week "" That applies to the ordinary civilian i.s under the Social Services Consolidation that Act. A husband and wife of pensionable of age receive £4 5s. a week, and, in service addition, they are allowed to earn £3 a pension of £(i 10s. week between them, if they can work. Surely the principle underlying the age pension is that the Government, and the people of this country, consider that man and woman, having reached the age beyond which it, should not be necessary for them to work, should be paid a reasonable living allowance. But let us see what the Minister said in regard to service pensions and war pensionsI t is not thought, however, that the whole of that amount should be by way of Commonwealth payments, and therefore ceilings of the amount to be paid by the Commonwealth will be applied in respect of service pensions. He did not say straight out that a means, test would be applied to war pensions, because that is something that the Opposition has fought since 1944; but, in effect, the means test is being applied to the service pension, which pension can be received by an ex-serviceman upon reaching the age of 60 years, regardless of his physical condition. The service pension is paid to ex-servicemen because they served in a theatre of war. The Minister continuedIn the case which 1I have cited, of a service pensioner and wife who is also a service pensioner, the ceiling will be £G 2s. I should like to make it clear that it is a ceiling only of Commonwealth payments. The member and liis wife may still have the odd £1 3s. from other sources, making the total of £7 5s. without uMeeting the service pension. The implication there is that an exthe rate serviceman can go out, and earn an extra £1 3s. to bring his remuneration up to £7 5s. The ex-serviceman has been receiving the war pension for some disability ever since his discharge. It is being being paid to him, as I have said repeatedly, to place him on an even footI ing with civilians who did not enlist and do not suffer physical disabilities. Therewhen an ex-serviceman becomes eligible for an age pension-o r a service pension as it is called under the repatriafor tion legislation-becaus e he is able to draw it five years earlier than his civilian for a colleague, this generous Government an applies the screw. The Minister addedIf no limitation were made, then, in the ! case of a member and wife, where the member receiviiijr the highest rate of war pension, is the special rate designed for the needs ti meinour unable to earn, it would be possible for the member nnd wife to receive pension of los. in addition to war The ex-serviceman to whom the Minister referred in that passage comes under the a JSecond Schedule. He is not allowed to receive the same amount as is the ordinary civilian. The Government should be ashamed to attach this tag to an ex-serviceman who applies for a service pension. The other matters dealt with in the bill are of little importance. However, before dealing with the report of the No. 1 War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal I propose to bring a couple of cases .before the Minister. One was brought to my notice only today. It concerns the mother of an unmarried son who was killed at the war, her husband having died as an invalid pensioner. According to the Repatriation Commission she cannot get a pension for her adopted son. The act provides that "" dependants "" shall include the widowed mother of an unmarried son, the children of any such person, and "" such other members of the family of that person as were wholly or in part dependent upon his earnings at any time within twelve months prior to his enlistment or appointment""; yet this woman, since her son was killed on active service in April, 1943, has been deprived of a pension for her adopted son, even though her husband was an invalid pensioner. Her son was eighteen when he enlisted, and contributed to the upkeep of the family. Eor the Repatriation Commission to say that because the child is an adopted son, he is not entitled to an allowance, is just an easy way to get out of its obligation. I propose to send the details of this case to the Minister with a request that something be done. The second case concerns the entitlement of a man who enters a repatriation hospital. I am familiar with the details of this case and I mention it to ascertain whether or not the interpretation of the Australian Soldiers' Eepatriation Act in this instance ircorrect. If it i.« correct, the act should be amended. I have a great regard for the work of repatriation officers and for doctors and sisters in repatriation hospitals, and I should not like to see their interests prejudiced. In the case to which I refer the ex-serviceman was suffering from ear trouble and had been receiving medical attention for some time. During the winter of this year, he contracted influenza, and the same doctor treated him. The doctor had tcld the patient previously that he would have to prepare to go '-into hospital or to ilr. Hamilton. attend a hospital every 'three or four hours for penicillin injections: When the man contracted influenza, the doctor said that the best thing to do was to go to a repatriation hospital where he could receive penicillin for his ear and at tinsame time be treated for his influenza. The man entered a repatriation hospital with a temperature of 101 degrees on a Thursday. On the following morning he was asked by the sister in charge of the ward if he could make his way to tinfront of the hospital to see the specialist who was to look at his ear. He saw the specialist, who syringed his ear and said. "" This man is for discharge "". The man went back and told the sister that he was marked for discharge. She said to him. "" You are not getting out of this hospital for two or three days because you still have a temperature. Go back to bed'"" He mentioned what had happened u< other inmates and said, "" If I am going out tomorrow I must walk about to get accustomed to being on my pins"". That morning when the ward doctor came roundj without bidding the usual *' cheerio "" to the patient, he said, "" Thii. man is marked for discharge"". Th»sister said, "" He cannot be discharged, because he is still running a temperature "". The. doctor said, "" There is no entitlement for treatment shown on hi> form and he must be discharged "". Thtfollowing morning the patient got hitknife, fork, spoon and his other gear and presented himself at the front of the hospital. One of the doctors there said. "" You look seedy and should not be going out"". The man said, "" I have arranged for transport and I am on my way homf to bed "". The doctor said, "" All right, sign there "", and presented a paper to him. [f that man had not had a vehicle to meet hira he would have had to walk from the hospital a distance of three-quarters of a mile to catch a trolley bus. Anything could have happened to him while he was on his way into the city, as he was running a temperature. I bring that instance to the notice of the House because, if that man had collapsed and the newspapers had become acquainted with the facts they would have imade a great song about what happened. I am prepared to believe that a mistake was made by the doctor, but I have been told by other patientsthat unless there is an entitlement on the man's form for him to be treated for something outside the complaint covered by the form he could not be treated. That seems crass stupidity, because if a patient develops something .vhile i.n a hospital or complications setin regarding some ailment he already had when he entered it, heshould be rreated, and the doctors, sisters and nurses ih the repatriation hospital should not be hogtied by regulations so that they are unable to treat him, thus making it necessary-for him to leave the hospital, make a-n application to be treated and return for later treatment. I refer to this particular instance so that the Minister may enlighten the House regarding the - ixact position. I do not wish to say any more about it as I believe the House is fully cognizant of the fact that such cases occur, but I can guarantee that what I have said is the truth, because the patient concerned was none other than myself. F could have kicked up quite a noise about that incident but I did not wish to - lo so. The Minister should make it known to the people of Australia that the incident occurred because of a wrong interpretation of the act. But if it --vas not a wrong interpretation of the net, the act should be altered to obviate such incidents in the future. I hope that it was a wrong interpretation and that where a man develops a fresh ailment while in a repatriation hospital, or where complications associated with an ailment from which he was already suffering set in, it shall be incumbent on the hospital to treat him rather than send him home while he is running a temperature or is in a sick condition. If such incidents occur ancl become known in the community the people will abuse the Bepatriation Commission ancl the doctors who are giving time to treating ex-servicemen. [ propose to devote a few moments rhe report of the War Pensions Entitlecontinues-^ment Appeal Tribunal, because I believe that although it is an indictment of the functions Government the Minister should welcome ir because what is contained in the report is' also the consensus of opinion of exhave - iPrvieftmen and ex-servicewomen. If tliere injustices. is any discontent it should be rectified <onn as possible. If what the memthat bersof the tribunal have to say is true T repeat that the Minister should be only too-pleased to take any action, necessary to remedy defects in. the system. When the members of the tribunal can say that although in their previous annual report they reported that section 47 of the act was not being administered faithfully by the Repatriation Commission and its officers, no improvement; ha.d since been discerned but that the position had deteriorated and was "" adversely affecting widows, sick, and wounded ex-members of the forces and their dependants "", it is rather alarming. I shall not weary the House by reading all the report but I shall quote some extracts from it. It states that the cases mentioned- serveto illustrnte thaX the provisions of suction 47 are uot being applied hy the Repatriation Commission. J have met many of the men connected with, repatriation and know that they are earnest and genuine, but they are unable to watch every little move. There is not the slightest doubt that some of the administration, particularly in regard to section 47, is being allowed by some officers to go by the board. The tribunal says there is no need for any maladministration regarding this section of the act because, as it points outXo controversial or difficult questions eith.er <)i law or fact,, which t-ould justify the original rejection of the claims, nrooc in any one of these cases. They were simple and straightforward and, ou theevidence before the commission., fell faiifly within the entitlement provisions of the act. But they were rejected out of hand by the Repatriation Commission without any reasons being assignedI n view of that I say there should be some investigation made to ensure that section 47 particularly is administered properly. I repeat, that it is absolutely useless adopting any amendments to increase pensions when the. base upon which pension claims rest is not treated correctly to under the act. The tribunal's report A tribunal does uot sufficiently discharge its simply by allowing appeals of this nature. There are considerations which must urge any responsible body to endeavourto altered a system which leads t<l> such as I agree entirely with those words. Now the tribunal has gone as far as it possibly can by investigating the position and furnishing a report it is incumbent upon the Government to act. If it is enough for those men to stake their posihad tions by submitting a report such as this, it behoves the Government and every honourable member in this House to do their utmost to see that the provisions the act are administered correctly. Further on the report statesFinally, and perhaps more important than ull, a sick and disabled member of the forces is deprived, during the waiting period, of expert medical aid and attention which have been available had the case been iproperly dealt with and determined in the first instance. I know that statement to be true. Recently, I had occasion to approach Minister with regard to a man who had been unable to secure a pension. I thank Tribunal the honourable gentleman for the tious way in which he dealt with matter. The man concerned was serving in the Navy. Having performed a tour of duty, he was granted 4S hours' leave. He went, to his home and then, with his wife and family, to a beach. He had not been there very long when be was attacked by a shark. He was taken to hospital, where his leg was amputated. occurred in February, 1946. He was the given an artificial limb and eventually The report goes ondischarged from the Navy. He applied tor a pension, but his claim was rejected on the ground that he was not on duty once at the time when the accident happened. He told me that he was not urgently in before rejecting a claim. need of a pension for his maintenance, and that he considered that he had fairly treated by being allowed to learn chemistry under the post-war reconstrucexist. tion training scheme. He said, however, rhat because his application for a penassistance sion had been rejected his artificial f:ould not be properly serviced or maincourse, tained. He had to take his turn with civilians, and as most of the parts that are required in the maintenance of ficial limbs go to the artificial limb tory that is run by the Eepatriation Commission he could not obtain satiscases factory service. I approached the Minisa ter and pointed out. that all servicemen are told that leave is a privilege and not a right. A pension was subsequently granted to this man. Why could it not have been granted in the first place ? The fact that it was not so granted meant that Mr Hamilton. the man was deprived of expert medical aid and attention for a lengthy periodgood a period of more than two years. He to stand on an ill-fitting artificial limb all day whilst he was endeavouring to learn the art of chemistry. The reason that his pension was not granted of originally was that somebody said he was on leave and not on duty at the time when the accident occurred but, as I have already said, all servicemen are told thai leave is a privilege and not a right and the they are on duty for 24 hours a day, for would seven days a week and for 365 days in a year. They are also told that they may be recalled from leave at any time. When cases such as those to which the reference is made in the report of No. 1 War Pensions Entitlement Appeal are brought to light, expediit is incumbent upon the Govern the ment or some other responsible body to investigate them and ensure that justice is done. The tribunal stated that no 'controversial or difficult questions, either of law or fact, arose in the cases to which it referred in its report; they were clear and straightforward - Men who cannot deal with such case!That should be dismissed, not men who hav<courage to make a report such as this. These considerations, therefore, impel u« more. to emphasize the necessity for proper advertence by the Repatriation Commission of the relevant portions of the act , Applicants for pensions should receive been every consideration. They should be given the benefit of any doubt that may The majority of ex-servicemen will not apply to the Government for unless it is absolutely neceslimb sary for them to do so. There are, of some of them who are prepared to impose upon the Minister and the Eepatriation Commission, but the ex-serviceartimen's organizations are prepared to fachelp in weeding them out. There 'are some malingerers, but in the majority of an ex-serviceman who applies for pension is in need of it because there is something wrong with him. I hope that future tribunals will be removed entirely from the control of the Minister for Eepatriation. I suggest that one could be appointed by the Attorney General's Department to investigate claims. It woulcl be free to criticize either applicants for pensions or the administration of the Bepatriation Department. The members of the tribunals should not be appointed by the Minister for Repatriation, because in many cases they are placed in the position of having to endeavour to prove that claims that have been rejected by the Repatriation Department are just claims which should be granted. I do not propose to detain the House any longer. I trust that the Minister will give serious consideration this report. I do not regard it entirely as a castigation of the honourable gentleman. I am prepared to accept it as a report that has been submitted for the consideration of a responsible body, and there is no more responsible body in Australia, than this Parliament. I support the amendnient that has been moved by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White).",57
154,Mr GULLETT,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Henty) [10.28] - A remarkable feature of this debate is the lack of interest in it by honourable members opposite. Only three of them so far have seen fit to take part in the debate upon a bill which will vitally affect the welfare of ex-servicemen. I could not help counting the number of Government supporters who were present in the chamber as the debate proceeded. At 5 o'clock this evening there were five of them, and at 9 o'clock there were nine.",62
155,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF, Order ! The honourable gentleman must confine his remarks to the bill - I emphasize that it is not an increase,62
156,Mr GULLETT,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I am referring to the lack of interest in this debate by orable members opposite. At, 10 o'clock this evening only three of them were present in the chamber. Mr AOTING DEPUTY SPEAKER. - The attendance in the House is irrelevant to the question that is now before the Chair.",62
157,Mr GULLETT,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"This is a bill which should be dealt with on a non-party basis, and it is a pity that honourable members opposite have not expressed their views upon it more freely. I deplore the fact that the Minister for Bepatriation (Mr. Barnard) is so resolutely opposed to the amendment which has been moved by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr. White), and which I support. The amendment proposes that a parliamentary select committee of ex-servicemen be appointed to inquire into and report upon present repatriation pension rates with a view to better equating those rates to present living oosts. An all-party committee was appointed to advise the Government with respect, to the payment of war gratuity, and by following that procedure the Government completely reto moved that issue from party political considerations. Whatever our attitude may be towards other problems and, indeed, to other pensions, the discharge of the country's obligation in respect, of those who were killed or severely wounded on war service should be dealt with absolutely apart from party political considerations. I should like the Minister for Repatriation to indicate that, that is the Government's attitude. The chief objective of the amendment is to set up machinery for the fixation of a basic pension and the automatic adjustment of that pension to meet increases of the cost of - living. The very fact that the House now has before it, a bill for the express purpose of making this very paltry increase of pension seems to me to be an admission of the inefficiency of the present system. As the cost of living increases and the needs of pensioners become more costly, machinery should be available to adjust the rate of pension to those needs. There is no pretence on the Government's part that this proposed increase of 5 per cent. of 10 per cent - wil l enable the pensioner to meet the rising cost of living. It is honmerely to catch up with certain increases that have taken place in the needs of pensioners in recent times. When we look at. the "" C "" series cost-of-living index figures on whioh the basic wage is substantially computed, we see that the cost of those items has increased by 10 per cent,, during the last few months. Therefore, the increase of pension now proposed will not cover proportionately even recent increases of the. cost of those items. The rat* of pension should be automatically adjusted to meet increases of the cost of living in the same way as the basic wage is now varied on that basis. That would be preferable to maintaining the present system under which long overdue increases of pension can be made only through nets of Parliament, and, indeed, as the Ministeialmost suggests, through aets of grace. As the right honourable member for North .Sydney (Mr Hughes) has said, the plain fact is that today all war pensions are of less value in proportion to the basic wage than they were 2."") ypars ago. No greater justification can be found for the amendment which the honourable member for Balaclava has put forward. I can see no reason why the Government should not appoint an all-party committee to examine this matter as he proposes. That course was followed most successfully in its approach to a war gratuity. Furthermore, I believe rhat the Minister will agree that ex-servicemen's organizations have been, remarkably non-party political in their approach to this problem.",62
158,Mr BARNARD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,Especiall y the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Harrison) !,63
159,Mr GULLETT,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"The fact remains that ex-servicemen's organizations generally have approached this problem in a national way. When we consider that one of them, the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, is potentially one of the most powerful bodies in this country, more powerful than any trade union, and if capable of bringing tremendous influence to bear on any government should it wish to do so, but has preferred to play t'he game, the Minister might have the grace to admit that those organizations have treated the Government generously in this matter. The Government should be equally generous in its attitude to this problem., and should accede to the requests made by those organizations. The Treasurer (Mr Chifley) in his budget said plainly that pensions were to be increased by 10 per cent.; but the Government proposes, in this instance, to increase war pensions, aot by 10 per cent., but by 5 per cent. Ten per cent, of 100s. is 10s., but the pension is to be increased by only os. Yet the Government pretends that it is increasing these pensions by 10 per cent. That is chicanery. T wonder at the effrontery of the Minister in persisting in this attempt to "" put one over"" the country, particularly at the expense of this most deserving section of the community, which is now to be offered a paltry pension increase of 5s. As the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr. Bowden) said, one would think that the Government was increasing the war service pension by £5 a week instead of 'by a few paltry shillings. Let us look at, the provisions .which the Minister claims are most generous. A war widow with oue child will receive a pension of £4 5s. a week. She and her child are placed in exactly the same category as two age pensioners. Of course, every one admits that even on that pension two age pensioners are receiving no more than the bare minimum on which to subsist. The first feature of the war widow's pension which I criticize is this ""minimum"" attitude which the Government constantly adopts towards war widows. Apparently, it approaches the matter by asking itself. "" What is the very least Ave can give them? What can two old people, whose days are nearly numbered, live on ? Thai will suffice for the war widow and her child to live on "". The needs of the two classes of pensioners differ considerably. First, costs must be incurred in respect of a growing child which do not necessarily confront old people. .Secondly, age. pensioners are entitled to earn income in addition to their pension whereas a war widow's child in respect of whom a pension is payable is not capable of earning any income. The obligations to the two classes of pensioners also vary greatly. After all, let us remember that in the case of a Avar widow the Government asked the breadwinners of the family, the young men of this country, at the height of their earning capacity to go away and fight in defence of the nation. Ministerial supporters urged those young men to go away and fight in the armed services and promised them that if anything happened to them their wives and families Would be adequately cared for. They did not say to those young men that if anything happened to them their wives and children Would be given the age pension. They said nothing of the kind. I wonder how the Minister can sit at the table and so comfortably pass off the fact that the Government is now asking war widows to subsist on the barest minimum. T cannot accept the present basis of war pensions. Those who went away at the height of their earning capacity to fight in. the defence of their country should not be cut down to the lowest living standards. I can see no justification for the view that war pensioners should be considered as coming exactly within the same category as other pensioners. They should be treated in a special category. They had no chance, as is given, for example, to .age pensioners, to make some provision for tiieir old age. The Government by its own actions has cut them off from old age. It ill becomes Government supporters always to speak in minimum terms and to suggest that if the husband of a war widow had returned from war service he probably would not be capable of earning much more than the basic wage. That is drivel. C admit that when an honourable memdealing ber makes representations to the Minishope ter dealing with specific cases, the ter invariably replies. In some instances he shows great patience in investigating the matters raised. I wish to bring one or two cases under the notice of lionorable gentleman. As the Minister knows, totally .and pei'manemtly citated ex-servicemen are not permitted to work and earn money in order to able supplement their pensions. As the honourable gentleman rightly says, because of their disabilities very few of them are capable of doing so. Sufferers from tuberculosis, however, are in a somewhat different category. Many of them could earn something. Some of them write, and some are engaged in various crafts the hospitals and other institutions where - tliey are undergoing treatment. I have received a letter from an ex-serviceman suffering from tuberculosis which unforI tunately, for a reason which I shall state, [ cannot hand to the Minister, indicating that many ex-servicemen suffering from i uberculosis are most anxious to earn - a little with, which to supplement their pensions, but because they are in the totally and permanently incapacitated category, they are prevented from doing so. I am loath to hand the letter to the Minister because my correspondent has informed ine that a similar letter was written .to a government member some months ago with the request that he should do something about it, but the honourable member concerned did not even have the decency to reply.",63
160,Mr BARNARD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I invite the honovable membei"" to bring the letter to me and discuss it with ine.",64
161,Mr GULLETT,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I shall do so. Another aspect of this legislation which ] wish to bring to the notice of the Minister is the unfairness of the provision reducing the war pensions of ex-servicemen whose wives are earning. A war pension is paid to an ex-serviceman to compensate him for disabilities arising out of his war service, and should be paid irrespective of what his wife may earn. If the earnings of a war pensioner's wife be taken into consideration the pensioner is placed in an extremely 'humiliating position. I shall hand to the Minister correspondence which I have received with a case of that kind in the that the honourable gentleman will Minisgive it sympathetic consideration. In quoting the report of the No. 1 War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal, the the honourable member for Flinders (Mr. Ryan) drew pointed attention to the incapafollowing statemen't:Too often the gathering of evidence favor to a claun is left to the appellant or hi* representative. I realise that it would be impracticable for the Minister to interview every appellant mdividually. Honourable members, however, have to interview many of them in the course of our duties. Many ex-servicemen complain that they appear before the at entitlement tribunal repeatedly without getting satisfaction. Some of them are called upon to prove that they were in a certain place in France 30 years ago. t is almost impossible for them to obtain witnesses to substantiate their claims as to their whereabouts so long ago. All too frequently, because of their inability to dr. so, their appeals against the refusal of tinRepatriation Commission to grant them pensions are rejected by the tribunal. I ask the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to that aspect of the problem. Finally, I trust that the Government will reconsider its decision in relation to - the meagre increases proposed to be granted in the pensions of totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen and that it will agree to accept the .amendment so that pensions will in future be adjusted to living costs just as wages are at present.",64
162,Mr MCEWEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Indi) [10.45] - In - supporting the amendment moved by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr. White), I shall endeavour to make my points without introducing party politics into this debate. Honourable members who have spoken from this side - of the House have made out a case for the submission of this important subject of war pensions to an all-party body which should be given a charter fully to - examine the existing scale and the implications of repatriation pensions and benefits. I do not propose to traverse the ground so adequately covered by the honourable member for Balaclava and the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Harrison) and other honourable members - on this side of the House, nor do I desire to introduce acrimony into the debate. It is surely sufficient to remind the Government that the No. 1 War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal has reported in the terms quoted by the Acting Leader of the Opposition. Amongst other things the tribunal statedIn our last annual report we observed the provisions of section 47 of the act were not f u l ly appreciated by the Repatriation Commission and its officers. We pointed also that proper attention by the Repatriation Comniission to those provisions would have resulted in a considerable number of claims being allowed without the necessity for appeal to this tribunal. Not only has no improvement since been discerned, but the /position has deteriorated and is adversely affecting widows, sick wounded ex-members of the forces and dependants. That is a damning indictment by a trisiderably bunal constituted of carefully selected men, the chairman of which was specially chosen because of his capacity for sifting evidence. In cold, simple English, the tribunal has reported to the Government that not only is the Bepatriation mission not fully appreciative of its gations, but also that, although it drew the attention of the Government to that fact in its earlier report, the position since deteriorated. Its statement is backed by pages of reasoned argument and by chapter and verse of specific cases. I do not propose to set myself up as a judge in this matter. The Government may have an answer' to the statement. I trust that it will not consider that a party political answer is sufficient to rebut it. The answer to an indictment of that kind can be furnished only by a non-party body. If the Government has a better proposal than that suggested by the honourable member for Balaclava, by all means let us hear and consider it. In the absence of a better proposal, however, the Government must accept the suggestion made by the honourable member. A case has been made out for the reference of this matter to an investigating body. Surely we cannot afford to lie under the charge of doing less than justice to men who have served and suffered in preserving our freedom. Even apart from the criticism of the No. 1 Tribunal there is a mass of evidence, so simple as to provoke queries in the minds of all reasonable people, as to whether we are honouring our obligations to ex-servicemen. Statistics will show that, over a recent period of years, the pension, which is, at least on the full scale, the means of living of a disabled soldier, has not kept pace with the increasing cost of living as indicated by that standard accepted by all Australians, the basic wage. No that argument which justifies the progressive increase of the basic wage does not apply with equal force in favour of a conout current and commensurate progressive increase of war pensions. Recent increases of the basic wage provide evidence that an war pensions have not kept pace with the cost of living. A comparison of the upward variation of war pension rates with and the upward variation of the age pension their produces the same result. Since 1934, the age pension has increased by conover 100 per cent., whereas war pensions have increased by about 30 per cent. I do not suggest that such a comparison is the ideal criterion. It is not. Probably good arguments could, be produced to prove that the age pension rate Comis not a proper measuring stick, but, obliwhatever measuring stick may be used, whatever statistics may be advanced, all will show that, of all the steps that gohas vernments have taken to keep pace with rising costs of living, the least effective steps have been taken in regard to war pensions. Consider the position of a totally and permanently incapacitated ex-serviceman with a wife. The very term applied to the man's condition implies that he is not capable of earning money. Under this bill, such a man, with a wife, will receive £6 10s. a week. An age pensioner with a wife of pensionable age will be allowed to receive £7 5s. a week, including his permissible extra earnings, small though that amount may be. Surely this disparity does not bear I'.xamination. Surely it is not reasonable that we should set a lower standard of living for a disabled ex-serviceman and his wife than is set for an age pensioner and his wife. I do not acknowledge for a moment that a comparison of war pension rates with the basic wage is fair because every one of us, as a man of the world, knows that few people do not earn something additional to their weekly wages since the 10-hour week was introduced. The opportunities afforded by the shorter working week have been availed of by thousands of wage-earners because they consider that they need the additional income, even though, in the first place, nearly all of them receive more than the basic wage. There is no opportunity for the totally and permanently incapacitated ex-serviceman to supplement his income in i.he same way. I shall not ask that, Hansard be cluttered up with further statistics to substantiate what I have said. I have presented facts and figures in simple language, and I say that a case has been made, crystal clear, for a review of the whole basis of repatriation benefits.",65
163,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,Eea d the recommendation of the tribunal.,66
164,Mr MCEWEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"The final recommendation of the entitlement appeal tribunal supports our case. It statesThe tribunal recommends that a general int|uiry into the administration of the Repatrianeurosis tion Act, including an investigation into the matters raised in this report, be conducted by a competent authority having no association with the Repatriation Department. That is a very strong and unusual kind of recommendation to be made by any instrument of a government. The men who signed that recommendation are not inexperienced.",66

I hope that the Minister will endeavour to explain all the circumstances in which the gentlemen who made that caustic report '",66
167,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,A valuable report.,66
168,Mr MCEWEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"An invaluable report! I hope that there will be some explanation of why those men were not reappointed as a. tribunal. All that I have said has been said fully, and probably better, by my colleagues. However, ] wish to discuss another point that, in my opinion, is of special importance. I think that the Minister will consider that it is worthy of serious consideration. It relates to war widows' pensions. The Government has decided to increase the rate of war widows' pensions, and I am quick to appreciate that decision. Nevertheless, the question whether some classes of pensioners are adequately provided with a means of living is' open to argument. A widow with six children receives £9 10s. a week, including child endowment. I admit that that is a substantial sum, and I do not offer any criticism of it. But I refer to widows without dependants who receive £3 a week. We all know that many such widows have been unable to undertake work. I should think that, in such circumstances, a widow who is bodily and mentally fit is not unreasonably situated. Therefore, I have no criticism to make of the provision that is made for her. However, I point out that some childless widows are not able to take jobs because of physical ill health or because of arising from the very circumstances of war which made them widows. I put it to the Government that £3 a week is not enough in those circumstances for a woman, to live on.",66
169,Mr BARNARD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,Would the honourable gentlemember apply a means test? Mr MCEWEN;-No .,66
170,Mr BAKNAKD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"-Tb.eii he would give :rhe same amount to the widow whose income from private sources is £2,000 a year as he would to the widow who is not - tble to work, and has no income apart -'rom her pension?",67
171,Mr MCEWEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,The Minister is put- i ng words into my mouth.,67
172,Mr BAKNAKD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"No , T am merely asking a question.",67
173,Mr MCEWEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"The Minister is suggesting that I have something in mind, which, in fact, is not in my mind at all. He mentioned a means test. If there .vere any situation in which a means test might be applied, this is one, but I would resist the application of a means test because it is contrary to our whole conception of the national responsibility towards - ervicemen and their dependants to apply a means test to war pensions. However, I propose to place before the Minister a suggestion which I ask him to explore.",67
174,Mr BAKNAKD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,I shall be glad to hear 'lie honourable member's suggestion.,67
175,Mr MCEWEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I suggest that, just ns there are entitlement tribunals to examine the claims of ex-servicemen for pensions, so there should be a tribunal to which a war widow might apply, and which would determine whether she was, in fact, unable to work, and whether she was eligible for a pension of more than £3 a week; in short, whether she should receive a pension upon which she could live. [ am not going to say what the amount onght to be. I do not believe that members of the Parliament should say what wages ought to be, or what pensions - mght to be. It may be decided that the amount should be £4 10s. a week, or £5 a week. The amendment to which I am speaking proposes that an all-party committee of the Parliament be appointed to i-onsider matters of that kind. A war widow who, because of ill-health or war neurosis, is unable to work, cannot live in decency on £3 a week. We have also to consider the position the widow with one child. Prima facie, rhe childless widow is an independent person who can go to work, can board - or take a room, or live with parents or relatives. The war widow with a child. however, is in recognizably different circumstances. iShe must have a domicile. Is it suggested that she should be compelled to live with relatives ? Is she to be compelled to work while she brings up her child? The answer will be that she receives a pension of £4' 5s. a week upon which to live. I maintain that a widow cannot pay rent and support herself and a child on £4 5s. a week. That is evident to any one who knows the price of women's and children's clothing. To anyone who knows the price of a pair of pants for a boy, or of a pair of shoes for a child, it is ridiculous to suggest that a war widow and her child can live on £4 5s. a week. The government which proposes such a thing, and the Parliament which endorses it, must accept as inevitable the fact that a widow in such circumstances shall throw herself ' upon the charity of some one, or neglect the up-bringing of her child while she goes out to work. That is not decent, and we ought not to approve of it. If ever there was an issue of real human concern for the consideration of the Parliament it is this matter of the rights of the war widow and her children. I pay a tribute to the magnificent work' done by Mrs Vasey, the widow of General Vasey, in arousing the publio conscience in this matter. I have sat at a conference and listened to her, and have been made to feel ashamed that more has not been clone for war widows and war orphans. That shame is still with me. and will remain with me until something has been done to better the condition of life for the widows and orphan dependants of the young men who, in the flush of their manhood, gave their lives in defence of their country. There is not so much involved. There are only 3,500 war widows without children, of whom probably 3,000 are able to take employment, or have means of their own. Therefore, to raise the pension from £3 a week to £4 10s. or £5 would not cost a vast amount of money for a government which can contemplate the expenditure of more than £500,000,000 a year. There are of only 2,800 war widows with one child, and 1,480 with two children. That is not a tremendous number, and their voting strength is insignificant. ""On the other hand the voting strength of age pensioners and their .relativesis tremendous. It is a matter for ouishame that the amount of attention that is given in pensions proposals seems to be related to the numerical votingstrength of the pensioners involved. If we were debating a. bill relating to aged pensioners I venture to say that there would not be 10 per eent. of the members on the Government side of the House who would not speak on it.",67
176,Mr FUXKER,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,The honourable member has a wicked mind.,68
177,Mr MCEWEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I have been sitting in this Parliament for fourteen years and [ feel impelled to reiterate that assertion. Year after year when bills dealing with age pensioners are introduced, members of the Australian Labour party take pride in speaking on such measures. Whilst I do not rebuke them for that it is a fact that those pensioners number hundreds of thousands. War widows, on the other hand, number fewer than 10,000. T am told that the figure is only 3.600.",68
178,Mr EOIAER,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"The soldiers always support, this Government.",68
179,Mr MCEWEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Whateve r the explanation may be, the fact remains that members of the Australian Labour party have not supported any proposals for the amelioration of the conditions of war widows. However, I do not wish to talk party politics, and I am sorry that I have started on that line, because I do not want to spoil any consideration that may be extended to people who are in dire necessity of sympathetic treatment. I trust that the Government will favourably consider this matter. I shall refrain from pursuing this line with respect to widows with greater numbers of children because if favourable consideration is given to the classes of widows under discussion, other categories would automatically benefit. I rest my submission on the plight of the childless widows who are unable to work and are therefore doomed to rely on the charity of others. They should not have to rely on charity. Likewise, war widows who have one child only, should not be compelled to rely on charity. Such a widow should not be forced to put her child in a creche by Hay so that she can go 'Out to work. Would asay 'hioii'orarble member 'have dared to tell the men, as they were enlisting, that if they were unfortunate enough to be killed, widows with one child would be given, only £4 5s. a. week, despite the high cost of living? Not one of us would have dared to do that because the country would have risen in revolt.",68
180,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,It is disgraceful.,68
181,Mr MCEWEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Surely , our sense of responsibility has not passed with the termination of hostilities. I appeal to the Government to give consideration to this class cf widows, and I again express the thanks of thousands of women in this countiy to Mrs Vasey for having aroused the conscience of the Australian people. Whether the Government recognizes thai fact or uot, the conscience of the Australian people has been aroused to the plight of the majority of war widows.",68
182,Mr HUTCHINSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Deakin) [11.15J. - That I have uot spoken previously on this matter is not attributable to any lack of sympathy on my part with the problems of ex-servicemen. There are, in this House, many ex-service members, who, .1 believe, are in closer contact with returned servicemen's organizations than I am. Usually I abide by the views they present, but I am impelled to speak on this matter now because of the attack thai has been made on the Government. It is the most devastating attack that has been made on any government for a greal number.of years, if not in the history of the Australian Parliament. Not one Government member has risen to defend the bill under debate. Surely there is a reason for that. Is it that the Government members are ashamed of the bill or is it that they have no sympathy with the problems of ex-servicemen?",68
183,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,The reason may be that their remarks would react against them.,68

185,Mr BARNARD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,The Government will pay them then.,68
186,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I rise to order, and in doing so I point out that if the amendment before the House is carried, the Opposition will grant immediate passage to the bill. The Government is just humbugging.",68

188,Mr BAKNAKD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,The Government wants rhe bill passed in its present form.,69
189,Mr HUTCHINSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"If that is so, rind Government members are satisfied with it, why do they not rise in support - if the Minister? Despite the fact that many members of the Opposition have spoken during this debate, no reply has heen given by Government members. I believe that the majority of ex-service members on the Government side of the House believe in their hearts that this M disgraceful bill, the provisions of which completely disregard all laws of equity in respect of a big body of people in this country. It must mean that Government members, by drilling and coercion hehind the scenes, have degenerated into an impersonalized lot of "" kordies "". They remain seated, and thus support the measure. They are prepared to let it go without saying a word. The suggestion made by the honourable member for Balaclava that an all-party committee should be appointed to investigate this problem, is worthy of adoption. After all, it must bo remembered that a similar body was appointed to inquire into war gratuity problems, and good results were achieved. In view of the fact that many millions of pounds are to be expended, such a committee should be appointed. The all-party parliamentary committee which considered the matter of war gratuities made a recommendation which gave satisfaction to most members of this chamber nnd also to ex-servicemen's organizations. Why could not the same system have been used in this instance? Differences of opinion regarding the problems of ex-servicemen are matters which could best be settled by a non-party committee. Unfortunately that suggestion has been rejected by the Government and, as I have said, it has become necessary to have a party debate in this House. I wish to deal now with the position of permanently and totally incapacitated ex-servicemen. Living costs are rising. Every time a coal-mine closes down, » strike occurs, steel-workers fail to maintain full production, or there is a reducI f tion of effort on the part of men anywhere in industry, output is reduced and this in turn tends to increase livingcosts. In the toils of this situation are caught the permanently and totally incapacitated ex-servicemen. It may be said that other ex-servicemen who are receiving war pensions are similarly affected, but they are not debarred from participating in the normal active life of the community, and, to some degree at least, basic wage variations compensate for increased living costs but that is noi so with totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen. They are debarred entirely from working, and no is provision is made to vary their remuneration to meet a rise in the cost of living. They have been permanently maimed. Some are blinded or have lost limbs, whilst others may suffer internal injuries which make them incapable of doing useful woirk. As I have said, these men are caught in the toils of rising living costs. ' They are in a worse position than are invalid and age pensioners because they cannot earn any income. What is the Government's explanation of its attitude to this section of the community? I cannot understand why, so far, no explanation has been forthcoming, nor can I understand why the Prime Minister deliberately misled the House and the country when he said in his budget speech that there would be a general increase of 10 per cent, in all war pensions. It is obvious to anybody who has studied this measure that an increase of os. represents only 5 per cent., and that the permanently and totally incapacitated ex-servicemen are the only pensioners who are not to receive an increase commensurate with the rise in living costs. The attention of the Prime Minister was drawn to this matter by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr. White). The right honourable gentleman wasasked whether he had made a mistake, and whether he would reconsider this matter. He said that he would; but all we know today is that the Government intends to put this bill through in its present form. The Minister for Eepatriation admitted quite frankly that the Prime Minister misled the House and che eountry. In other words, he made a deliberate misstatement, because totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen are not to share the general 10 per cent, increase. The only explanation that one can find for this attitude is that offered by the honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen), namely, that whilst the Governinent has to take some notice of the demands of powerful sections of the community, and is prepared to assuage any malice that such groups may have towards the Government, it is prepared to disregard completely the needs of less fluential sections, whose votes, in any event, may not go to government supporters. War widows have been mentioned. What does the Government care about war widows ? It cares little because their numbers are small. Similarly, because there are not many permanently and totally incapacitated ex-servicemen in the community, their needs can be disregarded. L leave the problem there, but I warn the Government that outside t.he Parliament there is amongst ex-servicemen's organizations, and people who are intimately connected with ex-servicemen, a rising fear of the danger that confronts ihis country in the broad general policy of the Government There is also a. recognition of the fact that the scales of equity are loaded against ex-servicemen, particularly those who suffer permanent, and total incapacity. .

Uaint ENID LYONS - To-day , at question time, I asked the Minister for immigratio n (Mr Calwell) a question which I hoped would bear some f r u it of value to Australia, The question was as follows:Is ' it a fact that the so-called ""Manila girls"" are holders of valid Australian passports renewed in Manila, and that vises granted by the United States autliorities were issued on these passports? Is it a fact that a refusal to issue such vises would have been contrary to normal diplomatic practice between friendly powers and will the Minister concede the same rights to these girls as to the eight Australian girls working for the American authorities in Tokyo who, it is reported in today's press, will he permitted to remain V Tf not, why not? I asked that question in the hope that it would lead the Minister to make a statenient that would be of value to this country and to the other country involved, but I received only the following answer:If the honourable member wiil put the question on the notice-paper T shall guarantee to keep it there until the end of the session. If the Minister is under the impression that this question is not considered important by the public, he is making a grave error. Indeed, I stand that there are honourable members opposite who strongly criticize the action of the Minister, which is high-handed. Lf that is not true of honourable members opposite it is certainly true of the people outside who support them. I presume that the attitude of the Government is based on the hope that this matter will die a natural death. Let me put it to the Government that it cannot be allowed to die a natural death, because certain very important principles are involved. in Manila, Mr H . A . Peterson.",70
193,Mr HAYLEK,KKCALL OF AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS FROM,Publicit y principles.,71
194,Dame ENID LYONS,KKCALL OF AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS FROM,"The honorpermittin able member for Parkes (Mr Haylen) possibly has no appreciation of the fact that there are motives, which sometimes actuate people, beyond personal or party advantages and not for publicity purbasis poses. To some people this matter may be of little relative importance, and indeed it has been asked why so much fuss other <hould be made about these girls. That reminds me of the first description I read of nn air raid in England, written by A, G. MCDonell. He stated that on the morning after the air raid his family took up the newspaper to see what the report was. The report said, after a graphic description of the air raid, that the loss of l if e was negligible. MCDonell said, "" We were interested and wondered whose negligible life had been lost"". The individuals who are the centre of this upset are only a few girls, but they are of importance. They are human beings. They are Australians, and cannot just be set aside as being of no importance whatever. There are other issues, of course, and I put it to the House that in the question that I asked today, I offered certain suggestions to the Alinister, of which he took no notice, that the present situation, as it affects the two governments, is founded upon a misunderstanding. I do not believe that any one in Australia doubts that there was an agreement. That there was no formal written agreement appears to be evident and we have not doubted the Minister's word that there was an agreement of some kind. I put it to him. that when the Australian consul at Manila renewed these passports to permit these girls to travel abroad, our side of any agreement became untenable. I quote from the under- press of the 7th October, which statedI t was stated to-dny that Australian consular authorities in Manila including the then Australian Consul to Manila (Mr H. A. Peterson) had validated passports for the girls concerned authorizing them to travel to the United States. The press also stated that one of the girls. Miss Jean Laurie, of Victoria, said that the girls' papers had been extended for five years, and were open for travel to the United States, by the Australian Consul 1 suggest that, those passports having been renewed for the very purpose of g the girls to travel abroad, there was no course open to the United States other than to honour them with a vise. I suggest now that this matter could very well still be settled on the of a misunderstanding, and merely a misunderstanding, between the two governments concerned. But there are still considerations, and these are probably the most important.. There is the question of the girls' own position in thtmatter, and their wishes. On an earlier oecarion I said that people are not cattle. They cannot be disposed of at the behest of the State. The State has no right to dispose of the bodies of its citizens, cept perhaps in time of war under conscription legislation. These girls are now being treated merely as merchandise, to be disposed of according to the wish of the Minister. Let us assume for the moment that the whole of the agreement was in perfect order. It surely has some bearing on the case, that, at the expiration of. the allotted time, the girls had no wish to return to Australia. This matter has some importance in the field of international affairs. Does any one suppose that an incident of this magnitude, involving two governments, one of which has the stature of the leading power in the world, can occur without having repercussions throughout the world? Does any one suppose that in Europe it has caused no more than ripples? I am informed that the Eussian newspaper Pravda has made more than one reference to it, and that Moscow radio has done the same. I understand that these instruments have signified their approval of the action of the Minister. The honourable gentleman can verify those facts for himself. I suggest that the very fact that the incident has been seized upon and become a matter for discussion in the international press is of very great moment to us. FOT my part, I regard this question as one which affects not only Australia, the British Commonwealth and the Tjnited States of America, but the whole idea of western democracy. Some time ago the Minister for Immigration was asked about 20 or 30 young Australians who went to Yugoslavia to be trained in the Communist technique, and he replied that, provided that they were within the law, it was not the business of the Government where Australian nationals went. It is not contended that these girls are outside the law. I cannot help but feel that the Minister is pursuing a course that is not only detrimental to the interests of Australia and to the whole concept of western democracy, but one that is in fact not in accordance with his own truest ideas and beliefs. I hope that he will reconsider his decision. The way is open for him to say that he has pursued a course that has led to considerable misunderstanding, to say the least of it. I feel that the best interests of all ex- will be served, if, even now, the Minister retracts some of the statements that he has made and adopts a new attitude to this matter.",71
195,Mr CHIFLEY,KKCALL OF AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS FROM,"Macquarie-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.42] - I wish to make it perfectly clear that the Government does not intend to engage in lengthy discussion upon this question. I have satisfied myself that an agreement was made. It may be that it was a gentlemen's agreement with regard to ladies, which is of course a dangerous kind of agreement, but it was one that was made at the request of the Americans, and that is not now denied by them. As the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) has said, apparently there was a misunderstanding in regard to some of the girls in Manila or another place. I am fairly certain that some of the people associated with them desired to keep the girls where they were, and 1I have no doubt the girls desired to stay. Even before the war it was not possible for Australian citizens to go to the United States of America, to accept positions there, and to stay for as long as they wanted to stay. It has not been possible to do that at any time. I am informed by the Americans that if Australians go to the United States of America as visitors on a visitor's vise they are not allowed to engage in work there. For over twenty years musicians who have desired to go to the United States of America to play in orchestras there have not been permitted to do so. Australians have never had the right to go to the United States of America and to stay there for as long as they wished to stay. The United States Government has never permited the indefinite extension of vises for the purpose of working in that country. Let that be perfectly clear. Before the war, if somebody went to America and wanted to work there he could stay for only a limited time, unless he was admitted under a very limited quota. The reason why the Government does not propose to engage in lengthy discussions about this matter now is that it is considered that the problem can be solved better by discussions between the t.wo countries on a governmental level than by discussions in this chamber. The United States authorities admit that an agreement was made at their urgent request. As a matter of fact, before it was made, Cabinet had come to a decision upon the case of some men who were required by the United States authorities for certain work. The Minister knew rhat there was a general decision with regard to people going to work for the Americans, but, as the Americans were --nxious to obtain the service of Australian girls until thej' could train American girls, I agreed that these girls - hould be allowed to go on the clear understanding that everybody, including fhey themselves, knew what the position was. As the honourable member for Darwin has said, certain misunderstandings occurred with regard to the extension - if vises in Manila or another place. I rhink that the United States Government and the Australian Government will he able to devise a satisfactory solution of ihis little problem that has arisen. Despite what has been said, it is not of tremendous importance.",72

204,Mr WHITE,KKCALL OF AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS FROM,"The Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) said, "" B e b r i e f "", and then walked cut of the chamber. There is a simple solution of this problem. The Prime Minister and his Ministers talk about a.n agreement that was made, and individual has no that must be adhered to. The agreemeni can be revised having regard to the altered circumstances. The agreemeni made with service personnel was thai they enlisted for the duration of the war and a. year thereafter. Nevertheless, the Government left it cpen to any of it enlisted personnel, men or women, to take their discharge in any country in the world they desired. Many of us availed ourselves of that opportunity after World War I . Although these girls took a war job, they should now be allowed to take tlieir discharge in any country they desire.

205,Mr WHITE,KKCALL OF AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS FROM,"They are very much in the same category as enlisted personnel. They were engaged to do a war joh. Perhaps, they did not wear a uniform : but they worked with service organiza tions or at embassies. It is ridiculous for the Government to behave in the foolish fashion in which it has behaved. In this instance, its attitude differs from that which it adopted in respect of other persons whom it allowed to go to Yugoslavia. It is, bounding these girls. The simple solution cf this problein is for the Governinent to give them their discharge in any country they desire and let them know rhat they will have to return to Australia at their own expense. All of us know rhat, generally, no one can be allowed to accept work in the Tjnited States of America. However, there have been exceptions to that rule. I know of instances in which people have been given a licence to work in that country.

210,Mr DEDMAN,KKCALL OF AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS FROM,"The Minister for S h i p p in g and F u e l has supplied the following information:1. I have not seen the report and cannot confirm that Australia has the largest percen tage of commercial vehicles compared with private vehicles. In the last ten years regietra tions of motor vehicles have increased afollows:Commer- Cars. cial Cycles. vehicles. 30th June, 1938 . . 534,963 241,251 80,114 30th June, 1948 592,512 414,175 101,22] Percentage increase 10.7 . 71.. 3 26.3 2. No. Thu average consumption per unit - - noted for Australian vehicles is incorrect, and probably no more reliable for the other countries mentioned. In New Zealand, for example, the total number of motor vehicles registered at December, 1947, was 340,014 and petrol imports for 1947 totalled 101,538,000 gallons. Even disregarding petrol used for farm machinery, industrial plants, boats, &c, the consumption would work out less than 300 gallons per vehicle. A comparison with Canada and South Africa is not pertinent n ncither country is a fleeted by shortage of dollars. India also cannot reasonably bc used for purposes of comparison because of thf small number of motor vehicles in that, country. Notwithstanding the huge population of India, 100 pcr cent, more petrol was used in Australia than in India in 1947. 3. Ye>. 4 and 5. Yes. The allocation of petrol to Australia can be increased but under present conditions only by imposing a further burden on the dollar pool of the sterling group. Even if the Australian dollar position permitted additional purchases the Governinent is anxious not to further embarrass the United Kingdom Government in its efforts to check the expenditure of dollars. 0. The Government itself made the decision icgarding the extent of petrol importations and fully took into account the considerations mentioned, as well as the necessity, from the point of view of both Australia, and the United Kingdom, to reduce imports requiring dollars to the lowest practicable level. 7. Yes. The situation is under constant review. S. It is nut a fact that rural industries are differing most as a result of the present petrol allowances. The cut which it was found necessary to impose has been spread as equitably as possible over all types of users. The Liquid Fuel Control Boards in all States have autliority to review and use their discretion in any individual case where hardship may bc caused to a consumer by the recent reduction in the petrol ration. 9. It is definitely not a fact that the Government desires to stop the competition of road transport with other forms of transport. As evidence, consumption of petrol at the present time and under the reduced ration is the highest in the history of Australia, being 10 per cent, more than in 1939.",75
211,Mr CHIFLEY,KKCALL OF AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS FROM,"On the 12th October, the honourable meinber for Richmond (Mr. Anthony) asked if I would investigate the way in which petrol is rationed to various sections of the community in accordance with the jobs which they do. I am now able to supply the honourable member with the following information :In the instance quoted of a person obtaining 11 tration of 0 gallons of petrol a month the - vehicle is - obviously >\ Tirivaltc car of not than 10 horse-power and the petrol ration i sufficient for approximately 1,900 miles run ning per milium. For higher-powered vehicle? the ration is proportionately greater to g i w the same mileage. Thus, if the person is 20' miles from the town the petrol is sufficient for four return trips monthly. Vehicles used in connection with primary production receive a. ration for a greater mileage depending on distance it is necessary to travel and fro qnency of journeys. In any individual casewhere hardship is claimed the Liquid Fuel Control Board in the State concerned ha-discretion to make any necessary adjustment of rations. Tourist buses have had their ration, reduced proportionately to other users, and noapplications in connection with additional vehicles will be entertained. Proprietors of tin tourist vehicles have invested considerable amounts of capital in their ventures aud ir would be inequitable to derive them of thcii livelihood. In any case they perform a ven useful function in that they enable man; people not fortunate enough to possess cars toenjoy sonic of the amenities of life which anavailable to car owners.",76
212,Mr CHIFLEY,KKCALL OF AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS FROM,"On the 30th September., the honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) asked me a question, regarding the issue of petrol ration coupons in New South ""Wales. I am advised that class 21, the licences under which are printed on buff paper (or other paper with buff stripes) is a standardized issue applying equally in all States. However, class 21 licences in New South Wales carry different identification mark^ to those issued in other States. In other States, the sub-clauses are marked 21A 21B, 21C, or 21D, whereas in New South Wales they are marked 1, 2, 3, and 4. The schedule of petrol rations applying as from the 27th September, 1948, was worded to show that the figures 1, 2, 3 or 4 as an alternative to 21A, 21B, & C . applied only to New South Wales. Aspost office officials have regard to this mark of identification when making the monthly ration ticket issue, it is necessary to show the alternative identification symbol in New South Wales to avoid confusion. It is essentially an administration detail and has no other significance. TEXT BOOKS.",76
213,Mr CHIFLEY,KKCALL OF AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS FROM,"On the lst October, .the honourable member for Franklin (Mr. Falkinder) asked me a question regarding more the importation of text books from dollar areas. .1. now advise the honourable member as follows:Somer misunderstanding appears to exist in regard to the importation of essential books from dollar areas apparently arising from the fact that curly in the year provision was mode for qualified book importers to obtain dollar licences only for text books prescribed for educational standards uot below the intermediate or its equivalent. Book importers established their hasic quotas by furnishing returns covering books of nil types imported from dollar areas during the year ended the :iOth June, 1947. The original allocation was made at a time when the licensing of dollar yootls was practically suspended and it was - - ranted specifically to provide the most essenthe tial text hooks for universities, &c. Since however, two allocations covering the two quarters ended the 30th September, 11)48, have heen granted to qualified book importers. Each allocation was of 20 pcr centum by value of the liasic quota. The range of books liccnsable has heen extended to cover all essential types, fiction, childrens books, English language dictionaries costing less than two dollars, net. Some Medical Books and Cookery Books comprise the prohibited types. A further allocation will be announced soon for the third Hiiartcr ending the Slst December, 1948. In the meantime, however, arrangements have been made to allow quota-holders to obtain licences for essential books urgently required. It is --onsidered that adequate provision has been made for the securing of all essential books from dollar areas particularly as the basic value on which allocations are calculated includes the value of many books which, although permitted importation from dollar areas during the base year period indicated above, are not now permissible imports from such areas. In view of the generous provision made it is suggested that'the unavailability of particular hooks may hp due to the fact they an; out of print. DOLLAR CREDITS.",76
214,Mr CHIFLEY,KKCALL OF AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS FROM,"On the 29th September, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Ryan) asked me questions concerning negotiations with the Government of the United States of America for the use by Australia, of credits under the terms of the United States Fulbright Act. [ now advise the honourable member as follows: The terms of the Lend-Lease Settlement Agreement of the 7th June, 1940. between the United States of America and the Commonwealth provided that, in addition to an outright payment of 20,000,000 dollars, the Commonwealth would pay an amount equivalent, at the then existing rate of exchange, to 7,000,000 dollars-(«- ) by providing real property or improvements to real property to a value not exceeding 2 dollars; and (6) by establishing a fund in Australian pounds for expenditure hy the United '.'tates Governinent. in accordance with agreements to be reached between the two Governments for carrying out educational and cultural programmes of henetit to the two countries. The United States Eulbright Act wn approved on the 1st. August. 1940, and gave legislative authority for the United StateSecretary of State to enter into agreeineiitwith foreign governments for the use, for certain educational purposes, of foreign currency credits acquired as a result of the disposal of United States surplus property. Negotiations are at present in progress with the United States authorities for the purpose of reaching agreement on the manner in which the Australian currency fund established undei terms of the lend-lease settlement is to then, be spent. Everything possible is heing done to expedite the conclusion of an agreemeni The honourable member referred in his question to the exchange of teachers and students between the United States and other countries The principal reason for providing in the lend lease settlement for the establishment of an Australian currency fund, however, was to induce the amount of dollars to be provided bj the Commonwealth under the settlement. It i> not contemplated therefore that the agreement to be reached with the United StatesGovern ment will make any provision for meeting tinexpenses of Australian teachers or studentin the United States. If it were to do so tinCommonwealth would have to provide Unnecessary dollars. POULTRY.",77
215,Mr CHIFLEY,KKCALL OF AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS FROM,"On the 30th September, the honourable member for ""Wide Bay (Mr Bernard Corser) asked the following question:Will the Treasurer give, sympathetic cou sideratiou to the request of the Queensland poultry industry for an amendment of the Income Tax Assessment Act t'o bring poultryfarmers within the provisions of section 54 (2) (6) or will he take any other action that limy be necessary to permit poultry-farmers t>> claim as a tax deduction depreciation on farm buildings and fencing-concession s which tlii-j arc denied at present? I now advise the honourable member as follows:""Section 54 (2) to) of the Income Ta.\ Assessment Act, to which the honourable mem licr referred in his question, provides for the allowance of depreciation on structural improvements, other than those used for domestic or residential purposes, which are constructed on land used for the purposes of agricultural or pastoral pursuits. The provision is limited to taxpayers engaged in the particular industries mentioned and does not extend to any other class of business. I am informed by the Commissioner of Taxation that the Commonwealth Taxation Board of Beview has held (Volume 5, Case 44, of the Bbard's Decisions) that poultry-farming cannot be regarded, for mcome tax purposes, as an agricultural pursuit. Consequently, under the provisions of the law as it stands at present, depreciation is not allowable on structural improvements used for the purposes of poultry-farming. The question of amending the law to include poultry-farming within the ambit of section ->4 (2) (6) bas been considered on a number - if occasion!,. If this course were adopted in regard to the poultry industry, however, the virtual effect would be to establish as a general principle that a deduction should be allowed in respect of the depreciation of all structural improvements. Once that principle were established, other sections of industry would undoubtedly claim similar treatment, and it would ultimately be necessary to give the i-oncession unlimited application. In this regard, I would point out that, when the general .question of the allowance of depreciation on structural improvements was examined by the Koyal Commission on Taxation 1932-1034, that body recommended that such depreciation should be restricted to buildings farming an integral part of the plant. This view was --xpressed in the Commissioners' report in the following terms:"" If depreciation is to be allowed, we consider that it should bc restricted tu buildings used to house plant employed in the production of income, and then only when it can be shown that the use of the plant affects the life of the huilding "". In accordance with this view, the Royal Commission proposed that the special concession which had been allowed to agriculturalists and pastoralists in this respect under the Income Tnx Assessment Act 1922-1934 should bc discontinued. However, the 1936 Act, as finally passed by Parliament, retained the concession. In my opinion, the view expressed by the Koyal Commission is fully justified, particularly as the expenditure which is incurred from time to time in maintaining the improvements in good order and condition is an allowable deduction. In these circumstances, I feel that any extension of the concession heyond its presents limits is not warranted. After again giving the matter careful con-ideratinn I find myself unable, having regard lo the factors which I have mentioned, to recommend to the Government that the law - Mould be amended to provide the deduction nuiglit by poultry-farmers in this respect.",77
