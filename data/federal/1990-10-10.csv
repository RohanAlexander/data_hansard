3,Mr ROCHER,CANBERRA TAXES BACK IN,"I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House deplores the Government's failure to develop an effective total taxation policy"" . If experience so far under this Government is any guide, the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Provisional Tax) Bill, the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill, the Income Tax Amendment Bill, the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) and the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill are among the first of many more tax Bills to come under discussion during the life of this Parliament and, more particularly, during the year to 30 June 1991. Intelligence that we gather from the Senate part of the building indicates that there are another eight taxation Bills which we have not yet seen 1990 to be debated before December. No doubt they will be subject to the guillotine and that is another aspect of the deplorable way this Government approaches legislation. The other point I want to make is-that we can get that information only from the other end of the building because it is simply not available to us here from the Government or any government sources. It is therefore appropriate to put the taxation record of this Government in some sort of perspective. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a table which I have circulated to the Clerks. Leave granted.

4,Mr ROCHER,TOTAL RECEIPTS,"I thank the House. Quick calculations will verify that taxes collected in almost every category since this Government brought down its first Budget in 1983 have increased at a rate more than double that of inflation. We can take totals of taxation revenue for the years 1982-83 and the estimate for 199091 to demonstrate the point. Tax revenue from all sources, old and new, will increase by 136.3 per cent to a massive $96.3 billion this year. Inflation over the period will be about 58 per cent. So in real terms, as we say, the total tax hike will be over 78 per cent, spanning eight years, an average yearly slug of an extra 8.7 per cent. Therein lies the tale, the reason for the surpluses about which the Treasurer (Mr Keating) boasts, usually when trying to divert attention from the economic mess he has engineered. Even this Government cannot spend the sort of money generated by its grasping greed. Of course Commonwealth debt has been reduced, given the single-minded obsession of the Treasurer with ripping the heart out of the discretionary income 1982-83 1989-90 1990-91 actual actual estimate $m $m $; 4,768 12,620 11,635 259 915 1,041 Nil 376 820 Nil 42 225 Nil 1,168 1,280 28,074 65,446 69,850 3,490 10,132 10,668 3,486 6,855 7,430 3,320 2,239 2,390 2,036 3,954 00 66 57 49 30 378 92 241 1,439 02 40,743 90,501 1 3,667 4,486 72 3,675 4,486 72 44,418 94,987 1 63 of individuals and private sector i-; nesses by taxation. But the good ne if only at first glance, about the re d Federal Government indebtedness i d news for the private business sector. d 'at first glance' because what amou to the extortion of vast sums of money c- . essary out of the private sector to tra er to the public domain, enabling surp s totalling perhaps $25 billion to $2 llion over four years, does not bear e examination. One natural outcome, as must have n anticipated, and which enables u o measure one effect, is the withholdin x grab and its growth.

It IS httle wonder that, in the light of the present tax take, and if the Government accepted the same degree of spending restraint it impos-d on its funding of the States, as Dr DavId Clarke has pointed out, the surplus for 1989-90 alone would have been more than $20 billion. The Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Provisional Tax) Bill 1990 contains several proposals, a couple of which the Opposition welcomes. Those with which the Opposition has no quarrel will reduce personal taxes by raising the tax-free threshold to $5,400, eliminating the 29c tax bracket and reducing other rates in the remaining brackets, except for that to apply to a taxable income exceeding $50,000. It goes without saying, however, that the Opposition maintains that such relief should be greater, and would be greater if the Government were to adopt the coalition's policy, as spelt out in its Economic Action Plan, and reduce its spending by some $2.7 billion. If it had adopted that policy of ours, as it has with our longstated policy to privatise Australian Air!ines, it might then have been possible for It to steal some more of our clothes and give worthwhile tax relief to Australian families. That lost opportunity aside, it should also be noted that total PAYE taxes nevertheless will increase this year by 7.6 per cent and other taxes on individuals by $1.3 billion, or 17.2 per cent. In the context of previous provisions applying to non-resident taxpayers, the proposed changes in marginal rates applicable to their taxable incomes appear unobjectionable, although in this case a 29c category is to be retained. However, this is not so when it comes to the medical expenses rebate. The 29c mark is to be abandoned and reduced in 1990-91 to 25c and thereafter to 21c. All I say to those taxpayers who were unfortunate enough to incur net 'medical expenses exceeding $1,000 last year is that this Government considers them lucky. If they are not so lucky next year with net medical expenses, the Government will, notwithstanding, be grateful for the additional 8c in the $1 it collects as a consequence of their misfortune. It then expects to collect another $15m all up from those who have had to pay bills for health care, which would be catastrophic for most families. That tidy sum of $15m will go a long way towards meeting the costs of Royal Australian Air Force flights to dog shows and footy matches and should cover the Treasurer's Canberra living allowance. While intentions are clear, the reasons for parts of the proposed changes to the provisional tax provisions are a little harder to come by. The second reading speech of the Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Crean) tells us what is to be done but not why, with one unacceptable exception. The exception relates to a discretion to vary the uplift factor to apply when assessing provisional tax. In the absence of reasoning we nevertheless· note that in determining the quantum of provisional tax assessments, rebates and credits will generally be allowed as before but after taking into account new levels of concessional rebates. We have no problem with that. However, we have a very serious problem with the measure to give the Government the discretion to increase the uplift factor in ensuing years to up to 12 per cent from the 10 per cent to apply this year. It is proposed that this will become possible by regulation. Such a device will further enshrine the practice of bypassing the Parliament and obviating the duty for it to deliberate on all measures which are intended to raise revenue by taxation. It is a fundamental responsibility of Parliament, inherent in the well known but often ignored slogan 'no taxation without representation'. If the Parliament agrees to allow the Executive Government to increase any tax without first having the opportunity to debate it, we will be allowing just another nail in the coffin of our irrelevance as both individual representatives and as a Parliament. By legislating to allow twice-yearly increases in excise on petrol, alcohol and tobacco products, the Parliament has already conceded to the executive imperialists a right which should never have been given. Mr Hand-That is a strong one.",10
5,Mr ROCHER,TOTAL RECEIPTS,"That kind of stupidity should not be repeated. In addition to that fundamental objection, we observe that the excise hikes at least have the virtue of being calculated in accordance with movements in the consumer price index (CPI). The proposed uplift factor on the taxable income of professional taxpayers does not even have that limitation going for it. This year it is to be 10 per cent while the Treasurer's Budget estimate is for a 6.5 per cent increase in the CPI. In ensuing years it is intended that the uplift will be between 10 and 12 per cent at the whim of the Government. One can understand that the Government has no faith in its estimate of inflationary expectations this year because that lack is widely shared. Its pessimism about inflation in subsequent years is equally understandable, given its lack of courageous vision. For the reasons mentioned, we will move to amend the Bill in the committee stage in line with the principle that only the Parliament should have the right to increase taxes and to decide the amounts of any increases. The need for another change of the type sought in this Bill is obscure. The Minister-although I doubt that he has the capacity-might like to tell the House why. it is thought necessary to legislate for visional tax to be assessed if there is a shortfall of more than $3,000 in the previous year in the instalments deductable from a taxpayer's wage or salary. If Correct instalments are not being deducted and remitted, one would have.thought the employer would be in breach of the relevant law. Indeed, such an employer was and is in breach and is subject to penalties for such a breach. A breach subject to penalty provision already being in place, it is pertinent to note that a further penalty has been foreshadowed by· the Minister if an affected taxpayer overestimates tax instalment deductions in an application to self-assess. It is difficult to imagine that any malpractices that may be countered by this proposed change are so widespread or so incapable of being remedied by action against the employer as to warrant changes of the incomprehensive complexity of this Bill. Perhaps there is a simple, albeit so far unexplained, reason which the Minis"" ter will outline in his summing up. While the changes mooted are contrary to the Government's empty undertaking to simplify the tax system-particula the last mentioned change-with the exception described the coalition does oppose the Bill. The Income Tax Amendment Bill 19 merely formally imposes income tax p able this year and in ensuing years gen ally until the Government propo otherwise and the Parliament concurs. T unprecedented exception as far. as know will be the 10 to 12 per cent pro sional tax uplift factor, our opposition which has already been stated. The el where stipulated rates of income tax to become payable by individuals a entities listed in the principal Act, Income Tax (Rates) Acts of 1986, all which will be amended by the previo Bill when it is passed. The Medicare Levy Amendment Bill more distinguished by what it will not than by what it will. It will not, for stance, go any way towards narrowing cost to all personal income tax paye over and above the vast sum raised prothe levy now, of skyrocketing health c costs engendered by the Governmen Medicare debacle. This year the levy w raise some $2.7 billion, whereas expen re on health care will total $12.953 bilon. Nor will the Bill do anything to educe the numbers of those in hospital ueues either waiting for treatment to alviate pain or suffering or awaiting in ome cases lifesavi.ng open-heart surgery. hat it will do is increase the income hresholds below which the levy will not ave to be paid, effective from 1 January 991. While the :aill is not opposed by the oalition, it is a matter for concern that e Government is fostering the illusion hat the Medicare levy, perhaps because f the appendage 'Medicare', actually pays or Medicare and that somehow it is an nsurance premium. It plainly is not. The vy itself is a tax on income and is topped up by, or itself tops up, other taxes to meet the total cost of allocations by the Commonwealth towards the all up cost of health care. The illusion perpetuated by the Government fosters an uninformed attitude towards what is affordable, thereby raising the unrealistic expectations of far too many Australians. I turn now to some general comments on sales tax. As at 30 June, since 1983 under this Government sales tax collections had increased by 206 per cent. The proportion of total Government revenue represented by sales tax will have increased from 8.5 per cent in 1983 to an estimated 11.1 per cent for 1990-91. Over the same period, the ramshackle sales tax regime has been extended, to include a broad range of new goods. Under the Hawke-Keating Government there have been numerous legislative attempts to correct the anomalies that inevitably occur in attempting to tax some goods while exempting others with similar qualities. Confusion abounds in drawing boundaries between types of goods, and !he Government is forced time and again lOto ad hoc legislation to plug the numerous gaps that occur. The Government's attempts to correct anomalies have added ev-n g-eater complexity to the existing leglslatlOn, and the Bills I will discuss in a moment are but the most recent example. Despite the complexity of the sales tax regime, the courts are ruling mostly in favour of the sales tax payer when cases are brought against the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). The Commissioner of Taxation has had a consistently poor record in interpreting the Government's sales tax laws. According to one report not so long ago, the Commissioner was losing three out of four major cases brought before the courts each year. Also, sales tax has been used for political purposes under the Hawke Government. The reduction in sales tax on some beer in 1988, while undoubtedly popular, also had the effect of bringing down the inflation rate to be more in line with the Treasurer's earlier predictions, disguising the Government's failure to contain inflationary pressures. The vast range of sales and other indirect taxes means that Australia is already subject to a de facto consumption tax, but with none of the advantages of uniformity and administrative simplicity that the coalition's proposed goods and services tax will achieve. The ramshackle system of largely wholesale sales taxation has evolved over some 50 years. It is no exaggeration to say that over that time the descriptions of the goods to. be taxed, as well as interpretation of the hybrid of laws itself, have become something of a dog's breakfast. Compounding these and other problems associated with the present sales tax regime are the 27 separate Acts and seven others of some relevance with which both enforcers and respondents alike have to grapple. Many interpretations have simply lost touch with reality. This is bred of a desire on the part of the ATO to make its administrative tasks easier with scant regard given to the burden on the businesses which are legally bound to collect and remit wholesale sales taxes. Major difficulties arise out of conflicting advice from the ATO; uncertainty abounds. It is now proposed that a new series of sales tax rulings be adopted in the near future. To the extent that it consolidates earlier edicts from the ATO, well and good. But if, as widely feared, the process includes recasting earlier rulings, then it will be seen as a subterfuge. ATO kite flying about a strange and alien version of the user pays concept, whereby rulings are available through access at any time, either day or night, to computer stored advice and rulings, also clouds issues, and if ever put into practice would open up limitless opportunities for bureaucrats to avoid accountability. We understand that the review of sales tax simplification is proceeding at a reasonable rate. The simplification review, as we understand it, will cover classifications, exemptions, sales value, and antiavoidance measures involving stipulation of divisions between goods and services, freight and rebates. Problem areas not yet resolved include the onus on the seller where a certificate of exemption is tendered: for example, when a known farmer with other businesses not connected with primary industry purchases a sales tax exempt piece of machinery. The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) 1990 is one of two sales tax Bills being debated cognately. One of its provisions sets out to amend legislation passed by the House in May, which imposed a super-tax on so-called luxury cars. Honourable members will recall that the previous Bill was debated under the guillotine- The Government now has the job of getting its earlier, hasty legislation and it serves it right. While the coalition will not oppose the general thrust of this Bill, it would not have been necessary even to consider this part of it if the Government were not so sloppy and inept in its approach to legislation. However, it is opportune to remind the House of the genesis of this super-tax. When it was first bandied about last year by the Australian Council of Trade Unions and others, the Treasurer properly observed that such a tax would be 'Mere embroidery on the fabric of policy'. We did not disagree with him then and nor do we now take issue with what he then said. After all, who would know better than the Treasurer the difference between mere embroidery and a double or triple sewn seam on a well cut imported suit? Who would know better than the Treasurer? Having stitched up more deals tha anyone else but the Prime Minister (M Hawke), without regard for the interes of a vast majority of Australians, is n the Treasurer the acknowledged expert o the difference between embroidery and· th noble art of the Saville Row tailor? course he is. In the event, with an eye to the politic of envy and the scent of an election i the air, he eventually bought it and th fabric of policy is to be embroidered, n once but twice. The new sales tax scale and marginal rates-for that is what the are-to apply to so-called luxury ca when they are sold will yield to the rev nue $10m in a full year, or so we hav been told. I hope that estimate is more reliab than the one plucked out of the air durin the election or. the one cited in the mem orandum accompanying the previous Bil Then, the figure by which the revenu would benefit annually was estimated t be $105m. Such is the state of things th we are yet to be told by how much th estimate was overstated. If the actual proceeds are to be all cated to increase road funding, as prom ised initially, there will be far fewe potholes repaired than originally hope right, Once again, the Government got it hop lessly wrong. As BMW Australia's Man aging Director, Mr Rob Meatchem, reported to have said about the estimate $105m extra revenue from the super-tax This ignores the fact that current projectio indicate that annual revenue from luxury ca will be at least $150m below the level require by the Government for this tax year. He is, of course, talking about all revenu expected from imposts on imported car calculated on sales figures for 1988-8 which formed the basis for the Government's estimate of $1 05m extra from th super-tax. On present indications, th Government will be lucky if it collec half that estimated $105m. In 1988-89, the base year for the est mate, it seems that some 15,400 uni were sold that would attract the new im post to some extent or other; whereas b annualising figures of units sold in Jun and July this year, t-e to-al number C!f imported vehicles WhICh will be sold thIS financial year could be as low as 6,050. If that very possible reduction proves to be anywhere near accurate, the .Government could not be further out In ItS estimates. Perhaps the Mini-ter wi-l gi-e the House an updated - stImate - n. hIS summing up, but th-n agam, the - mI-ter at the table the Minister for ImmIgratIOn, Local Gov-rnment and - thnic Affairs, does not have the capacIty, mental or otherwise, to do that. Back in May, the Motor Traders Association and others said that this tax would be entirely self-defeating. The Association reasoned then that sales had already fallen dramatically and that a massive decline in sales would flow as a result of the new tax. The Association was factually correct then and its predictions also look like being right. What we could end up seeing is a classic case of a new tax with a negative effect on revenue-clever stuffi It is not only the high-fliers in the corporate world who can turn a sure thing into a net loss; our Treasurer is right up there with them. The likely negatives are not limited to the direct tax take from the previous and new sales tax imposts. To the extent that those who might otherwise have bought cars subject to the new tax have withdrawn from the market, or have deferred replacing a present car, there will be less overall economic activity. Registration fees, stamp duty, insurance, lease repayments, and fringe benefits taxes come readily to mind, but there are other direct and indirect transactions that will be diminished as an inevitable consequence. The super tax also exposes the Government's rhetoric in international fora, about freeing up trade generally, as being rather empty. At a time when the Government is making a great deal of noise about tariffs and other impediments in the way of freer international trade, this tax is, fact, non-tariff protectiori. While we bleat about subsidies on manufactured products and agricultural produce by Europe-n and North American governments which prevent us from competing in trade around the world, we selectively increase the barriers a few more notches against car imports. Our international credibility and the influence that we might have suffers accordingly.",12
6,Mr SPEAKER,TOTAL RECEIPTS,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Is the amendment seconded? Dr Kemp-I second the amendment.,15
7,Mr MARTIN,TOTAL RECEIPTS,"ln the past I have enjoyed coming into this chamber to debate tax matters because, as I think Hansard dutifully records, I have often debated with the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who has just spoken. I have to say that I found that some of the comments he made today were not really in keeping with somebody for whom I certainly have a high regard because of his diligence in defending his Party's particular views on tax and other measures. However, I think that making comments about the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), who is at the table, or, indeed, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and so on, really is playing the man rather than the ball and I would have preferred it if he had stuck to the issues at hand today. But that is fine, because I can understand some of the sensitivities that probably exist on that side of the House, particularly when we are talking about the issues surrounding some of the taxation measures that we will be discussing during today's debate. I would probably want to defend my boss as well if he drove a Ferrari and there was a sales tax imposition which would raise the cost of that. I suggest that a number of people on that side of the House were probably a little bit upset. Let us return to what we are really talking about here. The Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Provisional Tax) Bill and cognate Bills which are before us, in fact, continue the work that this Govin ernment has embarked upon over the past 71/2 years. It is doing exactly what other governments have failed to do-clean up the tax system in this country. Well may people remember tax summits and what this Government has done in a whole range of areas in regard to cleaning up that tax system to make it fairer and more equitable. During my contribution this morning I propose to go into some of those particular issues. The contribution of the honourable member for Curtin was interesting in that, whilst he said a lot of words about some of the problems he foresaw with the legislation that is pending here today, he indicated that at the end of the day the Opposition was not proposing to deny a second reading to it. That is appropriate, given that the legislation is trying to lower marginal tax rates-and I do not think anybody in this place would disagree with that. Mr Rocher-It is a Budget measure; we do not oppose Budget measures.",15
8,Mr MARTIN,TOTAL RECEIPTS,"They are Budget measures, as has been rightly pointed out by the honourable member. Equally, there are the other issues of ensuring that those people who had absolutely no health coverage at all prior to 1983 continue to receive that health coverage. Some of my colleagues on this side of the House will speak about that in a little more detail, as I am sure will the honourable member from the Opposition side who will follow in this debate. The issues surrounding the car tax, the luxury tax, are part of this Government's approach to the whole question of cleaning up the act. I would like to take honourable members to some of the issues that the honourable member for Curtin raised in relation to his table that was incorporated this morning. He said that the tax take by this Government has increased remarkably over the last seven years. He has very nicely put down in a tabular form where that tax was in 198283 and where the estimate is in 1990-91 in prospect and what the actual was in 1989-90. This raises some very interesting issues. We see, for example, that net pay as you earn (P AYE) taxpayers-that is, ordinary workers who pay a fair and reasonable share of tax after marginal tax reductions-have seen an increase in the revenue gain by the Government through that. The honourable member for Curtin sees that as indicative of dreadful taxing policies. What that also is indicative of is the fact that in the last seven years there has been an enormous growth in the job market. People who previously did not have a job are in work. If they are in work and they are a PAYE taxpayer then obviously the tax take to the Government will increase. In 1982-83 there was no capital gains tax. We are uncertain whether the Opposition still has a policy opposing that. There seems to be some conflicting evidence coming out from those on the other side. There is certainly $306m that was collected in 1989-90 in capital gains tax and an estimated $465m to come this year. That is a reflection of a buoyant economy in terms of shares traded and in terms of capital gains being made in the corporate sector, where this Governme believes that a fair and equitable share tax should be paid. I cannot see for t life of me where this can be shown as criticism of the Government collecti reven.ue which, after all, as part of t overall tax regime, goes back to the peop of Australia in paying for tax cuts whi the Opposition was never able to demo strate that it could do in two successi elections. It went to the people and pro ised tax cuts but when the arithmetic w done the figures were shown to be billion short on one occasion. On the other hand, this Governme through surplus which has been measur and which is accurate, is paying th money back to the people of Austral through tax cuts which are funded. course, the Opposition cosily chose to fo get all about that. Next we go to the Medicare levy. 1982-83 there was no Medicare levy. those days close to two million peop were not covered by health care. No everyone in this country is covered health care. An amount of 1.25 per ce is levied on people's incomes which go to offset the cost of health care in th country, but so what? If we turn to t actual legislation that refers to that tod we see that the legislation not only le the 1.2 per cent taxable income basic ra of levy remain as it was last year but the loW income thresholds have also been increased. If we listen to those on the other side we would think that that was. terrible. If we translate that into some real figures we would see that for 1990-91 individuals with taxable incomes of up to $11,745 and married couples and sole parents with family incomes of up to $19,045 will not be required to pay the levy. This is from a government and a party that supposedly, if we listen to honourable members on the other side and some media commentators, have walked away from their traditional constituency. They are not looking after the battlers. Further deductions of $2,100 will be allowed for each dependent child or student. If we take the classic Australian family that the Opposition likes to talk about-that is mum and dad and the two kids-we find that there is no levy paid where the combined taxable incomes exceed $23,245. That is the sort of justice that this Government stands for. Yet is any credit directed from the Opposition towards the Government for these sorts of measures? No, not one little bit. What we get is concern about the BMW and Ferrari drivers. We get concern from the other side about whether or not the health policy is fair and reasonable. We have got mark 7 of the health policy, which I am sure the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), who is at the table, is going to talk about shortly. I am not sure whether it is his version or the version of the honourabl- m-mb-r for Tangney (Mr Shack) which IS gomg to be considered but we are all waiting with bated breath to get some further information on that. Moving on through the table provided by the honourable member for Curtin we - ome down. to taxation on· companie-.

The free lunches are out. .The entertainment expenses are out T errlble! . Mr Hand-Baby-sitting is out.",16
9,Mr MARTIN,TOTAL RECEIPTS,"The baby-sitting is out as the Minister said. It is dreadful that the take has increased for the Government because of the imposition of the tax on these rorts that were around before! On and on it goes. This table seeks to demonstrate that taxes have increased. The honourable member for Curtin is absolutely right, but for a variety of rea-ons which he has chosen to completely Ignore for his own political purposes. I can understand that. I understand that on the other side they feel a degree of shame and a degree of remorse that for all of those years they were in successive governments they were unable to clean up the tax Act; the.y were unable to change the sales tax regimes; they were unwilling to go to the issues of tax evasion and tax avoidance. The honourable member for Curtin was around in those days and he feels a bit of.shame about that. He probably looks With envy at this side of the Parliament, which has a government and - Treasurer who have had the guts to go m and take the fair decisions necessary to see the tax system cleaned up. Mr Deputy Speaker, let me go particularly now to one or two of the issues in the legislation. I have already talked about the Medicare levy and I do not propose to do that any further, but I do want to deal specifically with the Income Tax Amendment Bill 1990, which goes to the question of marginal tax rates. How well the people of Australia remember that in 1983 the top marginal tax rate in Australia was 60c in the dollar. How well the people of Australia remember that the bottom rate was of the order of 30c in the. dol-ar. Now we s.ee again through this legislatIOn the latest Improvement in marginal tax rates. . We. now - nd. as a result of the passage of thiS legislatIOn, which obviously the Opposit-on is not going to oppose, that taxable mcome from zero to $5,400 is tax free, and as part of that the threshold rate has been lifted from $5,101 to $5,400. The next rate-$5,401 to $20 700-is 21c in the dollar. The rate from' $20701 to $35,000 is 38c in the dollar, as it is from $35,001 to $36,000. We see that from $36,001 to $50,000 the rate of 46c in the dollar applies, and over $50,000 the rate is 47c in the dollar. This is part of the Government's belief in a progressive tax system. Those who work and who are, for a variety of reasons, able to maximise returns to themselves are taxed accordingly. Often in these debates on tax people tend to forget the reasons why tax is imposed anyway. As I have said on many occasions in this place, income tax, sales tax and probably the taxes that accrue from petrol and excise on oil and so on are the major source of the Commonwealth Government's revenue. From that revenue it must pay for all the things that a government has responsibility for, right across the broad spectrum of government services. Of course, we pay State and local government grants. So across the broad spectrum of government in Australia, funds are disseminated from the Commonwealth based on collections from these major sources. If people are serious in suggesting that some of those sources should no longer exist, such as the capital gains tax or the fringe benefits tax-the Opposition often says this-they have to identify where they propose that government services be cut. The money has to come from somewhere. Do those opposite propose to cut the welfare budget? I was interested in comments made by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson); as reported in the Sydney Morning Herald today, that we have cut as deeply as we can in that area. We have targeted welfare and social security payments far more reasonably in the last several years. That was overdue, and I am pleased that that has been done. But I agree with the Minister's comments; it is very difficult to go any further. But those on the other side will say, 'No, there are still some areas of concern and we will slash and hack into that area'. Whose constituency will that hurt? It will certainly not hurt theirs. Would those opposite make cuts in the area of education? Would they make cuts in the health area? Their mark 7 health policy that will come out may tell us something more on that. But cuts go to the basic question of the provision of services. If people want services provided-if they want roads, hospitals and protection at law-they have to be paid for by governments whom they elect. The source of government revenue is through measures such as these that we are debating today. As I have said, I am particularly pleased to see in this legislation the continuance of this Government's agenda in reducing the marginal tax rates. As I have indicated, we have seen major reductions in those rates over the last seven years which have all been paid for. The tax breaks that have been passed on to the average man and woman in the street are clearly identifiable in the Budget Papers as having been paid for by measures taken by this Government. One of the major concerns expressed by the honourable member for Curtin also related to the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) and the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill. It seems that in the past there has been a difficulty in the area relating to printed material. Printed material is generally subject to sales tax at the general rate of 20 per cent, although it is exempt if it contains news or current affairs or has educational or cultural significance. For example, newspapers are exempt, which most people would agree is fair and reasonable. But there has been an increasingly common practice of distributing advertising material with newspapers. Irrespective of its value as a means of advertising, this has meant that material has been exempt from sales tax. The removal of this exemption is estimated to raise about $20m in 1990-91 and $25m in the next year. I am sure honourable members will all know the sorts of material I am referring to; it is often wrapped up in weekend newspapers. The sales tax laws were being avoided in this way by people who saw the opportunity for advertising by inserting material in newspapers which carried an exemption from sales tax. This provision will obviously remedy that situation. Some comment was also made about the rates of provisional tax and so on. Again, most of that has been covered in the second reading speech by the M-n-ster for Science and Technology and MmIster Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Crean), and I do not propose t? go over it again. Su!fice to say in conclusIOn that one of the thmgs that this Government has endeavoured to do-even those - n !he other side have to recognise that thIS IS the case-has been to remedy in legislation in - he t!lx area anomalies. that have bee- IdentIfied as having eXIsted for a long tIme. Let us take the case again, very briefly, of the question that was raised on sales tax. At least this Government has had the opportunity to examine sales tax an- has taken courageous steps to try to fix It up. I wish those people in the Australian Taxation Office and Treasury and those who deal with this issue the very best of luck in trying to fix up the sales tax legislation and indeed, any tax legislation. We know that' there is a tax legislation review unit that operates in the Tax Office itself and I believe, as has been stated here on a number of occasions, there is a need to look at the tax Act, make it a lot more simple than it is, certainly reduce it in volume, and to incorporate in it many of these other changes that have been debated from time to time over the last several years. But again the principal point here is that this Government at least has had the opportunity and indeed has taken that opportunity firmly to change where necessary. We have not been afraid of change; we have not been afraid to get involved in looking at these difficult areas of tax and at the end of the day endeavouring to make it fairer and simpler. I do not think anyone can quibble with the fact that in terms of marginal tax rates and cleaning up the tax evasion and avoidance industries the Government has bee!l successful. We might not have - chleved as much as some people might - Ike. It seems that as soon as one report IS fixed up there are practitioners in accountancy and the law who are quite happy to promulgate in the community other tax avoidance and evasion schemes. Then the Tax Office has to get onto that an- m-ke recommendations on particular le-lSlatIon or the Commissioner has to brIng down rulings to fix that up. That will ever be thus, but we, as members of the Australian Parliament, should look favourably on legislation of this nature and congratulate the Government for doing what it believes is important in cleaning up the system and making it fairer and more equitable. I believe all of the legislation before us today does just that.",17
10,Dr BOB WOODS,TOTAL RECEIPTS,"I wish to address today aspects of the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill. I see in passing that the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) made reference to the health policies of the coalition. I would like to !,>oint out that what is happening within this situation is exactly the same as what is happening in the Government. There is a review going on. The big difference between our review and that of the Government is that we are not charging the taxpayers $2.5m. It is $2.5m worth of taxpayers' money that is going down the drain, that is being thrown away by this Government, and we are doing it for free. Mr Hand-You do not have a health policy. Will Shack come back?",19
11,Dr BOB WOODS,TOTAL RECEIPTS,"I think the Minister should wait and see. It is very interesting actually to look. at what the Medicare levy actually pays for. The income from the levy is around $2.3 billion per annum. There are a number of people in the community who accept the falsehood promulgated by the Government that this actually pays for all their medical cover. It does no such thing, of course. In this last Budget, for example, the outlays of the Commonwealth, if we include pharmaceutical benefits, amount to around $12.9 billion, so by those figures the Medicare levy accounts for only 18 per cent, less than one-fifth of Commonwealth health outlays. If we add in State government outlays and private health outlays, the total expenditure on health in Australia is around $25 billion. If we use that figure, the Medicare levy pays for less than 10 per cent of health outlays in Australia. If we really want to have a Medicare levy that pays for Commonwealth Government outlays, we need a levy of around 7.5 per cent and I do not think even this Government would be crazy enough to try to introduce that. It is quite clear that the Medicare levy is in fact nothing more than an extension of the personal tax scales and should be included as such and counted as such and called such. A matter was raised with me a week or so ago by the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus), who pointed out that there were a number of American basketballers in her electorate who were actually paying the Medicare levy, but because they were Americans they were not allowed to have access to Medicare. They are paying the levy, but they do not have access to it. I am not arguing about that, but why call it a Medicare levy when in fact it is not paying for Medicare as such? Indeed, it was very interesting to ask a question in a recent survey that was conducted in some attempt to find out exactly how many people really understand how much of Australia's health care is paid for by the Medicare levy. I asked the question: Do you know. what percentage of the total of Australia's health care is paid for by the care levy? The real answer to that is around about 10 percent. Nobody in the survey of 148 people got close to that figure. The two closest were one who said 2 per cent and one who said 20 per cent. One hundred and twenty people, more than two-thirds of the sample surveyed, said they had no idea what percentage of Australia's health care was paid for by the levy. Twelve people, the next highest group, thought that more than 85 per cent of health care was paid for by the Medicare levy. If only that were the case! We should be so lucky. The truth, of course, is that not enough money goes into health in Australia and what this Government should be trying to achieve in terms of financing a health system is to increase the money put into health. It should not do this from Commonwealth outlays; it should do this by encouraging individuals to take out private insurance, encouraging them to contribute to the total pool spent on health in Australia. Expenditure on health in Australia as proportion of gross domestic produ (GDP) is around about 8 per cent. The is nothing magical about this figure; it higher than that in the United Kingdo it is lower than in the United States; it around about the average for the OEC countries. I would have no problems indeed, the expenditure as a percenta of GDP rose, provided this was done a result of the choice of individuals rath than by Commonwealth Government i creasing its own expenditure. The obvious way of solving one of t major problems facing Medicare at pre ent, which is the gross underfunding, pa ticularly of public hospital capit expenditure, is to do just this. Let m point out that capital expenditure in pu lic hospitals is currently about 3 per ce of recurrent costs compared with about per cent 20 years ago and now, in t public system, is about one-third of th spent by private hospitals in terms of th ratio. There is no simple solution to thi There has to be an encouragement to p vate insurers to take the strain off publ hospitals and allow their budgets to Mediused not just to keep their heads abo water, .but to reinvest in capital works an improving the facilities of the hospitals. Another question which was asked this survey was designed to find out ho good those surveyed thought Medica was. The question which was asked was Under the current Medicare system, how good your access to public hospital beds should y need elective surgery? Five levels of access were given as option very good, good, acceptable, poor and ve poor. Of the sample of 148 people, on 24, that' is 16 per cent, thought access w very good or good; another 12.8 per ce thought it was acceptable, giving a tot of people who thought it was good acceptable of just 29 per cent. Indeed, o of the problems facing Medicare is that the same time as there are long waitin lists in most States, particularly for ele tive surgery and particularly for orth paedic and ophthalmic surgery, there a occupancy rates in private hospitals around 50 to 60 per cent. There a around 7,000 or 8,000 empty private be every day. Any solution to this problem has to address this ridiculous paradox. We solve that problem; we relieve the strain on public hospitals; we increase the revenue into the private sphere; we reduce some of the problems facing the private health industry; we improve the standard of care in both the public and the private spheres. Obviously it is a system which needs to be introduced, it is a solution which needs to be introduced, but this Government clearly does not have the guts to do it and persists in maintaining a second-rate system. One of the interesting things about this Government's approach to health problems is the fact that it really has not addressed any of the problems facing Medicare. It has announced it is going to blow $2.5m of taxpayers' money on a review and it will no doubt claim that because there is a review under way it is not going to take any action. On the other hand, in the area of pharmaceut1cal benefits, it has managed to take some action. It has managed to address some of the problems of overprescribing and it has done nothing to address the problems of overservicing, an integral part of Medicare. Mr Hand interjecting",19
12,Dr BOB WOODS,TOTAL RECEIPTS,"In spite of the Minister's protestations, there is little doubt that there is significant overservic!ng which is largely due to bulk billing. IS overservicing which is both patient duced and doctor induced. The figures the first year of Medicare show that some 110 million medical benefits items were - ebated. That includes GP visits, specialI-t consultations, pathology items, operatIons, et cetera. In the last year for figures are available, which is 1988-89 - he number of items rebated under Med: Ic-r- wa.s up from 110 million to 144 mllhon Items. In the intervening years there. has been no significant change in the size of the population or the ageing - e - opulation or in the structure of the they earned. edl-are rebate book. The major cause for thiS blow-out is bulk billing. Some per. cent of medical benefits around traha are now bulk billed and in New South Wales the figure is closer to 75 per cent. A few weeks ago I talked to a bulk bi-ling GP in terms of the problems that thiS was cre-ting. H- said, 'Why, when you .a-e lookmg at thiS problem of overservlcmg, why, when it is raining gold nuggets, do you look to see where they've come from? You don't; you just bend down a.nd pick them up.' That is clearly happenmg m a large way with bulk billing in Australia. If it were to follow the same - pproach as it was when the pharmaceutIcal benefits scheme blow-out-Mr Hand-A fine thing to say about your colleagues.",21
13,Dr BOB WOODS,TOTAL RECEIPTS,"I actually find it absolutely reprehensible that overservic-ng occurs, but I for one would not deny It, whereas Government members deny it occurs. It is both patient driven and doctor driven. There could, for example, be a. -2.50 co-payment for each pensioner VlSlt to the GP if the Government followed the same approach as that it took to pharmaceutical benefits. I am not nece-sarily fa-ouring that option myself, but sl.mply pom! - ut that there is a gross dl.sc-epancy m Its attack on overservicing wlthm the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and overservicing within the medical benefits scheme. In .contrast to the original intention that Medicare would be entirely funded by the It levy, at present the levy funds a very ins-all proportion of health outlays, defor spite a numbe(of changes. The major change, in 1986, was an increase from one per cent to 1.25 per cent. There had been an increa:-e in the levy ceiling from $700 to $750 per annum in 1984, and in 1985 which the levy cut off at an income level of $70,000 per annum, so that the most that any household paid in levy was $700. In the 1985 Budget the ceiling was abolished and those exempt from paying the levy then paid one per cent, now 1.25 per cent, of of all income, regardless of how much This points out the fact that I men56 tioned earlier, that the Medicare levy is Auseffectively an income tax surcharge and could be considered to be divorced from the health policy. The progressivity of the levy has been established by increases each year in the threshold above which the levy applies,starting from $7,100 in 1984 and increasing to $10,000 in 1989, with further increases to apply this year. The Medicare levy arrangements have made no approach to the problems facing the States. They are still locked in the original construction of negotiations as occurred in 1983-84. It has taken no account of the fact that private insurance has fallen from approximating 70 per cent of the population at the time of the introduction of Medicare to around 45 per cent of the population now. The reasons for this are that private health insurance is more expensive and one gets less for it. One of the reasons that it is more expensive is that the Government has attacked financially the private health industry. The Government has done an enormous number of things which will reduce the attraction of private health insurance and increase the costs. For example, it has withdrawn its contribution to the health fund reinsurance pool, which saved the Government $100m. It has reduced the private hospital bed day subsidy, and that saved $143m. It has widened the gap between medical benefits and scheduled fees for in-patients in hospitals, saving $200m. We are talking about a basic saving for the Commonwealth, and therefore an extra imposition on those privately insured, of some $430m. The effect of those changes has been to increase the costs to families of private insurance by about $150 a year. That is cOPlPounded by the fact that the decreasing membership of private health insurance funds means that those who remain in them are those who cannot afford in health terms to get out, those who are higher risks, those who cost more, and in turn that increases the burden on the health funds. It is estimated that for one per cent of the population that drops out of private insurance the burden on Government funds increases by about $120m. One has to ask why one would bother with being privately insured at the moment. Certainly one would have a choice of doctor, but by and large most Medicare patients have some choice of doctor. Private insurance gives one the ability to jump the queue and be admitted for elective surgery, in particular to a private hospital, rather than suffer a public waiting list. But beyond that, there are very few reasons to be privately insured. There are a number of disincentives. It is possible, for example, to be a private patient in a public hospital in a shared ward and be in a bed next to a Medicare patient who has the same doctor, is undergoing the same procedure, is admitted for the same length of time and has exactly the same care. At the end of the day the Medicare patient pays absolutely nothing and the individual who has taken out private insurance and has already paid extra for that is faced with an additional bill. What are the incentives for private insurance? For a private patient in a private hospital there may well be a number of out of pocket expenses. Members are probably aware that the Government has made it impossible to be privately insured for the total costs of being sick. The number of disincentives that this Government has introduced makes a mockery of our health system. The announcements that the Government has made in the past few months have done nothing to address the underlying structural problems of Medicare. The continuing survival of Medicare is predicated on the basis that 45 per cent of the population at present-and that number is falling-by and large will use it for hospital services. The Mini has a dilemma. He has to walk a fe on the one hand if he allows Medicar offer really good standards of service makes it too attractive and then fac mass migration from the private sp into the public sphere. The strain of lo ing after in the public share the pri every sphere-the 45 per cent who are curre privately insured-will put an extra den upon the remaining number, w obviously will be falling. On the o hand, if he offers a standard of ser which is even more unacceptable tha present, he faces major political proble Quite clearly some resolution of this iculty needs to be addressed as soon as ossible. I want to address today also a number f problems that have arisen under the edicare system with the day surgery lations. The Government and Opposiion have endorsed the importance of day urgery, both as a cost-saving measure ince it prevents people from being aditted overnight with all the extra exenses involved in that, and also as a rocedure which is beneficial for patients, n as much as they can be treated quickly nd efficiently and return home the same ay. The Government has stated that it ishes to encourage day surgery proceures, and the Opposition believes this is worthwhile endeavour,and supports it. Clearly the system has been abused by number of people. Some procedures hich normally would have been carried ut on an outpatient basis, such as minor uts and minor surgical procedures, have een performed after the patients are aditted as day cases to a hospital so that hey can attract the extra benefit associted with this. We deplore this misuse of he system and believe that it should be ightened up. However, we believe that hould be done in an appropriate manner. ver the past couple of months the Govrnment has introduced measures which have, to use a well worn phr-se, uninended consequences. I wish to raise a ouple of those in particular. . The first relates to the Department's CIrcular HBFI99. This lists certain medical benefits schedule items which are excluded fron:t attracting a same day accommodation benefit. The aim is quite laudable: to exclude procedures which are not significant enough to require even a day admission. An example would be the removal of a small birthmark or naevus - f.a minor nature, which a general practitioner would normally do in his' surgery or outpatient clinic, as the case may be. If, however, there is a particular reason why one needs to be an in-patient to have that .n.aevus or mole removed, there is pro-lslon within the regulations for that patient to be admitted. The doctor has to - ake a statement to the effect that there IS a particular need. An example which has been brought to my attention is of a five-year-old child. Clearly a five-year-old child with a naevus needs to be admitted, because that child regwill need a general anaesthetic to have it removed, if it is of any significance at all. I think honourable members will agree that five-year-old children do not take kindly to sitting watching while their birthmarks are burnt, frozen or cut off in front of them. That sort of case needs to be admitted; it does not need full-scale hospital overnight admission; a day surgery admission for the general anaesthetic, with the child going home that evening, would be entirely appropriate. One would think that it would be possible to attract an appropriate rebate for this p--cedur,e. One would think that the proVISIons m the Department's guidelines would allow the child to be admitted to enter a freestanding day surgery centr- or a standard hospital, be treated appropri-tely and then sent home. But sadly, that IS not the case. However sensible it might seem there is no provision for that sort of ad-ission where there is a special need for amino; procedure, to a day surgery centre. That sort of admission, for reasons which are completely beyond anyone's understanding, has to, be made to a standard hospital. There IS no good reason for that; it is not a question of the services being more appropriate in a hospital; it is simply a que.stion of bureaucracy going wrong agam. I presume this is an administrative oversight, the slip of a pen, a clerical error, call it what you may. The fact rem-ins that patients such as that particular chIld---:-and this indeed is a genuine case, although I will not mention the child's name-will no longer be allowed to have day surgery in a day surgery centre and attract a rebate for it. If the Government is really genuine about encouraging day surgery, why on earth would it impose this ridiculous situation? I have a letter from the inquiries and claims processing manager from Me-ibank Private, a Government organisatIon. He thought that the situation was somewhat crazy, so he contacted the Department and clarified what it intended. It confirmed that in this regard freestanding day facilities were not available to these patients for admission. As the inquiries and claims processing manager himself said: Whilst the above seems to be anomalous, in that a procedure on the exclusion list performed in the hospital can be upgraded and can attract an accommodation benefit whilst the identical procedure in a freestanding day facility does not attract a benefit, we are obliged to adhere to the Department's instructions. This matter was drawn to my attention by Dr Jeffrey Sinclair, one of Victoria's most eminent and respected surgeons, who practises at the Surgicentre in Box Hill in Victoria. A man of his reputation would not allow any patients, let alone five-yearold children, to be admitted unnecessarily. It is absolutely outrageous that the patient in question, a five-year-old child, who had put her trust in Dr Sinclair to remove the particular naevus, can no longer have that procedure carried out as her parents had planned, without incurring an extra financial burden. I hope that this administrative oversight can be fixed as soon as possible. Unfortunately, the information given by the officer we contacted was that it would not be possible to fix that before autumn, because the Department could not find time in its program. The second item with regard to day surgery relates to a similar matter-the admission to public and private hospitals for procedures for day surgery. Once again, the exclusion list, which I mentioned earlier, was circulated in HBF199 to all registered health benefits organisations, private hospitals and day surgery facilities. This statement relates to the Medicare benefit schedule items which excluded 'as professional attention', which is the description which would normally require admission as a day patient. It is the same problem as before and that description is to ensure that minor procedures are not admitted to either a hospital or a day admission facility. The circular states that in all hospitals a doctor's certificate is required stating the medical condition and other special circumstances which require the patient's admission before benefits are payab Under the list are a number of ite including a number of obstetrics ite The inclusion of .these obstetrics ite means that obstetrics patients cannot admitted to a day facility. Because of t wording of the circular, however, th cannot be admitted and attract a ben full stop. We are now saying that patients w are obstetrics patients giving birth babies cannot be admitted to any hospi and attract a benefit. We contacted t officer and had this confirmed. Obvious it is bureaucratic nonsense and an er of some sort. I do not believe that ev this Government would want to exclu obstetrics patients from giving birth babies in private or public hospitals. It just indicative of the lack of professio alism shown by this Government in t administration of Medicare items. I trust that these two hopefully adm istrative oversights will be rectified as so as possible because they are causing en mous inconvenience to a number patients. Nobody will die because of th problems but they are inconvenient a cause other problems. I trust that t Government will try to fix these partic lar administrative errors as soon as p sible. Overall, . the Medicare levy is in a quate. In summary, what the Governm needs to do to fund the current system to encourage private insurance. The i ology of this Government and these Mi isters will not allow the Government offer sensible incentives for private ins ance, which will solve a whole range problems within our health system as stands as present.",21
14,Mr GEAR,TOTAL RECEIPTS,"It h been 71f2 years that honourable membe opposite have been in opposition and th still have not developed a health polic All we heard from their spokesman health matters was a bit of a whinge abo a few aspects of Medicare. Let us take the last comment first. I recorded the honourable member for Lo (Dr Bob Woods) correctly, he applaud the Government for encouraging day c services and then went on to say that there were abuses of t-e system. Accepting that what he says IS true, one has to ask' Who is abusing the system? Who makes the choice about who is eligible f-r day care surgery? In other words, who IS putting patients in for day care surgery? Was the patient going to the doctor and saying, 'I want. day, care surger¥', o,r was the doctor saymg, You are gomg m for day care surgery'? It is clearly the doctor's decision. The honourable member talks about abuses. In his own words, the abusers are members of the medical profession. He then starts talking about exclusion lists to try to address the problem that he has already caused. Dr Bob Woods-You weren't listening. That is not what I said.",24
15,Mr GEAR,TOTAL RECEIPTS,"I was listening to the honourable member for Lowe. I never got a policy from him about what he would do. That does not surprise me because basically he has no policy and he dumped the blame for this on his own mates. The honourable member said that there are abuses of the day care services system. He nods his head. Clearly, if a medical decision rests with the doctors, the abusers are the doctors. If exclusion lists ist, they exist because of rorting in the system, and that rorting is not by patients. Let us look at some of the things the honourable member for Lowe said. In his summary he said something about going back to private health insurance. We hear this all the time, yet he had the audacity to speak about us being driven by ideology. The Opposition is driven by ideology on this matter. The reason why after 71/2 years it has no health policy is that its ideology cannot match up with the ne-essities for having a health care system 10 Australia. What the Opposition basica-ly wants is a privately run free enterpr-se. system with community rating prmclples. Dr Bob Woods-Who said that? . . Mr GEAR-A number of spokesmen, mcluding the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack). The honourable member for Lowe is not disagreeing. The simple fact is that what the Opposition really wants is private insurance and competition. It wants all the health insurance agencies competing for business. What the Opposition does not say is that it will keep the community rating principle. That is not private enterprise. What the community rating principle says is that, if a person is young and healthy, he or she will pay the same premiums as somebody who is elderly and in constant need of medical attention or a family with young children who also need constant medical attention. Under the community rating principle, which is anti-free enterprise, the amounts paid are levelled out. So there is no competition. The other point is that private health care funds were never able to make a profit. What is all this talk about free enterprise? There is no free enterprise in private systems. In actual fact, when one sits down and looks at the health insurance system, taken at its widest what we are talking about is all Australians sharing their medical risks and their resources to help pay for those medical risks. That is ex- the concept in macro. What it really means is that, when health insurance is taken out, one needs to be able to make sure that it will pay for medical attention. Medicare has been the most successful health insurance system this country has ever had. It has advantaged Australians in a \couple of ways. Let us take the private health insurance favoured by the Opposition. Up until 1984 both millionaires and truck drivers paid the same rate of private health insurance; there was no difference. Under Medicare it is based on one's ability to pay; that is, a person on a low income pays much less than a person on a high income. In fact, in this Bill before the House today, anybody on a single income of $11,745 or less will pay nothing, is exempted and is entitled to Medicare benefits. A family on one income with two kids will not pay anything if that income is $23,245 or below. A major advantage over the private system in ability to pay is being recognised. So it should be for as basic a requirement as health. The other advantage is that it is universal-everybody in Australia is covered-unlike the privately run system back in the bad old days of private insurance. where two million Australians did not have any insurance and had basically to rely on charity. If we want to have a look at some of the aspects of a privately run system, then we can do no better than to have a look at the Green Paper of the Australian Medical Association (AMA). I thought that this was to be followed by a White Paper, but since this one saw the light of day we have never heard of it again. What is the AMA doing? It has put out its proposal. Wasn't it a ripper! Here are some of the features of the AMA Green Paper on better health insurance. What it says is that it has to be compulsory and has to be private health insurance. It does not go into the practicalities of people on low incomes balancing their budget and having nothing left over at the end of the week. The AMA's proposal for compulsory private health insurance means having to front up every week or three months with premiums while with Medicare, which is taken out automatically, one does not have to worry about it. The AMA also said that even when private health cover was taken outwhich is $17 for singles and $34 for families-in addition, one would still have to pay 50 per cent of the doctor's bills and 75 per cent of the hospital costs. That is private health insurance for you! That is the AMA's style. I have heard nothing from the Opposition that leads me to believe that this has not been the basis for its health policy. Certainly we did not see it before the last election. The reason we did not see it is that it could not marry its ideology with the practicalities of running a decent health insurance system. Medicare has now been in place for over six years. It has proved to be the best health insurance system this country has ever had. The other advantage of Medicare is that it allows doctors to bulk-bill. I notice that the honourable member for Lowe, who has left the chamber now, spoke in derogatory terms about bulk-billing. Certainly out in the suburbs of Australia bulk-billing is one of the most favoured aspects of the Medicare legislation. The honourable member for Lowe also went on to talk about waiting lists. We are always told by the medical profession that there are waiting lists. Let us accept that statement at face value. Let us accept that there are waiting lists and let us have a look at some of their causes. In Australia the hospitalisation rate is 21.8 per cent. About one in four Australians will go through our hospital system this year. Honourable members should compare that with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average of 14.7 per cent. What I am saying is that the 31f2 million Australians who go through our hospitals every year-and prove just how efficient the hospitals are, by the way-would be decreased by one million if we could achieve the OECD rate. So one million fewer Australians would be going through our hospitals each year, and we have to ask ourselves again who puts these people into hospitals. Once again, it is a medical decision to put them into hospitals. Just think what such a reduction would do to the waiting lists. The other thing that the Opposition spokesman on health talked about was the fact that our public hospitals are full while our private hospitals are half empty. The fact is that over 50 per cent of all the privately insured patients in Australia are treated in public hospitals. I am not saying that that should not happen, because obviously some of our larger public hospitals have the best facilities in the world and it would seem that many operations can be done only in those hospitals. But certainly a lot of the operations carried out in those hdspitals now could be carried out in private hospitals. The Medicare agreement allows - for public patients to be treated in private hospitals, but the people who will not allow it are those in the medical pro-es­ sion who have an embargo on treatmg public patients in private hospitals. We have to ask ourselves --eth-r they are really dinkum about waIting lIsts. Should it not be that we should be trying to make better use of all our faciliti-s, both pu?lic and private? When those III t-e. med.Ical profession talk about long waItmg lIsts, we have to ask them why they will not treat public patients in private hospitals and so decrease those lists. The Opposition spokesman on health said that there are long waiting lists. I do not believe that is the case, but certainly we have to address the problem of why so many Australians-3V2 million-are put into our hospitals each year. That is a staggering figure. No race of people on the face of the earth are put into hospitals as much as Australians. I do not think that Australians are any less healthy than people in other countries, so we have to ask why it is that so many . .are put into hospitals. The honourable member for Lowe also talked about the choice of doctor being one of the great advantages of private health insurance. How many people in Australia have a clue about what surgeon can operate on a particular condition, how many people in Australia know which hospital surgeons operate at, and how many get to choose their anaesthetist or their pathologist? It is so wrong to talk about freedom of choice. There is no freedom of choice. The only freedom of choice that Australians have is to go down to their local general practitioner and hope that he knows somebody who is competent enough to perform an operation. So all of this talk about freedom of choice of doctor just does not stack up in the real world. There is absolutely no way people can have freedom of choice, as though they were informed people going to choose from a number of competent surgeons. They just do not know-or at least not until afterwards. The honourable member also talked about the drop in private insurance. Why ._ would people not drop private insurance? He - poke about two people in a public hOSPItal having the same operation and being in similar beds, and the Medicare patient not receiving an account and the privately insured patient receiving an account for, as he puts it, incidentals. The biggest incidental, by the way, will be the surgeon's bill. Members of the medical profession can send accounts directly to privately insured patients. If they treat a public patient, a Medicare patient, they cannot send out a bill but must accept the schedule fee as full payment. It seems to me that most Australians are economically literate and that, having taken out private insurance and being stung once, they might think twice about renewing that insurance. I go back to the statement. I made before about having a look at the health insurance system in to to-that is, having a look at pooling all our risks and all our resources to pay for those risks. It would seem to me that a more logical way to move-and I suggested this in Caucus yesterday-is to have the medical profession, consumer groups and Medicare representatives sit down and work out fair and reasonable schedule fees, but then the medical profession should not be able to charge above them. I would like to put on the public record an instance of What is now happening in the real world. A young mother in my electorate having her first child had complications at the birth and, understandably, wanted the best medical treatment for her baby-and she got it. She was privately insured, but when she got home she had specialist bills for $1,600; that is, $1,600 over and above the Medicare schedule fee. That meant a financial headache, to say the least, for her and her young husband. It put them back by at least a year in their endeavours to move into their own house, all because they had to pay those medical bills which they should never have received. When she had those complications at the birth, she should not have had to negotiate fees with a number of surgeons, and she was in no place to do so. It seems to me that what we really have to do is collectively set fees so that people know their health insurance does cover them for medical treatment and they do not have to put up with these large bills all the time, so they do not have to put up with the debt collectors and bailiffs and all of those hangers on in the medical insurance. industry that really should not exist. But they do. I would venture to say that the most common complaint by patients of their doctors is the size of their bills. The posal I have put up would go all of the way towards addressing that. By way of example of this problem, last week an account from a surgeon to his patient came into my possession. It says this: The fee of $400.00 is the recommended Austrabeing lian Medical Association charge for this dure. Should this account be settled by 1110/90 please remit the lesser amount of $325.00 which will be accepted as payment in full. We can say two things about that. The first is that the $400 was a serious overcharge. In fact, on the one piece of paper the surgeon has actually dropped charge by 20 per cent, being prepared accept $325 as full payment. So there is 20 per cent overcharge on that one piece of paper. The other }Joint is that people on high incomes would have no trouble in writing out a cheque for $325, but imagine a young truck driver with a couhealth ple of kids at school, trying to pay off house with all the expenses his family would have. How could that family be reasonably expected to come up with at short notice? The fact is, it could not. This situation is regressive. The reason I moved my motion in Caueither. cus yesterday was to overcome problems like that; to overcome the worry that Australians have of getting clobbered by bills mainly from medical specialists and surthat geons when they seek hospital based treatwhole ment. Later on the account says: From August 1st 1987, the Federal Government has reduced your insurance cover under care. As a result, your rebate may be less previously received. That is a very broad brush statement. the best of my recollection, on 1 August there were some reductions on some items, but certainly not the one on this account. This is the sort of stuff that is being dled by the Australian Medical Associathe tion, which has never accepted Medicare and which would love to go back to the good old days of private insurance, with fewer controls, as it sees them, on medical I take the very fundamental view that the health system-perhaps we should more aptly call it the sickness system-is here basically for patients, not for docprotors. The person who is paying the bill is the patient, and in any master-servant relationship the master should be the person who is paying the bill. Yet, in this particular industry, that is turned on its head and we have to accept what we are told by the people we are paying. proceThat happens in very few professions,· if any, that I can think of and it is about time the patient's voice was heard more than it has been in the past. To go back to the proposal of the AMA, which understandably will form the basis his of the Opposition's-the AMA is not to against my proposal, by the way-it says a that medical fees should be set by doctors and health insurance funds. The proposal of the AMA is very similar to mine except that it has left out the patient. So the doctors will sit down with the private funds and figure out fees suitable a to them. The proposal of the AMA has gone some way towards being compatible with mine, but it has not gone the extra $325 way and put the patient-the good old person who pays the bill-in there to help negotiate those fees. The AMA does not say that it is going to stick to the fees, The AMA also proposes that health funds be free to compete for members but all members pay the same fees. The thing is a joke. What is the AMA doing? It put this proposal out last year as a Green Paper, and it was going to be Medifollowed up by a White Paper. But where than is the AMA now? Where are the proposals of the AM A? Why has it not developed To these? As soon as this proposal saw the light of day, it crashed, and so did the AMA; we have never heard from it again. I make the prediction now that when we pedsee the proposals to be put forward by Opposition, whenever that may be, the very same thing will happen.",25
16,Mr DOWNER,TOTAL RECEIPTS,"This is a cognate debate with a number of Bills listed for discussion, and I refer in particular to the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No.2). This Bill has two functions. First of all, it extends the sales tax on printable matter. I do not wa?t to say anything about that. Secondly, It changes the way sales tax is applied on luxury cars. The Bill changes the sales tax which was introduced earlier this year, and it has had to be changed because the Government has found the operation of the original proposal to be unworkable. I think the amendment really underlines the simple fact that this whole exercise of imposing higher levels of sales tax on luxury cars is little more than a political stunt. It has nothing to do with a rational taxation system or with the management, in a rational way, of our economy. It bears no relationship whatsoever to other Government policies such as the pursuit of what is described - s the - utton car plan or the Government's role m the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations-known as the Uruguay Round. The Government's policy on those things is not related directly to its position on the luxury car tax, and it is to those subjects that I wish to address my remarks today. When we look at the amendment in this Bill, it is interesting to reflect on what the Government really has in mind. First of all, the Bill sticks with the 20 per cent wholesale sales tax on cars up to a wholesale value of $30,233 and then proposes· that the tax be increased to 50 per cent. Under these new proposals, the tax operates in quite a byzantine way. The $30,233 to $54,419 category of cars is subject progressively to an increasing rate of sales tax, starting at 30 per cent and ending up at 50 per cent. The way this progression works is for a 75 per cent rate to apply on the excess above the $30,233 to $54,419 category. I have seen sales tax legislation from all around Australia and the world. I have visited a number of countries and looked at .how their sales tax regimes work, but It-mk that this is a first. This is the first hme that I have seen a sales tax operate in such a complicated way; and at a time when countries in the rest of the world. wherever one goes in the world, are doini what they can-some successfully; some not successfully; some, like New Zealand, highly successfully-to improve and simplify the operation of their indirect taxation regimes and to make their indirect taxation regimes economically neutral. Yet here we have a government which. is actually making ours more complicated and imposing a greater distortion into the economy through the operation of this change. The Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Crean), in his second reading speech, said in introducing the Bill: This situation that is, how the arrangement worked in the pasthas encouraged wholesalers to adopt a number of undesirable practices to artificially reduce- . that is his split infinitivewholesale prices below .the threshold level, in some cases by removing safety options from vehicles. The point of that is that the previous operation of the tax, because there was a differential sales tax, led to what the Treasurer (Mr Keating) likes to describe as rorts-deliberate attempts to circumvent the higher level of tax. They were legal, yes, but they were deliberate attempts to circumvent it, and as aconsequence the Government has decided to introduce this extr::tordinarily complex legislation. As both the Treasurer and the Government know-at least the Treasury definitely knows-we will always· get those. kinds of distortions for as long as we have differential rates of tax. If differential rates of tax are applied to one particular commodity-in this case, cars-then, inevitably, the industry will endeavour to get the best possible deal it· can out of that taxation regime. Indeed, one of the arguments that the Treasurer gave Australia in 1985 with his White Paper on taxation reform and which he continued to argue during the tax summit and for a short while after the. tax summit was that differential rates of indirect tax create distortions and opportunities for people operating within the trade to endeavour, if you like, toartificially minimise their level of taxation. This particular measure contradicts everything that the· Treasurer has said, and that exposes the measure as nothing more than a political stunt, which is what it was. But it was the worse sort of political stunt. It is the sort of political stunt where one tries to bring out from people in the community the worse aspects of their disposition. This tries to charge up the community's sense of envy about people who have bigger and more expensive cars than they have. It tries to exacerbate that and say, 'Isn't it wonderful, the Labor Party will exploit your sense of envy by attacking the people who buy these sorts of cars and as a result we hope we might win a few votes'. That is pretty sick. If one is running a country, one ought not to be doing that sort of thing; one ought to be putting the broader interests of the community first, not behaving in that way. This amendment Bill and the original Act fill me· with a sense of despondency and disappointment about the way decision making by at least the present Government actually takes place in this country. The Treasurer argued when the original Bill was introduced that this particular legislation would produce a net revenue gaiq to the Treasury of some $105m. The question, though, is whether that estimate is even half accurate. In fact, the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries (FCAI) estimates that it will have the reverse effect, that the cost of this measure will be something like $120m. That particular proposition has been put by a large number of people in the automotive industry. There seems to be little doubt that if an irrational and distortionary tax of this kind is imposed the effect will be to reduce demand for, in this case, luxury cars. If the demand for luxury cars is reduced, obviously the revenue obtained from the sales tax from those cars will be reduced. So, clearly, the estimate is an overly inflated estimate just on that principle. The tax is also going to reduce the profitability of those people who sell those cars. It is going to reduce employment levels in those enterprises and, again, the consequence of that is simply a reduction in tax revenue. So the FCAI estimate is an estimate-one does not know whether it is accurate or not-that bears greater reality than the heroic estimate that the Treasurer himself has put forward for this particular proposal. The fact is that it was said by the Treasurer that he would spend the so-called $105m on roads. It appears clear that that money will have to come from some kind of other source. From the point of view of my own work in the area of trade, I find this proposition also particularly contradictory and damaging to Australia's interests because by introducing a differential rate of tax on what are described as luxury cars, we are effectively introducing a non-tariff measure in order to discriIhinate against the manufacturers of those types of cars that are overwhelmingly foreign manufacturers. This particular measure affects less than 8 per cent of locally manufactured cars. Therefore, 92 per cent of all cars affected are imported cars, and they are largely cars imported from the European Community. I have had a large number of representations from foreign governments about this particular measure. Indeed, to some extent it is embarrassinlt for any Australian to have to face up to these representations because we on this side of the House have been doing our best to promote a successful outcome to the GATT Uruguay Round of international trade negotiations. The Government has been going into the Uruguay Round arguing for a more liberal international trading regime; for greater access for Australian exports to international markets, and offering some sort of vague promise that maybe we will give foreigners easier access to the Australian market in exchange. That is the basic proposition Australia has been putting forward. When we get visitors to Australia, such as Sir Leon Brittan, one of the European Commissioners who came here recently, and we say, 'Look, your a ricultural policies are doing untold d-mage to Europe, untold damage to efficient agricultural producers such as A!lstralia and untold damage to developmg countries', they half agree. But t-en th-y say, 'But ho- c-n you. - pea- hke thIS about protectIOnIst p-hcles m .Europe, when you yourselve- l- Aus-raha have introduced a protectIOnI.st pO-ICy. s-ch as this luxury car tax WhICh dl-cflmmates against European car ex.ports, mfI-tes the price of European cars m Austraha and, therefore reduces demand for them and acts as a 'non-tariff barrier?'. It is embarrassing. We may have opposed the Bill origina-ly but it is still embarrassing as Austrahans to have to put up with that sort of argument. I have to say 'Well, the Opposition never went alo-g with this political stunt'. I do not know what the Government says but I believe some Ministers privately say they were not particularly in favour of it either but the Caucus had forced this stunt. Presumably the number crunchers in John Curtin House have forced this stunt on the Labor Party in order to try to generate a few more votes. As I said, it does undermine Australia's position in this very important Uruguay Round of international trade negotiations. It is a matter of severe embarrassment to us and it really is something that is completely unnecessary in terms of the national interest. But it also undermines the integrity of the Button car plan, which is designed to reduce gradually tariff protection on imported cars from 57.5 per cent in 1984 to around 35 per cent by the end of 1992. Lo and behold, the Button car plan after all is not quite as fair dinkum as it appears because what the Government is doing all along, whilst reducing the level of tariff protection, is finding other sneaky ways of introducing non-tariff barriers. The Australian newspaper summed this up quite nicely in its editorial of 26 April 1990, when it said: Even if the Government makes money-which is an argument about whether it would make the $105m it promised or whether it would not-it is sending the wrong signals. The Government boasts about the Button car plan, which is supposed to enhance efficiency and reduce tariff protection. But the new tax almost restores the effective rate of protection on luxury cars to its former peak-Note that, Mr Deputy Speaker: it almost restores the effective rate of protection. I have not checked that, but assuming that is right, it is quite startling. The article continues: just when Australia is trying to convince other countries to reduce their tariffs on our exports. And artificially raising the price of all cars costing more than $43,000-which is the retail price-is, no way to keep efficiency pressure on Australian manufacturers. The Australian newspaper summed it up very clearly and concisely. The implicit point it makes about the need to reduce the level of protection in our car industry is absolutely right, in order to ensure our car industry becomes more internationally orientated and that consumers are able to benefit from both that and the general reduction in the retail price of cars. Those are critical points that Australia needs to be considering and needs to be promoting. Yet there one has the Government doing precisely the reverse. I could go on but I have a sense that, looking at my Leader sitting beside me, my time may have already run out. In conclusion, let me say that this piece of legislation which is before the House today underlines, if ever any piece of legislation needed to underline this, the need for us to change completely the operation of our indirect tax system in this country. It is alone a perfectly clear, concise and good argument for the introduction of a goods and services tax in this country of the kind that we have seen introduced in New Zealand, so that we can abolish the sort of complex nonsense that this legislation represents.

17,Dr HEWSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION," Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to make a personal explanation.",32
18,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Leave is granted. Please proceed.,32
19,Dr HEWSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"On two. separate occasions over recent days, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has misrepresented the facts concerning statements that I have made on foreign policy issues. First, he stated in the Parliament yesterday that it was: a matter for regret that while I was in Japan, the Opposition leader, Dr Hewson, delivered an address on foreign policy in which he made clear his belief that Australian influence in the region had become, in his word, 'marginalised', and that Australia's foreign policy was, again in his 'in disarray'. Mr Deputy Speaker, that statement by the Prime Minister is not factually correct. The speech from which the Prime Minister quoted is one that I gave on 13 September in Canberra to the Australian Institute of International Affairs-the day before I left for Japan and three days before the Prime Minister left for Japan. By stating that I had given the speech while he was in Japan, the Prime Minister tried to leave a clear impression that I was somehow undermining his visit to Japan by 'talking Australia down'. He also left the impression that, since I was in Tokyo at the same time as him, I had given the speech from which he quoted in Tokyo. Both those implications left by the Prime Minister are clearly false and based on factually incorrect premises. I am delighted that the Prime Minister is closely following my foreign policy statements and that, as his recent changes of' policy show, he is learning from them. But it would help if he got the facts straight about where and when they were given. Second, in a speech to the ChineseAustralian community in Canberra last Saturday, the Prime Minister again got it wrong. He said: I have read the press reports of Dr Hewson's recent visit to China-the suggestion that he ac cepted the Chinese assurances aboUt the safety o students who return to China; his rejection of a special visa category for Chinese students in Australia in favour of an impractical and undesirable case-by-case approach; and his extraordinary characterisation of some Chinese students in Australia as 'shish kebab' students. These are all o some concern to me. seriously It is thoroughly reprehensible that an Australian Prime Minister should deliberately lend credence to 'suggestions' - his word that lack any factual basis. The Prime Minister's suggestion that I accepted Chinese assurances about the safety o students who return to China is factually wrong. His statement about 'my extraorwords, dinary characterisation' of some Chinese students as 'shish kebab' students is also factually wrong. References that I made to that term were in the context of quoting what the Vice-Chairman of the State Education Commission of China, Professor Teng Teng, told me when I met with him in Beijing. If the Prime Minister wants any confirmation that I did not accept blanket assurances about the safety of returning Chinese students or that the term 'shish kebab' students was not mine, then he should consult with Australia's Acting Ambassador at the time. I was in Beijing, who was present during my meeting with Professor Teng Teng. But he should do such checking before he deliberately misrepresents my view for his own personal political purposes to a group of Chinese Australians. Finally, it is a sign of how sensitive the Government has become to the Opposition's critique of its foreign policy that the Prime Minister has resorted to misrepresentations in a sorry attempt to score cheap political points. His tactic will not succeed and he should apologise to the House. NA (RATES AND PROVISIONAL TAX) BILL 1990 [COGNATE BILLS: NA BILL 1990 NA NA BILL (No.2) 1990 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) AMENDMENT BILL 1990] Second Reading Debate resumed.",32
20,Mr GRACE,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"As honourable members would be aware, the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Provisional Tax) Bill and cognate Bills, which are currently before the House, are the legislative culmination of the Government's 21 February 1990 economic statement promise to reduce personal income tax for all Australians. The Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Provisional Tax) Bill specifically amends two taxation Acts-the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936-and it should be recognised as a timely and well thought out contribution to the Government's ongoing program of reform of the Australian taxation system. Although the Bill deals with a number of taxation matters, including the changes to personal rates of tax for non-residents, medical expenses rebates and the method of calculating provisional tax for the 91 and subsequent income tax years, it is the issue of personal rates of tax for tralian residents that I would like to deal with at this time. Before I turn to the specifics of the Bill, however, I wish to say a word or two on the general subject of taxation and the approach of the Hawke Government. Without doubt, taxation reform has comprised a major part of the Government's economic reforms over the past seven years. In fact, there can be no doubt that the Hawke Government, through the !reasurer (Mr Keatjnr-, has been responSIble for more taxation reform than any government in the history of this country. It is a record that any government in the world that has held office for seven years would find difficult to match. We need· to remember that, when we came to office in March 1983, Australia had a taxation system that had been allowed to degenerate into chaos under 20 years of conservative rule. Not only had 1990 the taxation system been allowed to stagnate in the face of a changing economic world, but also rorting had become the norm, as unscrupulous businessmen used the system to their own advantage while the honest, ordinary Australian taxpayers suffered under the weight of high marginal rates. It is to the eternal shame of the previous Government that it sat by and, by negligence, aided and abetted the rorting that destroyed the integrity of the tax system and helped bring to the boil the economic malaise that engulfed Australia in the early 1980s. As Mr Keating said when he took the Treasury portfolio in 1983, i- would be Labor's highest priority to make the Australian taxation system fairer-in other words, to make sure that the rich paid their fair share of tax. Under this Government we have seen an end to the taxation loopholes and tax preferences which marked the FraserHoward years. We saw the introduction of a capital gains tax (CGT) to prevent speculative activity and watched as the Government tackled the hard issues, such as free lunches, cars and abuse of entertainment deductions, through the framing of the fringe benefits tax. The Govern1990ment rightly believed that capital gains and fringe benefits added to the purchasAus- ing power in the same way as ordinary incomes and that, therefore, it was wrong that wage earners should be taxed while others earning an equivalent amount of money were not taxed. In reforming the taxation system over its seven years in office, the Government has been very conscious of the relationship between. the organisation of the taxation system and the economic well-being of the country. Labor has understood, while the conservatives have not, that taxation is not just a revenue raising vehicle, but a device which can be used with wider economic policy to assist economic growth and stabilisation. When the Treasurer cut out the free lunches, the conservatives screamed that business would suffer accordingly. They also lamented that the capital gains tax would abniptly halt investment by acting as a disincentive to risk-taking and initiative. As everybody knows, they have been proven entirely wrong, as Australia, under Labor, has nessedan explosion in economic growth and investment. The reason for this is simple. Prior to the introduction of a capital gains tax in 1985, investment decisions were distorted by the existence of an incentive to invest in assets. offering returns in the form of tax free capital gains. The capital gains . tax forced investors to look more closely at their investment options and this has led to a more efficient allocation of resources. The fact is that the Treasurer has used taxation policy in a structured and coordinated fashion to maximise Australia's economic prospects. Although honourable members on the other side labelled Mr Keating as a 'business basher' when he introduced the CGT and the fringe benefits tax, the fact is that the Government has given business a more solid structural growth springboard than could have ever been imagined by the previous Liberal Government. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and Treasurer Keating have understood that a healthy business sector means more jobs and economic prosperity and they have put in place taxation policies which have helped businesses to expand. Need I ,say that the number of jobs-well in excess of 11f4 million-that have been created since we have come to office is proof of that. In May 1988 the Government announced a range of business tax reform measures-principally the abolition or reduction of many business tax concessions, and a major reduction in the corporate tax rate from 49c in the dollar to 39c in the dollar. In this one move alone the Government gave business a massive incentive to devote resources to the most productive uses rather than to uses which merely generated the largest tax concessions. In combination with the Government's decision on dividend imputation and wider macroand micro-economic policies, the introduction of the 39c in the dollar tax rate gave business the best investment environment in the history of this country. In 1990 the results of this Government's business tax policies can be very clearly seen and quantified. Comwit- pany profits are now taxed once-not twice as they were under their so-called friends, the conservative governments. The profit share in gross domestic profits has recovered to its highest level in 20 years. Real unit labour costs have declined by 13 per cent since the Government came to office and business investment has increased in real terms by an annual average rate of 10.8 per cent over the past five years compared with 1.6 per cent in their the five years prior to 1983 under the former Government. Of course, in assisting business to grow and invest, the Government's overriding concern has been to protect and increase the living standards of ordinary Australians. In achieving that ambition, taxation policy has been an important adjunct to wider government economic policies, such as the accord. In the Bill currently before the House we are seeing the culmination of a government program to bring incentive back into the taxation obligations of ordinary Australians. The records show that the Hawke Government has delivered the largest cuts in personal income tax rates in Australian history. When the Government came to office in 1983 the top marginal rate was 60 per cent and the lowest marginal rate was 30 per cent. In this Bill, those rates will be cut to 47 per cent and 21 per cent respectively. Moreover, the scales contained within those boundaries have been dramatically reduced and the threshold at which no tax is payable has been increased from $5,100 to $5,400. In other words, the Government has used the taxation system to but a brake on bracket creep, protect the low income earner and encourage the average wage earner to maximise his or her income. The specifics of the tax cuts are that the 29 per cent· tax rate has now been abolished' so that the top of the first tax rate now - teps from $17,650 to $20, - OO. This means that the 21 crate apphes from $5,401 to $20,700. Further, the 39 per cent rate has been reduced to 38 per cent to apply in the income range from $20,701 to $36,000. The new rate of 4- per c-nt has been introduced to· apply In the Income rate from $36,000 to $50,000. The existing top marginal rate - f 47 per cent would apply only to Incomes over $50,000. Importantly, and annoying-y. for the other side of the House, statistics show that the tax cuts provided by the Government have more than kept pace with inflation. Individuals are paying less tax than if the 1983 tax scales had been fully indexed for inflation over the life of the Government. That will also be true this year. I realise that this information is not always acceptable to the other side of the House and seems to be a bitter pill to swallow when we talk about the tax cuts. When listening to the debate this morning I heard the hollowest of arguments put up to support the contention that the Labor Government is a high taxing government. Anybody who takes the time to mull over the figures concerned will undoubtedly disagree with that argument. The previous shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), is looking very suspicious. I am sure that he will have something to say about it. He must take some of the blame as he was a member of the previous government which had in place the 60 per cent income tax rate. The truth is that the Hawke Government is a low taxing government. I am sure that the Minister at the table, the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), would agree with that. By any standards it is a low taxing government. It is a rock bottom low personal taxing government by the standards of the previous conservative Government. In 1987, the latest year for which figures are available, only three of the 23 coun.tries in the Organisation for Eco. nomIC Cooperation and Development have had lower taxes. They were the United States of America, Japan and Turkey. Budget Papers show that the Commonwealth Government revenue in gross domestic product is the same this year and last year as it was for the same two years of the previous Liberal Government. When one considers the growth in revenue from non-income tax sources, particularly in the services sector over the last seven years, it is clear that this Government has delivered in its 'promises to make the taxation system more equitable and reasonable in its impact on all Australians. I conclude by repeating that the Hawke Government is the lowest taxing Government in the history of this country.",33
21,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, the purpose of the sales tax legislation before us is to introduce a phasing-in arrangement for the sales tax payable on luxury vehicles and to provide that supplements inserted in exempt publications will be subject to sales tax. The rate of sales tax on luxury vehicles is currently 50 per cent, this having been increased from 30 per cent effective from 9 May 1990. For 1990-91, the tax will be imposed where the vehicle's wholesale price is greater than $28,793, which is equivalent to a retail price of $45,056. The increase in the rate for luxury vehicles from 30 per cent to 50 per cent is estimated to raise $105m in a full year. After my speech in the Parliament on this subject on 15 May 1990, the Government did address some of the inequities which existed in the original legislation. The effect of the new arrangement is to reduce the rate of sales tax applicable to lower priced luxury motor vehicles. Vehicles with a wholesale price in excess of $30,234 but less than $54,419 will now be subject to a progressively increasing rate of tax, commencing at 30 per cent for vehicles priced at the threshold rate and increasing up to a maximum rate of 50 per cent for vehicles with a wholesale price equal to or greater than $54,419. I recognise that the Government has addressed some of the areas of inequity in this legislation since it originally increased the luxury tax to 50 per cent. However, it has not gone far enough. The area I wish to address is, once again, the four-wheel-drive motor vehicle. In my electorate and in many of the electorates that are held by Labor, such as Kennedy, Kalgoorlie and Grey, these vehicles are not a luxury but are purchased out of necessity. It is interesting to note that part of my entitlement I have a four.wheel-drive vehicle to cover Maranoa, as do the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls), the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) and the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil). So it is recognised that in rural Australia, much of Australia, four-wheel-drives are a necessity, not a luxury. At the threshold level of $30,000, which is the phasing-in part of the luxury tax, we still have a 10 per cent additional tax above that which the ordinary motorist pays for his motor vehicle. The crazy part is that, unlike the passenger motor vehicle, where we have Australian-made counterparts, the four-wheel-drive station wagon does not have an Australian-made counterpart. So what we really have here is a tax revenue source for the Labor Government. There are still vehicles such as the Toyota range and the Range Rover range that are above the threshold limits, even with the amendments proposed in the legislation today. One of those vehicles is the automatic version of the diesel turbo-charged Toyota. Because it fits into this category, this vehicle is not going to be imported into Australia by Toyota. The point I want to make is that these vehicles are not used as luxury vehicles to run up and down beach fronts and to go camping on weekends. They are used as work horses out in rural Australia. In my electorate, many of the vehicles that fall into this category are used as school buses. I have constituents who drive 50 and 60 miles over rough roads to get their children to school. The Government may be genuine in its desire for all children in Australia to have fair and equal access to education, but often the only access for these children out in the bush is over rough bush roads on which the Australian-made motor vehicles rattle to pieces. So they have to get to school using fourwheel-drive vehicles. It has been well documented in this Parliament and by the media around Australia that in the recent floods in my electorate many children were unable to .travel on these roads for several months until repairs were carried out. When the roads as were repaired people still needed fourwheel drive vehicles to negotiate the roads to get children to school, otherwise these children would not be getting an education. In rural and provincial Australia a four-wheel drive vehicle is a necessity and not a luxury. I referred to the automatic Toyota. People could buy a smaller, lower priced four-wheel drive with gears, but many women find the automatic much easier to drive than the geared version. Large fourwheel drive vehicles are heavy and the automatic is certainly more comfortable but, as I said, many women take their children to school. It is only right and proper that, if women find it easier to operate an automatic vehicle, such a vehicle should not be subject to a luxury tax. In many cases families combine their resources and pick up children on the way to school. It is clearly a distortion for the eight-seater version to attract a luxury tax because people are trying to do the best for their children and they try to cut the cost as much as possible. The fact that the eight-seater version falls into the luxury tax bracket is quite wrong. If the roads in Australia were better and if the Labor Government addressed the issue of rural roads-in fact, all roads-in Australia, people in the bush could drive their children to school in these Australian-made passenger vehicles. But the Government has not, and it has failed there. If it had only listened to what we had to say in the last election, when we said we would spend $500m more on roads, perhaps it would not be necessary for me to talk about this issue today. The Labor Government clearly sees this area as a source of revenue. People in the bush have no option but to buy these vehicles if they are to get their children to school. This is a callous way of discriminating against people in the worse waydiscriminating against ?hild.ren who w(;lUld be denied an educatIOn If these. vehIcles were not available. I am surprised that the honourable member for Kennedy, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie and the honourable member for Grey have not addres-ed this area. If they were really repr-sentIllg their electorates they. wou-d b- III here supporting me on thIS l-glslahon. They would have many constItuents who fall into the same categories that I am talking about today, They have large electorates just like mine and would have people suffering the same sorts of distortions as do those I represent. I also want to mention the area of horticulture. Vehicles that attract ll: luxury tax are used in the area of hortIculture. People buy these vehicles for tw,? or three reasons-as a workhorse, a famIly motor car or a school bus. They combine all their resources into one vehicle to cover a wide range of purposes. People do not have the money to have a separate vehicle for each day of the week or for each occasion. One vehicle is used for everything. In horticulture these vehicles are often used to transport workers from town to farms. As I am sure you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, and as many people in Parliament would be aware, a lot of casual labour is used in the horticultural dustry. In order to get people to the farms to carry out casual labour, the owners of the small farms go to town, bring the workers out by day and return them to the towns by night. Another very good reason why these four-wheel drive station wagons are needed by these people is that some State governments have regulations preventing the carrying of many herbicides and pesticides out to their properties on the back of an open vehicle; it is a· requirement that they be carried in an enclosed vehicle. Farmers cannot just stick them on the back of a lItility or a one-tonne truck. State government regulations clearly state that they must be kept under lock and .. - ey, which, of course, means putting them III the back of a station wagon. As I have said, those involved in horticulture buy these vehicles to carry not only their workers but also their horticultural pesticides and herbicides out to their farms. That is a very good reason for needing such vehicles. We db not want to see herbicides and pesticides left on the back of an open vehicle where they could be picked up and misused. I certainly commend those State government regulations which ensure the safe passage of these chemicals and herbicides from their place of purchase to the farms. Those same State regulations state that the outlets which sell these herbicides and pesticides must also keep them under lock and key. If one goes to these outlets one sees that the chemicals are kept in enclosures which are barred with steel gates and have very heavy locks. That is just another reason why this luxury tax on the four-wheel drive station wagon is inequitable. This Government has Clearly failed to recognise the special needs of rural Australia. As I said earlier, these four-wheel drive vehicles are not purchased as a luxury. They are purchased for very good reasons as an everyday necessity. In many cases they are purchased as a necessity to ensure that children get an education. They are purchased as a necessity to bring farm workers to their place of work and return them home at night. They are purin- chased as a necessity to comply with State government regulations relating· to the carrying of horticultural herbicides and pesticides. As I said earlier, of course, in so much of rural Australia they are purchased as a necessity to navigate the appalling roads that are a legacy of seven years of abuse and lack of funding for rural roads. These vehicles are a part of everyday life in rural Australia. I call on the Government to reconsider this tax on four-wheel-drive vehicles and to consider a special classification for the people who use these vehicles out of necessity. The Government should abolish the luxury tax on the entire four-wheeldrive range. Why does it discriminate against the lower end of the scale of fourwheel drive vehicle as against the upper end when we do not have an Australian made counterpart? We are not protecting an industry; all these vehicles are ported. If we were making such vehicles in Australia perhaps then, and only then, the Government would have a reason to apply a discriminatory luxury tax on ported vehicles. But that is not the case. Where it can be established vehicles are used for business purposes in agriculture and in the mining areas in rural Australia, these exemptions should be granted. I call on the Minister at the table, the Minister for Small. Business Customs (Mr Beddall), to convey this to the Government and to ensure that addresses this very real problem. I do say this lightly, and I hope that the ister will look at this again and correct the anomalies.",35
22,Dr HARRY EDWARDS,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"In this cognate debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Provisional Tax) Bill, the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill, the Income Tax Amendgral ment Bill, the Sales Tax Laws Amendin ment Bill (No.2) and the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill, I want to direct my remarks to the sales tax Bills. As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) stressed yesterinterpretations day in this House, it is the Opposition, not the Government, which is setting the agenda in the tax field. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) states: That all words after""That"" be omitted with view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a reading, the House deplores the Government's failure to develop an effective total taxation icy'. I want to direct some of my remarks to that policy. A major issue in the agenda cent. as set by the Opposition is the need for a broad-based consumption tax. The sales tax measures before the House underline that there is already a high level of sumption taxation in Australia, of which this sales tax is a major component. As the table distributed by my colleague the honourable member for Curtin undertax; lined, this Government and this Treasurer (Mr Keating)-'recession Keating' as we might refer to him-has been no slouch the Opposition. in levying and increasing this sales tax. imOver the term of this Government it has increased by some 200 per cent to a total of nearly $11 billion. Much of that increase has taken place since the considerimations of the National Taxation Summit and the draft White Paper presented by that these the Government in 1985. We have had from this Treasurer a massive increase in this form of consumption tax without any thought to its impact. In saying this, I am not thinking of and the current tax on luxury vehicles. An increase in the tax in this overall way has it been made without any thought to the not impact on pensioners and other low inMincome groups, particularly superannuants. There is no word of the need in that respect for some form of compensation for the increase in consumption taxation, as was stressed at the time of the Tax Summit and in the draft White Paper. Such compensation is, of course, an intepart of the proposals for tax reform this area from this side of the House, which I will mention further later. We have an archaic sales tax which, over the 50 years of its existence, has lost touch with reality through the variety of to which it has been subjected. The tax is anomalous, distorting and economically inefficient. I do not have to dwell on the obvious anomalies in the tax, although they are important: caviar is not taxed while chocolate biscuits and a ice-cream are; radios and television sets are hit by 30 per cent sales tax while second books and newspapers are exempt; a flight to Port Douglas and luxury hotel accompolmodation is not taxed while the family caravan-a means of a holiday for many ordinary Australians-is taxed at 20 per True, this legislation will impose a tax on advertising and promotional material inserted in newspapers, which are exempt confrom the tax, in the same waY as such material not so inserted. So I am not saying that the Government is not aware of the anomalies and difficulties with this some sort of review is supposed to be being undertaken. Again, that is perhaps a response to the setting of the agenda by The fact remains that in general terms one can s-y,-rs!ly, that this sale- ta:c is unfair in ltS hmlted base of apphcat-on, especially as it .doe.s not apply to serVlces purchased by hlgh mcome groups, such as those I referred to a moment ago, or even foreign tourists; - n effect, the-e groups do not pay their fatr share. Thls feature of the sales tax that I am talking about, high rates on a narrow base, distorts the whole pattern of consumption and production and that costs in the economic sense. It involves a misallocation of resources and it costs at a time when we need maximum efficiency in our 'productive machine' in the situation this country is in. Secondly, it does not get comprehensively at the tax cheats in the so-called cash or black economy, and that is a very important p-int in favour of a broad-based consumptlOn tax, to which I have referred. The third point I make about this sales tax is that it adversely affects the competitiveness of many Australian producers, especially those producing in competition with imports and for export, as it is levied on business inputs. Finally, it penalises export industries to a significant extent. It has actually been estimated that fully 49 per cent of the sales tax falls on pur.chases by businesses for use in producing their products. That is what we mean when we talk about business inputs-paper and printing products, furniture, transport equipment and such like. Does the Government not see that that adversely affects the capacity of Australian industries to compete with imports and, of course, to export? At a time when we have a vast current account deficit and burgeoning overseas debt and when all that can be done to produce competitively with imports and to make exports should be done, we have this tax which, as I said, falls to a significant extent on business inputs and on exports. This sales tax is in need of total reform; really, that means its total abolition and replacement by a goods and services tax such as proposed by the Opposition. If honourable members do not atcept my statement in that regard, I refer them to . a paper by a person heavily involved in tax and tax research, and a balanced and disinterested observer, Professor David Collins of Macquarie University, who in the course of a recent paper delivered at a conference on taxation in Sydney in May of this year organised by the Current Affairs Study Centre posed this question: . . . assume that we wanted to retain the basic structure of the existing wholesale sales tax but remove its . . . deficiencies. How might we do this? It would be necessary to identify the defects of the current WST and then implement reforms to counter these defects. . He goes on to follow that procedure. He said: Problem (1) Narrow base Solution: Remove major exemptions Extend the base to include services, either by the difficult process of imputing wholesale value to services or by taxation at the retail level (or at all levels). He went on to consider the issues of taxation of inputs, the definition of the base, removal of exemptions and necessity for a single tax rate, the taxation of exports and so on, and then concluded: If the WST were reviewed in this wayJhe outcome would, in fact, be the implementation of a BBCT. Contrary to Mr Keating's assertion it is not possible to produce an acceptable reform of the WST by piecemeal reform. The only way to produce a comprehensive reform of WST is to replace it with a BBCT. I am certain that Australians generally will recognise the validity of this argument if, as proposed by the Opposition, the sales tax currently subject to amendment here today were totally abolished and replaced by a single rate goods and services tax in the range of 10 to 15 per cent. We would then have a fairer tax. It would get comprehensively at the tax cheats in the cash or black economy, spread right across consumer spending. With a lowered income tax, as I will mention in a moment, it would spread the burden of this consumption taxation, including to the items that I mentioned earlier usually purchased by the rich or by foreign tourists. So it would be a fairer tax. It would enable a significant reduction in the income tax, particularly reduced marginal rates of. tax, which is greatly to be desired. Income tax was discussed by my colleague the honourable member for Curtin this morning. The change would be good for the nation in the broadest sense. It would not be a panacea by any means for all our difficulties in the current account deficit and the overseas debt; nevertheless, it would contribute in that area as part of a package in terms of providing, by the changes in income tax in particular, a boost to incentive and productivity, to increased saving and to a greater capacity for producing in competition with imports and for export-in other words, generally to a more healthy economy, to more jobs and to a higher standard of living. It goes without saying that, while the introduction of such a tax would cause an initial lift in the general price level, there would in fact be a generous compensation package for pensioners and low income groups so that they are not adversely affected by this change. In short, we would have a change which would not seriously disadvantage anybody but would in fact particularly benefit the pay as you earn taxpayer who has been slugged the hardest by the taxation measures and increases in taxation of this Government. So in the amendment that has been moved by my colleague it is important that we recognise that this fundamental change to the tax system should be implemented. The Government has walked away from it. As I have said before, it is this side of the House which sets the agenda in this field.",38
23,Mr TUCKEY,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"ln this cognate debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Provisional Tax) Bill, the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill, the Income Tax Amendment Bill, the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) and the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill, I would like to address the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill. In that regard, I would like to refer the House to some statistics extracted from the Budget Papers between 1979-80 and the current financial year. It is interesting to note that in the 1979-80 Budget defence spending was approximately $3 billion, education spending was approximately $3 billion and health spending was approximately $3 billion. Of course, in the 1990-91 Budget we find defence spending at $9 billion, a mUltiple of three; education spending at $7.5 billion, just over a multiple of two; and health spending up to $13 billion, in excess of a multiple of four. In fact, the percentage increases are: for defence, 80 per cent; for education, 87.5 per cent; and for health, 271 per cent. Those statistics should not necessarily attract criticism. A government no doubt would stand to its feet and say that that is clear evidence-please remember that we politicians have a habit of measuring excellence by expenditure-of a government doing the right thing for the health of the people. But, of course, the evidence as we see it out there in the real world is to the contrary. People have never had it so bad. One actually has to give two years notice before one can get sick. The situation is illustrated by an occurrence in my electorate recently where an entire hospital ward closed down. Why? It was not because people were not using it, but because too many people were using it. In the town of Geraldton there came for the first time an orthopaedic surgeon. He actually started to do operations on people in their home town, instead of their having to travel about 300 miles to Perth. It blew out of the window the budget of the State Government owned hospital-not because of inefficiencies but purely and simply because of additional use-and the simple solution was to close the ward; and that is what happened. We hear the stories. The one I quote most frequently is of a woman in New South Wales who waited for surgery on the veins in her leg. Surgery was not made available in time, but she did get emergency procedures when it became necessary to amputate her foot. That is not an isolated example. Going back to 1979-80, for all our $13 billion now, pensioners actually got all of their drugs for free; so did other citizens in Australia. Today, of course, the pensioner is asked to pay $2.50 and the ordinary citizen $15. There is not much evidence that that massive increase in expenditure has done anything for the people to whom you, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Ministers, the shadow Minister at the table, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), and I have a sworn responsibility. Really and truly, we must ask ourselves, 'What is going on?' The old rule of measuring excellence by expenditure is certainly not working on this occasion. . It is an interesting fact also that a matic event occurred in the Australian Labor Party's ranks the other day when, after decades of a commitment to government enterprise, its members decided that it does not really work. Of course, their Leader, our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), was at pains to spell that out to them in great detail. He stood in here and said, 'I've had a conversion. Five years ago I believed quite differently from today'. But he seems to want to quarantine that to the government business enterprises of Telecom Australia and airlines. But what about the government business enterprise of health? Is it not time that the Government, .while it and the Labor Party are going through this conversion, sat down and analysed. the responsibility of government as compared with the role of government? My view is that my responsibility is to ensure that all people within Australia have fair treatment from government. I do not see any role in having to own the shop. Government in our society has a clear responsibility to ensure that all Australians have reasonable access to medical and hospital treatment, irrespective of their means. Government does not need to build hospitals or operate health insurance schemes to achieve that end. Let us look at the situation of the elderly. Government accepts its responsibility to provide them with financial resources. It does not institutionalise them in their millions to achieve that end. We do not say, 'Well, to get a pension you have to go to our old people's hostel'; thank goodness we do not. We have seen a development through this Government of the home and community care scheme, which provides - that, even when people are getting ill and having other problems, it is still better to keep them away from an institution, if that is possible, and to give them care in their home. The Opposition supports that principle entirely. But we do not believe that we have to give pensioners a bed in a hostel to provide them with the help to survive in their old age; we literally send them the money. Of course, it is an interesting situation that Senator Peter Walsh-I am sure that trau- it is only since a member of his family married into my family that he has had some of these conversions-is telling us, through the Australian Financial Review, that one of the greatest problems in society today is that the people who constantly press for more welfare are not those who receive it; it is those who deliver it. He is quite right. These people build these institutions and then set out to defend them at all cost-to the taxpayer. Many years ago, an American professor, who was raised in a ghetto with a fair opportunity to see this working, said that the American process of welfare delivery was a process of feeding sparrows through horses, which he said was the most desirable way of feeding the sparrow from the horse's point of view. That is a very perceptive statement. What is Medicare all about? It is about feeding sparrows through horses. It is government setting up a massive institution to do something that over the decades the private sector has demonstrated that it does very well, whether it be in the provision of health insurance or the provision of medical and hospital services. The private sector exists. We have a constitutional provision that denies government the right ever to socialise it entirely. So we have this mishmash of the Government trying to compete with the private sector, and not doing it very well. But, because health is rather specific, it is also putting massive distortions into the system. It gives us a compulsory scheme called Medicare, which for some is reasonably cheap, and it becomes the healthy man's insurance scheme. Everyone in Australia knows that, if one is contemplating being sick, one does not stick with Medicare because one just might be told to wait two years for a service. For example, a woman with a cataract wrote to me and said, 'I have been told that I must stand around in darkness for another two years because the system cannot look after me'. People know what is happening. Health, or ill health, is a rather predictpieces able thing. One has only to look at the statistics actuarially, as I did, to find out that there are times in people's lives when generally they will put much more pressure pn the health system than at other times. Strangely enough- the first period is the first year of their life. Then they fade away from the health system until, in the case of women, they become of child-bearing age. When that is over, the next predictable step is old age. That is, of course, when most of the demand for health services applies. That is predictable. If one has to be forced into a government scheme, why bother to take out private insurance during those periods when statistically one will not need any help? People know that; so they go to the private company only when they are likely to be sick. Women get married and, before they go off the pill, their mothers say, 'Come on, dear. Before you do that you had better go and privately insure'. Then, when they think that they have had enough children, they chuck it away again. But what does that mean for the people trying to run private health insurance? It simply means that they cannot make ends meet. They are providing for a disproportionate share of the ill and charging them accordingly, as they are obliged to do, while the Government creams off all the healthy people and then boasts about the low level of its premiums, which of course are about a quarter of what it actually spends-",40

27,Dr HEWSON,INTEREST RATES,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the yes, no, yes policy on high interest rates as evidenced by his endorsement yesterday, the repudiation by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, on the 7.30 Report last night and Senator Button's clarification this morning. In view of other recent statements by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, the Minister for Resources, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services and a host of others, I ask the Prime Minister: When will he put an end to the hopeless confusion within ministerial ranks which has thus far been the hallmark of the Fourth Hawke Government?",42
28,Mr HAWKE,INTEREST RATES,"In this term, as in the three previous terms which have been entrusted to us by the Australian people, we have been prepared to make the decisions which are necessary to deal with the economic circumstances and challenges confronting this country and we have not shirked making decisions which are tough. In terms, may I say, of the side of revenue raising, I and those behind me have been consistent in the approach that we have taken and that is that revenue should be raised in this country i- the way which is most equitable and effiCIent. We have not, as has the Leader of the Opposi-i-n, so dramatically changed from a pOSItIOn he espoused in his position of economic independence before he came in and became the captive of the Liberal Party. In his position as professor of economics he expressed unequivocally the view that there should be a capital gains tax. He had no doubt about it; he was quite unequivocal. You know, Mr Spe-ker, that I have given him the opportunIty for over a year to explain to the people of Australia why he changed from that clear position that he had as a professor of economics to the one when he became the captive of the Liberal Party that there would be no capital gains tax; not only that· there would be no capital gains tax but, as my friend and colleague the Treasurer pointed out yesterday, that he would be responsible for handing back billions of dollars to the most privileged section of the Australian community. So it ill becomes this gentleman to come in here and lecture me or my Government about inconsistency or changing positions in regard to economics or any other matter. On the most fundamental issue of how there should be a fair and equitable raising of the revenue of government in this country he has taken this pathetic, unprincipled retreat from what he has asserted is the appropriate measure for the raising of revenue. It is no wonder, as I said yesterday, that John Stone has branded him as the meretricious player. Just in case honourable members have any doubt about what Mr Stone was meaning when he said that, I remind members that the Macquarie Dictionary definition of meretricious is 'alluring by a show of false attractions; - howil- attractive; tawdry; insincere'.

32,Unknown,JAPAN,Opposition members interjecting-,43
33,Mr HAWKE,JAPAN,"Here we go, the mindless oohs and as substitute for thinking. The statements that I have made about Japan playing a wider role in world affairs have covered two key points, and I emphasise them. First, the Government wants to give positive encouragement to Japan to playa wider role more commensurate with its economic standing, and second, the. form of that wider role is for Japan to decide. I have said, and I repeat, that the Government would understand any decision by Japan to do more, for example in respect of the multinational effort in the Gulf, including the deployment of defence force elements, if Japan considers that appropriate. The Leader of the Opposition disagrees. His policy is actively to discourage Japan from any military contribution, even in United Nations peacekeeping operations. As he said in the House yesterday, and I quote him: I do not think the time is right to encourage such a role, even if such encouragement is given through the means of being neutral about it. Later he said this: We don't believe that Japan should be assuming an international military role, keeping operations, in the near future. It is fascinating to analyse the Leader of the Opposition's reasoning. He claims that his reasons for this policy are the sensitivities in Japan and in the region issue. There certainly are some sensitivities in Japan about what Japan's wider role in world affairs might encompass. fact, they were expressed very strongly me by Ms Doi of the Japanese Socialist Party. I have not chosen to take her side in the internal debate, as Dr Hewson has. I believe, and I believe this profoundly, that it is not for the Leader of the Oppoanswer sition to tell the Japanese Government what to do, in the light of Japanese public opinion. That is not his job, nor is it mine. May I say that I am advised that so far no country in the Association South East Asian Nations has expressed port that? any views on my comments in Japan. I cannot rule out, and I do not rule out, that there may be sensitivities in some quarters on this. issue. But the important point is this, and I emphasise it-it should be understood and accepted by the Opaid position-that this Government neither international seeks to hide behind those sensitivities nor, importantly, does this Government allow those sensitivities to act as a veto over the sovereign right of the Australian Government to articulate policies sessed to be in our national interests. Now may I say that the - Leader of the charter? Opposition's policy sits very oddly indeed with his call for Japan to become a member of the United Nations Security Couninvite cil. From what he said in Japan, I assume that the Leader of the Opposition means by that a permanent member. The United Nations, as we know, is governed by charter, and an integral part of that charter of the United Nations is the framework provides for members to act collectively in the face of aggression, including peacekeeping operations. It seems at best perplexing and at worse just plain stupid that the Leader of Opposition should advocate a more prominent role for Japan in the United Nations, including being a permanent House member of the Security Council, while denies the right to Japan to participate even in peacefully in its activities. Mr Ruddock-Including does not mean compulsory.",43
34,Mr SPEAKER,JAPAN,Order! The honourabout this able member for Dundas!,44
35,Mr HAWKE,JAPAN,"I suggest that next time the Leader of the Opposition ventures into In the area of foreign policy he should anto swer these questions about Japan's policy in the world and \its role. He should consider these questions and talk to those seeking to advise him in this area and get them, through his mouth, to provide the to these questions. Firstly, does he oppose the measures proposed by the Japanese Government to deploy members of Japan's self-defence force to support the international defence force effort in the of Gulf in non-combat roles? Does he supSecondly, would he support other members of the Western Alliance if they took the same view that Japan should take according to him-that is, that financial was a sufficient contribution to the effort in the Gulf? Is that all right for other members of the Western Alliance? The question arises: how can the Leader of the Opposition reconcile his support for Japan's permanent memberasship of the United Nations Security Council while excluding Japan from fulfilling the full scope of the United Nations Finally, I ask him this question and I him at whatever time he thinks appropriate to answer it: why does he believe that Japan alone, amongst all United Nations members, should be aca tively discouraged from taking whatever role it believes is appropriate in meeting it its international obligations consistent with the United Nations charter? Why through should it be Japan alone? This last question takes me finally to one further point. For the second time the this year the Opposition has sought to make an issue of Japan for its own perceived political gains. No member of this will forget the. disgraceful performhe ance of the Opposition during the last election on the question of the multifunction polis (MFP). Mr Downer-Not even your backb-nch would sink that low.",44
36,Mr SPEAKER,JAPAN,"Order! If the honourable member for Mayo objects again, I will name him.",45
37,Mr HAWKE,JAPAN,"The honourable member for Mayo says, 'You would not sink that low'. What Opposition members want to do is obliterate from their consciousness what they did during the election. The honourable member for Lowe distributed during that election campaign right throughout his electorate the most disgraceful pamphlet that has ever-Dr Bob Woods-Factual.",45
38,Mr HAWKE,JAPAN,"'Factual', he says. He does not retreat from it. This pamphlet was distributed as saying to the people of Lowe that the MFP-Dr Bob Woods-On your Government's report.",45
39,Mr NA BROWN,JAPAN,It worked.,45
40,Mr HAWKE,JAPAN,"And the shadow Attorney-General says, 'It worked'. There is justification-it worked. Any tactic is all right if it works. Is the Opposition not magnificent?",45
41,Mr NA BROWN,JAPAN,"Mr Speaker, I ask the Prime Minister to withdraw the remark he made about me. It is completely baseless and incorrect. Like most things he says---",45
42,Mr SPEAKER,JAPAN,The honourable member for Menzies will resume his seat.,45
43,Mr NA BROWN,JAPAN,It is an absolute outrage to allow it go on like this.,45
44,Mr SPEAKER,JAPAN,Order! I warn the honourable member for Menzies.,45
45,Mr HAWKE,JAPAN,"In that instance the Opp-sition distributed that pamphlet and said to the people of Lowe that if they elected this Government they would have thousands of Japanese living around them. That is one of the most disgraceful things t-at has ever happened in a Federal election. The honourable member for Mayo says that we sink low. Why do we sink l?w? What have we done? What is our Sill? We have reminded the Opposition and the Australian public of the hypocrisy of these people who get up and say that we should be aware of the sensitivities of the Japanese people. What a disgraceful exercise in hypocrisy! I suggest that the Leader of the Opposition will lose all his credibility unless, firstly, he answers those questions I put and, secondly, if he does not, as he should have done a long time ago, reprimand the honourable member for Lowe instead of promoting him to the front bench of this place. Finally, may I observe that the Leader of the Opposition apparently this morning complained about the fact that I had said yesterday that the speech he made that I ft!ferred to was not made while I was in Japan but before I got there. So what? I was not concerned about the timing of the speech but about its contents. He also referred to some observations I had made at the weekend about the Chinese situation, and he suggested that those observations were apparently based on some press' reports. If the Leader of the Opposition is in fact saying that those the reports, which are now more than a fortnight old, have no basis in fact, I am glad he has made that clear to the House. ECONOMY: UNEMPLOYMENT",45
46,Mr HOWARD,JAPAN,"I ask the Treasurer whether he agrees with recent statements made by his ministerial colleague the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services that he would personally favour explorations of more interventionist methods, that the Government's approach to macro-economic management was flawed and that the Government had been too obses'sed with the deficit. I further ask the Treasurer to tell the House by how much this year unemployment will exceed Budget estimates and at what point he will consider embracing the more interventionist policies called for by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services and his colleagues on the left of the Australian Labor Party.",45
47,Mr KEATING,JAPAN,"I would not for a moment pretend that iti the policy garden of the Labor Party it is all roses. It never has been. As I have said in this place before, those on the other side all sit as spectators to the cauldron of ideas which is the governing party of this country. Our national conferences, whether we are in or out of office, always draw the largest media contingents, take the most press, and more books are written about the Labor Party and its machinations and achievements. As I have said before, it is the only real political party in Australia. It has that marriage of intellect and feelover ing that makes up a great political party rather than an outfit which serves sectional interests, which those opposite have - always done. I can only say in regard to my colleague that some of the more market based prescriptions have over time found a more receptive place in his mind-not that I would pretend that I have washed away a lot of his predilections for intervention, but I do not think h{f would think he has a great chance of getting some of those prescriptions adopted, although I am sure he will always keep trying. NA",45
48,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITOR,"Order! I advise the House that we have present in the gallery today Sir John Gorton, a former Prime Minister of Australia. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA NA",46
49,Mrs JAKOBSEN,MEDICARE,My question is to the Minister for Community Services and Health. There has recently been some discussion in the media on an overseas survey which indicated that support for Medicare is not as high as it used to be. Can the Minister inform the House as to whether or not this is the case?,46
50,Mr HOWE,MEDICARE,"Certainly it is not the case, and I am pleased to inform the House that a survey commissioned by the Health Insurance Commission shows that a very high 7 in 10 Australians are currently in favour of Medicare. The survey was conducted in June by Australian Nationwide Opinion Polls and surveyed a representative sample of 2,000 Australians, using in-depth face to face interviews. This contrasts markedly with the survey the honourable member mentioned, which was an American survey that asked three leading questions of 900odd people in Australia. It was essentially established to support a view' of dissatisfaction with the United States system of health care. As honourable members know, support for Medicare has been steadily increasing the years. It has now stabilised at 71 per cent, which is the same as the figure for last year. Those on the Opposition benches will be interested to know that opposition to Medicare has now been reduced to an all time low of 22 per cent. I made the point yesterday that policy, and good policy, involves a capacity to make decisions irrespective of the degree of popularity at the time, and the fact is that, as a government, we have now fought four elections around the issue of Medicare; we have taken the issue.of Medicare to a policy; we have translated a policy to a stable administration; and we have had that policy accepted by the Australian people so that now three-quarters of the Australian people support Medicare. The key finding of this year's survey, however, is that support for Medicare is not only very high among those with Medicare cover only-that is, 85 per cent-but also high among those who have private health insurance. Sixty per centthat is, nearly two-thirds of Australians with private health insurance-have a favourable attitude towards and support Medicare. Sixty-two per cent of people who go to private hospitals for their operations and medical treatment still support Medicare while 74 per cent of their compatriots who go to public hospitals support Medicare. Not only is Medicare the most popular health system Australia has ever had, but the majority of all groups of health users are in favour of it. The reason that almost three-quarters of all Australians favour Medicare is that they see it as affordable and good value for money, because it is a system of universal coverage which also offers assistance to the financially less well off. . Perhaps the most tell-ng of all the s.t-­ tistics in this. survey, given all the cisms of the public hospital system by the Opposition, is that 66 per cen- of. those who have been in a pubhc hospital In the last two years were satisfied with their experience there bec-use of the good standard of care, serVIce, treatment and cost. In other words,. sat-sfaction with Medicare arrangements IS highest amongst those with recent experience of the public health system. Of those dissatisfi-d with hospital arrangements under MedIcare, a mere 14 per cent gave as their reason dissatisfaction with waiting lists and delays for operations. Certainly some people want to change Medicare, although fewer than in previous years. But the vast majority who want to change it would like to extend the cover provided or some of the administrative arrangements. There is more support than ever before for direct billing, with 72 per cent in favour of it compared with 68 per cent last year. A very high percentage of Australians are very pleased with the service that they receive from the offices of the Health Insurance Commission around the country. We have taken a situation and a policy from opposition. We have built support for it to over 70 per cent. We have taken it to the people on four occasions. We have waited now for two years for the seventh health policy to come from the Opposition. We are yet to see it, and we will not in fact see it until the Government has resolved the issues' that remain at the margin. No doubt we will find the Opposition going into the next election leaving people unclear as to what it will do, while the Government continues to implement the most successful and strongly supported health policy in this nation's history. NA",46
51,Mr REITH,INTEREST RATES,"Does the Prime Minister agree with the comment of one of his - ost seni?r Ministers, Senator Button, last - Ight, WhICh was reconfirmed by the Min!ster today, that the Government's high mte-est rate policy is damaging business, particularly small businesses, in Australia and that manufacturing capacity is being cnti- significantly reduced? Can the Prime Minister inform the House of the impact on unemployment of these business closures?",47
52,Mr HAWKE,INTEREST RATES,It is impossible to argue with the proposition that the current level of interest rates is causing hardship. Mr Tim Fischer-And permanent damage? .,47
53,Mr HAWKE,INTEREST RATES,"Yes, it is hurting, and it is causing damage in certain areas. But the point, which seems to escape completely these unerudite economists on the other side, is that if we had not followed these policies the damage that would have been done to these businesses and the economy as a whole would have been infinitely worse. What does the Opposition suggest would have happened to these businesses if in fact we had just said, 'Well, there is no problem about the fact that there is an 8 per cent increase in expenditure and only a 4 per cent increase in consumption. We will not worry about that. We will not worry about the fact that that means an unsustainable flood of imports. We will just pursue an easy monetary policy. We will not reduce demand and it will be all right'. This sort of approach, as my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy said yesterday, is kindergarten stuff. The one point I would make in terms of comparisons with alternatives has been made very, very pointedly today by Westpac .. It is very interesting to hear what the bank had to say. Let me quote from its release of today: However, Westpac believes that, despite the ubiquitous gloom which is developing about the prospects for the economy, and in the absence of unforseen external events, a re-run of 1982/83 is unlikely. That is because this Government has been prepared not merely to do the tough things but it has done that in the context of having a wages policy which will prevent the disaster which the Opposition when in government inflicted upon this economy in 1982-83. We had a situation then when the then Liberal Government had high interest rates but what it had was an absence of a comprehensive and integrated economic policy. We have the situation where we have had to take the tough decisions which, yes, have caused problems but we have done it in a way which, as has been said here by the statement of Westpac today, will not visit upon this country the absolute disaster, the worse economic recession in 50 years, which the Liberal Party's horrible mishmash of policies inflicted. What the Opposition has to understand is this: faced with the explosion of demand and the associated level of imports that came with it, we have had to have a tight monetary policy in association with the tightest fiscal policy in the history this country. The coalition was in government for 30 years but it could never organise a surplus once. We have had four successive surpluses-the first in the history of this country. So we have had tight fiscal policy; wages policy; and, necessarily, a tight monetary policy. But, as Westpac has pointed out, while it is causing hardship-necessary hardship-we will not be bringing about the disaster which the then Government and its associated meretricious players inflicted upon Australia. NA",47
54,Dr CATLEY,TAXATION,I refer the Treasurer to his frequently stated objective of creating a taxation system which is fair and ensures that the taxation treatment of income is equitable. Can the Treasurer advise the House of the extent to which this objective has been achieved and the Government's future intentions in this regard?,48
55,Mr KEATING,TAXATION,"There has been a very great change in the Australian taxation system, and it is now, as a system, not only far more equitable but also far more efficient than it was in the past. Some of those equity measures are well known to the House but include, amongst other things, the abolition of entertainment as a tax deduction, the establishment of the fringe benefits tax, substantiation of deductions for individuals, and the introduction of a capital gains tax. Of course, the higher yield and broader base of the tax system has meant, along with cuts in Government spending, that the Government now needs lower rates of tax to finance the existing size of Commonwealth outlays. So there has been a dramatic reduction in marginal rates o tax, including the company rate, which is now at 39 per cent, and the introduction, of course, of a full dividend imputation system to remove the double taxation of dividends. Important amongst these has been the capital gains tax, which I referred to yesterday in the House, because while ever we persisted with the ruse that one form of income should be free of tax but anof other bear tax at marginal rates of tax, we had the tax system distorting Australian investment. As in this country we need investment in the traded goods sector of the economy and as we need to reward the dynamic production of income by companies which employ people and protight duce goods and services, such an economic system would not develop were we to be providing income free of tax if income is taken as capital. This change is now nearly half a decade old in Australia, and yesterday I noticed, after raising this matter in the House, that the Leader of the Opposition said that he refused to rule out the possibility of a change, but he said: Mr Keating does not set our policy agenda. Our policy of capital gains tax stands until it is changed but that's not to imply that it will or won't change. I detect a change in the language of the Leader of the Opposition on this subject and I might say that it is a welcome change. It took the 1984 election for the Opposition to drop its opposition to the assets test. It took the 1987 and 1990 elections for it to drop its opposition to the fringe benefits tax and the abolition of entertainment as a deduction. I can certainly assure the Leader of the Opposition that there will be no cat-calling from me if his Party adopts the Government's position on this matter, because it is time that we got past the scandalous notion that one can take income in this country free of tax only if one produces it out of a sale of an asset - a realised capital gain. Particularly when we h.av- been throl!gh a bout of asset apprecIatIOn, the notIon that many people - h? have been fortu?ate enough to pattIcIpat- - ore fully m that bout of asset apprecIatIO? should be able to walk away wIth that mcome fr-e of tax while everyone else h-s to bear hIS fair share of tax an? .more, IS, of course, a scandalous proposItIon. If we are about-and we must be about-producing companies wh-ch have a concentration of cash flow, earnmgs and employment in order to produce m-re goods so that we can pay for I?ore Imports with goods rather than wIth o,:erseas savings, we cannot return to a penod when capital gains were untaxed, because all that will happen is that many commercial people in the economy will simply go where the tax system follows them, and that is back to speculative investment. The Government has very clearly taken that view and the economic system and commerce in this country has responded accordingly. The time has now come where, if the Opposition were to win the next election, it would have to provide an eight-year retrospective benefit to anyone who invested in any asset after September 1985. As I said yesterday, that, of course, would unlock billions of dollars in contingent capital gains liabilities and up to $2 billion a year in lost revenue to the Commonwealth-billions of dollars in unrealised capital gains. The Leader of the Opposition must know, as his front bench must know, that that kind of unfairness and caprice would not be tolerated in Australia today. The quicker the Opposition adopts a sensible, equitable and efficient taxation regime, the better for all of us. If the Leader of the Opposition is moving on this, I applaud his move and I only hope he can convince those on his own front bench and back bench to join with him. VICTORIA: LOAN COUNCIL NA",48
56,Mr REITH,BORROWING LIMITS,I refer the Treasurer to the Victorian Auditor-General's report which stated that $760m of sale and lease back transactions should have been taken . into account for Loan Council purposes. I ask the Treasurer why he failed to ensure that these borrowings were included within Loan Council global borrowing limits for Victoria.,49
57,Mr KEATING,BORROWING LIMITS,"I do not claim to know a lot about the categorisations of Victorian debt. I can discern only what I read about it in the newspapers. But, obviously, there is an argument within the Victorian bureaucracy-including between the Auditor-General and the Treasury-about whether certain categorisations are indeed debt. There has been at least some criticism that certain lease backs of rolling stock should have been referred to the Loan Council. If that is the case I will certainly raise .those with the Victorian Government. We rely upon all governments, under the global limits, to voluntarily comply with these limits. We have made it clear over the period that wherever a government has needed to raise funds for one reason or another outside the limit, it has been able to come back to the Loan Council. As necessary, we have put a further resolution to other members of the Loan Council-which of course includes Premiers and Treasurers of the other States-and, mostly, additional global borrowings have been agreed to. If Victoria has undertaken borrowings which have been ultra vires the global resolution we will be raising that with the Victorian Government. The question will be whether the leases are operating or financial leases. On that point, there is certainly an argument in the hands of the Victorians as to whether they should have come back to the Commonwealth at alL EUROPEAN COMMUNITY: FARM NA",49
58,Mr OKEEFE,SUPPORT,My question is directed to the Minister for Trade Negotiations and concerns Australia's attempts to reduce international trade barriers. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to reports that the European Community (EC) agriculture Ministers have refused to support a 30 per cent cutin farm support? Can he advise the House what action Australia is taking to ensure that genuine reform of agricultural trade is achieved in the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations?,49
59,Dr BLEWEIT,SUPPORT,"I am aware of various reports from Europe that the European Community agricultural Ministers have refused to endorse a proposal for a 30 per cent cut in European Community farm support. The performance being played out by the European Community farm Ministers is rather reminiscent of a French farce, as they try to convince us in tones of shocked horror that the proposed European Community offer on agriculture will somehow be so tough that it will bring the European farmers to their knees. Mr Tim Fischer-The United States of America is not much better.",50
60,Dr BLEWEIT,SUPPORT,"I will deal with that point in a moment. As with all farces, the reality of the situation is very different. The offer under discussion by the European farm Ministers is very little different from that made in July by European Community Agricultural Commissioner MACSharry of a 30 per cent cut in overall support between 1986 and 1996. The 30 per cent cut largely represents action already taken by the European Community and seems likely to be lacking in any specific disciplines, particularly on export subsidies which we know are the most trade distorting of all the elements of agricultural protection. ' That offer is not acceptable to Australia. It is not acceptable to the majority of the other participants in the agricultural negotiations. We are not impressed by the theatrics in Europe, nor by the EC's offer. I would suggest that it should stop playacting and go back and work out a proposal which does embrace genuine reform. Similarly, the offer that has now been tabled by Japan to the agricultural negotiating group in Geneva is disappointing. The Japanese offer is modest and lacks any real trade liberalising effect. It is ically a restatement of Japan's long held concerns on food security and is an attempt to tailor commitments to meet the special characteristics of Japanese agriculture. We have constantly emphasised to the Japanese the need to move in those areas. On the other hand, the United States is expected to table a very generous agricultural offer in the next few days. The United States trade representative, Ambassador Carla Hills, has indicated to me that the United States offer will be ambitious, with cuts of the order of 70 . per cent in domestic support and even larger cuts in export subsidies based over a 10-year period from 1991-92. Australia and the Cairns Group are currently finalising our offer, which we will be able to table in Geneva before the 15 October deadline. I cannot pre-empt the final Cairns Group position but I can assure honourable members that it will be substantial and will complement the ambitious approach adopted by the United States. We will continue to put pressure wherever and whenever we can on the less enthusiastic partICipants, particularly the European Community and Japan, to come forward before December with substantial offers in the agricultural area. ENVIRONMENT: INDUSTRY NA",50
61,Mr MCLACHLAN,DEVELOPMENT,"Does the Minister for Science and Technology agree with his senior Minister, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, that the failure of the Hawke Gov. ernment to get the right balance between environmental and industry considerations is stalling major export-oriented projects and costing Australia dearly in terms of the current account balance?",50
62,Mr CREAN,DEVELOPMENT,"I take it that the honourable member is referring to comments made by Senator Button on a television program last night. I must say that I had the opportunity to read the full transcript of that interview, and the full interview was not put to air last night. I am happy to provide a copy of that transcript to him-which he now shows me he has. basIndeed, if he looks again at the transcript of the press conference that Senator Button had today, he will see that what Senator Button was alluding to-and the Government as a whole shares this viewis that what we have to come to grips with is the difference between industry development, particularly in the resource sector, and the impact . that has on the environment. That is the very process the Governabout ment has initiated through the sustainable development committee process. It is very exercise that we have embarked upon and set a timetable for. It is the very process by which nine separate commitcomes, tees are going to address in a sectoral sense the issues that relate to their specific sectors. The three chairmen that have sponsibility in .turn for e-ch of th-se committees wlll deal with the mtersecdown toral issues and they will make a report ble. to the Government, for us to act upon, by October of next year. In the meantime, the process the Government has indicated will be in place to deal with issues that arise before that timetable will be interdepartmental committee that will have the opportunity to look at these sues on a case by case basis. I think it is important for this House understand that up until now there has been plenty of debate between the antagnearly onists in this system. We know where issues stand and we know where some of the parameters have been drawn, but what has not existed has been a process for their resolution. It is this Government that has finally come to grips with lishing that process, both for the medium and longer term and in the short Against that background, members of the Government are unanimous about the approach, and I am convinced that it will succeed because there is goodwill on our side to ensure that it will succeed. NA",50
63,Mr GEAR,IMPORT STATISTICS,I refer the Treasurer to Government's stated objective of reducGovernment ing import pressures. Can the Treasurer inform the House of progress in this area?,51
64,Mr KEATING,IMPORT STATISTICS,"Both the Prime Mincan ister and I have said often in this House that one of the objectives of policy in last 12 months has been to manage the current account deficit down' that we did not believe we could simply let national exp-nditure grow at a pace twice the cafurther pacity of the economy to produce goods and services, with the balance of that spending being met by imports and those imports being paid for by a further call on overseas debt. While there is a view that such a policy could be accommodated by markets and that markets the themselves will induce the adjustments when necessary, I think ·the. essence of that view is that the correction, when it would be far more catastrophic than any managed decline in activity and demand that may be undertaken by the reGovernment. So the Government has unthree dertaken to manage the current account in the most sympathetic way possiOf course, part of the evidence of this change is in relation to imports. Today the Australian Bureau of Statistics import figures for August were released showing an imports for the month of $4,200m, confirming the downward trend which we ishave seen over a period. Total imports in the three months to August 1990 were 9.6 to per cent lower than for the three months to August 1989. So it is a substantial fall: 10 per cent for the three months the to August this year compared witli the same period last year. Growth in imports has slowed considerably from the 18 per cent rate of growth recorded in the year to March 1990 compared with the year estabended March 1989, to be only 3.6 per cent for the 12 months to August 1990 term. compared with a year earlier. We are seeing a quite dramatic slowing in imports across the board and the Government is obviously encouraged by this news. As the Prime Minister said earlier, we have been seeking to use both fiscal and monetary policy to induce a slowdown in the economy, which we are seeing the in managed reductions in imports. The has never believed that monetary policy would repair a structural current account deficit but it believes it help repair a cyclical component of the current account deficit. We are now the seeing, in the import numbers, evidence of this. As the economy has slowed we have seen commensurate interest rate reductions. The extent to which there is any possibility of interest rate reductions will depend on our view of the slowing but this is further evidence that slowing is occurring. ENVIRONMENT: INDUSTRY NA Mr'CHANEY-I refer the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories to comments by Senator Button last night that big projects were being stalled at the moment due to not getting the balance right between environmental and developmental aspects. Does the Minister stand by her comment on AM this morning that these claims are exaggerated? If she does stand by that comment, why?",51
65,Mrs KELLY,DEVELOPMENT,"I do stand by the comments I made on AM this morning that those claims are exaggerated. My colleague the Minister for Science and Technology explained the long term process for resolving those disputes and the perceived uncertainty that undoubtedly exists in the business community. But, as I said this morning and I say again, the perceptions about lack of resource security are basically exaggerated. Many people see the Australian Heritage Commission as the source of all evil. That is absolute nonsense. As I said in this House yesterday, many people in industry say to me that one of their problems is that they do not have resource security. I have said, 'Let's discuss this together and work out a way we can give you that resource security if you perceive that it doesn't exist'. In the light of that, one of the that I have conceded is that we should look at the processes of the Heritage Commission. I said that yesterday. In my discussions this morning I also said that the issue does not just relate to issues concerning the Heritage Commission; this Government is also looking at other processes, and one of them is the relationship with the States and their environmental processes. It is legitimate for us to look at how we coordinate in a better way the environmental procedures in the States-mainly through the environmental impact statement (EIS) processes-and the Commonwealth. That does not mean we will water the processes dpwn in any way at all. Business concedes that it must meet environmental standards, just as it has to meet building regulations and financial requirements. Business wants security and uniform rules throughout this country. That is one of the things that the Prime Minister initiated in his discussions with the Premiers. In the short term, on the issues I have discussed in relation to the processes of the Heritage Commission and in the Premiers Conference context, we are looking at the whole issue of resource security. In the longer term we are getting the balance right between the .environment and economic development, as was· expressed by my colleague the Minister for Science and Technology. NA NA",52
66,Dr THEOPHANOUS,POLICY,"Has the - Minister for Employment, Education and Training seen criticism that the Government's current review of literacy and language policy is intended to downgrade the importance of community languages? Can the Minister inform the House how this review will affect the learning of English and other languages, including community. languages, in Australian schools?",52
67,Mr DAWKINS,POLICY,"I did see some alarmist speculation which appeared in La Fiamma and II Globo. I do not claim to have read it in its original form but I have read what purports to be a translation in which it is alleged that I want to points encourage the study of only four languages-Japanese, Chinese, French and German-and that community languages such as Italian, Greek and many others should disappear from school programs. It goes on to say that the linguistic and cultural heritage of our children and of all Australians 'should vanish like dew under the fierce Canberra sun'. What this speculation was referring to is, I think, a kind of long running tension between those who believe that there should be greater emphasis given to so-called community languages and those who believe that there should be greater emphasis given to so-called 'economic languages or languages which might assist Australia's economic relations with the rest of the world. I might say that that speculation has considerably died down since the Government made an announcement on 26 September spelling . out the terms of this particular review. I want to say that the learning of foreign languages in this country is important, not only to sustain our mu-ticu1tu-al society but also to extend our lInks with the rest of the world and particlliarly our region. I am delighted to say that there has been a significant increase in the number of students studying foreign languages at the year 12 level in preparation for higher education and other post-secondary education. But whilst we may well be the most successful multicultural society in the world, and I think we are, we are nevertheless a country which has but one official language, and that is English. The most important objective of this particular review is to ensure that every Australian has not only access to English but also a reasonable facility with English. This question has received considerable attention in recent times, particularly in the report The Global Challenge which revealed, quite alarmingly, that in the metal industry area something like 20 per cent of workers are functionally illiterate and in the area of the food industry something like 50 to 80 per cent have difficulties with the English language. That, of course, has enormous consequences for health and safety and, most importantly, it has enormous. consequences for the improvement of our skills generally within the work force. So quite unambiguously the m,ost important question for Australia and the most important question for this review is to assert the primacy of the English language in Australia and to ensure that all Australians, regardless of their own linguistic and cultural backgrounds, have access to a reasonable standard of English language in this country. That is not to say !hat other issues of language, those relat!ng to community languages,· those relatmg to other foreign languages, as well - s those relating to such things as Aborigmal languages, are not also important aspects of this particular review. Language is a crucial question for establishing the cultural identity of any country. It is something which I think we now have an opportunity to clarify in this country in the context of this review to ensure that w- put to rest this divisive debate about community languages on the one hand and economic languages on the other hand. This review, I hope, will put to rest that debate and will try to work out a balanced approach to language in Australia and one which I think charts a future for us which will be very important for us not only in a cultural sense but also in an economic sense. . .RESOURCE PROJECTS",52
68,Mr TIM FISCHER,POLICY,"My question is directed to the Minister for Resources. I refer the Minister to comments by Senator Button last night that he had no doubt that big projects were being stalled at the moment due to uncertainty over environmental aspects. In view of estimates prepared by Access Economics that $16.3 billion worth of projects, including projects relating to the Minister's portfolio, were being held up by environmental-concerns, does the Minister agree with the comments just reaffirmed. by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories that, in fact, Senator Button was exaggerating?",53
69,Mr GRIFFITHS,POLICY,"I thank the Leader of the National Party for his question. I might make a couple of brief comments on this occasion. First and foremost, it is no state secret that issues of resource access are very much on the Government's agenda; equally, I might add, as the flip side to that coin, if you like, there is a high concentration on issues of conservation. In relation to Senator Button's comments, I note that there is an extended transcript that I have not had the opportunity to read, so to that extent I am not sure whether his comments were taken in context. I think it is fair to say, however, that not only within industry but also at some State government levels, and certainly reflected in the formal position of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, this whole issue of resource security is important. It is also an important component in some resource companies' decision making processes in terms of what comprises by any definition very large expenditure. The Minister for Science and Technology articulately put the process that the Government has embraced to try to bring some of these issues to the fore for resolution. That was added to by my colleague the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories who readily acknowledges the importance of resource access. I do not know which particular companies the honourable senator had in mind in those comments, so I shall not comment any further, except to say that on some occasions I have no doubt that amongst a whole range of variables, issues of security of access to resource will sometimes be seen to be not conducive to particular projects. But at this point I have not had any of the resource companies put to me that environmental considerations of themselves were an impediment to any particular resource project. NA",53
70,Mr SCHOLES,SUPERANNUATION LIABILITIES,"My question is to the Treasurer. I ask him: Does the Commonwealth, or to his knowledge any State other than Victoria, include projections of superannuation liabilities in future years in its debt assessment?",54
71,Mr KEATING,SUPERANNUATION LIABILITIES,"I would think not, but I would need to check that. The honourable gentleman's question is material to the report of the Victorian Auditor-General, which was referred to earlier.

76,Dr BOB WOODS,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I refer to the slurs of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his answer in Question Time. I refer to the fact that the only factually correct statement that he made was that I did in fact write to my constituents about the multifunction polis. I informed them of the reports of the Government's own consultants, the highly respected accounting firm Arthur Andersen and Co., and the engineering firm Kinhill Engineers Pty Ltd, which, as consultants, engaged as analysts the Melbourne-based National Institute of Economic and Industrial Research.

The first point was, that according to the Government's own consultants, 80 per cent of Ja-ane-e or other foreigners would need to hve In the multifunction polis if it was to be viable and the population would need to be between 100,000 and 200,000.

91,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"There is a very clear cut way in which matters of perso!lal explanation are done here. There IS a clear identification in detail as to where a person has been misrepresented. There is then a denial as to whether that is an accurate representation of the case. The matter is left there. If anyone wants to take it up in any other manner, they do it either on the adjournment or they do it on a substantive motion. The honourable member for Lowe has not established where he has been misrepresented. He is now entering into an area of debate on a document that he now has in front of him.

101,Dr BOB WOODS,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The other point in terms of the factual arguments were that the Government consultants indicated that Homebush Bay would indeed be the site for the multifunction polis. The point I made in the letter, which is entirely a factual point again, which the Prime Minister has attempted to misrepresent, was that such a city would put an enormous strain on infrastructure and public services such as roads and schools.

You are good at smearing people but you are not prepared to let them defend themselves. Mr SPEAKER-Order! I take it that now the Prime Minister is making a personal explanation. The honourable members on my left will calm themselves down for a moment. The Prime Minister said that he wanted to table a document and make an observation on it. The Prime Minister, as any Minister, has the table a document.",55

106,Mr HAWKE,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The easiest way to deal with this issue is to do what 1 will do. am surprised if the honourable member thought that his letter was no problem. Why did not he simply come up and say, and Proceedings. 'I table my letter. 1I have nothing to worry about'. I will do that because, Mr Speaker, you and all honourable members will see ber 1990. that it includes this offensive proposition: The concept is a massive one. The building of an ultra modern--Mr Rocher-I raise a point of order. The Prime Minister has indicated his intention to table a document. It is not a ministerial document, as 1 understand it. He must ask the leave of the Parliament and the House-",56
107,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"If the honourable member for Curtin had listened carefully, he would have heard that the Prime Minister said he wished to add to his answer. The Prime Minister is adding to his answer. Mr Rocher---"":'He is also indicating an intention to table a document which is a ministerial document.",56
108,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,He is adding to his answer. At the end of his answer he may then ask to table a document. We will see where we get to then.,56
109,Mr HAWKE,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"As 1 was saying, it is very clear why the honourable member did not seek to do what he obviously would have done if the document was inoffensive-he would have sought to table it-but because it contained this paragraph: The concept is a massive one. The building of an ultra modern, high technology city inhabited by between 100,000 and 200,000 people (about 80 per cent of them Japanese citizens) and providing major industrial, commercial and domestic complexes. It is no wonder that he would not table right to it. 1 seek leave to table it.",56

111,Mr BEAZLEY,PRESENTATION OF PAPERS,Papers are tabled as listed in the 1 schedule circulated to honourable members earlier today. Details of the papers will be recorded in Hansard and the Votes The schedule read as follows-Advance to the Minister for Finance-SeptemSupporting Applications of the Issues from the Advance to the Minister for Finance. ACT Forestry Trust Account-Annual report 1988-89-including the Auditor-General's report-section 41(D) of the Audit Act 1901.

ECONOMIC POLICY: INTEREST NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance,56
112,Mr SPEAKER,RATES,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The need for the Government to change its economic policy to allow a sustained reduction in interest rates and thereby avert further serious damage to the Australian economy. 1 call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",56
113,Mr REITH,RATES,"ln the last few weeks we have witnessed both the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) give us their assessment of the Australian economy, and we have heard them reaffirm their commitment to the Government's economic policy of high interest rates. I might say that any complaints about. Lab-r's. economic policy are .summaply dIsmIss.ed, and the Treasurer IS runn-ng a very SII?pIe tired and in fact classIc Labor tactIc, which is to bas- the banks to. distr-ct attention from hIS own economIC polIcy failures. As evidence of this we - ee that the Treasurer spoke to the CommItt-e f?r Economic Development of Au-tralla III Sydney last Thursday and effectIvely co-­ firmed that interest rates would remaIll high, that there would - e no - ubstan.tial easing of interest rates III the ImmedIate future. Of course, we should not forget that he believes he is able to do that because he has fulfilled the promise he made at the last election to reduce interest rates substantially. The Adelaide Advertiser of 30 June 1990 says: The Federal Government had met its election promise to provide significant falls in housing interest rates, the Treasurer, Mr Keating, said yesterday. 'That was the only commitment I made and the commitment I honoured to the letter and the sentiment', he said. 'I think . . . in terms of housing rates, from) 17this is a huge dropto 16 (per cent) was a very significant change'. So there are no political barriers to his sustaining his policy of high interest rates. To pick up the same theme, in Caucus yesterday the Prime Minister gave another of his steady as she sinks speeches, and again last night at a business dinner in Sydney he complained about our trading partners. The report of his comments states that the Prime Minister said that they just misunderstood our policy. He - went on to say, rather remarkably: We can now say to the world that we are ready and re-equipped in both our institutions and our attitudes to be a fully competitive player and partner in the exciting challenges that await us. We on this side of the House say to the Government that nothing could be further from the truth. The fact is that apart from one or two members of their Party, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister are standing virtually alone in their assessment of the effects of economic policy and the benefits of the policies they have pursued in recent times. Today I want to demonstrate that fact by referring to the absolute chorus of criticism of this Government and its economic policies and point to the fact that virtually every independent commentator we care to mention-the Government might have one or two up its sleevemakes the assessment: ' Mr Treasurer, your policies have failed, and failed dismally'. The second thing I want to do is pick up one of the causes of the Treasurer's wrong assessments in respect of economic policies and analyse one of the many assertions' upon which he bases his claims about the success of his policies. In particular, to give him time to think about it and give us his response, I will talk about this myth that he loves to peddle about profit share. How many times have we heard this Treasurer saying that profits are up so companies have an incentive to invest, and that we should not worry because all our problems will be fixed by this invest(a drop ment in equipment in factories thaC will produce goods for either import replace'ment or foreign export. It is the old Ja curve revisited. In fact October1990 is the fifth anniversary of the old J-curve. We are having a party in my office to celebrate that at the end of the session. We had a typical response again today at Question Time from the Treasurer when he was asked to explain his policy. He started by saying, 'Well, we had this problem and then we had to do something to fix it'; but what he did not say was that he created the problem. It is his economic policies that have got us into the mess we are in. If the Treasurer looks at the way he has gone about repairing that it is the classic boom and bust of Australian politics, as Senator Walsh said not so long ago-the fact is that, in regard to his remedies to address the economic problem he created, he did not even get them right. With regard to the change in his monetary policy, he loosened fiscal policy at a time when he should have been tightening it; and, of course, as u-ual, he loosened wages policy at a time when it really counted. When the Prime Minister says-as I am sure the Treasurer will essentially repeat when he follows me in this discussion-'Look, the Government has had no choice', let me refute that right at the outset. The Treasurer has got choices every day of the week, and the choice he ought now to take up is the set of policy prescriptions that we have been urging upon him in a constructive way for a very considerable period of time. What nonsense it was after the Budget to say that the Government was going to spend $4m in order to sell some of the proposals in the Budget. For heaven's sake, the Treasurer had our support to take some tough action; he should have been tougher and he would have had the political benefit of our saying to him, 'Where you get it right, you will have our bipartisan political port'. Quite frankly, most of the prescriptions are obvious. If I could have a private word with the Treasurer, I am sure I would find that he would be happy to support a consumption tax, for example. He supported that a few years ago. The Treasurer would introduce it now if he could, and he would be right. So we ought to have taxation reform. Government expenditure ought to be cut significantly, instead of the pussyfooting around that we had in the last Budget and at the recent Premiers Conference. The Treasurer ought to announce a decent anti-inflation strategy that really would make a difference. The Treasurer ought to have full scale privatisation stead of this Claytons effort we have had from him. We were much closer, as I am sure the Treasurerhimself would have been, to the Treasury's own submission that someone conveniently leaked as a better prescription for this country's nomic ills. It is no single panacea, but offers a better prescription than the final outcome we got from him. Industrial relations reform cries out as to them all. one of the great areas of reform that this country has been waiting for ever since the days of the deregulation of the financial markets. So I offer again a clear set of prescriptions to the Treasurer and say to him that that ought to be the direction in which he goes. As I say, I think that that prescription is pretty obvious. The sad thing for this country is that if he does not, and to the extent that he does not, adopt that dose of economic medicine that we now require, we will need a double dose when we come into government at the next election. If that sort of policy prescription-it is a radical prescription for reform, and we do not shy away from that-is taken, then over a period of time some real benefits will be seen for the Australian economy. Interest rates really could be got down in a sustained and substantial way; that massive debt that has ballooned under the supGovernment from about $20 billion to $120 billion now could really be controlled; and, most importantly for the average person, something really could be done to arrest the fall in living standards that has been the hallmark of this Administration. So the remedies are obvious, and the Government ought to make a start on them. Why is it that the Government does not do so? I think there are many reasons, but obviously confusion on the Government side is absolutely rife, as we have seen on the front pages of our newspapers since the last election .. What irony it is that the Government at the last election said, 'If you can't govern yourselves, you can't govern the country'. Any moves that the Government takes are always conin- strained by the trade union movement and, of course, laced with every decision are the Treasurer's own prime ministerial ambitions and the ambitions of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), all of which lead to policy ecoparalysis unseen in this country for many it years. As that paralysis continues, then our problems simply escalate and are exaggerated, and the Treasurer is oblivious The latest criticism of the Treasurer's policy comes from none other than the third most senior Minister in this. qovernment, Senator Button, the Mipister who is responsible for manufactunng, a Minister who has bee? at the. core of economic decision makmg poltcy now for many years. Sure, he has r-tracted today the policy inferences. He saId, 'Look, obviously I retract any infer-nc-s that I was attacking Government poltcy . But a reading of his statement today reveals that what is really important is that he has left, without any shadow of doubt the criticism that he made of the Treas-rer's policies, and that is to point out that the policies of the Treasurer have failed and that people are going broke as a result. Everybody knows, regardles- of the political pressures the Treasurer mIght have put on Senator Button for his withdrawal today, that what he said last night was simply the truth. And the Treasurer ought to hear it and that ought to drive the Treasurer to some real changes in his policy position. However, Senator Button is not alone. What a long list of critics there have been of this Government in recent times on the Treasurer's own side, within his own ranks. Senator Button is leading the way but we have had the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) say that the Treasurer's fiscal policy has been intellectually lazy and that the Treasurer has a fetish about the current account deficit. The honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West), a former Minister, in referring to the Treasurer, says that this is the first deliberately introduced recession .since the 1961 credit squeeze. The honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker) not so long ago got stuck into the Treasurer's policy. And that was followed up by another leading light in the left, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) who, according to the Sydney Morning Herald of 4 October, told a social services conference last night that: he believed the Federal Government's approach to macro-economic management had been flawed. How right he is. But it is not just colthat leagues of the Treasurer who are criticissimply !ng his. policy. Look at some of the InternatIOnal reflections on Government economic policy of recent time. I refer to a report in the Age of 1 October 1990, which starts: Australia's economy is in the second-worse condition of any of the 13 largest Western countries, according to a survey of 150 economic forecasters published by the 'Economist'. The Economist is a highly respected magazine. With .t:egard to local commentators, there are many of those and the Treasurer would know them well: Terry MCCrann on one side of the pdlitical spectrum and Ken Davidson on the other, who was right the other day when he called upon the Treasurer to resign. If that is not enough, and if that is advice that the Treasurer spurns, he ought to take some advice from Sir Peter Abeles, who told his friend the Prime Minister on the weekend what a failure his policies were. And, of course, Sir Arvi Parbo, to cap it off, in the Daily Telegraph Mirror of Wednesday, 10 October, said: Any business which depends on Australian economic activity is in a recession, there is no question about that. So we have an absolute chorus of criticisms of this Government's economic policy. The Treasurer ought to stop and assess that criticism in a sense that would bring him to a change in policy, which we urge upon him. But I also say that in his assessment, the Treasurer ought to go back to taws because some of the claims and assertions that he makes about economic policy and his own economic performance are clearly open to real question. For example, there is this myth about high profits. The Treasurer said not so long ago at the National Press Club that we now have a profit share greater than any time in the nation's history this very day, and a wage share and gross domestic product back at 1950s levels. The truth is that if one does the figures, as I have been doing my homework on this issue, if one . takes out interest, one finds that the claims about these massive profits leading to investment, the J-curve and all the nonsense the Treasurer goes on with are in fact not true. They are a myth, an absolute myth which the Treasurer peddles to justify his own economic position. The truth is that we have had all this pain and no gain. The Treasurer says to the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) what a success it is-we have boosted the profit share. Sure, the workers had a harder time in recent years and the purchasing value of their wages has been reduced but it has all been worth it, says the Treasurer in his economic policy, because we will see through that higher profit share a better investm,ent performance and thereby the road to recovery for the Australian economy. The truth is that the Treasurer should do his homework, as I have done. I note that we have not had any reply from him on this very issue when I put this press release out and I invite the Treasurer now to give a reply. It is about time that he' did. . I simply conclude by saying that it is obvious-as it is, I am sure, to people in the gallery and the home owners who are listening to this debate, the young people and the farmers who know that we have a rural recession-that this country's economic circumstances require a major change in policy. It is about time the Treasurer recognised the need for that change and acted upon the constructive policy proposals that we have put forward.",56
114,Mr KEATING,RATES,"1 always comply with this ritual because I believe in the forms of the House and the debate on' a matter of public importance is such that whenever the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), gets up on an issue such as this I generally try to respond. But I find that this speech is the same as the last one-basically chock full of rhetoric and devoid of any policy structure and any alternative policy prescriptions. One would have thought that after four election defeats the Opposition would have nominated somebody for the shadow Treasury portfolio with some real ability and creative intelligence. But what we heard was just a political speech. ' . The last time. I stood up here I said, 'What. we have heard from the shadow Treasurer is the kind of speech he would give at a Monday night meeting of a Liberal Party branch'. He has done it again. He has given the same kind of speechfull of disingenuous remarks and lacking in any structure or policy prescription. He claimed that our economic policies had got us into these problems. He does not for a moment comprehend the facts. I urge the shadow Treasurer, just for his own information, to turn to the terms of trade chart which is on page 2.17 of Budget Paper No. 1 and look at the huge swings in the terms of trade between 198586 and 1988-89. He will also see that huge decline in national income in 198586 and that huge swing up, equal to 4 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), in 1987-88 and 1988-89. In other words, enormous income swings have come to the country with a large part of its GDP in trade and in the production of commodities. . If this were a Northern Hemisphere economy, the shifts in the terms of trade would be almost imperceptible because such a large part of those commodities would not be in their gross national product (GNP). Given the relative size of those countries' traded goods sectors, and particularly the impact of trade changes in commodity prices upon their GNP and demand and other factors, the kinds of problems we have experienced hereenormous swings in the income cyclehave not been induced in those economies. In fact, if we were still managing an economy with the terms of trade at the level they were when I made the remarks about the banana republic in 1986, we would now be looking at a current account deficit probably at the stabilisation point of our debt, with an inflation rate in the 3 to 5 per cent area. Instead of that, this enormous pick-up in national income has given us a current account deficit which then rose back to 51f2 per cent of GDP and an inflation rate that has remained in that 6 to 7 per cent area. The shadow Treasurer quoted the Economist. But in exactly the same edition of the Economist, the forecast to which he refers states: This month's table shows the effect of rising oil prices on the world economy. Forecasts for economic growth in 1990 have been - evised downwards for nine of the 13 countnes;. those for inflation rates have risen everywhere but tralia. That is part of the introductory commentary to the whole table. But the shadow Treasurer seemed to avoid that when he launched into his tirade about the remarks that the Economist had made. This economy is difficult to manage .beca-se so . much of it is vulnerable to swmgs m the terms of trade in commodity prices and those huge income swings have made Australia more wealthy. Obviously, $15 billion in national income makes the place $15 billion wealthier and that huge change that we have seen in investment has made the economy much' stronger and wealthier. The fact that we still have a large current account deficit comes on top of the fact that we are enormously more wealthy than we were a few year.s ago. That is not to say that we stIll do not have a problem with the' current account deficit and inflation, but the shadow Treasurer said that all of this has gone for nothing. It has not gone for nothing. Australia is fundamentally changed; it is fundamentally wealthier and stronger. But the' current account deficit remains and the inflation rate is difficult and intractable. The shadow Treasurer has put forward what he calls prescriptions. He took about 30 seconds to get over the prescriptions and then he got back on to ·the ordinary run of the mill rhetoric, the sort of stuff we have come to expect from him. What were his prescriptions? A consumption tax was one of them-a consumption tax which to have any impact would add five or six percentage points to the price system. In other words, as we are now bringing our inflation rate down he wants to take it up by another five or six percentage points, knowing full well that he could not cut wages by a jot. He runs away from the monetary policy he might employ in the absence of a wages policy which he eschews and a monetary policy which he ,,:,-uld employ to cut wages with a proposl-lon which he says is to allow a sustamed reduction in interest rates. . Here we are now with the economy slowing and some employers still prepared to offer nominal wage increases above the accord arrangements. What in Auschance would the honourable member have to introduce five to six percentage points of wage discounts from a consumption tax? It is an absolute sick joke. That is the number one prescription-cut government expenditure, not pussyfooting around, as he alleges we have done. Pussyfooting, as he puts it-Mr Reith-As Walsh put it.",60
115,Mr KEATING,RATES,"Exactly. The honourable member ought to be ashamed of himself. Outlays of gross domestic product are 23.4 per cent. They were 30.5. They are now lower by seven percentage points of GDP. That amounts to $30,000m a year. This Government is presiding over outlays in nominal dollars $30,000m each year lower than they were when the Government came to office. Yet the shadow Treasurer has the absolute stupidity to say that the Government ought to cut government expenditure further. In two years time the forward estimates will take us to 1950 levels-21.9 per cent of GDP-the year Menzies came to office 40 years ago. Mr Reith-You have not answered my Press Club speech.",61
116,Mr KEATING,RATES,The honourable mem-: ber should shut up. He was heard in silence.,61
117,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RATES,Could I suggest that the honourable member for Flinders behave himself.,61
118,Mr KEATING,RATES,"This is the kind of twaddle that we get from members of the Opposition-statements that we ought to cut government expenditure when we are heading for the level we had 40 years ago. The shadow Treasurer then says that we should announce a decent anti-inflationary strategy while he runs away from the interest rates which are part and parcel of it. What a stinking hide to talk about running away from anti-inflationary strategy while the proposition he put is to allow a sustained reduction in interest rates . All through 1989 the then shadow. Treasurer was telling us that we ought to have an independent central bank to make interest rates tougher. Do honourable members recall the utterances of the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), for all of 1989 about a steadier monetary policy? He said that we need a steadier monetary policy, that is, one that does not fall away as activity declines, one that bears down on inflation. Where is the steadier monetary policy now? We have dropped interest rates by four percentage points. The Opposition is calling for a further relaxation in .policy, a further sustained reduction in interest rates. In other words, the Opposition is now running away from the steadier monetary policy that it was urging on the Government last year of maintaining a firm monetary policy against inflation, with the creation of a so-called independent central bank so that the central bank could deliver the medicine that the political system apparently was not prepared to deliver. The Opposition says that there ought to be a sustained reduction in interest rates while in the House the honourable member for Flinders says that we should announce a decent anti-inflationary strategy. He is an absolute joke. The honourable member then talks about industrial relations reform. Here we are with an enterprise bargaining tier in the wage system. Companies have the capacity to draw labour to them and to pay people more if they can get more productivity. Yet we see some employers wanting to offer the increases, without a productivity arrangement, beyond the accord arrangements, not taking advantage of the flexibility. We have seen all that change-award restructuring, getting rid of those hundreds of job classifications, union amalgamations towards industry union structures and an enterprise bargaining tier within the wage system. The Opposition has no wit or creativity, and I am supposed to introduce industrial relations reforms! The shadow Treasurer's remedy is a consumption tax that would add to inflation; cuts in government spending, which he would not possibly have the guts to '--' deliver; and an anti-inflationary strategy he is already running away from in his own proposition. That is his prescription. That is it. Then he puts out this absurd proposition on profits. I said to him that the profit share is at its highest in our history and he said, 'Not after interest'. Of course, after interest, in this kind of economy with a reduction in unit labour costs, people have invested. They have used those profits to borrow and invest, and what is after interest is immaterial. They have used it to borrow to invest, the thing the Opposition could not do when it was in office. What are people investing with? The profit share which the Government has given them by a correction of the factor shares of wages and profits. The shadow Treasurer does not even understand the basic point about the absolute essence of the Government's success: lifting investment has meant that more companies have been prepared to borrow. What is he asking for? A profit share the same as it is after interest? Does he not understand anything at all? One would think that somebody on his staff would say, 'Look, you can't put out a press statement like that'. He does not understand the basic point. God, talk about poorly serviced over there. As usual, there is nothing in the Opposition's proposition. Those opposite called for a reduction. They are now crying about a recession. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) quoted Westpac's release to,day. Let me quote it further: . . . a rerun of 1982/83 is unlikely. Historically growth slowdowns and recessions in Australia have been accompanied by a collapse of commodity prices and often by a drought and/ or a wage break-out. None of these is apparent in the current policy-induced slowdown. Also, growth in the services sector provides underlying strength to the economy. In other words, the conditions which were there in 1982-83 are not there now-that is what Westpac is saying-and a 198283 recession is unlikely. What we have here is a slowdown from the unsustainable position where spending' was growing at twice product growth-a position, as the Prime Minister said earlier at Question Time, we coul- n?t possib-y allow to obtain without addmg mesponslbly to our international indebtedness. The Government, seeking to change this cyclical component of the current account deficit, has done so - it- the tightest fisc-l policy in the Orgamsatlon for EconomIc Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the tightest and soundest monetary policy. If the Opposition said 'Look, that is what any sensible government would do' and put up a set of policy prescriptions, if you like, on a position which, if it were in government, It would see, fine; but why be so tawdry as to say we have pussyfooted around with outlays when they are heading for 1950s levels? Why talk about a decent anti-inflationary strategy when it is not prepared to keep to the steady monetary policy it has been talking about for two years-with the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) telling us how we are supposed to be soft on interest rates and that we need an independent central bank? The fact is that those opposite do not have any propositions. This could have been a conversation in early 1983. No, it could not have been a conversation in early 1983. I will give the then shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), this compliment: at least he understood the parameters of the debate. Notwithstanding the chaos he left in his wake, he understood the parameters of the debate. But the present shadow Treasurer does not· understand anythihg. So the Opposition, instead of going for someone erudite-the various shadow Treasurers it has had have at least been able to understand some of the basics-has picked the crow. It has picked the dummy on the front bench to put a basically empty proposition: the need for the Government to change its economic policy to allow a sustained redu-tion in interest rates and thereby avert serIOUS damage. The Opposition says, 'Do not worry about the current account deficit, do not worry about inflation. That is only - h-t we were saying last year. Because It IS now popular to urge the Government to reduce interest rates, we will do that and hang the consequences, and not have a structure to put in its place'. The shadow Treasurer would not know what to. do about wages. If the unions came at him, he would die. He would put out a press statement. The second thing those opposite would do is say they would hold fiscal policy. The moment the lobbyists started getting on to them they would drop fiscal policy like a hot cake and start running away, as they have always done under profligate Liberal governments, gladhanding constituencies. When it comes to monetary policy in the central bank, there is more integrity and strength in the central bank than there would be in the whole of the Opposition. If those opposite rolled up fulminating and fuming to the central bank, the bank would treat them with the contempt they deserve, and they deserve contempt from us.",61
119,Mr MCLACHLAN,RATES,"I am interested that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) believes that we are not in a recession. High interest rates have been part of the burden of Australian business and the Australian citizen for a long time. It is not a recent phenomenon and it is not incidental or unintentional; it is a positive· Government policy which has been in place since 1984. As the President of the farmers' organisation of this country, the National Farmers Federation, I went to see the Government on 9 December 1986 to talk about the impact of the Government's policy on 174,000 farmers. On that day, without having that conversation, the Treasurer walked out on us-as he is doing now. I went to tell the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer that farmers, like everybody else in this country at that time, were prepared to take the hard economic realities on the chin. While there was a chance that the Government's economic strategy might reach its Budget forecast we were prepared to take it. I went to tell· the Treasurer that small business and many others in the economy at that time had been subjected to 15 consecutive months of interest rates at over 15 per cent and, more recently, of over 20 per cent. I went to tell the Treasurer how these interest rates were damaging small business, including the rural sector, and how it was nearly impossible at that time, in 1986, to service interest repayments or make any inroads into paying off capital. I wanted to tell the Treasurer that my constituents were becoming apprehensive about his economic policy despite his pronouncement earlier in the Labor Government's term when he said: · . . there are no plans to touch small business incomes, there never have been any such policies, nor will there be such policies from a Labor Government. I wanted to warn the Treasurer that farmers had started to question his reassurance in November 1985 when he said: · . . we have a policy in place which is controlling inflation, lifting growth and lifting earnings. Most importantly, I went to tell him how the Government's policies had discouraged business investment, which in that year had fallen by 9 per cent. We got short shrift from the Prime Minister. We got a 10-minute hot-headed soliloquy on his view of propriety. His language on that day belittled the position he holds and belittled the Cabinet room, and he and the Treasurer left without further ado. That, in my view, has been what has been happening in the Cabinet room ever since. Not long after that, in 1988, the Treasurer said: · . . we are moving in giant strides, but we are not home. He said: · . . we are just about to move into the long straight. He had previously admitted, in 1984, that he thought in long straight lines. We have had the longest, straightest line of high interest rates in Australia's history. I hope for all our sakes there will never be another like it. While over the years the Treasurer has poured barrels of vituperative vitriol from every available orifice on any critic of this policy-supported, I might say, by a non-existent but sycophantic media, some of whom still cannot bring themselves to concede that this country is in recession-this single phase policy is still paralysing the economy by the day. The Government has made our homemade self-imposed recession-an organic recession, if you like, unfertilised from the outside but helped a little by a local product from the Government's stable. The Treasurer said in 1988: I like to think that, in terms of the building blocks of real reform, the new set of foundations, the new joists, the new walls, all that has been done during these years I've had the Treasury. There is a house exactly like that in my electorate, started in about 1983, which I have driven past many times. It had foundations, it had joists, it had walls, but the builders ran out of money due to high interest rates and they actually left the . roof off. Since then I have noticed that the white ants have got in, the joists have gone, the foundations will not support it any more, and in the next decent wind it is going to blow over. All that has happened while our national undertaker has been running the Treasury. He was absolutely right. He must take all the credit and all the world knows he shall have it. I just want to take up on this subject the illogicality of a single rate policy. Let us assume that the Government succeeds, and it manages to bring the economy down to the point where its growth slows, it becomes comatose, and finally, after a while, a few people start to break out, interest rates come down and away goes business again. If the Government has a single rate policy, how is it going to deal with it again? If it cannot deal with the lack of productivity on the waterfrontthat productivity rate is 50 per cent that of our serious competitors-if it cannot persuade General Motors-Holden's Ltd to take its motor cars by our railway system to Perth because that system is too inefficient or the cars never get there, as I was told this morning, if it cannot put real competition into the rest of the transport systems or the telecommunications system, if it cannot get an industrial relations system where people can deal one to one management with employees, what is it going to do? What it will do is exactly what it has done since 1984-it will put interest rates up again because that is all it has left. Everybody knows that a 'pol-tical fix was made in the telecommUnIcatIons debate. Everybody knows the reasons for those internal divisions and that those internal divisions, while providing an interesting spectacle for the rest of us to watch, were, of course, a specta?le full of rancour and permanent separatIOn. We can only assume that the internal division is the reason why the Government cannot come to the sorts of policies that are going to reduce inflation and get this country on the road. Of course, the Government cannot face the industrial relations decision. I understand why it cannot face the industrial relations decision. It cannot face the mate decision to introduce voluntary unionism, notwithstanding the fact that 87 per cent of Australians want it, notwithstanding the fact that 81 per cent of unionists want it, the Labor Party cannot bring itself to do that because it will lose its power base because the Australian Council of Trade Unions will lose its power. Everybody understands it. I sympathise with the Government, but it is no reason not to do it for the sake of this country. We can bring about a management and employee relationship in this country, one to another, which can succeed if we want to attempt it. It is absolutely no good putting it in the too hard basket while other people in the rest of the world are galloping past us. Luckily on this side of the House we have no such inhibitions or divisions as were shown in May between the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) and the Treasurer and again yesterday which gave rise to this debate when the Minister, that same Minister, expressed his dissatisfaction at the obvious inability to deliver a comprehensive policy while he is watching the industries for whom he holds responsibilities being slowly but surely and absolutely !hrottled at the Treasurer's altar of high mterest rates. The Minister was dissatisfied. The business community, I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, is comatose and the private citizen knows that ""Ie are in recession because he has been burned by these policies, burned in a way that goes even further than we went in 198283. One would have to doubt that the Westpac Banking Corporation is right. If we want any confirmation of that, just note on behalf of these people that the Corporate Affairs Commission of New South Wales has been consistently predicting this year that 55,000 businesses will go under water and that the formal rate of bankruptcies will be up 70 per cent on 1983. I cry for them. I cry for Australia, but I do not cry for the Treasurer nor this Government that caused these problems.",63
120,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RATES,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,65
121,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,RATES,"A debate of this nature is a very important opportunity for this Government and this Parliament to consider the major thrust of economic affairs in this country. We have had put before us today a proposition which relates to the question of interest rates and monetary policy. That is an interesting proposition to put up but one which requires some analysis. There has been some discussion and analysis to this point, but I make a fundamental point at the outset. I think it is interesting that this opportunity has arisen. When we begin to talk about economic policy we cannot talk about one item of economic policy in abstract. This particular proposition that we have before us argues that; it argues a point in abstract. Any analysis of economic policy will show that that is not the way to do it. The Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), who is at the table, understands that as well. As an economist, he knows we have to bring the threads of economic policy together. The central point that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is making and the one I intend to make is that when we look at economic policy we are looking at a ma7 trix of issues and appro,aches. I think the difficulty that the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) faces is that although he can reasonably advance the question about interest rates being high and to express the obvious desire to lower interest rates, he then has· to put around it the other policy objectives and policy options that must be adjusted to try to get a sensible economic outcome. If we look at the picture and focus it what we see is that unless at the same time the Opposition is prepared to put in place some other policy position, some other policy settings, its desire for a reduction in interest rates simply would not produce the results it wants. Why? Because the fundamental problem we face at the moment is a current account deficit due to the change in the terms of trade and we need to address that in a number of policy settings. That is the circumstance; that is what we are talking about. Quite obviously, when we observe what happens out there, we see that empirically there are difficulties in relation to business and it is true that interest rates have been hurting people in the economy. I am not backing away from that at all; I have no difficulty with it. That is not something which is desired by government policy, but it is an outcome. I will run through the other policy settings. In terms of fiscal policy, the current Budget is ecting an $8.1 billion surplus. I suggest honourable members opposite go through the Budget Papers. It would be very difficult in doing so to imagine a more substantial surplus being achieved in the circumstances. That is the fiscal policy element. If we look back over the last few years, it also becomes clear that a major achievement on fiscal policy is being brought about by this Government. The Treasurer has already referred to this accumulation of savings. It is an enormous accumulation of savings, but it is also an extraordinary achievement in terms of outlays. The Minister at the table would be one amongst many who has departments pushing for programs in, a very competitive environment. The easy thing to do is to drop the baton in terms of the economic relay race we are running. The easy thing to do is drop the baton and give away this persistent reduction in outlays but we, have not done that. The strategy has been to continue to reduce outlays. As the Treasurer very correctly says, we are going to have outlays down to 1950 levels in the future. That is a very important goal because we are saying we are removing the pressure of government from the monetary system so that it is the private sector that can adjust in terms of market manoeuvres. That is a sensible position. It is not only sensible, it is being rapid achieved, and that needs to be pointed out. The other issue is the central issue of wages policy. Fundamentally, the Opposition has as its strategy on wages an attack upon trade unions. The difficulty that Opposition members face is that they do not spend enough time talking to responsible trade unioriists. If they talked to responsible trade unionists-and some have now joined our ranks; one who is now a Minister was recently a senior official in the trade union movement-they would understand that those unionists have a positive and sensible agenda for economic reform. One speaks to those responsible trade' unionists because one recognises that they playa part. It is interesting to compare the experiprojence in Australia with that in western Europe. The notion of having a partnership-social partners in any economic change-is one that is current in western Europe. We are not about to throwaway that experience of western Europe or our own experience, which says that the best way to bring about economic change is to produce that change by involving a major shareholder in the economy-that is, the trade union movement and its members. It is very easy to speak in this House about voluntary unionism, as if that is somehow a palliative that will solve a the economic problems in Australia. will not.",65
122,Mr FILING,RATES,How about small busines,66
123,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,RATES,"T honourable member raises the issue small business. If he looks at most of t coverage of small business, it is und State awards. The Western Australian A for example, provides for people to o out of the award provisions; there is difficulty. The interesting aspect of this that I cannot get a - ebate going in 'Yestern Australia about It. I have taken It up with people like Mr CO-lft of the Opposition in Western AustralIa but they do not understand that the State tribunal allows people to opt out of the awards. There is a possibility to opt out. So to speak about voluntary unionism is to ignore the point. I respect the honourable member and I understand the point he seeks to make. However, he must understand that. i? many State tribunals and State Acts It IS possible for an employer and an employee to opt out of the award provisions.",66
124,Mr FILING,RATES,"Try telling that to the people in the construction industry. Mr RONALD EDWARDSThe honourable memb.er is now moving to the larger award conslclerations.He was talking about small business earlier. One has to attack the larger award considerations at the leyel of getting responsible union leadership and sensible awards. In that sense the honourable member and I will probably find ourselves with much in common. There is no difficulty there. I am not at all happy with what is happening in the construction industry. If productivity gains are to be achieved, that has to be done at the level of the leadership of employers and of unions. That is common in Europe. This notion of a social partnership is something that needs to be developed. We are not unhappy with that here. I say to the Opposition that a wages policy must result from that social partnership. Today's press release by Westpac Banking Corporation is timely, for it says: Historically growth slowdowns and recessions in Australia have been accompanied by a collapse of commodity prices and often by a drought and/ or a wages break-out. None of these is apparent in the current policy-induced slowdown. Also, growth in the services sector provides underlying strength to the economy. That is important; we are not about to have a wages break-out. Certainly we have had some industrial disputes, and none of us take satisfaction from those; nor should we. What we do need is a sustained wages policy. If one looks back over the past . few years, that has been the case. An enonrious amount has been achieved. The other side has been that there has been a considerable gain in terms of profits. There is now a higher level of profits, which leads to a higher level of investment. The logic of the argument I am putting to the House is that there needs to be a series of policy settings. At no time is the world an ideal place; it does not stop out there while one gets the policy settings right so that one can produce a nirvana. It does not happen that way. Countries in Europe and the United States of America are equally troubled by the oil crisis. We are in the fortunate position that we are a net energy exporter. However, our other policy settings are better placed than those of, for example, the United States. We are not facing the trauma that that country is facing of trying to reduce its Budget deficit. That is an important consideration. There are several other matters I wish to focus on. One is the question of the restructuring of the economy and the restructuring of government. They go hand in hand. Here I make a request of the Opposition. I find that often the Opposition falls back on this position of State rights, at a time when the Government is saying that we should do away with duplication of services and crazy State-imposed sanctions. For example-and the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) will appreciate this-why is it that in Western Australia margarine comes in a different shaped container from that which is used in eastern Australia? It is only because of the stupidity of our packaging laws. In Western Australia margarine has to be in a square container and in New South Wales in a round container. The Opposition parties have defended State governments of both political persuasions which, in their stupidity, have made decisions which have led to such crazy economic outcomes. It is a nonsense. At the same time there is, one finds, the same stupidity in Western Australia in resisting daylight saving. That is a nonsense. It is as if Canberra were somehow trying to impose this new regime of equalising the time zones. The·fact is that if we want to save business a lot of money and make the economy more competitive, we get rid of these inhibitions. The thinking in the Opposition is the thinking that dominated the rail system in Australia: for goodness sake, do everything to protect State rights, but do not do anything that makes economic sense! We could take any number of Australians out on a train journey and show them what the Opposition's policies have done in terms of restructuring. We had the same attitude with corporate law reform last year: States must have rights to protect the crooks in the business world! Let us not take away the right of the State corporate affairs offices to do nothing about prosecuting crooks! We wanted to change that but the Opposition resisted it. The Opposition parties resist these major structural changes. If they want to make the economy more competitive-",67

128,Mr KERIN,CATTLE TRANSACTION LEVY BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is one of a package of Bills tha will introduce new levy arrangements fo the cattle and beef industry from 1 Janu ary 1991. The other Bills in the packag are the Beef Production Levy Bill, th Cattle Export Charge Bill, the Cattle an Beef Levy Collection Bill, the Livestoc Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill, the Livestock Export Charge Amendment Bill and th- Cattle - n.dustry - egislation (Consequential ProvlSlons) Blll. The new arrangements have been developed by the industry through the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council (AMLIPC). The AMLIPC is a statutory body established by the Government in 1984 to provide a forum for the industry wide consideration of industry issues and to inquire into areas of concern to a number of sectors. The Council brings together the leaders of industry, with producer, meat exporter, processor, wholesaling, retailing, union and domestic marketing interests being represented. Levies are raised from the meat and livestock industry to fund the operations of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC) and the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation (AMLRDC). The Government matches dollar-for-dollar the industry's expenditure on research and development up to 0.5 per cent of gross value of production, in line with primary industries research and development policy. , Levies are also' collected to fund the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign (BTEC), to which the Government contributes 20 per cent of funding, and to fund the Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consllltative Council"" to which the Government contributes 50 per cent of funding. , The current levy arrangements for cattle, sheep, buffalo and goats consist of a flat rate per-head 'livestock slaughter levy' at the point of slaughter and a flat rate per-head 'livestock export charge'. These levy raising mechanisms have been a bone of contention within the industry and a cause of friction between livestock producers on the one hand and processors a-d e.xporters on the other. The major dlssatlsfaction arises from the question of who actually bears the cost of the levies and charge. Both the producer and the processing and exporting sectors believe they bear the full cost. This dissatisfaction has increased as levies have risen substantially in recent years. The 1987 annual general meeting of the industry reque_sted the AMLIPC to undertake an investigation into levy raising mechanisms for the meat and livestock industry. The AMLIPC recommended a new levy and charge raising mechanism for the cattle and beef industry, with the mechanisms for sheep, buffalo and goats to remain unchanged. The Council has resolved to review the new levy mechanisms during its third year of operation. The basic mechanisms recommended by the AMLIPC for cattle and beef are: a flat rate per head levy on all cattle sales and transfers of cattle from the production to the processing stage, payable by the vendor or the owner at the time of transfer; a beef production levy on a cents per kilogram basis on beef and veal produced, payable by the owner of the carcass; and a charge on live cattle exports on a cents per kilogram basis, payable by the exporter. Dairy cattle traded for dairy purposes are to be exempt from the transaction levy and the export charge. The initial rates of levy and charge have been set in the Bills to yield an income equivalent to that yielded under existing arrangements. Future adjustments to the rates will need to be approved by the industry' annual general meeting, as is the current requirement. The initial levy rates have been set so that the producer and the processor and exporter sectors share equally the cost of the AMLC and AMLRDC operations and this apportionment will apply during the first three years of the new arrangements. The producer sector has accepted the responsibility for the funding of the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign, known as BTEC, and the na'tional residue survey, or NRS. The NRS is currently collected as part of the inspection fee collected from export abattoirs. Rather than collect a _very small separate levy designated for the Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Council"" funding for this organisation is to be collected in with the AMLC levy and paid to the Consultative Council by the AMLC. Given the experimental nature of collection mechanisms, provision has been a made for three-year trial period of the new arrangements. The current levies and charge can be reinstated at the rate operownership ative at 31 December 1990 up to 30 June 1994. This provision will be exercised only place. in consultation with the AMLIPC. The new arrangements are designed achieve what the industry perceives as more equitable and visible division of payments between producers and procesNRS. sors by clarifying their relative contribulevy tions to the AMLC and AMLRDC. As part of this package the AMLIPC has also recommended the restructuring of the register of livestock producers tablished and maintained by the AMLC. Producers entered on this register are titled to vote at the industry annual eral meeting, along with those persons entered on the register of processors exporters. The producers' register divided into two registers-one for cattle producers and one for producers of sheep, buffalo and goats. The processors' register will remain unchanged. The practical difference resulting from this restructuring will be that only cattle producers and all meat processors will able to vote on matters relating to rates of levy and charge on cattle, and only producers of livestock other than cattle and all processors will be able motions relating to levies and charge on those animals. The AMLIPC has been able to demonAMLIPC. strate that there is a firm consensus within the Council on this issue, and that objections to the new arrangements from outside bodies affected by the proposals have received detailed consideration. industry is aware of the increased costs collection associated with the proposal, this Bill. and has assured the Government that it is willing to meet these costs. Since 1988 the Government has recovered from industry the costs incurred in the collection of levies and charges. To contain these costs to some extent, the AMLIPC has requested that there be a first tim.e. \lesser degree of audit in some minor collection areas. Again, the Council has as the sured the Government that it is aware that this measure could result in leakage. The purpose of this Bill is to impose the levy on cattle sales and transfers of and transfers from production to processing where no sale has taken Separate rates of levy are struck for to adult cattle and for bobby calves, and a both rates contain separate components levy for the AMLC, AMLRDC, BTEC and the The Bill provides that the rates of may be altered by regulation, but specifies the maximum rates of levy that may be imposed in such a manner. The operative rate of the transaction eslevy will be $5.83 for an adult beast. The maximum is set at $12.25. The equivalent enrates for a bobby calf are $1 and $2.25. genRecommendations to adjust the rates of levy for AMLC and AMLRDC purposes and must first be supported by an industry is to be annual general meeting. The levy is imposed on the person owning the cattle immediately before the change of ownership or immediately before delivery for processing. The new arrangements will yield revenue approximately equal to that yielded be under the present arrangements and, as the Commonwealth recovers all of its costs incurred in collection of levies and charges, there will be no net effect on to vote on Consolidated Revenue. As mentioned earlier, the proposal has been initiated by the industry through the The Government is pleased the industry has been able to come to the any Government through the policy council mechanism to present a united view on such a complex policy issue.

129,Mr KERIN,BEEF PRODUCTION LEVY BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is another of the package of Bills that will introduce new levy and export charge arrangements for the cattle .and beef industry from 1 January 1991. The purpose of this Bill is to impose a levy on the production of l?eef at an operative level of 2.17c per kIlogram of the gutted and trimmed carcass weighed within two hours of slaughter, or the hot carcass weight, as it is termed in the trade. The levy is payable by the person owning the carcass immediately after its hot carcass weight is determined. This levy, in combination with the cattle transaction levy, will replace the current levy on the slaughter of cattle, calves and bobby calves imposed by the Live-Stock Slaughter Levy Act 1964. The levy contains components for the funding of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation. As I have already outlined, the initial rate of levy has been specified in the Bill. This rate may be altered by regulation up to the specified maximum, which is 5c. Recommendations to adjust the rates of levy must first be supported by an industry annual general meeting.

130,Mr KERIN,CATILE EXPORT CHARGE BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is another of the package of Bills that will introduce new levy and export charge arrangements for the cattle and beef industry from 1 January 1991. The new arrangements have been developed by the industry through the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council. The purpose of this Bill is to impose a charge on the export of cattle from Australia. The charge will be on a cents per kilogram liveweightbasis, as opposed to the current per head charge imposed under the Live-Stock Export Charge Act 1977. The industry has recommended this change to bring the charge into line with the beef production levy, which is on a cents per kilogram carcass weight· basis. The rate of charge is set at half that of the beef production levy, or 1.09c per kilogram, to put it on a carcass weight equivalent basis, as about half the live weight is lost in gutting and trimming. The charge contains components for the funding of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation. While the initial rates of charge have been specified in the Bill, this· rate may be altered by regulation up to the specified maximum of 2.5c per kilogram. Recommendations to adjust the rates of charge must first be supported by an industry annual general meeting. The charge is payable by the owner of the cattle at the time of export.

131,Mr KERIN,CATILE AND BEEF LEVY,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is part of the package of Bills that will introduce new levy and export charge arrangements for the cattle and beef industry from 1 January 1991. This Bill provides the collection mechanisms for the new levies and charge imposed under the Cattle Transaction Levy Bill 1990, the Beef Production Levy Bill 1990 and the Cattle Export Charge Bill 1990. To enable a more cost effective levy and charge collection procedure, the Bill provides for the collection of moneys from intermediaries such as selling agents, abattoir operators and feedlot operators. The Bill also provides for the reimbursement by persons primarily liable for levy and charge to these intermediaries. These arrangements will assist in keeping costs to a minimum by significantly reducing the number of collection points. The Bill also provides for the due dates of levy or charge to be prescribed by regulation. This will allow flexibility in the collecting of moneys by permitting different collection periods depending on the amount of moneys to be collected and the sector of the industry it is to be collected from. This measure also has the potential to minimise the costs of collection. I commend the Bill to honourable members, and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.

This Bill is part of the package of Bills that will introduce new levy and export charge arrangements for the cattle and beef industries. This Bill sets the levy rate for cattle, calves and bobby calves under the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Act 1964 at zero, to allow the introduction of the cattle transaction levy and the beef production levy. The Bill also provides that, if the new arrangements are not working satisfactorl ily, the Minister, after consultation with the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council (AMLIPC), may make a declaration, setting the rates of levy under the new arrangements at zero, and reinstating the livestock slaughter levy on cattle, calves and bobby calves at the rates that were operative at 31 December 1990.

NA 1990 BILL 1990 Bill presented by Mr Beddall, and read a first time. Second Reading",73
135,Mr BEDDALL,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill proposes three substantive changes to the Excise Tariff Act 1921. The first will provide the facility for the determination of different volume weighted average of realised (Volware) prices for different oil producing regions, which is consequential on proposed amendments to the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987 which are contained in the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill 1990. The second will incorporate into the Act a previously notified Excise Tariff Proposal which alters the excise duty on naturally occurring liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) with effect from 1 April 1990. The third will effect a technical correction to the definition of 'new oil', to ensure that oil which has been produced from two reservoirs in the Bass Strait since 1 July 1980 and which has been excisable at the 'old oil' rate, does not inadvertently become 'new oil', and thereby subject to a free rate of duty. Volware Amendments The purpose of the proposed amendments in clauses 4 to 8 and clause 10 of the Bill is to amend the Excise Tariff Act to enable the calculation of different prices for sales of crude oil from different oil producing regions. These prices are required for the purpose of determining excise liability for excisable oil. As from 1 January 1988, when the decision to deregulate the oil market and to terminate the import parity pricing basis for levying excise was implemented, crude oil prices for the purposes of calculating excise liability have been determined by the Minister for Resources or his delegate under the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987 on the basis of the volume weighted average of realised prices of sales oil in calendar month. As the principal Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act applies to offshore areas ducing excisable petroleum, its application has effectively been confined to the Bass Strait producing region. The second reading speech to the principal Act in 1987 noted that production from areas onshore would become excisable in the event that production exceeded the 30 million barrel excise exempt limit, and that the price basis for excising such onshore oil production would be considered at the appropriate time. Indications are that cumulative production from the Jackson oilfield located in south-west Queensland will now exceed 30 million barrels, and hence production above this limit will become excisable. The calculation of separate Volware prices for different oil producing regions is necessary to prevent inequities in excise liability. These inequities arise from the fact that the realised prices of crude oil from different sources have been observed to differ and hence there are direct implications for the excise payable. In effect, those producers with lower realised prices would pay relatively more of the excise liability than those with higher realised prices if a combined Volware price were used as the basis for excise liability. This is the case for Jackson and Bass Strait production. The Bill therefore provides for an effecand tive and equitable system of collecting excise on crude oil production by enabling the calculation of different Volware prices for different oil producing regions. Liquefied Petroleum Gas The excise duty for naturally occurring LPG is adjusted six-monthly on 1 April and 1 October each year in accordance with the LPG excise policy announced in April 1980. The excise rate is calculated as 60 per cent of the amount by which the realised price for naturally occurring LPG exceeds $147 a tonne. The realised price is calculated as a weighted averagel of the prices received from exports and local sales of LPG during the immediately of crude preceding six months. Under the petroleum excise arrangements introduced from 1 July 1987, LPG pro- produced from onshore fields is exempt from excise, so the excise now applies only to offshore fields in production in August 1977. On this basis Bass Strait is the only area that attracts excise on the production of naturally occurring LPG. No excise is payable on refinery-produced LPG. Clause 9 of the Bill will amend the excise rate with effect from 1 April 1990 to $5.78 per kilolitre, an increase from the previous free rate set on 1 April and 1 October 1989. The increase reflects the higher export prices obtained for this product over the six months to March 1990. 'New' Oil Definition Amendments The purpose of the amendments in clause 3 of the Bill is to correct an anomaly in the definition of 'new' oil from the date in 1984 when amendments made to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 relating to 'new' oil classifications were first introduced into the Act. At the time the 1984 amendments were enacted, the Government had intended to preserve the effect of decisions made prior to 1 July 1984 under Excise by-law No. 78. That by-law contained provisions that were used to determine whether an oil discovery was eligible for 'new' oil status, hence concessional excise treatment on any crude oil production. This intention was clearly indicated by the Government when it announced in June 1983 that it intended to amend the 'new' oil excise arrangements with effect from 1 July 1983. The Government has recently become aware that the amendments introduced in 1984 do not legally preserve the validity of decisions on 'new' oil applications made prior to 1 July 1983. The effect is that, in one case, a decision made prior to 1983 to refuse a 'new' oil classification on certain reservoirs could now be effectively reversed, with the effect that the companies could receive an unintended windfall, possibly up to $200m. In order to avoid payment of refunds on that oil, and not provide an uninresult tended windfall to the companies conexcise cerned the legislative changes in cla-se 3 of the Bill have retrospective effect to 1 July 1984. The retrospectivity will legally remove any Commonwealth liability to refund duties paid in respect of production from the reservoirs. In effect, what has been paid will, by force of the amendment, the correct amount of duty payable. All producers had accepted the pre-July 1983 classification arrangements and aspresentI sociated decisions and paid excise at the the Bill. appropriate rate without protest from that time up until 1 March of this year. For that reason, the Government considers any journed. changes made now to the 'new' oil definition that have the effect of ensuring that the oil classifications made prior to 1 July 1983 remain binding should be seen as declaratory in nature-that is, the changes will only ratify what the industry and Government had always expected to have been the legal position. Financial Impact Statement Volware Amendments The amendments will enable excise be collected from a field in an oil producpatent ing region that will become subject to the excise regime after that field has produced more than 30 million barrels ot crude oil. The Jackson field is expected to exceed that limit in 1990-91. Other fields, includmarkets. ing the Saladin field in Western Australia and potentially the Wanaea and Cossack fields on the North West Shelf, could bePatents come excisable in future years. No spethe cific figure, however, can be put on additional excise revenue that might be collected from oil producing regions subtoms ject to the excise regime in 1990-91 that figure is dependent on both the level of production and the price received for tion. that production, which are at this stage unknown. LPG Amendments The increase in the excise rate for LPG-from free to $5.78 per kilolitre on and from 1 April 1990-is estimated to in the collection of about $9m in receipts in the 12 months commproposed encing 1 April 1990. 'New Oil' Definition Amendments The correction of the 'new oil' definition will remove a potential liability of any the Commonwealth to repay some of the duty which has been paid on oil produced from the Tuna field in Bass Strait since 1 be July 1984. But for the amendments, the extent of that liability might be in the vicinity of $200m. commend the Bill to the House and the explanatory memorandum to Debate (on motion by Mr Howard) adPATENTS BILL 1990 Consideration resumed from 9 October. Second Reading",73
136,Mr CREAN,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The essence of the patent system is to encourage entrepreneurs to develop and commercialise new technology. Since a patent confers a limited monopoly over to the use of the patented technology, the owner has the opportunity to make a profit from it, gaining a return on investment in innovation. The international character of the patent system makes patents a useful tool in penetrating export It is against this background that the Patents Bill was formulated. The present Bill is in fact a reincarnation of Patents Bi111989. That Bill was introthe duced on 1 June 1989 by the Hon. Barry Jones, the then Minister for Science, Cusand Small Business. However, it had as not been debated when Parliament was dissolved prior to the March 1990 elecThe Patents Bill 1990 derives from the 1989 Bill, but also takes into account a number of submissions made by members of the public about that Bill. Those cluded submissions by expert groups in the patents field: the Institute of Patent Attorneys of Australia, the Australian Manufacturers' Patents, Industrial Declosures signs, Copyright and Trade Mark Associworld ation, and the Law Council of Australia's Intellectual Property Committee. The extent of participation by users the patent system in formulating the Bill is heartening. I intend that it continue, where appropriate, in further legislative developments in the industrial property field. The Bill, as introduced now, also takes into account certain concerns expressed in the other place on the issue of the patentability of human beings. The Minister for Industry, Technology and Comthe merce, Senator Button, has consistently stated that no patent for a human being would be granted under existing Austrathat lian law-nor would one have been granted under this Bill as introduced in the other place. Nevertheless, amendhave ments to the Bill were agreed to in the other place with the effect of codifying this policy and to ensure that the biologiin cal processes for the generation of human beings would also not be patentable ventions. The Government does not oppose the amendments. The economic effects of patent systems have been the subject of debate for at least a few centuries. The main arguments were outlined by the Industrial Property Advisory Committee (IPAC) in its report entitled Patents, Innovation and Competiour tion in Australia, which forms the major basis for the policy changes which the represents. Economists have not agreed, however, and IPAC, chaired by John tional Stonier of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, produced a report which was conmarkets. structive rather than revolutionary. IPAC sought to improve the operation of the system so as to maximise the benefits and minimise the costs to Australians. The most significant changes made by the Bill focus on fostering indigenous in- developing novation and the use of the international patent system in developing export maravailability l kets to improve Australia's international incompetitive position. For example, the standard of patentability for standard patents is strengthened by testing inventions for novelty and inventive step against disin recorded form anywhere in the rather than, as at present, just in Australia. Novelty and inventive step for petty patents, on the other hand, will be of tested only against prior disclosures in Australia, consistent with the fact that petty patents are better suited to less significant inventions with a shorter commercial . life and less likelihood of achieving market success abroad. Other changes are aimed. at improving the efficiency of the administration of the patent system, ranging from examination procedures to enforcement of patents in courts. In addition, the Bill uses greatly simplified language and structure in comparison with the present Patents Act, so it will be more comprehensible to people who are not patent experts. The Bill and IPAC's recommendations already been dealt with in the second reading speech on the 1989 Bill and there is no point in my repeating what is Hansard. I agree with what was said then. I do wish to make· two short general inobservations, however. First, the patent system of Australia; or any other country, cannot operate usefully in international isolation. The reason for that is not theoretical; the reason is that international trade affects national economies. We in Australia have said and heard a great deal In recent. years about international trading position and its implications for the Australian economy. Bill Patents and other forms of intellectual property have a role to play in internatrade because they can assist in the establishment and development of export A patent in Australia gives no protection against appropriation of· the patented technology in other countries. But patents obtained by Australian .enterprises in other countries can make a tremendous difference when it comes to an export market. There is a two-edged' sword here, since of patents in other countries to Australians is matched by the availability of patents in Australia to the nationals of other countries. A patent owned by a foreigner restricts imitation of the patented invention in Australia-a fact which has been anathema to some economists. But an Australian patent can also be an essential feature in negotiating an agreement for the licensing by an Australian company of foreign-owned technology. And the Bm, like the present Patents Act, contains provisions expressly designed to prevent abuse of patent monopolies. The Government, like IPAC, supports the patent system, but believes that it can be modified to enable Australians to make better use of it internationally as well as nationally. One of the main features of the Bill is to move towards greater international compatibility of the standards of novelty and inventiveness which are applied in deciding whether a patent should be granted for an invention in Australia. The second point I wish to emphasise is that a patent only gives an opportunity for profit-not a guarantee. A patent is no substitute for entrepreneurship in the broader sense. The mere fact that a product is patented wm not persuade people to buy it. Intellectual property is not some form of commercial magic which can cause a profitable market to appear and grow overnight. Marketing skills are just as necessary for success with a patented product as with any other; the difference is that the availability of a patent for a successful product can justify investment in research and development. Having got a patent, however, the entrepreneur must make the best use of it in developing a market. Intellectual property must be managed properly to ensure that it achieves the objectives of both the owner and the community generally. . Patents thus have a subsidiary, albeit Important, role in entrepreneurship. The patent sy-tem itself is, in IPAC's words, a blunt mstrumentof industrial policy'. !here a-e other more direct ways in which mnovatJon can be stimulated. This Bill increases the usefulness of the patent system as one of the measures which Australian entrepreneurs can draw upon. It is a constructive example of the Government's commitment to improving the climate in which Australian industry operates, but it is no substitute for entrepreneurship by Australian enterprises. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Howard) adjourned.

137,Mr TUCKEY,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"O'Connor) (4.35-This morning I was addressing my remarks to a part of this legislation package, the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill, and I was pointing out to the House how there was absolutely no need for a government that wishes to provide welfare and assistance to those in our society who need it to construct the shop, as it were. Of course, I was quoting Senator Walsh as a supporter of my particular point. I had also made the point that in terms of medical services, notwithstanding the huge growth in expenditures of some 271 per cent in the past few years, the service to the community was actually falling. I was blaming this on the fact that the Government instead of just addressing the problem' of people who needed financial assistance had decided to run a health insurance'scheme and a substantial hospital system. It is interesting to note that in his article under the 'Cassandra' headline, Peter Walsh told us on Tuesday, 28 August, in referring to the 'New Class', that: . The New Class tirelessly asserts it is the pion of the poor, but prefers to give the I?o-r services instead of money. The reason for thiS IS that service provision provides sinecures for members of the New Class. Simply paying out money does not. The New Class is concerned about service providers, not users. This morning I made some other points in that regard. But it is one thing to talk about what is wrong with the system; it is another to propose alteration. It is a simple fact that the bes- way we can - elp people in terms of then health needs IS to give them the fin<l:ncial assi-t-nce - eces­ sary, if they need It, to partIcIpate m the private health services sector. That would mean, for instance, providing them with sufficient subsidy to buy a health insurance premium. They would then be represented by that health insurance company in their dealings with doctors and hospitals. It is interesting that, if people are totally reliant upon Medicare, and Medicare tells them that they cannot go into hospital this week-notwit-stand­ ing a genuine need-or maybe thIS year, they have no recourse. They have paid the money because the Commissioner of Taxation has collected it but they have no right to the services. If a person were a member of a private health fund and that fund were to say, 'I am sorry old chap, the funds are a bit weak this week. We do not think we can fund your visit to the hospital', that person would be off to a consumer affairs organisation at a very rapid rate and have that matter resolved. The person concerned would not resume the premiums with that particular group next year. Those would be the sorts of choices a person would have. I was interested to hear the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear) tell the House today about how few people know the names or identities of surgeons and other people in the medical profession. Why would they bother? It is not mucb good knowing them under Medicare because one has no choice. One cannot nominate who one would like. Why would one bother under the present regime to check out the qualifications of a medical practitioner when there were 99 chances chamout of 100 one could not be looked after by that person? It is so silly. Were people able to make those sorts of choices, they would not be silly. They would go out and find which of the medical practitioners had the better reputation and who would attend to their needs most certainly. The simple solution-and it is one I have costed on a previous occasion-is to say, 'We do not need to own the shop to help people. All we need to do is ensure that financial support is given to them' .. Most of the l?eopl- in need in our socIety are already IdentIfied by government. Generally t-ey alr-ady receive some sort of finanCIal assIstance, whether it be a pension or an allowance under the various family assistance programs, such as the family allowance or the family assistance scheme. Those people are known to us and it is pretty easy to address their particular problems. It is interesting also that the honourable member for Canning was at pains to make some sort of accusation against all of us by saying that, .were we in government, we would contmue the farce of community rating. I cannot speak for anybody else on my side of politic and I will not speak for my Party, bu will tell honourable members that co munity rating is the greatest joke that h ever been perpetrated upon the Australi people. The simple fact is that people a being insured and government is dictati that they all represent exactly the sa risk to the insurance company. As pointed out in my earlier speech toda people make demands on the system different times in their lives-ill health very much age-related. People are joini private health cover only when ther a in one of those age groups most at ns particularly the elderly. Other people who are genuine-and let us presume that we had a universal private system which people did join-join a company with the intention of staying with that company for life. They pay preniiums during a period when they make no claims at all. When they start to get sick they can make sOl?e very substantial claims. But we are saymg that throughout that period the one company can look after those elderly people. Of course, the longer a company is in business the bigger the percentage of elderly people on its books, and they are the ones who make the biggest claims on the funds of that insurance company. What happens then? In a competitive market another company, which is starting up in business, advertises cut price rates and all. the new starters go and join that company. So the company that is in the market with its old contributors suddenly is not getting that flow of funds from the new people. That is silly. Clearly all the evidence points to the fact that health insurance should have a variety of rates, but the solution to the problem of having higher premiums for the elderly is that that is where the Government's subsidy should cut in-whether one is a pensioner, or a person of some independent means but still elderly. The interesting thing about a cash subsidy, which Senator Walsh seems to think is the solution to many of these problems, is that it can be graded 50c at a time if one chooses and, unlike the issue of the present health benefit card, it is not a that one has it one day, one's income goes up go $1 and one loses it the nextnotwithstanding that it is probably worth about $30. The other interesting thing is that the Parliament has been informed that the Government is spending $13,000m on its health scheme this year, yet it is a failure. In 1987-88 I was able to cost the subsidy scheme at $4,000m a year. I could guarantee every pensioner in Australia· on any form of pension and every child a 100 per cent subsidy for their life health insurance premiums and I could give substantial assistance to others relative to their needs, for $4,000m. Perhaps it is $5,000m today-I have not costed it for a long time. What was the change or the benefit in that? Suddenly pensioners would not have been second class citizens. They would have had their own private health benefit card. When they fronted up they would be as good as anybody else. They would not be told, 'Please go to the back of the queue' or 'I'm sorry, my friend, you do not have private cover, I can't attend to your needs'. Also, it would be a better system in terms of how hospitals would get paid. I drew the attention of the House to one hospital in my electorate which had to close a ward because too many people were using it. Of course, if that public hospital were being paid in exactly the same way as a private hospital-namely, from private health insurance companies which had been sent the bill-it would have the capacity to service the people who came to that hospital. If it lacked customers it would not get paid and if it had more customers it could expand its facilities. But we have a government which, on the one hand, takes money through taxes and, on the other, cuts the expenditures on hospitals wherever it can because it cannot afford to pay. It promises a free service but tells people when they will get it. A noted health administrator from New Zealand once said publicly in a speech in my presence, 'We have 50,000 people on the waiting lists in New Zealand, waiting for admission to public hospitals. Waiting case lists are the means by which we ration public hospital services'. Her only complaint was in the administration of the queues of patients. The other day I explained to a few of the honourable members on the opposite side of the House, who are on very high salaries, that they do not have to wait in a queue as Medicare participants because they are important people. This lady also made it very clear that if one was in the know, one did not wait. That always happens under any socialised medical system-one has to be in the know and one can get anything. The point is that if one is paying one's own way, even with a government subsidy, one has some pride. These are the issues that the Government has to adtion dress. It has accepted that it is the right thing for Australian Airlines Ltd; it should be the right thing for health.",77

141,Mr CADMAN,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I am not going to vote for the Labor team proposed by the Mining ister at the table. If he wants to keep trust of the motorists of Australia, he will not play politics with organisations such as the NRMA. But that is an aside. The Minister is part of the complicity foisted on the people of Australia in order raise more and more complex taxes. Today the Opposition has moved this amendment to the effect that, whilst do not decline to give the Bill a second reading, we deplore the Government's It failure to develop an effective total policy. We cannot oppose taxation measures. That would destroy the Budget and that is not part of the scene in the Australian Parliament-that has never been done and should never be done. I believe that the Australian people are starting to understand the tactics and the role of the Australian Labor Party. I know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you will agree with me when I say that those intelligent, competent, good-looking Australians in the gallery would understand this. They would taunderstand that they are being attacked is day after day by the Government, headed by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)-an endorsed by every member of the (Mr Australian Labor Party. Those members too ashamed to come into the House today, but they endorse the policies of the LaGovernment which is taxing Australians We have moved this amendment to the legislation-a great wad of pages concerning taxation law, sales tax law, changes to to Medicare, the whole box and dice-because we consider that one only has to look at the Government's record whilst it has been in office to realise what is happening. For instance, one only has to look at the complexity of taxation law over the eight-year period that the Government has in office. When it came into office All there were about 1,184 pages of tax law; there are more than 2,000 pages. The Treasurer said during the last election campaign, 'I am going to simplify the tax laws of Australia'. Yet today we are adding more and more complexity to that law. One of the proposals that will be comup later in this session will be the the taxation proposals for foreign source income. I understand that we are looking at a prospect of 119 pages of legislation and 240 pages of explanation so that we can understand it here in the Parliament. I do to not know whether anybody really does understand it. I hope that the Australian Taxation Office does.· I guarantee that the we Treasurer would not. We have 240 pages to explain a little over 100 pages of law. will further complicate the processes of taxacollecting taxes in Australia. We have had a raft of new taxation since the Government came to office. We have had capital gains taxes, Medicare levies, prescribed payments taxes, withholding taxes, taxes on superannuation, a resource rent tax, which is about to come into place, and a fringe benefits tax. We have had all sorts of complexities and increases in taxes. The Australian people are sick and tired of this. They have absolutely had enough of the new taxes and the complexity and the rip-out of their system. It adds to the inefficiencies of the system and it adds to the cost and the pain. We should look at the level of collection of taxation since the Labor Party has been in office. We should look at pay as you earn (PAYE) taxes-the taxes people pay day to day, week to week, as they earn it. After the refunds sent back at the end of the year PAYE, taxation has increased by 128 per cent in just eight years. The average person in Australia is paying more by 128 per cent of what they earn. Companies-those providers of employment-have had their taxation increased by 144 per cent in eight years. If we look at the so-called indirect taxes, the ones that the Treasurer appears not to like, we find that there has been an increase in indirect taxes-including sales tax and excise duty, customs, bank debit - nd ,those sorts of things-by 136 per cent m eIght years. There is a lot of talk in this place about the Government's single string policy. There are. tw- strings-the t-xation string and the hIgh lllterest rate stnng. It is easy to run a business that turns out a surplus at .the end of the year if one can just claIm whatever money one likes for one's product. That is what the Government has been doing. The Government has been foisting h,igher and higher taxes, funding Its - pen.dlllg and funding its failures by gettmg lllto the taxpayers pocket. Across the board over most taxes there has been something like a 130 per cent increase over the last eight years. The Australian comm-nity cannot cop that. That is far above lllflation. Each year we divide that 130 per cent by eight. We are into a double digit figure increase on average for every Australian each year this Government has been in office. Therefore, not only has there been the complexity of the taxation law, the new taxation measures adopted by the Government that the Treasurer appears to be so proud of, but there is the other factor of the huge and debilitating increases in taxation. Those increases have been linked with the other strategy of the Government to help - odify, improve and change the Austrahan economy. I am talking about high interest rates. The Treasurer seems to like high interest rates as well as high taxes. He is the only Australian Labor Party member I have ever heard actually appearin- to rejoice when unemployment figur-s nse. He says that the policy is worklllg; if we are getting increased unemployment his policies of high interest rates and high taxes are working. Can honourable members imagine anything so shameful from a member of the Australian Labor Party, let alone any member of the Australian Parliament? That is something that no member of the coalition would endorse, encourage or would want to engage in as a policy for government. The Treasurer is supported by all members of the Australian Labor Party who are so ashamed that they cannot come into this House. Another Government member has arrived; there are two here now. The Labor Party has found another one. There are two Labor members here s-pporting the Government's policies of hIgh taxation and high interest rates. These two members of the Labor Party apparently are the only two who really endorse the process that the Treasurer enunciates-that is, send enough people out of jobs but not too many and send enough companies broke but not too many. That is his policy-to put people out of work and send companies bust, but not too many. That policy is painful for Australians. It is so crude and so raw in its operations. It engenders such a resentment in the Australian community. I see - rriving in the public gallery-I draw thIS to your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker-some really wonderful Australians. They must be on a bus trip from somewhere or other, I would suggest.",80
142,Mr HOWARD,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,Are they from Mitchell?,82
143,Mr CADMAN,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Not that I know of. I guarantee that they have understood what the Treasurer has been doing with superannuation, pensions, the claw-back in capital gains taxes and the need to pay provisional taxation on their investments. The raft of changes, the complex changes, to taxation brought about by the Australian Labor Party are painful for elderly Australians, young Australians and producing Australians. This two-string policy of high taxation and high interest rates is producing in Australia the very effects that the Treasurer seems to want. I looked up the bankruptcy figures to see whether the Treasurer's policies of enough people unemployed and enough businesses broke are working. The indications are that the policies are working. There is increasing unemployment, and that is shameful. To the .end of June last financial year,' 1989-90, there were a record number of bankruptcies. Those bankruptcies that looked so large last financial year will be massive by the time we get to Christmas, and worse still by the time we come to the end of the current financial year. Last year 8,636 businesses officially went bankrupt. On top of that are those companies that fade away, close their doors and say, 'We're copping out; we're out of this. Send the workers home; we are finishing up at the end of the week. There is no more work. We are not bankrupt; we just cannot go on'. That is happening in suburb after suburb, in country town after country town under the policies of the Australian Labor Party. We have moved an amendment to the effect that the hundreds of pages of new tax law should be adopted by the House and to say that the Governm-nt should adopt a realistic approach to taxation. The only realistic approach is one that the honourable member for Bennelong has endorsed for almost as long as I have known him. It is painful and sad that in earlier days when he was the Treasurer he was not able to generate an indirect tax system which is fairer to all and which will allow a reduction in personal income tax to rates somewhere between 20 and 28 per cent which will protect the fixed income earners so that they do not have to pay more out of their pocket. They may pay more but they can be compensated so they have more to pay with. We will see a regime of indirect taxes which will encourage exports and which will take away the stupidity of the current wholesale sales tax. Members of the House, notably those on the front bench of the Government, come in wearing their Italian suits for which they have paid no sales tax. The mechanic in his workshop or the brickie's labourer going off with a box of tools to the site pays sales tax on that tool box in which he carries his means of earning a livelihood. The inconsistencies and stupidity of the current wholesale sales tax need to be replaced, removed, chucked out and got rid of so that in place there can be a consistent and predictable regime of taxation. The other area that encourages me to endorse the goods and services tax is the capacity to draw out of the system taxation from those who have avoided tax-the people who receive cash in the hand. They are not taxed when they get their money and they are not taxed when they spend it. Those people ought to be starting to pay their way. If they get cash in the hand, under a goods and services tax they must pay taxation as soon as they start buying things. In that way there is a stricture, a discipline, on those people who want to work in the black economy, the cash economy. In a number of areas a goods and services tax linked with a low personal income tax will give the Australian peoplv a choice in how they spend their money. If they want to save their money they do not pay tax, or they pay very little tax. If they want to spend .up big, buying Mercedes cars and yachts or attending expensive restaurants, they will pay tax, and lots of it. But for those who are on low incomes or fixed incomes, the goods and services tax can be established in such a way that those people are quarantined-a hedge is put around them to prevent them being affected by it. That the only sensible approach that the tralian people should take. Australia is one of only two countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) which does not have a goods and services tax one sort or another. Of the 24 countries in the OECD, all except two have a goods .and services tax and all of their economtoday ies are performing better than the Austraan lian economy. The Treasurer comes in here as the world's worse Treasurer and says, 'We're on course: steady as she we're right; follow me and we will go right down the tube'. The fact is that competithe tive nations, nations which have a mix tax strategies, a fairer tax approach, faring better in the world today. Their citizens are managing their affairs manner that allows them to use their hardthe earned money in the way that they like and with a minimum of personal income ployment is rising. tax applied to it. It is an equitable process to restru'cture the tax regime. The Opposition in this process is not talking about raising less tax in the sum. To raise less tax we to cut government expenditure. That needs to be done too, and we will do it. But this instance, when the Opposition moves an amendment to Government tax legising lation deploring the Government's failure, we are talking about the restructuring the tax system. We are talking about doing things better and doing them differently, doing them in a less complex way, a more equitable way, a way in which the producand tive sector of Australia is encouraged' way in which the elderly sector of the community is relieved and protected. cluded i- those who will start to pay taxes are tOUrIsts, who come into Australia contribute very little to the economy their day to day movements but who could, through a goods and services tax on their accommodation and on their travel, start to pay a contribution towards the infrastructure cost of the country. the whole process becomes more equitahouseholds ble. To achieve real results there has to some reduction in Government expendiyear tUre. We can then look at the prospect is a maximum income tax rate of around 25 Ausper cent, and that is what the average Aussie wants. He wants to be able to work hard and keep his money. He has earned it. The average Aussie also wants to be able to decide how he will spend his of money. He does not mind if the goods cost a little more. He has a choice in how he uses his dough. The trouble is that nobody has a choice. If one goes to average suburb, people have no choice on their mortgage repayments or the cost of maintaining their families. They are at sinks; rock bottom. They have no options and nowhere to go. That is why we are seeing 'For Sale' signs in many of the subof urbs. Those people were committed to are mortgages. People who have paid off their houses are the fortunate ones, but among in a those who are committed to mortgages forced sales are starting to appear. The businesses are closing and so unemThere are no options left under the regime of the Australian Labor Party. Every member of the Australian Labor Party must endorse these policies. They support have the Treasurer. They support the Prime Minister. They are the front men. The in Australian Labor Party comprises far more than just those two leaders who are foistthese things on Australia today. That is why the Opposition has said, 'Let's of change this process; let's put more money into people's pockets; let's tax it as they spend it but let's give them the option of how they spend it'. Therefore, I endorse support vehemently and strongly this a amendment moved by the Opposition that, while we do not decline to give a Insecond reading to this obnoxious, extensive, complex piece of legislation, we deand plore the Government's failure to develop in an effective total taxation policy.",82
144,Mr WILSON,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, I too am pleased to have the opportunity to take part in this debate. The structure of our tax system is central So to the well-being of Australians and the in which they live. The structure. of our tax system is central also to be the well-being of Australians not only this but next year and over their lifeof times. Unfortunately, this piece of legislation represents tunnel vision. It is upon the presumption that if we can broaden the base of income tax collections, that is all we need do to reform the tax system to make it fair and equitable. Yet again, the Government has missed the opportunity of making our income tax system fair and equitable. The test that is very often applied to see whether a tax system is fair and equitable is to ask the questions: Is it horizontally equitable? Is it vertically equitable? People will say immediately that that is a lot of economic jargon and what does it mean? Horizontal equity means that taxpayers in similar economic circumstances should be treated similarly. What the Treasurer (Mr Keating) assumes is that people are in similar economic circumstances if they have the same level of income, because they then must pay the same amount of tax. On the surface that would appear to be sensible, but we all know that merely having the same income does not place us in the same economic circumstances. There are many taxpayers who have dependants-dependent spouses or dependent children-whom they support. In my view, and I think it is generally accepted in the Australian community, they have a lower tax-paying capacity than a single person with the same income. Also there are many taxpayers who meet their own social responsibilities. They take out health insurance. They pay for their own education or the education of their children. They provide for their own periods of dependency so that, if unemployed, they do not draw on the social security system; or when they retire, they do not qualify for an age pension. The tax system gives no recognition to those people who aspire to self-reliance and independence. They are all taxed the same, whether or not they support those dependants, whether or not they assume those personal responsibilities. What is worse, those who become independent not only forgo, as it were, the right to an age pension or to a free education for their children by paying for those things for themselves, but also their tax burden is increased because others of like inbased come-and often of much higher income-draw down on the governmentprovided education, health and retirement income provisions. The second criteria that is often used is to say that the tax system, to be fair, should have vertical equity. That means that people on higher incomes should pay more taxes than those on lower incomes. Under the present tax system we have a progressive rate scale: one not only pays extra tax in each dollar; as one's income rises one pays increased tax in each dollar out of that increased income. Modern economies are finding that that is a most inefficient way of collecting taxes because it creates incentives whereby people seek to minimise their tax, avoid their tax and even in some circumstances evade their legal responsibilities to pay tax at all. We should be aiming to reduce the general level of taxes and the number of steps in the rate scale. That would have many advantages. It would stop governments gaining windfall benefits from bracket creep because, as people's incomes are increased, they move into additional and higher tax brackets. For the next six months, from January of this year, the Government is increasing to eight the number of steps in the rate scale. I acknowledge that from 30 June next year the number of steps will be reduced to four or five steps but during the phase-in period of the illusory tax cuts that the Government is offering there will be eight steps in the rate structure. I said 'illusory' tax cuts. They are illusory because they are presented in dollar terms and they do not acknowledge the inroads of inflation and the income increases as a consequence of inflation, so in the current year and next year people will be paying a higher proportion of their income b way of tax than they would have pa when this Labor Government came to o fice. . I want to turn now to an area whic deals with a paper that sometimes com out with the Budget Papers, sometim later. The Treasury issues a docume dealing with taxation expenses. In 198 the Treasury issued the first of these an it came out with the Budget Papers. More recently, the tax expenditure paper has come out some time after the Budget has been brought down. In these statements the Treasury has attempted to measure the amounts of income tax forgone as a consequence of these so-called tax expenditures. The Treasury has had little problem in defining tax expenditures as provisions of the tax system which are considered to be deviations from the normal tax structure and which reduce the amount of tax which would have been collected but for these deviations. But the Treasury has failed to give a satisfying conceptual basis for the criteria that it uses, and should use, to distinguish these deviatiorts from what is described in the Treasury's own language as the normal tax structure. It is described by others as the underlying tax base or the taxation benchmark.' It is the benchmark by which one assesses any variations that are given to people for specific purposes. This normal taxation structure is sometimes described, as I have said, as the benchmark or underlying tax base. In trying to describe the normal taxation structure, the Treasury considered the Canadian and United States experience and agreed that the benchmark or underlying tax base should not deviate dramatically from the public perception of the current tax system. That is a very woolly piece of intellectual thinking. What is people's perception of the current tax base? One can present the tax rates as a progressive rate scale with a tax-free threshold and certain steps, with increasing marginal rates of tax-from 21c to 25c to 30c to 38.5c to 42.5c to 46.5c to 47c. But one could equally categorise that rate structure as a flat rate structure. The Minister who is at the table, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), raised his eyebrows. The way in which this Government treats people's income is really to assume it belongs to the Commissioner of Taxation unless it is left behind after assessing tax. One could intellectually argue that the underlying tax rate is 47cin the dollar-the top rate-and that everything one pays less than 47c in the dollar on every dollar is a rebate from the Government. Equally one could say, 'Let's look at the full time work force. What income is the full time work force, on average, receiv:ing?'. In that case one might say, for the tax rates from 1 July next year, that the underlying flat rate of tax is 38 per cent because someone on 80 per cent of average weekly earnings would be paying 38c in the dollar on the marginal dollar and everything below an average rate of tax of 38c in the dollar is categorised as a rebate or reduction of tax for people on low incomes-a deviation from the underlying tax base. High income earners are paying a high surcharge because they are high income earners and, using the vertical equity principles, it is argued that they should not only pay an extra amount of tax in respect of each dollar earned but also pay at a higher rate. The Treasury has very confused thinking in its tax expenditure approach. It does not bring into account the tax-free threshold. Minors start paying tax when they have a few hundred dollars of income. Foreign residents who pay tax in Australia pay tax from the first dollar of Australian taxable income. Therefore why does the Treasury, in looking at the tax expenditures, not assume that there is an underlying tax rate on the basis of a flat rate from the first dollar to the last dollar? If it is argued that we have a tax-free threshold because we want to leave taxpayers without any tax liability in respect of an adequate minimum subsistence income, why do we not treat it as part of the underlying tax base? That is what the Treasury does. If that is based on a capacity-to-pay principle, why do we not look at other capacity-to-pay rebates as part of the underlying tax base? The rebates to which I refer fall into two categories. The first includes those tax concessions, limited though they are these days, in respect of an individual taxpayer's obligation to meet what I describe as his or her social expenditure responsibilities: the responsibility, to the extent that it is taken, of providing private hospital insurance, for which there is no tax rebate at the moment; the responsibility that a taxpayer takes in meeting his or her own educational expenses-again, except in certain areas, there is no tax relief at the present time; and the responsibility for taking on the task of providing sufficient income through superannuation or private provision for retirement, in respect of which there is quite significant tax relief. Yet we treat these as tax expenditures. I do not think they should be treated as tax expenditures. They should be treated as part of the underlying tax base that recognises that there should be a reduction in tax because people's capacity to pay tax is reduced by the extent to which they are providing for their retirement incomes. The second group to which I wish to refer is those who meet responsibilities for dependants, whether they are dependent adults-spouses-dependent adult children or dependent relatives, where they are allowed a rebate. A nominal rebate is allowed by this Government but has not been effectively adjusted to take account of the huge cost of supporting dependants who, if they were dependent upon the public sector, would be receiving the unemployment benefit, age pensions or amounts equivalent to those pension or benefit rates. No relief or little relief is given through the tax system to recognise the reduction in the taxable capacity of a person who is supporting dependants. The other group of dependants are dependent children. The Labor Government treats children as consumption expenditure and gives very little acknowledgment through the tax system and a very modest allowance through the social security system. The Treasury has argued that we should treat as tax expenditure any tax relief that could be otherwise delivered by means of some sort of direct cash payment. It s<!.ys: The aims of identifying tax expenditures should be to include in the Budget the cost of special taxation provisions which can, in most cases, considered as alternatives to direct expenditure programs rather than an attempt to define some ideal taxation system and show deviations from it. We should not be worried about defining in this context an ideal taxation system. What we need to understand is that we should not assume that every rebate that could be delivered by a direct expenditure is necessarily to be treated as a tax expenditure. The great majority of personal rebates should be treated as part of the underlying tax base. It is interesting to note, as we have followed the American and Canadian Systems in a number of respects, that those systems treat spouse rebates as part of the underlying tax system. The Australian Treasury, the present Labor Government, does not do so and in my view it should do so and give much closer attention to the necessity to increase rebates that reflect the true cost of the capacity to pay. I want to give a further quote from the 1988 taxation expenditure statement, which said: Tax expenditures are deemed to arise where taxpayers' liabilities are modified according to their dependent care responsibilities, although this is not to say such provisions are not defensible design features of the tax system. What I am arguing is that they are sensible design features of the tax system. What we need is the introduction of a goods and serviees tax as proposed by the Liberal and National parties. Contemporaneous with the introduction of the goods and services tax, we need a major reform of the income tax system. I would like to see the introduction of a flat rate system. I would set the rate somewhat higher than my colleague who advocated 25c in the dollar. I would set it somewhat higher, say 30c, maybe even a little higher than that. I will explain why I would set it higher. I would set it at that level. I would allow for a tax-free threshold in the form of a tax threshold rebate. Once a person's income reaches, say, average weekly earnings perhaps that rebate should be withdrawn. Under present tax rates, if it wer withdrawn at 10c in the dollar that woul be give people whose income was in exces of average weekly earnings an effectiv total tax rate of 40c in the dollar. Thi would not be much different from wha this Government is proposing if one take into account the Medicare levy which believe should be totally abolished because in fact it is part of the tax system and not fulfilling its intended role of collecting the money needed to fund the Medicare system. In addition to that, I would create a whole series of capaCity-to-pay rebates which would be seen as part of the underlying tax structure. Those rebates should fall into the two categories to which I refer. They should relate to rebates which would acknowledge the expenditure incurred by individuals in providing for their own health insurance, not merely hospital insurance, but health insurance hospital and medical, on policies which are community rated because community rated means a policy that is similar to a life insurance policy and does recognise that health insurance expenditure is age related as well as sex related. I would include rebates that take account of the fact of people providing for their own retirement, that take account of their meeting their own education expenses. If I wanted to provide funding, I would look at the graduate tax type mechanism of recalling any payments that are advanced by the public sector for people's education expenditure. Then I would have a whole series of rebates that took account of the reduced capacity to pay because of th- support of dependants-dependent chddren, dependent spouses and other dependent adults. Those rebates should be - et at a level which is equal to the cost - ncurred by the public sector in maintainmg those same dependants because only by r-moving the differential between the penSlOn payments and the rebates for dependants can we get what we describe often as the level playing field so that the !ax and soci-l security systems do not mfluence socIal behaviour. There is no doubt that in today's world under the Labor Government's tax system the tax system, and - ocial se-urity are influencing people s socIal behavlOur. - r DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Dub.OIs)-Order! The honourable member's tIme has expired. M .. r CREAN (Hotham-Minister for S.cl-nce and Technology and Minister Asslshng the Treasurer) (5.26)-in reply-In concluding this debate I want to turn most of my attention to the amendment that has been moved but also to say something subsequently about the sales tax on luxury cars. The amendment comes - s something of a surprise to me because It seems to suggest that those on the other side just do not appreciate the extent of reform that this Government has undertaken in relation to the total taxation systern. It is not, as the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) has indicated simply based on broadening the inco-e tax base, although that is a vital part of it. But what this Government has done ove; the period of its office is to develop the most comprehensive and effective reform - o.tax policy ever seen in this country, so It IS for that - as1c reason, obviously, that we are opposmg the amendment. I will just indicate how we have em-raced that reform. It involves not just mc<?me tax-although, as I said, that is an Important part of it-but also corporate tax and indirect taxation. The honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) - nd-cated that we are amongst t-e Orgamsahon for Economic Cooperahon and Development countries that do - o- h-ve goods and services taxes. I think It IS 1mporta-- to corr-ct t-e honourable . member'- - lsmformahon m this regard because If, m fact, we look at the OECD table of taxes raised both directly and thr<?ug- a. goods. and services tax, Austraha SltS1 m relatlOn to the heading goods and serVIces tax, at 28 per cent of the percentage of total taxation revenues, compared to an OECD total of 30 per cent. It is not significantly below the average for the - ECD. I think that whilst it may be techmcal.ly correct to say it is not a goods aJ.?-d services tax to the extent that mos.t SerV1-eS are not picked up by it, the reahty IS m terms of an indirect, direct and corporate tax mix the. Australian systern sta-ks up very well m comparative terms WIth the OECD nations. I - ome to the question of the reform of the mcome tax base that this Government - as undertaken over the course of its var10US terms of office. What the Government set out to do-and it commenced in earnest with the Tax Summit back in 1985-was to repair the income tax base, a base that we had inherited, one that been riddled by loopholes because of the previous indiscretions and negligence a previous government. There was a tax system, an income tax base, that we could shoot holes through and which had beentation. come inequitable. It was something which simply had to be repaired because not only was revenue being lost, the system was unfair. That is what the Government set out to do. A number of initiatives were developed: the capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax, the assets test, predating the Tax Summit. Those initiatives should be seen in spective. On each occasion that the Govand ernment introduced them, for the purposes of repairing the tax base, returning reveinternational nues and making the system fairer, what did the Opposition do? It opposed every measure. But increasingly it has been tional Monetary Fund. coming to learn of the significance ""and importance of these measures. Though originally Opposition members opposed the assets test, they have now dropped their opposition to it. It is no longer of their strategy to abolish it if they returned to office. The same can be said of the fringe benefits tax. The Opposition went to the 1987 election saying it would oppose that tax. Since then it has dropped its opposition to the fringe benefits and the substantiation provisions that associated with it. Yesterday in relation to the capital gains tax it was interesting to see the change direction that the Leader of the Opposithe tion (Dr Hewson) is now signalling. There is a suggestion-and I put it no higher dollar. than that-that the Opposition is prepared to review its opposition to the capduction ital gains tax. I simply say that I do mind if people are slow learners, provided they do appreciate the quality of the forms that are undertaken. What does antaken noy me is that the House has before it amendment which ignores completely extent and breadth of reform that this Government has undertaken. As a consequence of those various measures, not only has there been a sigmust nificant gain for revenue, but also that has been coupled with quality expenditure cuts, in the sense that they have been had lasting and that they have not disadvantaged the worse off, the poorer people in by the community. Whilst the Government has had to cut expenditure, it has done so with compassion at every Budget presBut the combination of those quality expenditure cuts, made with compassion, and the gain to revenue from repairing the income tax base, has been the mainstay of our fiscal strategy in government, a fiscal strategy I might add that the has seen us turn around an inherited domestic deficit of 4 per cent of gross domestic product, to a surplus of 2 per cent perof GDP. That is a miraculous turnaround one that is genuinely recognised as a major reform, a major progress, by the finance Ministers. I am in a position to report that, as I have recently returned from a meeting of the InternaThere is international recognition of the extent to which this Government has been able to develop its fiscal strategy, based on that combination of repairing revenue part and looking sensibly at appropriate exare penditure cuts. What have we been able to do as a consequence of that fiscal stance when it comes to taxation? When one listens to members from the other side of the House, one would think that there tax was almost a suggestion that there had are been no reform of the tax system. What have we seen? We have seen a situation in which the lowest marginal tax rate has of dropped from 30c in the dollar to 21 c in dollar and at the highest marginal tax rate from 60c in the dollar to 47c in the Never before has that magnitude of rein personal taxation been achieved not by any government in this place. Yet it has been achieved by this Government, rebecause of the strategic approach it has to taxation policy. Those cuts repan resent better than simple tax indexation. the As we know, the previous Government used to rely consistently on the bracket creep, essentially to try to keep down the rate of growth of its domestic deficit. I say that that was something that did not really achieve its target when we look at the extent of the deficit inherited by this Government when it came to power in 1983It is not only in relation to cuts in taxation rates that the Government has varied the income tax system. Also there have been significant increases in concessional rebates, and many of them are now indexed. The point I make about the combination of taxation cuts and concessional rebates, and the fact that they represent better than tax indexation, is the tie-in that taxation policy has had to wages policy under this Government. That has been not only a means by which we have been able to deliver a fiscal discipline-a deficit of 4 per cent of GDP to a surplus of 2 per cent of GDP-but it is also the mechanism that has helped sustain the wages strategy, the only wages policy that a government in this country has ever had; the only time that we have been able to ensure, consistently over seven years, non-inflationary wages growth, not just in periods of downturn but also in periods of significant economic activity. Never before has this economy been able to sustain strong domestic economic growth without a wages blow-out. But we have done it, and we have done it because we have a wages policy that seeks to reach agreement with the trade union movement, and on all occasions has been able to do so, but recognises that the distribution of entitlements, the living standards if you like, of the work force are not determined simply by the level of money wages. They can be determined by what happens to the tax system, what happens to the superannuation system, what happens to the social wage. That is a factor which the Opposition simply refuses to comprehend. In the short time. I have been in this House I have been able to sense on the other side almost a seizure, a flinching, when the trade union movement of this country is mentioned. The Opposition still sees the trade union movement in this country in the context of a conflict mode. Opposition members do not appreciate the extent to which, properly embraced, a constructive relationship can be developed with the trade union movement to deliver a wages policy, which in turn with fiscal policy is delivering the sort of economic recovery that this country has seen and will continue to experience. The other point I make about these income tax cuts is that all of them have been funded from a Budget surplus. Never before has that been achieved by a government in this place. On all previous occasions when a government has turned up at an election campaign to dole out the tax cuts, these were always funded by deficits. Yet this Government has ensured that whilst the tax cuts have been large, whilst the concessional rebates have been significantly targeted, whilst these have been a significant element in terms of the wages accord, those tax cuts have been funded responsibly. Yet Opposition members tell us there is no comprehensiveness associated with our taxation policy. In relation to corporate taxation, what has the Government done? It has reduced the corporate tax rate from 49c in the dollar to 39c in the dollar and introduced dividend imputation, ensuring that there is not a double taxation on effective equity investment: a specific usage of the tax system to encourage investment in equity as distinct from debt, which was the previous rush to investment before the imputation system was developed. In relation to superannuation, again the Opposition should try to understand the extent to which taxation policy links into superannuation. Superannuation is treated concessionally still, and so it should be. What we are trying to do is to encourage circumstances in which people essentially defer income to fund retirement, to take pressure off an ageing population resulting in increasing demands on welfare payments in this country. This growth of superannuation itself has been a significant component of the wages accord. A strategy has been developed whereby the growth in superannuation payments will be exponential. One needs to again understand the significance of the taxation structure in this regard. Superannuation funds are treated concessionally for taxation purposes at 15 per cent, but they are also entitled to get the full dividend imputation entitlement. That means that there is significant encouragement for the superannuation funds to invest in Australian equities. It means that the $600 billion growth will be an important source of domestic savings to fund the investment in the development of this country. One needs to again try to understand the circumstances and the strategy behind our thinking and approach to how a taxation system can work better for this country. Finally, in terms of the indirect tax component, I have already mentioned the proportion in the mix. It is important to understand that since the Tax Summit in 1985 there has been significant broadening and ration ali sing of the indirect tion policy of this Government. In addition, in relation to the wholesale· sales tax there is a review under way to ensure its simplification. I simply want to put on record our rejection of the assertion from honourable members on the other side of the chamber that this Government does not have a taxation policy and that this is not a total approach, because it is. It is a comprehensive approach, it is right for this country, and we have been the only government with the courage to introduce it. We have introduced it because we have gone out, understood the fundamentals of it, and sought agreement where that agreement is difficult. Let us take the Opposition's alternative proposition of the consumption tax. Where is its agreement not to have the consumption tax feeding into prices resulting in a wages break-out? Where is its agreement? It wbuld not know how to go and approach the trade union movement to try to get an understanding that this Government was capable of getting in 1985. I simply say that when one looks at the basis upon which our strategy has been put together against the Opposition's rhetoric, there is no alternative. It is not putting a sensible alternative to us. I will just go to the question of this sales tax on luxury cars because a couple of issues have been raised in the debate. Firstly, I repeat the point I made in my second reading speech about the suggestion from the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) that this tax, because it somehow has the effect of impacting on effectively 92 per cent on imported cars and 8 per cent on domestically produced cars, is a distortion in terms of the Gelleral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) regulations. I reject that proposition. I made the point in the second reading speech that this tax does not discriminate. It is a tax that applies equally to imported as well as domestically produced cars. It has been cleared in terms of the GATT authorities as not contravening its provisions. I cannot understand-and I guess it comes back taxato recognising not just slow earners but no learners-why the honourable member for Mayo still persists with the proposition that is contrary to the GATT round. A number of honourable members have referred to the fact that this tax will disadvantage people in rural electorates who are more likely to be purchasers of fourwheel drive vehicles which are the vehicles that are hit by this tax. It is revealing to look at the facts associated with where this luxury tax falls. The luxury tax falls in relation to models that are currently priced above $42,910. In relation to the four-wheel drive vehicles, 121 models are available on the Australian market. Only 27 of those 121 fall within the category over $42,910. In other words, 94 models are available for people to choose from that do not attract the luxury car tax. Having heard the examples about carrying chemicals around on farms, putting sheep in the back and carrying out general farm duties, I hardly think that farmers will purchase the luxury model so that the sheep feel more comfortable or the chemicals sit a bit easier. Also, in terms the argument about carrying the kids around and needing eight seats and those sorts of things, all those entitlements can be found within the range of the 94 models that are available. I reject the proposition that this is somehow disadvantaging those in rural communities. The fact of the matter is that it is designed to bring revenue in circumstances where those people who can afford to pay will pay. It does not disadvantage those who have the opportunity to exercise their discretion in relation to a raft of models to suit their needs. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee Clauses 1 to 6-by leave-taken toa gether, and agreed to. Clause 7.",83
145,Mr ROCHER,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,1 want to explain at this stage-because it applies firstly to clause 7 but also to a ule which has been distributed to the Committee-that there will be subseworries quent clauses which fall into the same category for the purpose of this discusgling sion. That category covers amendments consequential to an amendment which been circulated in my name and which propose to move when we get to new clause 15. 1 simply explain to the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Crean) and the Committee that we oppose this clause because it contravenes an amended clause which is included in an overall amendister ment which we intend to produce later. Clause agreed to. Clause 8.,91
146,Mr CREAN,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Hotham-Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Asposits sisting the Treasurer) (5.48)- I move: Clause 8, page 3, after proposed 221YAB (1) (a) (i) insert the following subparagraph: ""(is) amounts credited under section 159GDA in payment of the tax payable by the taxpayer respect of income of the preceding year of come;"". I will try to explain the amendment - riefly. The Bill proposes to amend the Income tax law to give effect to a Budget announcement to authorise the raising provisional tax in respect of 1990-91 subsequent years of income on certain - alary or wages incomes. The change that IS. proposed by the Bill that is before us will apply only where two conditions are met. The amendment that 1I have circuused lated relates to one of those conditions. That condition relates to the areas where the taxpayer has a balance of tax to pay on assessment of $3,000 or more in relation to the year of income preceding the year for which the provisional tax is to be payable. The amendment that 1I have moved will include in the calculation of the tax to pay on assessment the credit available to a taxpayer where an amount of tax is withheld from the withdrawal of deposit made under the income equalisation deposits scheme. 1 commend the amendment to the Committee.",91
147,Mr ROCHER,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"We have only just become aware of this amendschedment, but a quick reading of it would indicate that there are probably no real about it. I ask the Minister whether there is any precedent for sinout tax withheld pending assessment on income equalisation deposits, their has being specifically mentioned in this 1 way-in other words, they are being singled out for special treatment. The reasons do not appear straightforward to me, and 1 would be interested if the Minister could enlighten me on that. It is to do with a withholding tax and, as the Minhas pointed out, it would include in the calculations of the tax to pay .on assessment the credit available to a taxpayer where an amount of tax is and has been withheld from a withdrawal of a deposit made under the income equalisation descheme. 1 cannot see the reasoning for that, but perhaps the Minister can tell me why that sort of income should be subparagraph singled out in this way.",91
148,Mr CREAN,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Hotham-Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Asin sisting the Treasurer) (5.51)-1 cannot inreally respond to whether there is a precedent but 1 simply make the point that in essence this is about correcting a deficiency in the current legislation to enable a credit to be taken into account in cirof cumstances in which it would not otherand wise have been taken into account. 1 would have thought that for those who had a basic view against this sort of provisional tax proposition being introduced in the first place, anything that can be to diminish the circumstances in which that tax applies would not cause any difficulties. 1 can get back to the honourable member on whether any precedent exists, but that should not be the basis upon which we hold up this provision tonight.

""(2) A reference in this section to the amount of provisional tax payable by a taxpayer includes a reference to the amount that, but for subsection 221YBA (5) of the Assessment Act, would be the provisional tax payable by the taxpayer."". This amendment is intended to remove the discretion which will become available to the government at its whim, virtually, after 30 June 1991 to decide whether the uplift factor shall be increased above 10 per cent and to apply anything up to 12 per cent. The uplift factor on provisional tax for this year, standing at 10 per cent, is already in excess of an estimated rate of inflation of 6.5 per cent, so what we have, as can readily be seen, is an addition to be made for t.\le purpose of assessing provisional tax income far in excess of the rate of the inflation. But as if to add insult to injury, the Government seeks also discretion to increase that 10 per cent by up to 2 per cent in subsequent years. It is fundamental to democratic government in any country that it shall be the parliament which decides the level of taxes to be levied on its citizens. In this case the effect will be, to the extent I have described, the giving of a discretion to the government of the day. That simply is not acceptable to the Opposition parties. 77F, Just picture it. At some time in the future a government, whether of our complexion or the complexion of those opposite, may see a bad year coming up and it may say that it has to top up revenue by increasing the uplift factor on provisional tax payments to 12 per cent. That would be a very handsome yield indeed, and the temptation could' arise. That is just one scenario, of course. This might be very simplistic in the extreme, but we really have here a breach of that fundamental I mentioned in my speech on the second reading debate this morning; that is, no taxation without representation. If this goes ahead, the representatives of this Parliament will not have the opportunity to debate a particular level of taxation. Revolutions have been made of that stuff, particularly if I understand what happened at the Boston Tea Party and the thoughts and emotions which led to it. It is a fundamental duty of the Parliament to decide the level of taxation whether it is to be increased or decreased' at any time. ., Mind you, if we were going to confer a bene-t on the population by decreasing taxatIOn we would probably not mind so much, but that is clearly not in the mind of the Government. It is patently clear that this will give the government of the day the right to increase this element of !axation 6y l:1P to 2 per cent. In doing so, It can effectIvely bypass this Parliament and, as I say, undermine the fundamental duty of all members in this Parliament to represent their electorate not just in general !erms but specifically in relation to taxatIon. We are often accused out there, with so-e reason, of taking ourselves far too senously. I am not talking about how we re-ard ourselves as individuals or how we mIght see our status because we are fortunate enough to be elected to this place t? .represent our constituents. The OpposltI<;>n parties realise that, and we take our - utIes. and responsibilities seriously. There IS a bIg difference. I want to make another point which demonstrates the complexity of this prop.osed law. Here we have an amendment to do. that very simple thing which I have mentIoned-to take away the discretion of the Government to add another 2 per cent to a particular tax regime. To do that, we needed a six-page amendment-for one simple job. It is outrageous complexity. Mr Halverson-It is ridiculous.",92
150,Mr ROCHER,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"It is ridiculous, as my colleague says. The Minister has spoken of tax simplification-and I touched on that this morning. The proof will be in the eating, of course, but if the Minister succeeds in getting any way along the line towards that very admirable objective I will be very pleased indeed. I will also 'be very surprised. I think it was in 1984 that our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) had the temerity to say that we will have a simplified, simpler tax system. We have seen nothing to indicate that that is likely to happen, and certainly nothing within the vicinity of that promise in 1984. So we have got six pages of amendments to achieve that simple end. I make the point again that that is part of the complexity of this legislation, but it is typical of tax legislation in all its - forms. Another example of it, of course, is anomalous sales tax treatment. Unfortunately, because of the nature of this debate I cannot go into that matter, although I also touched on it this morning. If the Government did have a commitment to the democratic principles of which we spoke and to the right and duty of individual members to represent their constituents in matters affecting the tax regime, particularly when the Government intends to increase a particular tax I am sure it will accept the amendment. ' That amendment has been prepared with the assistance of parliamentary draftsmen, and we are grateful for that assistance because, once again, getting back to the complexity of the legislation, it would have been beyond the wit of any ordinary man-and, of course, parliamentary draftsmen are not ordinary men or women. We do thank them for that assistance. We are assured that it meets the objectives we set out to achieve-what I have explained as re,dressing our fundamental objection to this Bill in the manner described-and I put it to the Committee.",95
151,Mr CREAN,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Hotham-Minister for Science and Technology and Minister sisting the Treasurer) (6.03)-We oppose the amendment. I, too, would like to see the number of pages associated with this legislation reduced, particularly when has got carriage of it. There is a requireGovernment ment for me to try to do that, too. It pretty heavy reading; nevertheless, it reprovided lates to the complexity of the system, I think it is associated with that broader strategy that I talked about before of ing the loopholes and repairing the base. If I can try to meet the point the hqnourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) outlined, this is not a provision that gives a new discretion to government. It simply seeks to give an opportuway nity within a band to do by regulation that which has been done by legislation. The reason for introducing it comes back to the problem in which we found oursaying, selves this year. Because the Parliament had been dissolved there was no opporwhim'. tunity through legislative procedures do what needed to be done to collect provisional tax. We have not heard in Opposition's comments that it is proposment ing the abolition of provisional tax. provision deals with the uplift factor, which is a decision that has to be taken annually to assess the percentage that should apply in relation to provisional tax for that appropriate year. I remind the Committee, because I think it is significant to understand the context in which this maxima-minima of 10 per cent to 12 per cent comes in, that since 1982 the yearly factor has fluctuated that band of 10 per cent to 12 per cent. So the Parliament has, by legislative tion, simply had to endorse a decision to make it 10 per cent, 11 per cent or 12 per cent. We are now proposing that the legbutions islation should give us the discretion do that by regulation. It will mean we expedite the function of government, particularly to ensure that we do not into the circumstances that existed this year when we could not move in circumchange. stances in which it was necessary for to move. It is not a new discretion; it is a simplification.",96
152,Mr ROCHER,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"With all Asdue respect to the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), it is a new discretion being conferred on the Government. All the fine words in the world one cannot escape that fact. This Bill gives a discretion to levy a particis ular tax at a rate higher than is being for today. It is as simple as that. and The Minister uses the rationalisation of an event that happened when the Parliaclosment was dissolved: that, because of the Government's own ineptitude, its own blatant incompetence, it could not achieve what it set out to do in legislation. The legislation simply was not introduced into this place in time to find its through the Parliament. The Government mucked it up. It is as simple as that. Because the Government made the mistake, it is now coming along here and 'We want this new discretion, we want the right to increase a tax at our We simply will not buy that. The to Minister comes along-I must say, in a very appealing way-and now asks the the Parliament to endorse what the Governproposes to do because last year. the This Parliament was dissolved before it did what the Government wanted it to do. I remind interested people that the Government has the numbers to decide the order of legislation in this place. We can see it as plain as day that the guillotine will be used in a couple of sitting weeks time to ram through, just as we did in May, 30 or 40 pieces of legislation without the elected representatives of this in country having an opportunity even to debate the legislation-let alone express a funccontrary opinion, let alone endorse the legisl.ation, and let alone, in the spirit of a legIslature, to make constructive contrias to how the Government's legto islation might be improved. We do not that get that under this Government. The matter comes back to the Governrun ment's legislative incompetence. Hopefully, with this Minister, that will all He is new, and I am sure that he us will have a lot more sway than those who preceded him. I hope that will be the case because, if not, it will be pretty dismal. We have had to trot up to the Senate to find out that eight more tax Bills are coming through this year. We do not know what is in them. Although we have a rough idea, we do not know their exact provisions. There will be eight more tax Bills, some arising out of the Budget decisions and some not. We have very little idea of what is likely to be in those Bills. The Minister has the gall to come in here on behalf of his Government-admittedly, generally speaking, his predecessors, although perhaps not so in May-and say to this Parliament, 'Because we mucked something up last year, please give us'the power at our whim to increase a tax'.

154,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATION," Mr Speaker has received advice from the Opposition Whip that he has nominated Mr Downer to be a member of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in place of Mr Beale. ARTS, ENVIRONMENT, TOURISM NA AMENDMENT BILL 1990 Second Reading Debate resumed from 20 September, on motion by Mr Simmons: That the Bill be now read a second time.",98
155,Mr JULL,AND TERRITORIES LEGISLATION,"The Arts, Environment, Tourism and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 is an omnibus Bill that causes the Opposition very little concern. However, I think there are a couple of points that we should make in terms of some of the provisions of these amendments, even though some may not be major. Perhaps I could start in the area of the Arts portfolio and refer particularly to some of those amendments that are now before us. The first amendment is to rectify a minor wording error in the 1989 amendments to the Australian Film, Television and Radio School Act 1973 which will operate retrospectively from the proclamation of the amending Act on 19 June 1989. We have absolutely no trouble with that. The second amendment is to the National Gallery Act 1975 to introduce flexible, workable and responsible disposal mechanisms for works of art from the national collection in line with recommendations made in the review of the Australian National Gallery in July 1989. These involve removing the requirements that two independent experts be consulted, but leaving ministerial approval as mandatory. The disposal mechanism has required reports from two independent experts on the importance of the works of art to the national collection. This has caused problems in that the fees paid for such advice could exceed the value of the work, especially when the only available relevant experts are from overseas. These new procedures are designed to allow sufficient safeguards to protect the works of art from wrongful disposal and the Minister's approval will still be required. In fact, we have asked the Government to make sure that it provides details of those works of art that are going to be disposed of in the Gallery's annual report. I thank the Government for accepting that suggestion, which came from the shadow Minister for the arts, heritage and sport. We have no problem with that at all. In this particular section of the Bill third amendment applies to the Protecdifficulties tion of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986 and will overcome administrative di!ficulties which have arisen in the atIon of the heritage export control scheme. The amendments will enable princip-l public collecting institution, nO.t .Pflvate collectors, to apply to the . MmIst-r for a general export permit s<? - v01d the present requirements dIvIdual export permits whenever lending Australian material overseas for research exhibition or a similar purpose. Because these collections are already controlled and protected by Acts of the Commonwealth, State and Territory parliaments, the administrative costs and inconvenience of the individual permits is considered unnecessary. The amendment will also exempt from the Acts all cultural heritage objects temporarily imported into Australia under a loan agreement from foreign governments. We do not oppose this particular recommendation either and the Opposition welcomes those particular details. I should also point out that in the other place we will move an amendment to this particular section of the Act which concerns the recommendations made in the report of the early investigation of the National Gallery, which enabled private sector funding to be considered as part of the program.",98
156,Unknown,AND TERRITORIES LEGISLATION,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.,99
157,Mr JULL,AND TERRITORIES LEGISLATION,"I turn to the amendment to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975. The purpose of this Bill is to repeal section 67 of the Act. The Opposition is not opposed to this part of the Bill which seeks to repeal that particular section. This is essentially a technical legal change aimed at preventing the disruption of proceedings in the event that a person charged with an offence does not give his or her permission for the matter t? be dealt with in a summary jurisdictIon. Repeal of the section will simply mean that the type of offence will be determined by the Crimes Act and nonappearance of a defendant charged with a summary offence will not prevent the matter proceeding. The Opposition regards this as a sensible and unexceptional the change which should remove unnecessary in dealing with these matters. I would like to turn to the sections of this Bill which deal with those two particoperular amendments that affected the Act in relation to the Australian Capital Terria tory. The first one is an amendment to but clause (5) and clause (6). They are purposely there to amend a technical error. I and suppose the same could be seen from the of insecond part of the amendments to that particular Bill as well because that is the , amendment to the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910. Basically it rectifies a technical error that has resulted in the unintended loss of the Governor General's ordinance making powers in respect of a number of Australian Capital Territory matters. The Opposition certainly has no problems with that either. The part of this particular Bill that we have some difficulties with is the amendments to the Australian Tourism Commission Act 1987. When the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) introduced this particular Bill he specifically said that these amendments were designed to make it possible for a more broadly based representation of persons with relevant skills, experience and background to be on the board of the Australian Tourist Commission (ATC). We could not agree with the Minister more wholeheartedly . We believe that people must have the relevant skills, experience and background to be on the board. In this particular Act the number of directors of the Australian Tourist Commission is taken from five to six. We would argue that while the cost of this particular move is not terribly great-the money that is involved is about $7,000 a year and some overnight travelling allowances that are set by the Remuneration Tribunal-we would really challenge the Minister about the necessity of increasing the number from five to six purely because of the composition of the present board. I think we should really go back to the establishing Act of the Australian Tourist Commission and look at some of the details that were provided for in that particular Act when the Australian Tourist Commission moved to Sydney from Melbourne and the new board was structured. A number of requirements were put into the particular Bill. A number of agreements were done between the then Minister Brown and the tourist industry. I refer particularly to the situation that existed between the Australian Travel Industry Association (ATIA) and the Australian Tourist Commission. At that time ATIA decided to hand over its overseas responsibilities, its overseas connections and the equipment and everything else it had in place to the ATC and made a very conscious decision-it was a correct decision, I think-to bring the promotion of Australian tourism under the one roof, under the control of the Australian Tourist Commission. The deal was done. On the board of the Australian Tourist Commission there would be two members who represented national tourism organisations. I refer particularly to section 13(6) of the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987 which says: Of the members appointed pursuant to paragraph 12(e), at least 2 members shall be drawn from representative national tourism organisations. In actual fact that never happened. There was never any consultation at that time with ATIA or, to my knowledge, the Inbound Tourism Organisation of Australia (ITOA) for any recommendation that they might put up or, indeed, for any member that they might put up. While we have the Minister here now expanding that particular board it is my understanding that ATIA still has not been approached for any recommendations or suggestions. I understand that ITOA has not been approached either. There has been a flagrant defiance of that particular section of the Act. What we must remember about the Australian Tourist Commission is that it has one prime purpose in life, that is, the promotion of Australia overseas. Let us look at the composition of the board of the Australian Tourist Commission now. We have Mr John Haddad who has been there for about eight or nine years. He has had a very close involvement with the tourist industry. Mr Haddad has probably done a very good job for the Australian Tourist Commission. We have the acting first assistant secretary of the Department. He is a requirement under the Act. Then we go into those five people who are allegedly representing the industry and allegedly putting their whole efforts into the promotion of Australia overseas. We have Mr John Ward, the chief executive of Qantas Airways Lt?: Mr - ard w-s appointed to that posItIon pnor to his being appointed as th- c.hie- executive of the airline. I guess It IS nght that we should have a representative of the airline on that particular board. I do not believe it should be the exclusive r:ight of Qantas to have that position on the board. I would hope in any future appointments that the Government-certainly we will in government-look around the other airlines in· Australia, the Australian owned carriers, for the best possible talent that we can find that will be dedicated to the promotion and sale overseas of Australia as a major destination. Then we start getting to the interesting appointments. One of the gentlemen who I understand is up for reappointment at the moment is Mr Sam Fiszman, the managing director of Univers Carpets Wholesalers. I have yet to find exactly what the connection is between this particular gentleman and his capacity to be able to promote Australia overseas as a tourist destination: I suppose we could argue that he has had a commercial background. We could also argue that he is not a bad golfer. We could also argue that he has some friends who formerly held some high places. Mr Fiszman's appointment is coming up. I do not know whether he will be replaced. The general feeling within the industry is that Mr Fiszman will still be there. There is another connection. One gentleman who has only recently left the board was Mr John Horgan, the Chairman of the Western Austra1ian Development Corporation. I wonder what sort of contribution WA Inc. made to the sale. of Australia overseas. We also have the usual appointment for this Government of Mr Peter James, the research director of the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees Union of Australia. I have no objection to union representatives being on the boards of major corporations; it is quite a good idea. When we go back to the late 1970s and early 1980s and we read. of the dramas thai went on between the then elnbryonic tourist· industry and the federated liquor union we wonder really what the dedication of that particular organisation is to tourism and to the promotion of tourism overseas. I would like to know in actual fact what the attendance of the aforementioned Mr James has been at some of the Australian Tourist Commission board meetings. We have a question on the Notice Paper regarding that. . One of the things that the Government did in terms of the re-establishment of the Australian. Tourist Commission was to put in a proviso that at least-it was set out in section 13(3)-one of the persons appointed as a member by the Minister should be a person who has environmental or sociological expertise relevant to the tourist industry. Another appointment is Ms Penny Figgis, former Vice-President of the Australian Conservation Foundation, and I h-ve no doubt about her qualifications. She is described as a leading environmentalist whose appointments include Vice-President of the Australian Conservation Foundation and Board Member, Uluru Kata Tjuta Board of Management. She has also been a member of the Board since 1988. As I say, in her place she is probably an admirable asset to the environmental movement. But I still think that the Government was totally wrong in having that provision in the establishment of the Australian Tourist Commission, whose primary purpose, after all, is selling Australia overseas. One really wonders just how much of the time and, more importantly, how much of the money and the resources of the Australian Tourist Commission are tied up in meeting this particular requirement of the Act. It could well be time and money that would be better spent promoting Australia overseas. It seems absolutely crazy that the Government has a huge environmental department with some of the best expertise around, and yet we have to have this separate division within the Australian Tourist Commission. I have no hesitation in putting the Government on notice that when the Opposition takes over the government benches it would be looking at rearranging that situation within the Australian Tourist Commission. That is not to say that we downgrade the role of the environment in terms of its cooperation and its capacity to live with the tourist industry; but we believe that there are people who are better equipped within the Department, people who have the expertise, the knowledge and the capacity to do a much greater job than this token that has been given to the environmental people by virtue of this one appointment on the Board. Once again, that is not a reflection on Miss Figgis or her capacities, but 1 really wonder, in the scheme of things in trying to promote Australia overseas, just how good that appointment has been. Ms Marie Watson Blake, the Chairman of Jetset Tours (Queensland) Pty Limited, is a fairly recent appointment to the Board, and I have no hesitation about her appointment. I have known her for more than 20 years. She has been a leading light in the outbound tourist industry in Australia, and in recent years she and her organisation have been very deeply involved in the promotion of domestic travel within Australia. There is no problem there at all. There is another point that does cause the Opposition some concern. Once again, this is not a reflection on the capacity the gentleman, Mr Tony Thirlwell, who is the Managing Director of the Australian Tourist Commission, but it seems very strange to us that the chief executive of an instrumentality such as this would also appear on the board of the organisation. I imagine that that would be a very strange situation in most companies around Australia. Sure, the chief executive might tend board meetings and the rest of it, but physically to be an appointment on the board we think is quite strange. Consequently, we would argue that there would be no need to increase the membership of the Board from five to six if the Board were constituted properly in the first place. I have said on many occasions in this House that this Government has to realise that, in terms of its export income, it has not much going for it at all except tourism. We can get up here and pound away and quote and quote the tourism figures. We can quote the $6.5 billion income. We can quote the fact that tourism is our biggest hard currency earner. We can quote the fact that 500,000 people are employed in the industry. There is not another area of the private sector that provides more jobs than tourism, and we should be able to quote the fact that we have the keenest and sharpest possible overseas operation in terms of promoting Australia. Overall, I think the Australian Tourist Commission does a pretty good job, but I really wonder, when we see the composition of that Board, whether we are getting to the stage where we have the proper direction. I do not put any blame on the present Minister because, as he said when he introduced this Bill, he wants the changes so that he has a more broadly based representation of persons with relevant skills, experience and background on the Board. The interesting thing is that we do have two positions available now on the Board. We have Mr Horgan's position and we have this new one, assuming .that these amendments are accepted. I would suggest that probably they are the only two appointments that are going to come up. In fact, if I were a more humble of man I would say that I know they are the only two appointments that are going to come up. Who are we going to get in them? My thrust to the Government would be that it really should take notice of its own legislation. It should really be there making sure that it gets people to serve on that Board who represent national touratism organisations. If we go through those individual appointments, I suppose we could argue that Qantas is a member of the Australian Travel lndustry Association; it is probably also a member of ITOA. I am not sure who else in that line-up would meet the requirement in the Act, but certainly there has never been the consultation that was required in relation to the provisions laid down in that Act and the appointment of this Board. That is no reflection at all on the present Minister. If anything, it is a reflection on the Minister who established this legislation. There has never been a time when the direction of the Australian Tourist Commission has been more critical. We have heard the lobbying that has gone on from all sorts of industry bodies about the sums . of money that are required to direct the Australian Tourist Commission. I suppose if one does a synopsis of the statements that have been made in that regard, the general consensus has been that $1 OOm is required if we are really going to promote Australia overseas. I do not know if that is the sum; it is an awful lot of money. The Government gets up here and tells us just how well it has done in terms of tourism, but when we look at the money it has dedicated to it, it is pretty pathetic. One can do some real comparisons. How much is the Government going to prop up primary industries and rural industries in Australia this year, and for what? Because there are declining commodity prices. How much is involved in supporting the wheat industry? $130m? How much is involved in supporting the wool industry? How much is involved in the coal industry, the beef industry? The tourist industry has more potential than any other to provide hard currency and jobs. There has never been a period in Australia's history, I think, like the one we are entering now. Jobs are going to become more and more important, - nd there has never been an industry with the capacity to provide the mass employment to young Australians that this industry has, yet the total dedication to it is $40m. The Australian Tourist Commission admits that, basically, its campaign this year is going to have to be aimed at the Japanese market. It really has not got enough to go into the North American market and do a good job in promoting Australia, trying to stir up that market again after the disaster of the pilots dispute. There are some good developing markets, and we saw evidence of that in the estimates in another place last week or the week before, with the re-emergence of the United Kingdom and some pick-ups in the numbers from Germany and other places in Europe. But very little money will be able to be spent in terms of major campaigns in Europe this year, and $40m is a pretty small sum. There are other ways, of course, that one can help in tourism promotion, but it would seem fairly obvious to me that there is no dedication in that regard either from this Government. One of the greatest things one can do for Australia is simply to open up the international aviation system. On two occasions in the last 15 months in this House we have heard statements from the Minister for Finance (MrWillis) and the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) that this is going to happen, but what have we done? We have put a few more seats on from Zimbabwe. Gulf Air is going to start operating into Australia on 1 December. That will do a great deal for us out of the Gulf region at the moment. I am sure the Bahrain to Sydney service is going to be a very popular one indeed, and I am sure they are going to do very well on the way back! Rights have been given to Swissair but it has not started operating yet. We have the absolute classic of Korea, which potentially is probably a market as big as Japan and potentially as rich as Japan. After 14 years of belting its head against the wall here, Korean Airlines came in and what was it given? One service a week. Yet a representative of a government department the other day had the hide to say that they are going to double the number of tourists into Australia from Korea by giving it two services a week. I suppose that is logical. We could now put seven services a week on there and fill them with the amount of outbound traffic that is coming out of Korea. In the newspapers this morning we read of the disaster that is already happening once again in terms of the negotiation of the air rights between Australia and Taiwan. It is not all Australia's fault, but the intransigence of the Government and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has made us look really quite ridiculous, I think, especially when we realise that virtually every other major airline in the world is operating into Beijing and Taiwan with very little difficulty. It is dead easy for Japan Airlines to paint its name off one side of its aircraft and put another name on it and in they go, which is exactly what Australia was putting up. It would appear that one section of the Government is almost committed to making it as hard as possible for the tourism industry really to expand. There is a relationship between capacity and the number of people we get. There is a very real relationship between capacity and the price of air fares into Australia. Tony Thirlwell, the Managing Director of the Australian Tourist Commission, and Mr Blunn from the Department, admitted that in the Estimates committee hearings in the other place. They said that the price of air fares out of Japan was probably far too high and that the best thing that ever happened in terms of the promotion of the Japanese market to Australia occurred after the pilots dispute when Qantas, Japan Air Lines and All Nippon Airways went into a major promotion and ripped the fares down by 25 per cent. There was a bit of promotion there. It was not the Australian Government but the airlines that did the promotion but they admitted that the fare component was vital in making sure that the Japanese market was generated again. Despite what we are told time and again by that part of this Government which is responsible for aviation, some of the highest air fares in the world operate into and out of this country. If we could just get our act together properly we have the capacity to solve all the problems in the tourist industry virtually without spending another cent. When we open up these air services and get the new carriers coming in, the first thing that happens is that every overseas airline office operates as a sales Australia. The airlines will not have empty flights in and out of Australia. They will go out and promote and fill the seatsand they will do it at the right price. If people want to look at what can really be achieved-and this is to our shamethey should look at what has happened to Singapore. Every time Singapore Airlines Ltd makes a move into Australia, Qantas goes into a flurry, holds its hands up and says, 'This is terrible; we are being raped'. The Government backs the company up. What did Singapore Airlines do? It said, 'We are a free port; if you want to operate into here, you can, but we want rights back into your country'. The Thais did not take too long; they did the same thing. They built a new airport in Bangkok and said, 'Who wants to come in here?'. 'We do'. 'How many services do you want? Have. as many as you like. Bring them in'. But not us; not Australia. We have such intellectual brilliance that when a bloke like Lauda, who is the only carrier operating out of Vienna, applies for an extra two services a week, he is knocked back. He is coming from the heartland of the biggest spending tourism market anywhere in the world. United Airlines comes in here and wants to pick up old rights between Tokyo and Sydney. The brawl is still going on. There will be another round of talks in November. So much can be made out of the Japanese market if we open up that system. There is a capacity problem out of Japan and a capacity problem with the airports. We know about that but we have to go in there and get the niches now. We have to get in there. and make sure that that market sticks. We have to go in there and make sure that we are competitive. Despite the fact that Australia is regarded by these overseas markets as an expensive destination, people are still coming here. Can honourable members imagine what could happen if we could compete in terms of fares with a place like Hawaii? Cairns is 15 miles closer to Tokyo than is Hawaii. It is not a matter of distance. We are in the same time zone. We have the attractions. People want to come. But if capacity and cost are deterrents, how will office for we get it off the ground? In the last 12 months the tourist industry has been through a dreadful time. We experienced the pilots dispute, which was ridiculous and was allowed· to continue for far too long. The cost to Australia was enormous and it was the worse industrial dispute since 1949. It has been very difficult to try to pick up that business. I think the Australian Tourist Commission has done well, through means such as I have mentioned, in getting that Japanese traffic back on the line. But we have a long way to go. The North American market and some other areas are still very soft. The United Kingdom and some of Europe is coming back. Never before have we more needed leadership and commitment from the Government; leadership, commitment and knowledge from the Board of the Australian Tourist Commission; or total dedication of the ATC staff, with what little resources they have, to be able to go back and generate those markets. I suggest that we in this House have a social obligation to force the Government to make the right decisions, to make sure that the right people are appointed to the Board of the Australian Tourist Commission. I do not know how many times in this House I have cited the old Bureau of Industry Economics figures that go back to about 1977, but those figures have held true. One can trace them through the development of Australian tourism. Every time we increase by a net figure of 25,000 the number of international visitors coming into Australia we create another 1,400 jobs. No other industry in Australia has the capacity to provide long term employment for our kids and their kids to come. In the short term no other industry in Australia at the moment has the capacity of the tourism industry to earn export dollars for us. This industry probably gets the lowest return of any of our major export industries in terms of governmental allocations, and it is not an industry that is looking for handouts. We have to make sure that everything is in place to allow the Tourist Commission to go out and sell Australia, to allow people who want to come here to be able to get here at a price that is right and to make sure we have the capacity to handle the flood of people who want to come into this country. That is why it is so terribly important that this time when we look at the composition of the Board of Directors of the Australian Tourist Commission we get it absolutely right. The Opposition wants to see people of top capacity get those jobs. We want to see people who know the industry, who have a real dedication to the industry and who have a flair for marketing to be able to get in and lead the Australian Tourist Commission. We have some good people on the Board at the moment. We want to make sure they are all good. That is why we are concerned that one more position is not the answer to it all; there has to be a cleanout.",99
158,Mr JOHNS,AND TERRITORIES LEGISLATION,"1 had an idea the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) might talk about tourism so, without canvassing the other matters in this very large Bill, the Arts, Environment, Tourism and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1990, I might also concentrate on the question of tourism and the composition of the Australian Tourist Commission. The honourable member for Fadden protested a little too loudly that he was unhappy with the current structure of the Australian Tourist Commission, with some of the people on the Board, with the amount of Government expenditure on the Australian Tourist Commission and with the negotiation of this country's rights with other international airlines, et cetera-except that in the end the figures we continue to cite about the numbers of travellers arriving here are good. Numbers of travellers are at record levels. Is the honourable member suggesting that if we spend another $50m or $60m on the Australian Tourist Commission it will double the number of tourists? Will it create the sort of return from investment we would like to see? I do not know; it is not proved. I am not an advocate for the tourist industry-as, clearly, is the honol,lrable member opposite-but in the context of drawing up a budget for an Australian government it was outrageous for some groups to call for expenditure of over $100m for the Australian Tourist Commission. It was reasonable for us as a government to continue at real levels the amount of expenditure, about $40m, for the Australian Tourist Commission. ' As the honourable member for Fadden ran through a list of people currently on the Australian Tourist Commission Board, he was not exactly dissatisfied with the performance of many of them, because I suspect we could not really measure that performance by interviewing them. We do not have the evidence before us. In terms of the number of people coming herethe honourable member should stay here because I will cite all the figures back to him in a moment-there is evidence in hard numbers suggesting that the Australian Tourist Commission has been successful, so it is difficult to sustain an argument that somehow we have got the structure wrong. I do not know what negotiations took place many years ago about who should and who should not be represented on the· Board of the Australian Tourist Commission, but I applaud the view of the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) that we should create an extra position at next to no cost and thereby give us two shots at bringing in new people. I think the honourable member for Fadden would be satisfied with that. He also wants to hunt out a few heads, though, and knock off a few people who are currently Board members. I do not think anyone would disagree that we do need a trade union representative on the Board. I do not know how  but I am sure he understands better than I-as well as the honourable member for Fadden-the intimate relationship between the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees Union of Australia and the tourism industry. There is no reason why he, as a representative of that trade union, should not be on the Tourist Commission Board. So it goes with most of the other members. They are all good people. As to whether some of the people that the honourable member for Fadden is closely associated with should be on the board, I cannot predict the next two appointees. He may be able to, but I doubt it, and some new people will soon be up for reappointment or otherwise soon. But the point is these minor changes will bring an exceptional amount of flexibility by bringcountry ing two new appointments out of 10 to the board. So it is hard to sustain an argument that somehow there is a crisis in the board, because if there is one it certainly is not having an impact on the tourist industry itself. So I am quite happy and keen to support the notion that we amend the number of people coming onto the board and that there should be lOin all. i think we would all agree that tourism as an industry has suffered from somehow being a latter day industry. It is not seen to be one of those base industries like .coal, wheat and so forth, as the honourable member for Fadden said-and I agree. That is partly a state of mind that each of us must bring to government. But neither could the honourable member criticise this Government for not being light years ahead in raising the profile of tourism in this country. The honourable member could not criticise the former Minister, Mr John Brown, in his ability to raise the profile of tourism and to make it a central industry in the Australian economy. Everyone would acknowledge that. So again I think the honourable member protests far too loudly because our work here has been good. Despite that awful dispute last year with the pilots we have already re-established the industry, with significant numbers of tourists coming into the country. Heaven knows where we would have been without that dispute. Our numbers surely would have been higher still. Despite the fact that we had to play it pretty tough last year with an outrageous set of demands by pilots, after finally resolving the dispute in the most difficult way possible-I mean in the sense that it could only be sol ved that way-we are back on track with near record numbers of people coming into the country spending near record amounts of money. It is not a bad old effort in view of the fact that we had to pick up the damages caused by the pilots. We apparently move along with a tourist commission that the honourable member is unhappy with, but we still get the numbers in the end. We still have significant new numbers of people coming into the and a significant contribution by the tourist industry to the economy. Perhaps I will forgo some of those facts and figures that we are now all probably aware of and pick up an issue which is particularly acute in my home State of Queensland. There has been some dispute or difference in emphasis between the Goss Labor Government and this Government over the amount of overseas investment in some Queensland resorts, particularly in the Cairns region. We know that there was a genuine and deeply felt dispute between the Federal member based in that region, the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Gayler) and his State colleague and Treasurer in Queensland, the member for Cairns. That dispute has now been resolved because the State Government has made it clear that not only does it welcome investment from overseas, particularly from Japanunfortunately, that became the focus of very heated debate-but it is also very concerned to keep the resorts available to Australians, to local users, to residents of Cairns, to residents of North Queensland, particularly the islands offshore. I applaud it for that. It is signalling to North slanders that they should never be pushed out of the tourist facilities now being built in the North Queensland region. I applaud the State Government for that initiative. By the same token, though, we have to make it plain that the Australian industry requires foreign investment; it relies on foreign investment. The purchase by a number of mainly Japanese companies of tourist facilities in north Queensland, throughout Queensland or in the rest of the country is really no sort of abrogation of this Government's responsibilities in the tourist industry. It is no particular abrogation of Australian investors in the tourist industry. It is the same as any other industry in the country; it requires foreign investment. We always seem to forget that when some Australians sell out of an investment it brings new capital to Australia. It frees up the capital that was gained by the Australian investors when they sold the hotel complex, the land or whatever; it frees up that capital to allow the Australians to reinvest. So in a sense I guess it could be argued that a foreign investment gives us an up-front return for the sorts of capital improvements that will be made in tourism in a given area and the up-front return, the capital raised from the sale, is used again and again in other industries. Government members recently had a debate when we were given a briefing by the Foreign Investment Review Board. It suggested that there was an enormous concentration of foreign, particularly Japanese, investment' in the tourist industry. I had to ask many of my colleagues whether they would prefer that concentration to be in other industries, for example, in the beloved manufacturing industry, as if the manufacturing industry was of itself more important than the tourist industry. I agree with the honourable member for Fadden that tourism is no less yet no more important than those other industries. It deserves the same amount of Australian Government support. Given that as a government we cannot really direct investment in certain areas, Queenwe cannot be craven in our attitude towards tourism and say that foreign investors should not invest so much in tourism. We need to welcome it. At the same time, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is 'quite right when in Japan he says, 'We would prefer that you start to look around at other industries. We would prefer that you give some assistance to us in manufacturing'. But I guess the tourist industry is one of the easiest entry industries and the Japanese, from their point of view, are looking to give their own people a service. They are looking to provide excellent services for their own workers in another country when they visit. We cannot blame them for that. When Americans first started to travel in great numbers around the world they made a lot of their investments in hotel chains. So really we can see it in terms of Japan or the United States of America wanting to make that first investment in a country in the area of tourism. That, in itself, enables them to have a look around the Australian scene and then make choices about investments in other industries. In a sense, although there may be not so much a trickle down effect, it will give the Japanese investor the opportunity to settle, to look, to watch our markets and then to make decisions. Investments in manufacturing, primary industry, mining or whatever are often more complex. I .think we need to lay to rest many of the concerns that Queenslanders in particular have about the concentration of Japanese investment in the tourist industry. There is no loss to Australia in that level of investment and I suspect that the level of investment will continue to boom in the next several decades. In fact, I was lucky enough to be in a delegation to Singapore some weeks ago and I talked to one of the Singaporean Ministers. He made the point to me that those of Singapore's middle class each have a reasonable living unit, all the electronic gear can be put into that sort of unit and reasonable jobs and are now at a point where, because of the physical constraints of Singapore, the next step is travel. The next step is to move out of Singapore, to look around and spend money. In that sense Singapore is the leading edge of that part of Asia, of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), just as Japan is the leading edge of the northern Pacific rim of nations. We could well expect a significant improvement in the number of travellers from the ASEAN region in the next decade or so. Probably there will be some Singaporean or Chinese investment which will be the precursor to those improved numbers of people travelling to Australia. We need to step back, see the tourist industry as a full-blown mature industry that brings significant employment. However, I should say that it does not bring the sort of technical expertise that Australia has been used to in the primary, mining and manufacturing sectors. There are real qualitative differences in the sort of work force required in tourism. I do not think that anyone would suggest that a country so reliant on tourism could ever produce a class of workers who had a significant intellectual input into a nation. There must be a distinction drawn between the sorts of jobs that Australians could hope to pick up in the tourist industry. It simply does not bring with it the engineers and scientists, except in the construction phase. Let me return to this Government's record in the tourist industry. Plainly there have been difficulties in the relationship between our flag carrier, Qantas Airways Ltd, and other airlines in the negotiation of rights. That situation will free up now that Qantas will be able to expand its fleet an(j take on private capital. It will be possible to negotiate with far more weight and to a far greater effect the sort of correspondence and relationship between Qantas as a carrier and other international carriers. . That implies that there will be a new phase of investment in tourism in this that country. Again that new phase will require international capital. We should prepare ourselves right now for an enormous boost to these already significant numbers of inbound tourists to Australia. I know that· the Minister· for' the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) is very keen on mapping out the next phase right now. The next phase will be just as exciting as the past 10 years have.. been. The next phase will be guided and assisted by this Government in close consultation with the industry, using groups such as the Australian Tourist Commission. I should imagine that the next phase will produce a far wider array of source points from which people will visit Australia and a far wider array of source points for capital to be invested in tourism. The challenge for us is to have the right skills available to investors when they bring their money onshore here and want us to work. Just to nail it finally, particularly for the Australian public, I point out that we should never forget that whoever invests here has to pay all the taxes of any Australian company. All the workers must be paid award wages; all the workers, with very few exceptions, must be Australians. The amount of investment in this country will stay here, in the sense that the greatest amounts of money are the wages and salaries of the workers and the tax retained by the Australian Government. We should not take any notice of the fairy tale argument that says that it all goes overseas, 'that whatever the Japanese invest here goes straight out the door. It simply does not. We derive a great deal of benefit from the enormous number of foreign tourists who arrive here, and we derive that directly. I guess the honourable member fot Fadden was leading to the fact that the housing industry has always been regarded as one of the great generators of employment in Australia. But housing and building generally are subject to enormous seasonal variation. It might be that tourism will supplant housing as one of the great engines of employment. Fortunately tourism simply is not subject to the vast movements that occur in the building industry. I support these particular changes to tourism. I applaud the work of the present'Minister, and also that of the former Minister in this \ Government in relation to tourism. I support the Bill. Question resolved in the affirmative.

160,Dr BOB WOODS,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"The Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill proposes a number of amendments to the Child Care Act 1972, .the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the National Health Act 1953. My remarks will be related particularly to the health aspects of this Bill. The legislation provides for a number of changes. In the first place it arranges for a change to the gap between the scheduled fee and the Medicare benefit, which in this case will increase from $20 to $26. The gap has not increased since 1986, so in financial terms this is not an enormous financial burden to be imposed upon the community. The problem that the Opposition has with the gap is a philosophical one. There is really no reason for the gap to exist and to be uninsurable. The reason for this is indeed purely ideological. The Government ment has its ideological bent about ducing the gap and for some reason makes it impossible to insure against the gap, an outpatient. An associated clao.:se actually lifts Medicare safety net threshold from the current $150 per calendar year to $240 per calendar year. The increase has not been made since 1986, so again in financurred, cial terms this is not an extra burden. Nonetheless, it is a burden and basically it is a problem for a number of patients who are prevented from insuring for this gap. I particularly refer to in-patients face extra medical fees. Bearing in mind the other impositions which the Governwhich ment puts upon the insurance regulations that prevent a number of other items being insured and make it impossible for an individual to be completely covered for the costs of being sick, this represents yet another burden upon the poor old patient. Associated with this the Government has increased the gap in the Medicare safety net in future years according to linkage with the consumer price index (CPI). This is quite simply an attempt the Government to introduce in an unwould derhand fashion and to remove from posure, scrutiny and public and family parliamentary debate the changes which occur on a regular basis. We accept that there is a significant change to be imposed according to the CPI. The problem we have with regard to this matter is that there should not be a problem here in terms of the gap; the gap should be insurdom, able. There is no reason why it should be; it is a sensible thing to do. Therefore, part of the amendments which we will moving include an amendment which calls upon the Government to allow patients to insure against the gap, being the differernment's ence between the scheduled medical fee and the medical benefit. As from 1 January 1991, Medicare benis efits for medical services rendered overallowing seas will be discontinued. The situation at present is that we are supposedly the grip of a universal, comprehensive health insurance scheme funded by taxper payers' moneys. This is how the Governdescribes Medicare. The truth, of introcourse, is far from that. What actually happens at present when as a person goes overseas and gets sick is that he or she gets no contribution to the wards hospital expenses under Medicare but may get a contribution, in most cases, towards medical expenses. Depending on whether those medical expenses are in that may be a worthwhile contribution or it may not. For example, if a person, visits the United States and is unfortunate enough to fall sick, then the medical expenses are liable to be very who high. The reimbursement which is offered from Medicare relates to the level of fees would be chargeable in Australia in the Medicare schedule. Because of that, from that person would probably get only a fraction of his or her medical expenses returned in terms of the rebate. Nonetheless, it is something which is useful, and sick there is no reason to change it. If one thinks about the other benefits which are offered to recipients under social security schemes, for example, by an,d a large, with one or two exceptions, they are offered on a continuing basis. Should by a person happen to go overseas, he or she still get a pension and a range of exother family assistance programs. The allowance, for example, to assist with children is paid for up to three years if one goes overseas. What we are talking about is short term overseas benefits. There are some reciprocal arrangements in terms of private travel health insurance with countries such as the United KingNew Zealand, Italy, Sweden and a not few others. I gather that a number of other arrangements are being negotiated be between the Australian Government and overseas governments. However, at this time, although I would support the Govinitiative in terms of trying to encourage people to insure privately for overseas trips, the situation is that there no sensible reason whatsoever for not Medicare rebates for expenses covered overseas, either philosophically or in practically. The amount the Government will save-which is in the o'rder of $5m year is not exactly going to break the bank. If the Government really believes has some sort of comprehensive insurance scheme, then surely this should be part it. It would be an anomaly if it were not. I might point out that virtually every private health insurance scheme in Austhat, tralia is valid when taken overseas, should the insured person be unfortunate enough to be sick overseas. He or she then ceives a rebate comparable to what would have been paid, in Australia. This is one of the few benefits of private health ance that are left which the Government has not attacked in recent times. If carries on in its current program, sure it will get around to it sooner later. Another clause which the Government has introduced relates to the recent agree is, ment between the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the Government in terms of pharmacy remuneration. There are number of aspects to that particular agreement. Most of them are unpopular within the pharmacy profession and most of them are unpopular with the Pharmacy Guild. The Pharmacy Guild, however, takes the view that it is probably the deal that it is going to get and on basis it has by and large accepted the offer from the Government and entered into the agreement. Part of the agreement lates to remuneration for dispensing and a number of other matters, but part of relates to the closures of pharmacies. The Govyrnment has this amazing titude toward pharmacies. It seems think that by closing a few pharmacies will save money. The basic problem with that is that prescriptions in Australia elsewhere around the world are almost universally written by doctors. If the ernment has some concept that the numbearing ber of scripts will reduce because the number of pharmacies is reduced, then it obviously needs to get its thinking The only possible financial justification for closing pharmacies and claiming that this will save the Government money is if it turns around at a later date and says to the Pharmacy Guild, 'There are fewer pharmacies. Therefore each of your indifour vidual pharmacists is earning more money and we will screw down even more the it actual dispensing fee that we pay to you for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme's of dispensations'. If the Government is planning to do that, then closing pharmacies . makes sense. If it is not planning to do then closing pharmacies does not make sense. In particular, it does not make sense when the Government is actually repaying good taxpayers' funds to those pharmacies to close. It is encouraging them to be non-viable in the first place insurby giving a low remuneration rate. When the pharmacists decide that it it might be worth considering closure or I am amalgamation, the Government says, or 'Okay, we will give you $100,000 or $120,000 to close'. Half those funds will actually come from the Government-that the taxpayer-and half of those funds will come from the Pharmacy Guild. That is the subject of negotiations between the a Pharmacy Guild and the Government. Part of the legislation in front· of us deals with the mechanisms for those closures and amalgamations. What the Government is going to do is set up a Pharmacy Restructuring Authority (PRA). best This Pharmacy Restructuring Authority that will be empowered to make recommendations for the payment of essential pharmacy allowances and for payments in rerespect of pharmacies that amalgamate or close. It will also be empowered to make it recommendations for new pharmacy approvals. Perhaps it would be more accuatrate to say that it will not make to recommendations for new pharmacy apit provals. It seems almost certain that the guidelines that will be given to the Pharand macy Restructuring Authority will be that very few if any new pharmacies will be Govapproved and allowed to open. This is in mind that the whole point of the agreement was to reduce the number of pharmacies from the current five and a straight. half thousand or so. The Restructuring Authority will be made up of seven government and industry nominees with an independent chairperson, all of whom are appointed by the Minister. The Pharmacy Guild will make nominations and two of those will actually be appointed. ThePRA will also make its recommendations in accordance with criteria determined by the Minister. We were not really going to think that this would b- an independent authority. Those determinations will be tabled in Parliament. The Secretary to the Department has a number of authorities in terms of power of overruling the recommendations of the PRA. So the PRA will set some guidelines but it will have very little authority behind it. The problem we have with the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority is that whether a pharmacy exists in a given town or suburb, whether it closes or a new one opens, has nothing whatsoever to do with government. Government has no role in the regUlating of pharmacies. It is not going to benefit the community. I cannot think of a situation where a government decision as to whether a community had a particular facility in terms of health was one which was beneficial to the community. Government and bureaucratic decisions, by and large, are not made with great insight in this area. There is no reason to suppose that it would be any different in terms of the pharmacy profession. Our view is that the pharmacy profession should be allowed to decide for itself where it wants to open pharmacies. As I said before, by virtue of opening up a 'pharmacy one does not incur or impose extra costs upon the Commonwealth but simply spreads around the number of scripts which are already there or, if a pharmacy is closing, reduces the number of pharmacies which will dispense those particular scripts. But the number of scripts will stay constant. We are opposed to this legislation. We believe that market forces should prevail.· We believe that if, for example, a pharmacy in a given suburb is non-viable then it will not survive, will not be viable and will close. If a pharmacy is actually needed by the community, then it will survive and be viable. The market forces in this regard are indeed very important. There are particular problems in relation to a number of country towns where there is only one pharmacy, and there are some provisions in the guidelines which will ensure that the Government takes note of that. But there are some concerns in a number of isolated towns in regard to what the Government is doing because the people in those towns are scared, with justification, that it may lead to the closure of the only pharmacy in that town and as a consequence the inhabitants may well have to travel many kilometres in making alternative arrangements. We believe, therefore, that this particular part of the legislation should be overturned, and we will move an amendment to that effect, condemning the Government for usurping free market forces in regard to new pharmacies and old pharmacies and whether pharmacies should close or amalgamate. There are some other items which I wish to address. One measure which we care should support is the extension of the secrecy provisions of the National Health Act 1953 and the Health Insurance Act 1973 to include persons who solicit, disclose or use confidential information, and this is information which is basically protected under both of those Acts. We believe that it is very important that we close loopholes such as this. This measure is sensible, and it covers a present loophole whereby it is an offence for a Commonwealth officer to disclose information obtained in the course of duty, but there is no provision for an offence by the person soliciting that information where that person may indeed have known that that information had been lawfully obtained. There will be no need for the information to have been disclosed. The Bill also relates to the publication of data relating to the sale of pharmaceutical benefit drugs, even if the data identifies the manufacturer. I am somewhat mystified as to why the Government wants to introduce this particular clause, and we have not received a satisfactory explanation. The Bill allows the publication of data relating to the supply of benefits in aggregate form, even though the release of that data, which may be confidential, may identify the manufacturer. The Government apparently defends this on the basis that a lack of data has hampered the monitoring of drug usage to ensure that subsidised drugs are being used in ways which will reflect both sound medical practice and cost effectiveness. The pharmaceutical manufacturers almost unanimously argue that the Government already has aggregate details of their market share, and they see no justification whatsoever for publishing the data. They do not believe that it will improve the monitoring of doctors' prescribing habits, and they believe that the release of this data could provide confidential information to other competing pharmaceutical companies. Surely it is a basic principle that pharmaceutical companies deserve similar consideration to doctors and pharmacists, or indeed other businesses. The confidentiality of individual company data is maintained for other industries, and there is no reason why pharmaceutical manufacturers should be any exception at all. The Bill also extends the benefits of health care cards to all families who receive the family allowance supplement. This means that those families will be able to receive pharmaceutical benefits at a concessional rate of $2.50. I must say we have no particular problem with this. H increases the cargo cult mentality to a certain extent. Levels of family allowance supplement are, of course, subject to the number and age of dependent children, and income and accommodation, and presently a person gets the full rate of family allowance supplement when the income is less than or equal to $324 a week. At present a health care card is provided. For married couples it is available when their combined income is equal to $ 314 a week, so the amount is fairly small. This provision does tidy up a loose end in regard to the health care card's allocabranded tion. Persons who are wholly or substantially dependent on financial support from an overseas government or overseas company wlll now no longer be eligible to receive a health care card. Indeed, they never should have been. We would entirely support that. The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) in his second reading speech referred to the new minimum pricing policy for pharmaceuticals and the prescribing of generics. Of course, the Government now plans to subsidise only the lowest price level of drugs, and if a given manufacturer wishes to make his particular product available at a higher price, he can do so but he will receive only the minimum price in return when it is dispensed through the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS). The difference will have to be paid by the recipient, the patient, who may well be a pensioner since some 70 per cent of scripts are prescribed for pensioners. The problem face<;l by any government in this area is very difficult. On the one hand, it is cost effective to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to encourage generic prescribing, since those drugs are almost universally cheaper and usually just as effective as the branded product; on the other hand, it is important to encourage branded products to a certain extent because the companies which promote those branded products are those which, by and large, introduce new drugs and therapies into Australia. One problem which is clearly going to arise from this is the question of infor-· mation, particularly to the pensioner group. Quite clearly, a number of pensioners will continue to receive from their doctors prescriptions for branded products which are several dollars more expensive than the generic product price which the Government is prepared to pay. Pensioners will have to pay the extra for the branded product, or get their prescriptions changed. The most effective way of encouraging the use of generics is to introduce a generic substitute program under which, if a doctor writes a prescription for a product, an identical generic product may be substituted. There are problems with this, of course. It is very effective in terms of reducing costs, but it does interfere with the doctor-patient relationship, and it interferes with the independence of the doctor and the decision making Of the medical profession. By and large, the medical profession has significant opposition to this, and the Government clearly has avoided making this tough decision. Of course, the pharmacy industry was unhappy because it would involve itself in a lot of extra conferring with doctors with regard to whether a prescription can be changed from the original productwhich ma'y be more expensive-to the cheaper generic product in order to save the patient money. I understand that the negotiation between the Guild and the Government includes an extra fee of $2 per telephone call made on behalf of patients to doctors in relation to this problem. . For the minimum pricing policy to be effective and to be a success, the Government has to implement an education program. The suggestions which it has made so far have been pitiful. The program has to educate not only the general public but also the professions about branded products, generic drugs, out of patent drugs and the financial implications of these prescriptions. I believe that the education program should place particular emphasis on pensioner education, since pensioners are, indeed, responsible for the vast majority of prescriptions under the PBS. The Government estimates that the minimum pricing policy will produce a net saving of approximately $16m in 1990-91 and $47m in later years. We have no problems with the thrust of the generic policy, but we do believe the Government must introduce, as a matter of urgency, a suitable education program because the generic pricing policy is almost upon us. As I mentioned at the beginning, we will not oppose the Bill, but I would like to move an amendment. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a reading, the House(1) calls on the Government to allow patients to insure against the 'gap' which is the difference between the scheduled medical fee and the Medicare benefit; (2) condemns the Government for providing automatic CPI increases to the maximum patient contribution which will remove opportunity for public and parliamentary scrutiny and debate of these increases; (3) calls on the Government to formulate and implement an education program on its minimum pricing policy and on the use of generic drugs; (4) condemns the Government for abolishing Medicare cover for Australians travelling overseas for medical expenses; (5) condemns the Government for its attempt to usurp free market forces by establishing the Pharmaceutical Restructuring Authority to make recommendations on applications for new pharmacies, and on the amalgamation and closure of other pharmacies; and . (6) expresses its concern that data relating to the sale of drugs which will identify individual manufacturers will be published and will be accessible .to the manufacturers' competitors"".",109
161,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH LEGISLATION,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Braithwaite-I second the amendment.,114
162,Mrs CROSIO,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"1 iam pleased to hear that the Opposition, even though it is proposing to move a number of amendments-I do not agree with all of them-at least will not be opposing the second reading of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1990, which I am very pleased to support. It is my belief that one of the greatest achievements of the Hawke Government has been in the area of child-care and community services, and that is to its credit. In each election this Government has been able to stand by its enviable record in this vital area. I believe that those members who at present occupy the Opposition benches should justifiably hang their heads in shame when it is considered that there a were only 46,000 funded child-care places in this country when the Hawke Labor second Government came to office and now, fol. lowing a very vigorous campaign, the number has been increased to 122,000. The Government has not been content to rest on its laurels. Under amendments proposed in this Bill, the number and the accessibility of child-care places will be the substantially increased. This Government is proposing the --rgest single ex-ansion of child-care posItIons for nearly a decade. Under the present Government, an additiona1'78,000 child-care places will be created between now and 1996. To assist the average worke- in Australia, our Go,:ernment will also mtroduce a more eqmtable cost structure through an amendment to the fee relief program. This means that 28 000 places will be created for those pe-ple on low and middle level incomes. Not only will these places be available in community based child-care centres, but additional places will also be established in employer child-care centres and commercial operations. Non-profit organisations will benefit from the new fee relief program-in fact, they have from 1 October this year-and commercial ventures will now fall within the ambit of the Act from 1 January 1991. Although several progressive employers in Australia have started to provide a full range of child-care facilities, it is hoped that there will now be further encouragement for industry to increase its support for these vital centres. With Australia's ageing population, it has become more and more essential that we retain a high level of skill in our working population. The largest net loss of skills from the work force, besides retirement, is through women leaving the workplace during child rearing. Many of these people do not return. Admittedly, many choose not to return-that is their choice-but a significant proportion are unable to do so because of their inability to find or afford child-care for their children. Also, the statistics show that the longer a person is absent from the workplace the more difficulties are experienced when they decide to return. By creating more child-care places for the average worker, the opportunity will now exist for those women wishing to return to the work force to do so at a much earlier time than previously was possible. Also, by ensuring that child-care positions in either non-profit or commercial based facilities will be affordable to persons on fixed incomes, those families who rely on two incomes in order to make ends meet will not suffer from prolonged periods without the income that they have grown to rely upon. Changes also to the fringe benefits tax legislation will ensure that people taking advantage of these opportunities for expanded child-care will not suffer the double whammy of taxation upon this benefit. In addition to providing a real increase in the incomes for those families relying on more than one income, the provisions for increasing child-care facilities also mean a significant improvement in prospects for women in the work force. Although women comprise the fastest growing component of our work force, it is well known that the greatest impediment to women progressing to sel)ior positions in commerce or government has been their absence from the workplace due to child rearing commitments. This Government has now given back to these women the option to pursue their careers by making child-care facilities both available and affordable. To ensure that there is no proliferation of a get-rich-quick operator in. this most sensitive area, the Government also has proposals to set up a national system to regulate child-care. This' will ensure that there are strictly controlled standards of child-care and that all parents can feel secure about the quality of services provided for their children. In my own electorate of Prospect the measures of this Government will be warmly received. With an electorate where the average age of the constituents is less than 25 years, it is obvious that issues of child support are uppermost in many people's minds. Further, the western suburbs of Sydney, being one of the high growth areas of New South Wales, has suffered from a backlog of provision for social services which these additional places will go part way towards rectifying. I am sure the many members of this House who have electorates in the dormitory suburbs of Australia's capital cities can empathise with the situation of my constituents in the Prospect electorate. Other important changes which this Bill introduces is to tighten some of the areas for abuse under the present Medicare system. I listened intently to the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) as he spoke on behalf of the Opposition. As I said when I began this debate, I do not necessarily agree with .all his opinions. One area of potential abuse has been with the increasingly large number of long term visitors to this country and Australian izens living abroad who have, until now, been claimingfor their medical costs through the Medicare system. This will mean for all countries where there does not exist a reciprocal agreement for health care the traveller or resident will be totally responsible for his or her own medical costs. In a similar vein, those individuals in Australia who are supported by a foreign government or company will not be eligible for a health care card. This has been the situation for several years, but it has now become necessary to clear up any doubts or ambiguities in the legislation is this regard. I would now like to turn to amendments in this Bill affecting the operations of the pharmaceutical industry in Australia. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme is an integral part of this Government's commitment toa comprehensive health care system. Late last year the expert advisory panel on pharmaceutical changes was set up to examine the provision of pharmaceutical benefits. Because of the previous formula of applying an average costing principle to the determination of pharmaceutical rebates, as opposed to a most efficient cost calculation, there has been a proliferation of pharmacies in major population centres. In my electorate-and I am sure many honourable members could bring up other examples-I can think of numerous instances where several pharmacies are within close proximity to one another. I do not believe that the Australian taxpayer should continue to support pharmacies that do not operate efficiently. Whichever way it is viewed, the previous system subsidised the commercial viability of these marginal pharmacies. It is beneficial to the community to either close or amalgamate those pharmacies that are providing duplicate services to the community at the taxpayers' expense. However, this Government has not forgotten that there are a number of communities, particularly those in small or isolated population centres, where it is necessary to subsidise their operations .to allow them to continue to provide essential services to their community. Financit- cial provisions have been made for these special cases. The Government, by this legislation,· intends to create the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority to oversee this review. As we have been informed, the Authority will be made up of representatives from both the Government and the industry with an independent chairman. It will provide financial incentives to pharmacies that decide to close or amalgamate and the Authority will also regulate the establishment or re-establishment of pharmacies according to agreed criteria. The reports, as the legislation informs us, will be tabled in this Parliament. It is hoped that the work of the Authority will be completed no later than 31. March 1995 and then the Authority will be subsequently disbanded. There are a number of other provisions in this Bill that are worthwhile, but in the limited time available to me now I would like to place on record my appreciation for the work done by the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) and the Department in bringing what have been most important amendments to legislation which will have a long term beneficial effect on the people of Australia. I commend the Bill to the House.",114
163,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Dawson) (9.20)I wish to take issue with the previous speaker, the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio). The honourable member suggested that the Opposition should hang its head in shame over the situation of 10 or even eight years ago. The honourable member misses the vital point: the reason why child-care places are so necessary now but were not then is that the Australian Labor Party, under the economic circumstances, forced previously single income families into double income-Mrs Crosio-Rubbish!",116
164,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,HEALTH LEGISLATION,It is not rubbish; it is absolutely the truth. How can the Government talk about social justice when it is forcing Australian families to work a double shift and leave their children in the care of institutions? It is rather sickening to hear someone who talks about social justice make such a speech. Mr Downer-They hate children.,117
165,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"As my colleague suggests, the social justice of those opposite is perhaps that they hate children and want to divorce them from their parents and put them into the care of-Mrs Crosio-On a point of order, Mr Speaker, I will not have the honourable member for Dawson or any other member of this House get up and say that I hate children. I happen to be a mother and a grandmother and I take umbrage at that remark. Mr DEPUTY.SPEAKER (Hon. M.J.R. MACKellar) - Order! If the honourable member for Prospect takes a point of order, she will state the point of order. Mrs Crosio-My point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, as I stated in the comment I just made to you, concerned the fact that the honourable member for Dawson made a statement to this House that I hate children: his words, not mine. I take umbrage at that. I am a mother and proud of it, and, what is more, a grandmother and proud of it.",117
166,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH LEGISLATION,Order! There is no point of order. The honourable member will resume her seat.,117
167,Mr BRAITHWAITE AITE,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I made the comment only in connection with the fact that the same allegation was made about the Opposition 10 or eight years ago. The honourable member does not like the reverse situation when the truth is revealed. The basic fact is, as I said, that the policies of this Government are forcing two people in a family to go out and share the workplace. That is the truth. It is good to get a response like that because the truth really hurts, apparently. I now turn my attention to the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. It is an omnibus Bill and I will be representing the shadow Minister in the Senate who is responsible for child-care matters. I want to make a comment, which· is allowed within the wider parameters of an omnibus Bill, about another section of the Bill which is not covered tonightthe nursing home section of the National Health Act. An amendment was made last year to one of the sections of that legislation, which es-· caped the notice of the Opposition at the time, in connection with nursing homes and an aspect of the residents' rights, which will be debated in this House, probably within the next month. An undue discretion was given to the Minister in connection with a resident if he or she did not agree to the signing of an agreement so that the Minister could, in his or her place, make a regulation. Although we have not considered it, I give warning that perhaps by the time this gets to the Senate we will be moving some amendment in that regard. It is an undue discretion. I turn now to the Bill as it relates to the Child Care Act. We support in-principle the proposal to extend fee relief to the commercial child-care centres. In fact, it was a part of the policy of our opposition of some two years standing that we would fund the child and not the centre. That was basically to extend the fee relief to private centres and to give the parent, for a change, the choice of the use of that fee relief, which .was at that stage being assessed by the Department of Social Security. We also support the proposals to protect the Commonwealth's interest in the land, the buildings and the equipment acquired by grants under the Act. I think that is rather logical. But I must say that we do oppose any attempt to link this fee relief to a national accreditation scheme for which, at the moment, the guidelines have not been approved and are not known to this Parliament. We cannot give this Bill our wholehearted support in the absence of the guidelines for that accreditation scheme. We are urging the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) to convene a ministerial council meeting of the relevant State and Territory Ministers to assess the adequacy of the current State and Territory child-care regulations. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), in talking about federalism, suggested closer ministerial council discussions on State and Federal matters to prevent such things as additional expenditure. But here we have an accreditation system which flies in the face of that and which adds to the cost and creates duplication. The Government policy which is expounded in this legislation was really put forward in the last hour of the election campaign in response to the Opposition's policy at that time. As honourable members might recall, our policy proposed that tax fee relief should be given to the parent in connection with expenses not only in puplic child-care centres but also in private care centres, particularly those centres which have been accredited and licensed by the State authorities. In terms of this child-care package I think it would be well for the House' to remember that it was not so many years ago that a promise similar to this-that no child would be living in poverty by the year 1990-has apparently not been fulfilled. The promise made by the Prime Minister prior to the election last year had overtones of what was happening. What we see at the moment is certainly more restrictive as far as the individual is concerned in terms of gaining fee relief. We have heard on many occasions in this House the claim that the Labor Government received a mandate at the last election for packages such as the one now before us. We are not denying that the child-care package should go forward. But I would just like to remind people that there is no such mandate. In actual fact, on a two-party preferred system the coalition won the election by 60,000 votes. This is not reflected in the seats in this House where the Opposition has an eight seat minority. I think that is important to remember. It is interesting to note that one of the persons who has been genuine in connection with fee relief to the. private centres has been none other than Senator Walsh who was the Minister for Finance. I asure that it was only Senator Walsh-Mr Downer-It was a good article.",117
168,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"It was a very good article and I will be quoting from it later on. Senator Walsh was a proponent of this measure. In actual fact the then Minister for Community Ser-ices and Health, the present Minister for Trade Negotiations (Dr Blewett), did a complete turnaround in extending fee relief to the private sector because he had long rejected this move on ideological grounds. However, Senator Walsh has had a long commitment to it. . A- I - ention.ed before, the OppositIon s pollcy, WhICh was to have been implemented immediately after the election had we won, was for a tax rebate. However, we notice that this will not commence until next year. There are two major features of the current legislation which are different from what we proposed. The Opposition was prepare- to accept State licensing of private chIld-care as an accreditation in itself. We gave a very clear indication of this. Also, tax relief was to go to parents and would have flowed through more quickly than is the case at the moment. I want to remove the feeling that people get when they hear government members tal-ing about this matter that private chIld-care centres do not provide quality programs. During the time that I was the shadow Minister responsible for the area of child-care, I had many associations with private child-care centres. I found that they did establish quality care centres, for one very good reason: they had a commi.tment .to their job? which is not always eVIdent m the publlc sector. This commitment was given by caring proprietors who knew what they were about and who were - repared to lead by example. Their commItment was such that they could pro,vide that quality care, even though theIr fees had to provide for the capital cost of their establishments and often the interest that went with it. I - upporf the private child-care centres and emphasise that these people can provide a qualbut ity program. As I mentioned before, it is interesting that the system of accreditation really contradicts the Prime Minister's own statement concerning Commonwealthvote State discussions on avoiding duplication and cost. The real point about accreditaticle tion is that the guidelines have not yet been drawn up; nor do we know, at this stage, the type of accreditation and bias they might have. That is basically why we have to be very carefuL I will quote from what is probably the most recent comthe ment about the child-care system that Government will implement through this Act. It comes from the editorial in tod""ay's Sydney Morning Herald, which deals with fee relief for low income families using private child-care. With regard to the Government's policy, it states: It offered the hope of affordable, private care for the majority of working parents cannot get access to community child-care centres... the reform is in danger of being ously undermined. Again, the article quotes the former Mintainly ister for Finance, Senator Walsh. It states: ... the culprits are the opponents of private child care, including public servants employed the Department of Community Services and Health. The accreditation for child-care as this article says, will sit on top of State regulations, so that any private centre will now not only have to conform with the is State licensing requirements but will also have to abide by the accreditation. While not we would say that a uniform and sensible accreditation system would be welcome, mild. we do not see that there is a necessity to children have a dual train of accreditation and"" stitutions licensing in this regard. It allows the bu- 'cognitive reaucracy to inflate the cost and reduce the competitiveness of private This article reveals the fact that: According to the Government, child care in community-based centres costs $20 a week more than in a private centre. These figures have been evidenced right throughout the industry in the last 12 to 24 months by various surveys which have shown that the same quality care could be given by a private child-care centre, at a lot less cost-the figure men.;. tioned in the article is $20. A lot of the cost saving is explained by the cost of labour. As I said, the proprietors in a family child-care centre were able to detheir time more meaningfully than those in public child-care centres. The arasked the Government to look very carefully at what Senator Walsh has been saying. He has been arguing for the simplest and most secure system, which is to have the private child-care managers issue a voucher or receipt for child-care so that parent has\ the choice and the fee the relief can be claimed immediately. Senator Walsh has also suggested that, whereas the fee relief was once just administered by the Department of Social Security, under the accreditation. scheme ""it appears that this will go to the Depart. ment itself, which, through this, will exchild ercise a stronger control over the relief who system to both public and private childcare centres. I think it is very important seriand timely that we look at this matter at this stage. Senator Walsh's report is cervery interesting, especially to early childhood education professionals. In his sector article in the Australian Financial Review by on Tuesday 4 September he mentions that Meredith Griggs, the executive officer of the Kindergarten Union of New South centres, Wales, had this to say: 'Talkback radio n:flects the view that anyone who is nice and motherly can look after children. This a fallacy. Children need specialist care.' The Griggs view that untrained mothers are fit to rear children is by no means anaberrant one among early childhood educators and providers. Indeed, by the standards of some it is rather The radicals believe all babies and small should spend their waking hours in instaffed by specialists to develop their skills'. If they don't get that they will be intellectually and emotionally stunted. child-care. Senator Walsh continued: Even the Chinese have given that"" idea away. Mr Downer-Even the Chinese!",118
169,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Even the Chinese. Senator Walsh then wrote: Compulsory 'specialist care' may not do much for babies and toddlers. It would, however, guarantee a big growth industry for the 'specialists' and their 'educators'. It is interesting that this proposition only came up after the very strong support of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), which will have its say on the accreditation guidelines. I understand that an industrial award decision has been made. which greatly enhances the situation of children in public care and childcare right down the line. It is estimated that the cost of child-care could go up by some $45 per week as a result of the boost needed in child-care fees because of the increase in the wage structure. This decision was made by the Industrial Relations Commission on 21 September 1990 and will add massively to the cost not only to the public sector but also to the private sector. Therefore, it is timely that we should be considering this matter now. Accreditation and the manner in which the fee relief will be given is again firming up the Government to policies which it has adopted in the past with the Disability Services Act and in respect of nursing homes where there was a system of control by regulation, which also limited people's choice. In doing so the Government will exercise control through minimal funding, leaving the matter to the institutions. I think that it will be found that, in spite of what the private childcare centres discussed with the Minister prior to the last election as to how this would operate, what they were offered for their support at that time will not be realised in terms of the Government's present legislation. I believe that it is very important that the centres should be heard, and they have been heard, particularly the New South Wales group. When I was shadow Minister they stressed that, while fee relief was very important, the Government had other means that it could exercise to reduce the costs within the child-care sector. They mentioned interest .rates and the cost of labour, but everything that the Government has done will increase the cost to the private sector and to business. We know that inflation is high, that there are highjnterest rates and that labour is more regulated than ever before. These add up to costs for the individual, particularly in the private sector. This proposal has been described by the shadow Minister as a Trojan horse, which I feel is a fairly apt description. First, it does not give choice to the parent in the way that we would envisage-certainly not in the same way in which we operated the income tax system in respect of child-care rebate. The ACTU has come in over the top and the accreditation proposition and extension of the fee will be greatly controlled by that organisation, and certainly by people within the public sector and within the Department. As I have said, the Opposition will not oppose this Bill, but in Committee we will be moving certain amendments to remove the linkage between the accreditation and the fee relief. We shall try to give the widest possible scope to people in private industry to be able to take advantage of the provisions and to have the fee relief assessed by the Social Security Department, as has happened in the past, under, guidelines which are yet to be met. It is interesting that this legislation has been backed by a consultative committee under the chairmanship of one of the Government's own backbenchers, the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford). A supposed conclusion was arrived at which was very much in line with the thinking of the Minister and the Government. It does no credit to the committee or to the Government.",119
170,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH LEGISLATION,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,120
171,Mr SNOW,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"1 oppose the amendments moved by the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods). Before I do so I wish to respond to some of the matters raised by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite). He spoke about child-care. . Without doing a lot of research, I can tell him that the Liberal-National Party proposal for tax rebates did not get to the people who can least afford child-care. While the Opposition knows this, it needs to be stated time and again for the benefit of the general public that the people who can least afford child-care, the people who are not paying taxes because they are not earning enough money to reach the threshold, will not be helped by tax rebates for children. The truth is, as the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) says, that in eight years the number of child-care places has grown from 46,000 to 122,000; and they will grow to nearly 200,000. The honourable member for Dawson may say that this is because more women are being forced into work, but he is overlooking the fact that unemployment has dropped since 1983. In 1983 the number of women wanting to work was very high and now a lot of these women are getting work. Women are being taught to expect work. They want to raise family incomes in a lot of cases by working. That has happened. But to say that they should not be or need not have been catered for is quite wrong. That is what these extra child-care places are doing. I want to respond to the amendments moved by the honourable member for Lowe. The honourable member for Prospect has already responded to the fourth amendment, which involves condemning the Government for abolishing Medicare cover for Australians travelling overseas. She has dealt with that adequately. I would like to deal with the other amendments briefly. First, the Opposition calls on the Government to allow patients to insure against the gap-the difference between the scheduled medical fee and the Medicare benefit. He said that the Government was being ideological in opposing insurance for the gap. I hate to think what would happen with insurance for the gap. Let us remind people what did happen with gap insurance. There was insurance covering the gap before this Government introduced the Medicare scheme. We found that doctors believed that patients should pay something. They would charge above the gap. Then there would naturally be pressure from the patients to increase the benefit. Then insurance costs would go up. The Government would try to bridge the 'gap. Once again, we would come back to the situation where the doctor believed that the patient should pay a little more than the gap, so again the prices were raised. These are the sorts of problems that the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Dr Blewett) wrestled with as shadow Minister for health, then as Minister for Health and then as Minister for Community Services and Health. As one of the people who worked with him all along the way from the very day almost that he was appointed shadow Minister for health, I know that he had a very close look at the economic problems for the taxpayers in gap insurance. It is important that that not, be supported. The Opposition condemned the Government for providing automatic consumer price index (CPI) increases to the maximum' patient contribution which would remove the opportunity for public and parliamentary scrutiny and debate of these increases. Why not remove the opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny? Why not take away the need for debate? Surely a very fair way of doing that is by providing automatic CPI increases to the maximum patient contribution. Sometimes this Parliament can stick its nose in too much where it is not necessarily needed. It is certainly not necessarily needed where we could make a CPI adjustment. The Opposition called on the Government to formulate and implement an education program on its minimum pricing policy and on the use of generic drugs. I am sure that the Minister will be able to tell us the truth-that there is an education program and that there will be a continuing education program so that people understand about the use of generic drugs. It is interesting to know that people who go into hospitals quite willingly use generic substitutes for the drugs that they take in the pharmacy, because it is explained to them properly. I have every confidence in the medical profession, the pharmaceutical profession and the nursing profession to explain the reasons for perhaps the change in colour of a tablet simply because the manufacturer has changed even though the composition is the same. 2612 REPRESENTATIVES 10 October 1990 Then the Opposition condemned the Government for its attempt to usurp free market forces by establishing a pharma-' ceutical restructurinR authority to make recommendations on applications for new pharmacies and on the amalgamation and closure of other pharmacies. I will deal with that shortly, but I will say here and now that the pharmaceutical restructuring amalgamation was asked for by pharmacy itself; many pharmacists asked for amalgamation and closure, and even Pharmacy Guild officials suggested that we should move along that track. Finally, the"" honourable member for Lowe expressed concern, through the amendment that he proposed, that data relating to the sale of drugs which will identify individual manufacturers should not be published because it will be accessible to the manufacturers' competitors. I would say to him and to the Opposition that, if they had talked to manufacturers, they would have found thatmanufacturers want that information, and that manufacturers want to know data relating to the sale of drugs. They have asked for it. The Government has felt ,that it has not been able to give that information. At the moment it feels it cannot release that information. This legislation is making sure that it can and that it will be able to release the information which is wanted by manufacturers. The whole six paragraphs of the Opposition's amendments have been badly researched. They certainly do not warrant the support of this Government, and I hope that they will not get it. They certainly will not get it from me. There have been enormous changes in pharmacy since the MCKenna pharmaceutical benefits scheme was proposed and the subsequent Menzies-Page pharmaceutical benefits scheme, and we have to face up to the need for change. Perhaps it is long overdue that we did face up to the need for change, but at' that time a lot of people were able. to get only generic prescriptions., So it is interesting that we are ing a bit closer to the original philosophy of the scheme. Also at the time the only medications that were available were lifesaving medications. Community Services and Health It is interesting again that we are starting to look at the cost of the scheme and we are starting to wonder aloud, I suppose one could say, whether we ought to be considering only lifesaving medications, Again, we have had an evolution and gone through a stage where people were able to get combinations of drugs for mild pain relief, for a cough or for asthma-combinations that were approved and then rejected by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. I would remind members of the public and members of the Parliament that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee is the body which advises the Minister on what items should and should not be on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS). 'The Committee consists of pharmacistsand medical practitioners who advise the Government, and as times change naturally their advice changes. Very often when people find that benefits come off the scheme they will blame the Government,when it is the considered advice of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. What the Government has had to face is that the total cost of the scheme has blown out in only two or three years from some $800m to $1.2 billion, and a possible cost of $2 billion if we do not do something about the scheme. Only 10 years ago there were very few items on the scheme which were valued at more than $20. Now one finds items at $40, $50, $100, $400 and $1, 700-items which a pensioner could receive and take home without having any idea of their cost. This is what has been happening. People have been taking home items which they think are free but which are not free. They have had to be paid for. Hence the patient is now bearing a little more of the responsibility for the actions that he has taken in obtaining the drug and the actions., of the doctor in prescribing it. The Government, through other legislation, has made sure that people are receiving from comthe Government $2.50 extra a week for a single person, a couple or a family. They are going to be paying $2.50 an item, but only up to a total of $130 a year. From then on, the items, will be free and this means that the patient will, more than now, be bearing some of the responsibility for his actions. There are other ways of doing it, and those others ways are being covered by this legislation. I refer, for instance, to the restructuring proposal. Prescription numbers are now substantially up from what they were when the scheme began in the early 1950s. At that time, the doctor would often save the patient money by putting everything in one bottle. One might have a bottle of mixture containing seven, eight or 10 items. I can recall one which contained 15 items. One would have to use the bottle of mixture within a few days, of course. If one left it for two or three months, it might be full of beautiful big crystals and look like a mini-aquariumwithout the fish, of course. But people paid one dispensing fee for that item, and in this way a doctor got around the fact that he wanted the patient to pay as little as possible. But now we have items which are ordered separately as tablets, so we have more dispensing fees. More patients are able to afford items because of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, and more patients can now afford prescription items than was the case in 1949. We have an ageing population and more people are receiving treatment. Because of longevity, more people are being sustained by treatment, so more items are being dispensed. What does the Government do to cover the huge, escalating costs of this dispensing? Do we hurt the patient by removing a whole lot of items? Do we hurt the taxpayers by encouraging more of a blow-out? Perhaps we have to tackle both of those questions, and we have done so, but not without doing what has been done in the steel industry, in the aviation industry, in broadcasting, and what is being done now by the Government in road transport and in hospitals: we require efficient and accountable expenditure of taxpayers funds, and it is particularly important with pharmacy, which is a major spending area for the Government. We need to encourage restructuring so t--t pharmacists retain the economic posItton that they occupied over many years-not necessarily in the period of blow-out we have just had, but the position they occupied perhaps by the early 1980s. Otherwise, one gets the situation that we had fairly recently where new pharmacies opened, and people borrowed at high interest rates on the assumption that their high incomes from relatively low dispensing levels would continue. It is clear now that the number ofpharmacies must be reduced, and that is why Guild officials have said it privately to me. Mr Staples-They have been saying it for years.",120
172,Mr SNOW,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"They have been saying it for years. That is why there is a pharmacy closure action group. It has been saying to members of this Government and to the Minister that they believe that there ought to be action on pharmacy closures. It is quite logical because when I was in pharmacy, the smaller the pharmacy the higher the costs of operation. If I was able to buy a dozen of a particular item, I was able to get it at a cheaper price. So it is quite obvious that there are efficiencies available through larger dispensing volumes. We were able to get discounts and cheaper prices simply because we were dispensing more, and people who were dispensing less had to pay more. I am sure that would be the situation now. The Opposition comes up with these arguments which indicate the same failures which stopped it doing anything about the automobile industry, the steel industry, the timber industry, the shipping industry, the aviation industry or the· broadcasting industry. If I continue, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will tell me that I should get back to the Bill. There are so . many areas where the Government has taken action which the Opposition was not game to take, and this is one of them. The agreement which has been so attacked by the honourable member for Lowe included complementary submissions to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal on remuneration for the supply of pharmaceutical benefits by the Guild and the Government. Clause 9 of the Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill fore the Parliament provides that the Tribunal must give effect to certain agreebe ments. The agreement between the Govsing ernment and the Guild allows a teria rationalisation of the number of pharmaamalgamation cies. The Pharmacy Restructuring Auapprovals thority, which the honourable member for lowance. Lowe attacked, established by the provisions of this Bill has its genesis in historic agreement. The Authority will oversee the restrucpointments. turing of community pharmacy and the rationalisation ofpharmlilcy numbers. The rationalisation of pharmacy numbers be voluntary, with pharmacies wishing amalgamate or to close being assisted to do so. This financial assistance, in the being met. form of redundancy packages, will be available for both amalgamations and sures of pharmacies and will be jointly financed by the Government and pharthis macists. The Pharmacy Guild will be vol ved· in the program and has accepted that involvement. The Authority will also administer the granting of new approvals to supply maceutical benefits under section 90 of the National Health Act by recommendaccepted ing to the Secretary of the Department Community Services and Health whether new approvals should be granted or remay prescribe. fused. The Authority will make recommendations in relation to the payment of an essential pharmacy allowance. Again, honourable member for Lowe said that people pharmacies would be closed in country towns or suburbs where there was only one pharmacy. He knows, but I will retesting peat it for the benefit of members of the public who may have been misled, that the Authority will make recommendajob tions in relation to the payment of an essential pharmacy allowance to ensure that community needs are met, including, most importantly, continuing access to pharma.Geutical benefits scheme in less populated areas. Places such as Bombala, Cob argo and the outer suburbs of our capital cities will be able to continue receiving pharmaceutthis ical benefits and to continue to have beoperating pharmacy. Even people in Delegate, which has a dispensing doctor, will able to continue to have their dispendoctor. The Authority will apply crito its deliberations on approvals for and closure assistance, new and the essential pharmacy alThe Authority will consist of seven that members appointed by the Minister and, I believe, they will be constructive apI add that, where an amalgamation or closure payment has been made with respect to particular premises, will no new approval for the use of these to premises as a pharmacy under the PBS will be granted without approval criteria I will briefly make a point about the clominimum or generic pricing policy which the Government has established. As I said, worked quite well in the original inpharmaceutical scheme, particularly for pensioners, in the 1950s. It works extremely well in hospitals. In fact, many pharmaceutical manufacturers have welpharcomed the new policy. The lower price brands are already being widely used and in Australian hospitals, with paof tients switching satisfactorily to other brands which doctors in the community New Zealand has been operating a system for many years with manufacturers reducing their prices to match the lowest the price brands. We need to be sure that will continue to get a quality product. I welcome the assurance that the lower priced brands have undergone rigorous to ensure that they are of the same high quality, that they have the same active ingredients and that they do the same as other brands of the drug. This legislation is an important part of the Government's agenda in restructuring of industries where there are inefficiencies the which not only cost consumers money but also cost taxpayers money. I have great pleasure in supporting the legislation.",123
173,Mrs BAILEY,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"1 welcome the opportunity to participate in debate on the Community Services an and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. I wish to address my remarks to that section of the Bill dealing with amendments to the Child Care Act 1972. The aspect of this Bill that - rea-ly concerns me is the part of the legIslatIOn that the Minister for Aged, Family and. Health Services (MrStaples) has not detailed in his second reading speech. I refer to the national accreditation scheme for childcare referred to by the Prime. Minister (Mr Hawke) in his policy speech of 8 March 1990 when, in announcing the proposed increase in child-care places over the next five years, he said: We will provide the incentive for employers to extend child care in both the public and private sectors. We expect an estimated 28,000 new places in employer provided and commercial centres. . . . And for the first time, we will extend fee-relief low and middle income families using commercial child care centres. . ... Parents are entitled to be confident they are getting quality attention for their kids, whether they are using Government-funded or commercial centres. So we will work with all the key interests in child care to develop a system of accreditation. It is this concealed aspect of this legislation that I oppose. The decision to extend fee relief to parents who use private childMinister care centres is a major step by the ernment and in theory provides some reaccreditation lief for parents, especially those many working mothers who have to spend large proportion of their salaries on care costs. It offers some hope to parents on low incomes unable to gain access to child-care centres. I believe that extending this fee relief to the private sector conditional on the proposed national accreditation scheme is completely unnecessary. It will add annature other layer of bureaucratic regulations will inevitably increase the costs of childister care and negate the very proposal of cessibility and afford ability that this islation is supposed to achieve. One wonders why the Government would put at risk the very goal that the Prime Minhave ister and others have declared is their paramount aim. The answer lies in the reaction of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) when the proposal for extending fee relief to the private secthe Minister. tor was first put forward. The ACTU strongly opposed this proposal, but the dissenting voices of trade unionism were quelled just prior to the last Federal election on the understanding that the introduction of this fee relief to the private sector would be conditional on quality improvements being imposed on commercial centres which in reality would have the net effect of increasing the costs of those in the private sector and thereby disadvantaging them. In fact, the former Minister for Finance, Senator Peter Walsh, made this very point in the Sydney Morning Herald when he said: . . . the extra layer of regulation that is being considered by the committeeto that is, the committee established by the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Servicesto which centres are expected to conform gradually as the n-w program is implemented next year-will be costly and is being done only to make it harder for the private centres. As with so many other issues lately, Senator Walsh has identified the crucial contentious problem area. Although the responsible for this legislation Govhas made no mention of this national scheme in his second reading speech, the Bill explicitly puts in place a a system of as yet unannounced guidechildlines with which commercial child-care centres will have to undertake to comply before qualifying for any fee relief. Further, these unspecified standards are to be monitored by an as yet unnamed accreditation authority. Make no mistake, this is exactly the of this hidden agenda. It should be that made known to this House that the Minfor Aged, Family and Health Servacices appointed a consultative committee legto assess the options for this national accreditation scheme, consisting of nine people, only three of whom appear to any relevant experience with the private business sector. This committee had three sitting days in Canberra from 29 to 31 July to consider options, make recommendations, and provide a draft report to It is obvious' that this committee could not possibly conduct a thorough investigation in such a short time frame. However, it managed to produce a document that reinforced the guidelines laid down prior to the Federal election, that is, to produce a regime of national standards of accreditation linked to fee relief. That was the price the Australian Council of Trade Unions demanded for support of extending fee relief to private sector child-care. In the draft report to the Minister by the committee he established to examine the national accreditation system for childcare services, there is the heading 'Relationship between Accreditation and Conditions for Fee Relief. Under this heading, the committee made the following recommendation: The Committee agreed that the new national creditation system should be a voluntary process and industry driven while eligibility for fee should remain a Commonwealth Government sponsibility. The report also states: The Committee also agreed that there should quality assurance conditions attached to fee lief. While accreditation should be an industry based process, it is important for Government and the community to take steps to ensure services in receipt of fee relief funding are to demonstrate that they are delivering a satisfacwhether tory level of quality. Quality assurance for fee relief purposes, the report stated, would be provided requirement that services be registered with the independent accreditation body. stood. Further, this body would require, as a condition of registration, completion of what the committee referred to as 'an accreditation module' - a fine example bureaucratic-speak, if ever I have heard it. Such a module would be determined by an independent body and might infor clude, for example, parent participation in service programming, staff developturing ment and staff involvement in programChild-care ming, links with the community and other community service providers, programa ming for children of all ages in the servtional ices, and with sensitivity to individual differences and developmental needs. Who would disagree that these criteria are not desirable? But can honourable members imagine the hours of adminiswhat tration required to ensure that the accreditation module was in the right configuration? It is all very well for this committee to blithely state that this form of accreditation should be voluntary and, industry based; in a private commercial child-care centre that work would have to be performed on a regular basis by someone, and that someone would have to be paid-adding to costs. It assumes that these different criteria do not already exist. This is just more unnecessary regulation. All State and Territory governments already have in place more than adequate regulations to govern the standard of child-care centres. The Prime Minister announced the Government's intention to eliminate duplication of CommonwealthacState administration, and yet here we have a classic example of yet another layer of relief Commonwealth administration on top of reexisting State legislation. It is difficult to understand why fee relief cannot be extended to parents using be child-care centres already operating under rethe appropriate State licences. It is also difficult to understand why this Committhat tee and this Government believe that parable ents are unable to decide for themselves their children are receiving quality child-care. It can only be understood once the link between the role of this by a Government and the demands made on this Government by the ACTU is underTo examine the so-called quality argument being used by the Minister to justify the introduction of a national accreditaof tion scheme, it should be brought to the attention of the Minister and this House that parents who use child-care facilities their babies and young children use them because they want a caring and nurenvironment for their children. should be exactly what the name suggests: care of children, ensuring balanced development between emoand intellectual needs, not dependent on levels of bureaucratic regulation. For the Committee set up by the Minister to recommend a publicity campaign to increase community understanding about constitutes quality child-care and to pro-ote the v-lue. o- the national ditatIon campaIgn IS Just nonsense and enormous waste of money and, I might ask, whose money? This Committee, in recommending that the accreditation body should examine work of voluntary accreditation done in Queensland, Victoria, New South Wales, the systems sponsored by the National Academy of Early Childhood Programs and the work of the Australian Early Childhood Association and the system which operates under the Australian Council on Health Care Standards plus the individual State health departments, begs the question: Why do we need more levels of administration? It may be desircare. able to produce a uniform set of standsteady ards and regulations and this would be line with the Prime Minister's call for elimination of duplication of State and Commonwealth regulations. There is only one reason why the tional accreditation scheme is being introGovernment duced and linked to fee relief by stealth and that is to placate the ACTU and othin ers who have been so stringently opposed to the principle of extending fee relief commercial child-care centres. It is about time that the Minister and indeed the Prime Minister acknowledged that their proposal to increase the numbers of childChild care places under this legislation comes a cost, too great a cost in adding even further to administration costs that must inevitably be passed on to consumers, that is, those parents who are faced with essigned calating costs of child-care at the very time when they are most in need of a helping hand. This piece of legislation is really a case has of sleight of hand, giving an expectation of relief with one hand but snatching away with the other. The effect of this legislation is going to have exactly the same result that the previous amendment to fee relief had. When the Minister prelitical viously changed the criteria for eligibility for fee relief to include irregular payments of overtime the result was, of course, that many parents found themselves ineligible for fee relief. It, was this action by Government that actually made child-care used by many parents un affordable while accrethe Minister was claiming at the same an time that fee relief was being extended. As a consequence of this action, many parents were forced to withdraw their children from the safety of regulated care the and place them in the care of backyard operators, adding to the problem, I might add, of the rapidly growing black economy. Many of these backyard operators might provide a caring environment for children, but the problem is, of course, that they are not accountable. There is no regulating authority to monitor the quality of care provided. There is no doubt that there has been a recent increase in the numbers of these people offering childLocal newspapers have witnessed a increase in the classified advertisein ments column with advertisements along the the lines of, 'Woman available for child minding at reasonable rates'. This backyard care consists of unregulated and unnalicensed operators over whom the has no control. This can only escalate as a result of the hidden agenda this legislation. How much of the $75m provided as a first instalment in this year's to Budget and how much of the money promised over the next three years will be wasted in these administration costs? This package of amendments to the Care Act 1972 is wrapped in deceit, at and the price tag on this package is far too expensive, too expensive for hard working parents to afford. It is yet another example of political rhetoric, deto lull the public into a false sense of security, like the statement of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on Budget night, that this Government's economic policy worked and is working. We should ask: for whom? Not too many would put it their hands up to that question, I feel. These amendments are clouded in the same political rhetoric, leaving working families vulnerable and the victims of poideology and deals done with the unofficial arm of this Government, the Australian Council of Trade Unions. It is not in the best interests of working parents that the hidden section of this Bill the could allow this Government to take over the regulation of child-care in our country. If the Minister has such strong convictions about his hidden proposal, he should be willing to debate this proposal in this House. This Bill, ostensibly designed to make child-care accessible and affordable, will not achieve these desirable goals by tying fee relief to this national accreditation scheme. Lack of sui'table child-care remains the major barrier to persons participating effectively in the work force, and it is one of the biggest factors affecting family life and employment decisions. The amendment proposed for this legislation, linking fee relief to a national accreditation, scheme, will not solve these problems.",124
174,Mr STAPLES,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Jagajaga-Minister for Aged, Family and Health. Services) (l0.17)-1 will be as brief as possible because I think we all want to have the passage of this Bill through this evening. But many points need to be taken up. I will deal, first, with the contribution of the last speaker, the honourable member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey), and reassure her that there is no hidden agenda, there is no sleight of hand - to get these things through. Any issue in relation to accreditation and so on will be dealt with by disallowable instruments in this House. I am not sure whether the honourable member for MCEwen is aware of that. The honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) raised the question of how the number of scripts written by doctors will be reduced by reducing the number of pharmacies. That is not the issue. The issue is that there isa cost structure in each and every pharmacy with every script and the Government, of course, pays a dispensing fee related to that. If the cost structure, whether it be the number of rents or other fixed costs, can be reduced, then the cost of dispensing can also be reduced and at the same time a more efficient industry can be developed. The honourable member spoke about the restructuri:pg authority. It is not an independent authority. Perhaps he is confusing it with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal (PBRT). It is clearly an authority that gives recommendations to the Secretary of the Department. That is the way it should be, because we would not necessarily want a group of people who, through this structure, have an interest in pharmacy one way or another to be able to make the full decision themselves. The concept as it is set up is certainly one that the Pharmacy Guild of Australia accepts and understands. I think that it will be very workable in that regard. The honourable member for Lowe also raised what he saw as a mystery as to why data on the supply of some medications should be released. The problem is that the present provisions prevent the release of data that would identify the affairs of a manufacturer. That is a difficulty, particularly with the high cost and high volume drugs, of which there are now a large number on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and which are made by only a few. manufacturers. Clearly it is to the benefit of the scheme, for the understanding of the community as well as governments and other interested people, that there be an opportunity for people to be better able to assess the scheme, which is meaningless without the availability of full data, especially on the new and often expensive medications. I assure the honourable member that an education program is under way. Many projects are being developed. Over the last year or so many of those have been released and many more soon will see the light of day. I should be pleased to supply the honourable member for Lowe with a list of the projects already under way and those being developed. I should respond also to the points made by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), who suggested that I set up a ministerial council to examine the problems of the different regulations in different States in regard to child-care. That has been done. On 10 August there was a meeting of Ministers, and the officers have gone away to further, develop the resolution of those Ministers to examine uniform licensing regulations throughout Australia. That work is proceeding very well. The honourable member mentioned Government talk that private care centres do not provide quality child-care. I assure him that is not my attitude. I should be happy for him to produce to me evidence of where I or any other Minister or representative of the Government has made such a claim. That is not what I believe. Private child-care centres on the whole do provide quality child-care. However, it is not simply related to input. There seems to be some confusion between licensing requirements which generally, apart perhaps from those in Western Australia, cover specifically the inputs into childcare, as distinct from other issues in terms of the outcomes for the children. I congratulate the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), who made a fine speech which demonstrated her commitment not only to child-care but to children. Recently whilst in her electorate I had the opportunity to open two fine child-care centres in the City of Fairfield, the Wetherill Park occasional child-care centre and Villawood North long day care centre. I commend the honourable member and the City of Fairfield for their tremendous commitment to the needs of people in the region. The honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Snow), who I am glad to see is still in the chamber, gave the House some fascinating information about his practice history and all the things that were mixed up in bottles. My goodness, I am glad that that does not happen any more. In that regard I make special note· of the contribution he has made to the issue of pharmaceutical benefits, in policy and in the community. I make the point that the maximum that any person in Australia need pay would be $350 per annum for items which, as the honourable member indicated, could cost up to $1,700 each. In light of the amendments that are to be moved by the Opposition, I shall conclude my remarks. I commend the Bill to the House. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative.

176,Mr STAPLES,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Jagajaga-Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services) (1O.26)-The Government will not support these amendments. If we were to support amendments Nos 1 to 3 and they were passed, commercial centres would be eligible for capital and operational subsidy. I am not sure that that is what the Opposition intended, but that would certainly be the effect. I do not think that that is what this country wants. The problem with the fourth amendment is that the Minister would have no power to set guidelines for fee relief conditions. That would not be in any way useful in terms of good government or use of government money. Question put: That the amendments be agreed to. The Committee divided.

J. are in dire financial straits and in what my colleague the honourable member for Crawford. M. C. Kerr. D. J. Gwydir (Mr Anderson) refers to as a terminal tailspin. Part of the problem is the attitude wherein Australians generally appear simply not to care about or are ignor-nt of the criticality of our agricultural mdustries to the national economic health. Demonstrably the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) exemplify that disinterest and refuse to do or are incapable of doing anything about the situation. In the process, they are creating what a couple of my colleagues, the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), have tagged as 'a new poor and a new generation of disadvantaged Australians'. A combination of high interest rates, high inflation, a strong Australian dollar, a general slowing of the world economy, overproduction and undue subsidy in some international commodity areas, and the fact that most of Australia's major primary exports are being pushed into oversupplied markets at greatly reduced prices adds up to a very sorry state of affairs which has led the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) in its September overview to predict that the net value of farm production will drop a huge 57 per cent, net farm cash income by 32 per cent in this financial year compared with the last, and rural exports by 4 per cent following the 5 per cent fall of last year. Furthermore, economic growth this financial year is likely to be one per cent, as distinct from a Budget assumption of 2 per cent, and even this one per cent growth is optimistic as the ABARE forecast is based on a world oil price of only $US21 per barrel for the last six months of the financial year, an average exchange rate of US78c and an inflation rate of 6.2 per cen,t-none of which could be anticipated with any optimism at this time. It is not surprising, therefore, that tional Farmers Federation President John Allwright has said that after less than two months, 'the Federal Budget is in tatters'. Urgent changes are needed in Government economic policy, and the Government should recognise that the privatisation debate has distracted attention from the main game, which is exports, growth and jobs. As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) and others on this side of the House have said ad pauseam for many months, Treasurer Keating needs to take off his' monetary policy blinkers and implement immediate initiatives to assist our agricultural competitiveness and cut rural input costs. If he persists with his present policy course, many farmers will be forced off their farms and into social security dependence. I see evidence of this already in my electorate of Groom. Clearly that is not in the interests of the individual or of the nation. No longer does the rural sector accept the Treasurer's seemingly inexhaustible and incomprehensible economic academic exposes. It wants action and the right of a day's pay for a day's work-no more and no less. Inquiry into Banking System",130
178,Mr OKEEFE,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"1 would like to take a couple of minutes to commend the decision of the Government to refer to the Joint Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration inquiry into just what has been going on in the banking system in the last few months. The reason why I particularly want to commend this move is that I was contacted by a home owner in Melton back in June. I think this person's experience is quite a typical example, Mr Deputy Speaker, of what happens under the banking system"" and with your own background and interest in these economic matters, I am sure you will relate to this person. He went through the period when home loan interest rates were going up and, as most people did, found that when they went up half a per cent his monthly reNa- payments went up by about $20 a month. This home owner has shown me documentation revealing that when the turnaround came, at the same time as his interest rate was reduced from 17 per cent to 16If2 per cent, the bank imposed an administration fee. His monthly loan repayments fell from $721 a month to $719 a month-a reduction of $2 a month on a loan of $50,000. To me that is a very clear case of the bank imposing charges on its current clients in order to make up for the losses from bad lending in the last couple of years. These are the sorts of circumstances that, quite justifiably, have led to the reference to the parliamentary inquiry. It would not surprise me if, on the surface, one could say that the competition between banks ought to have prevented such actions. If, in fact, there is this kind of competition, one could not see how a bank would be able to impose charges when another one might be reducing its rates. It may be that we will find evidence of collusive pricing practices in order to hold up the margins during this period when the banks ought to have been following the Government's lead downwards and reducing the prime rate. On the other hand, if that is not the explanation-if there have not been collusive practices-there has obviously been very little will to lend and, therefore, a common practice of holding rates up, because no bank has been providing any downward pressure. Whatever we find, I am going to release this information publicly. I am going to invite my constituents to make submissions to this inquiry. I have no doubt we will turn up many examples of this situation where, as the banks have virtually been forced into starting to reduce their home loan rates, they have turned around and started to introduce other kinds of charges. In the case I have cited it was the vance Bank Australia Ltd, but I have no doubt that we will find across the board, by one means or another, banks have been doing exactly what the Treasurer has said-they have been burning their existing clients in order to maintain margins and try to restore some of the profits that were lost, via bad lending practices, in what was obviously a highly excited lend"",ing market. Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to say a few words tonight. I think the House ought to be aware that I have no doubt there are lots of those kinds of examples around Australia, and this Parliament will be hearing about them via the inquiry. Primary Industries",131
179,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Firstly, on this day 98 years ago a record was created in Australia, and the person who created that record was Jacky Howe. On this very day 98 years ago he sheared 321 sheep at Alice Downs near Blackall in Queensland in eight hours 40 minutes, using hand shears. That is indeed a great record. Jacky Howe is held in very high regard by all in the bush and, of course, his name lives on. Mr Tim Fischer-Do you think we could have that productivity today?",132
180,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Exactly-productivity and encouragement. He would have had in those days to have attained a record such as that. It is interesting that this record was achieved 98 years ago, and the record still stands. However, the point I make tonight is that Jacky Howe would be rolling over in his grave if he had heard members on the other side of this House saying that there is no rural crisis. The Australian Rural Times of 3 October this year is testimony that to the fact that this Labor Government has absolutely no idea that there is a rural crisis. Three of the members, the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) and the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), who said that there is no rural crisis, are in this House toAd- night; they deny it. It is in the nation's newsprint. That is how out of touch they are. Mr Tim Fischer-In particular, Kennedy and Page.",132
181,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Yes, as the Leader of the National Party says, all very marginal seats, too, and they would be very worried. I suggest to each of themin particular, the honourable member for Kennedy, in whose electorate this record was created 98 years ago-that they have a look out there. The honoura,ble member for Kennedy will find that there is a very real crisis in the bush. In fact, this Saturday in Roma there is to be a crisis meeting, and people are coming in from all over Queensland in buses. Trucks and headers have been organised to be driven down the main street. There is certainly a crisis out there, and I suggest that the honourable members for Kennedy, Hinkler and Fisher make sure that they are there in Roma on Saturday, because these people are fair dinkum. They are people in the bush, and they are hurting because of the policies of the Labor Government. The real fear out there is that they are not going to survive. Of course, the assistance afforded to them.in 'the past has been toughened up in the latest Budget. The Government has applied an assets test to family supplement. Is that fair? Is it the time to apply an assets test when these assets are almost worthless? These assets cannot be sold at the moment, yet the, Government has deliberately gone out, as I see it, on a path to destroy rural and provincial Australia. I am surprised that the honourable member for Kennedy and the honourable member for Hinkler have made these statements, because I thought that they might have had some credibility, but this article in the Australian Rural Times shows that they have none. As I said, Jacky Howe would roll over in his grave if he thought that people were representing the Australian Labor Party today who could not recognise a crisis when they see one. The honourable member for Hinkler also attacked the United Graziers Association in the matter of public importance yesterday and said that it had no credibility. It has been representing people in the bush for 100 years. Only this year it celebrated its centenary. I think it can stand up very proudly and say that it has got a very good track record-a much better record than that of the honourable member for Hinkler. Mr Snowdon-That means you will be applauding the Labor Party on our centenary next year.",132
182,Mr BRUCE SCOIT,HEALTH LEGISLATION,That association will be around for the bicentenary. It knows what hard times are all about. It will be here; it has much more credibility than this Labor Government has ever had. There is a very real rural crisis out there in the bush. It is certainly recognised by the coalition and by the National Party. Testimony to the fact that the Labor Party does not recognise it is the article in the Australian Rural Times this week. Adelaide,133
183,Dr CATLEY,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"ln contrast to the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), who was the preceding speaker, I want to talk about the centre of artistic life-that is, the city of Adelaide-which is not just the city of churches, long lunches and the best restaurants in the country but also has just won a prize for the best film made last year in this country, Return Home. Adelaide is also a city of poets, short story writers and novelists. Adelaide has a booming writers centre, which is the first in Australia, with about 500 members. It also has the Friendly Street poetry-readings, which meets on the first Tuesday of each month. Mr Truss-That's nice.",133
184,Dr CATLEY,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"I knew the honourable member for Wide Bay would appreciate that. Adelaide also has a publishing collective which has produced 14 annual anthologies of poetry and 14 collected volumes of poetry. It is also the longest running poetry reading group in Australian history-even older than the Australian Labor Party. Honourable members opposite will be interested to hear that it first started to meet on the day that the Whitlam Government was sacked. Most of the funding for these operations at present comes from the South Australian Government. There is a, very good journal that I would like to draw your attention to, Mr Deputy Speaker-the Adelaide Reviewwhich is distributed free from my office, among other places, and is the largest circulation of any arts journal in the Southern Hemisphere. Unfortunately, it is slightly pro-Liberal in orientation. It is a bit hostile to the multifunction polis, but otherwise it is a very reliable newspaper and quite stimulating. There is a very large number of successful writers in the seat, including John Bray, who is a poet, classical scholar and whose book Satura won the 1990 Festival Award; Peter Goldsworthy, who is a general practitioner and lives just round the corner from me-I am sure that the Liberal front bench would appreciate that he is a friend of mine; Graham Rowlands, another city poet who is very widely published, particularly in the Murdoch press on a Saturday morning; Barry Westburg, an old sailing friend of mine with whom I sometimes go to some of the best restaurants in the country-Mr Costello-All these blokes are Liberals, are they?",133
185,Dr CATLEY,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"He lives in my electorate and is a widely published novelist. Mr Hulls-And vote Labor, do they?",134
186,Dr CATLEY,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Of course. There is also Andrew Taylor, who recently has been awarded the Australian AM; and Jeri Kroll, a very distinguished poet in her own right. I thought honourable members might enjoy a bit of culture so I will read a poem to them. It concerns crocodiles and might be of some interest to honourable members opposite as that is one of the booming industries in northern Australia. I thought that an appropriate poem about crocodiles might suit the literary tastes of honourable members opposite. It reads: Crocodiles are decent creatures, up front as their jaws clack-clacking at your limbs. They dribble in honest delight at cries for Their eyes cruise above the slime twinkling like sunspots. They promise other worlds with each chomponly a moment of pain and you enter a primeval realm; intestinal juices break you down without tears, making new muscle and hide. Finally, you're motorised power, snug in the You, too, can maraud without mercy. Everyone shuns those teeth like protected ivory. Heartily feared but not hated, your glorious gorge, your tail that can pound a man into meal. A truly catholic creature you'd let anyone cruise down your street regardless of sex, creed, or colour. Your great jaws only open to repeat; I am what I eat. That is a fine bit of literary work with a sting in the tail and I see honourable members opposite appreciate it greatly. Only barbarians would deny that writers are a great asset, maybe even an adornment, to our urban and rural communities and to society as a whole. Anybody involved in creative writing groups-there are many in my seat and I am sure they exist in most other members' seats-can see the immediate value of the creative activity of writing, but there are also some less immediate advantages to be gained from supporting creative writers and these include: they can function as a kind of international advertisement for the country that they reside in; they are a modest kind of cultural export, comparable to scientific expertise, although a lot cheaper to produce and export. Writing is a very natural human activity, like sport or dancing, which anybody can do, but to do it really well it requires a great deal of time, and time requires money. This week is Arts Week. Today the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) confirmed in the Members' Hall this Government's commitment to funding writing and the other arts, and good on him. I note in passing, and to conclude, that he was in the company of Robyn Archer, another wonderful product of the seat of Adelaide, whose father and mother still live there in Housing Commission accommodation, publicly funded from the Commonwealth Government and for which they have been grateful and been able to help. produce such a wonderful specimen of Adelaide arts as Robyn Archer. Letter from Astrology Today Company",134
187,Mr COURTICE,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Last week I received a very concerned response from a 73-year-old age pensioner mud. and widow. She was concerned about her privacy being invaded by a company called Astrology Today of 2A Cross Street, Double Bay, New South Wales. The letter was from a Mr R. Hastings-Clarke, Director of Astrology Research. He stated: J have taken the liberty of writing to you ally because I have some wonderful news for you and I felt you should know about it right away. As part of my ongoing research I have been examining some of the more interesting birth charts in detail looking for anything of special importance. I have to tell you that the latent planetary conjunctions in your chart stopped me in my tracks and I felt I simply must write to you to tell you about some very exciting events that seem to be in store for you in the near future! This change will have a double barrelled effect it entails both the financial and the emotional side of your life . . . This 73-year-old widow, a lovely lady, is very distressed that her privacy has been invaded by Mr Hastings-Clarke. He enclosed a brief summary of questions and answers and said that instead of charging the $35. as normal he would charge only $25 and was doing her a favour. It is a great pity that people like him do not get out there, get a bit of dirt on their hands and earn a bit of decent money instead of utilising their research base to write to elderly people, invade their privacy and pry on them. I think that is rather disgraceful. We need to let people know that there are other people in the community personwho may well be vulnerable and should not be susceptible to this sort of thing.
