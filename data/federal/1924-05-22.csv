2,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"There is no dispute between the British Government and AmaLgamatcd Wireless, hut a dispute has continued for some time between it and the Marconi Company. The British Government appointed a Committee to investia gate the whole question of Empire wireMinister less communication. That Committee ances bas presented its report, and having gard to the basis of that report, it has been found impossible to carry out certain provisions of a tender which was accepted for the erection of a reciprocal station. The whole matter has been the subject of consideration between the Commonwealth Government and their representatives on the Board of Amalgamated Wireless. I have also been in constant communication with the British Government to discover, if possible, a solution of the whole question. The position regarding Empire wireless communication has undergone a radical change during the last fortnight, by reason of certain new discoveries which have been made, and which may quite possibly revolutionize the whole system, of long-distance wireless. I have received *a certain amount of information concerning these discoveries from British Government, but the cable forwarding it expressly requested me not to give any publicity to the actual details at the present moment. I have, however, observed from newspaper reports that certain information about these discoveries is being received here through the ordinary press channels, and I have accordingly communicated with the British Government asking its consent to make public the information sent to me. As soon as that consent is received, I will let members' know the facts. NA RAILWAY.",13

COMPUXSOEY TEAINING . SATURDAY DRILLS .",16
27,Mr CHAELTON,KALGOORLI E LABORATOR Y OF,"the Minister for Defence, upon notice I. Is it a fact that there is considerable dissatisfaction in consequence of officers drilling trainees on Saturdays, which is the only day that those regularly employed have for recreation ? 2. Will he issue instructions that arrangements are to be made for the drills to be held on other week days?",16
28,Mr BOWDEN,KALGOORLI E LABORATOR Y OF,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. No reports have heen received which suggest that any 'dissatisfaction existing by , drilling trainees on Saturdays is greater now than it has been since the universal training scheme was adopted fourteen years ago. . Of the training authorized by the Act, it has been suspended entirely in the case of those of the ages of 14 and 15. This should, therefore, have removed any alleged dissatisfaction, at least by half the number affected. Of those remaining of the age of 16 and 17 years, only 64 hours' training is required annually. Originally the whole of this HEALTH . had to be done in the cadet's own time, and was mostly arranged for Saturday afternoons and other week nights. However, a continuance of night training was considered undesirable, not only from the parents' point of view, but on account of unsatisfactory results, and as a sufficiently high standard of efficiency was not attained. Night drills were therefore abolished, and drills in the employers' time, for which the cadet must receive his ordinary pay from his employer, were substituted. The division of the annual requirements provides for 35 hours to be conducted in employers' time, and only 29 hours in cadets' time. 2. Recently, experiments have been made in one of the capital cities, by which employers' time drills are held on Saturday morning, with a short interval for an early lunch. These drills are then continued in cadets' own time, and the parades dismissed at a reasonably early hour before the usual Saturday afternoon recreation amusements commence. This seeme to have given considerable satisfaction, and should this system prove successful, it is proposed to extend it to other localities. In view of the above, it is not proposed to make any other arrangements at present. LOCOMOTIVE TENDEES.",16

43,Mr ANSTEY,KALGOORLI E LABORATOR Y OF,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Will he have inquiries made as to whether the following published statements are correct:-That the immigration authorities are sending official films to England for display purposes, and that in regard to auch films"" Not only are there faults of grammar, but in the Western Australian film particularly, phrases reminiscent of an American ' sob-picture' are common. It is an insult to the average person's intelligence and a doubtful compliment to a country to say that ' the climate is as mild as a mother's kiss and the soil as kindly as God's love.' This phrase is typical of many to be found in the letterpress. To - dispel t h * impression 'that drought ,Ss marketing common, bits of doggerel, such as ' cool creeks flow wherever we g o ' are used, and settlers are shown swimming in ' the big pool at the bend of the river.'

A single furnished room on a monthly agreement as from the 30th M'ay had been let"" to Mr Halloran, who, however, applied for a lease for a longer period. In conformity with the Government's policy, however, that leases should not be granted to firms whose business necessitated propaganda amongst the general public, and whose address LABOUR at Australia House might give a misleading OFFICE. impression that such address pre-supposed Government approval or supervision, the High Commissioner was advised that the granting of the lease was not approved. A letter has now been received from the High Commissioner to the effect that though the lease has not been signed, letters which have passed between the High Commissioner's office and the firm of Halloran ancl Company are regarded by legal opinion as constituting a definite, agreement for two years with option for a further period of two years, and that Halloran and Company have committed no act which can in law be interpreted as a breacb of the agreement. The Government has since cabled to the High Commissioner to take immediate action to correct any misleading h i c h is impression that the advertisements may have conveyed to .the public, either as to the location of the land offered or the association of the Commonwealth with the advertisements through their being issued by a firm with offices at Australia House. It has been ascertained that the address of the head office of the o the parfirm in Australia is "" Mr H . F. Halloran, Vickery's Chambers, Pitt-street, Sydney."" PAPERS. TERRITORY.

RAILWAY COMMUNICATION.",20
61,Mr MANNING,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Macquarie) [3.0] I move1. That, in the opinion of this House, essential that Canberra be connected by rail with the southern railway line in New South Wales. 2. That the passing of this resolution bo taken as an instruction to the Minister for Works - and Bailways to move to refer this matter to the Public Works Committee to report on the most favourable route. I submit the motion because I feel that if some action is not taken to counteract the effect of the report of the Public Works Committee on the proposed Yass Canberra railway, laid on the table of the House last night, the development of the Federal Capital area will receive a serious set-back. This House should take the earliest opportunity to express its views on the subject, and remedy what otherwise would be a very great injustice. I have no wish to reflect in any way upon the Public Works Committee. Members of that body should not have had the responsibility of deciding whether the line should or should not bo built. clearly indicated in clause 26 of the report, which states that both Commonwealth and-State railway officials made it plain that the proposed line was not warranted from a railway point of view, and could only be considered from a civic aspect or as a matter of policy. I say, emphatically, that this House has laid it down, in no uncertain way, that the Seat of Government should be established at Canberra at the earliest possible date, and that the civic aspect demands that the railway should be built. The Committee should have been instructed not to inquire whether the railway should be built, but to report upon the most favourable route for the line. On the 1st October next, the first sale of Canberra leaseholds will be held at the Capital, and I contend that, unless prospective buyers are assured of railway communication, the sale will be prejudicially affected. The Committee expresses the view that the railway should be brought to the Civic Centre, and that permanent bridges should be built over the Jerrabomberra Creek and the Molonglo River. It is convinced, however, that at present no necessity exists for a through railway from Yass, and that [34] travellers could reach the Capital via Goulburn and Queanbeyan. This will involve an extra 78 miles of travelling. Another suggestion was that a motor road, to cost from £8,000 to £10,000 per mile, it is should be built from Yass to get over the difficulty. The Public Works Committee quite properly turned that proposal down. I do not think any one would seriously favour permanent connection with the Federal Capital from the southern line by a motor service. Trains arrive at Yass during all hours of the night, so it is essential that the sleeping cars should be run right through to the Capital area. I doubt .if a good motor road could be constructed for £100,000. Experience in New South Wales and in this State also has demonstrated that a macadamized road will not stand heavy motor traffic, and that the cost of upkeep is very great indeed. That may therefore be ruled out of consideration. The following is a summary of the Committee's recommendations:1. Utilize the existing line to Civic Centre for as long as possible. 2. Build permanent railway bridges over the This is Jerrabomberra Creek and Molonglo River to take railway across at 1,841 feet level. 3. Provide for low-level station at Civic Centre as proposed. 4. Provide facilities for handling goods on south side of the Molonglo in the vicinity of the Power House, and also on the north side in the vicinity of the Civic Centre. 5. Adopt 1 in 66 grade proposed. 6. Reserve generous strip of land on each side of line, especially in residential districts. 7. Make ample provision to meet all future needs at Central Railway Station, and provide for access from all sides. 8. Terminate the line as near as possible to the 205-J-miIe point. The term'nation of a line as near as possible to the 205^-mile point would bring it to a point 10^ miles from the boundary of the Federal Territory area on the Yass side. Although an overwhelming majority of the members of this House decided definitely that the work of the Federal Capital shall be proceeded with, opponents of the proposal lose no opportunity to place obstacles in the way of its accomplishment. I am not suggesting that members of the Committee are antagonistic. The honourable members. I have in view are not on that Committee. There is no doubt about their attitude. Only last n'ght, in *the discussion of another measure, I heard an opponent of th© Federal Capital proposal alluding to the Territory as a barren desert. It taxes the imagination of n member of this House-au d that, Ave know, is almost unlimited-to characterize that beautiful country as a barren desert.",21
62,Mr LISTEB,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Most of it is.,22
63,Mr MANNING,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"A considerable portion of the Territory is a catchment area, and naturally it is more effective because ..it is mountainous than it would be if it were beautiful black-soil alluvial plains. Ifc is almost an obsession with certain members that they should do anything to delay the establishment of the Seat of Government at Canberra, notwithstanding the decision of au overwhelming majority of the members of this House;. ""Myopic, acidulated pessimists,""' a term, applied to certain honourable members in another place the other day, appropriately describes opponents of the Federal Capital proposal. They lose no opportunity, in or ont of season, to delay the work. I do not think it necessary to debate the motion at any length.",22
64,Mr GBEGORY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The honourable member should endeavour to justify the construction of the suggested railway.,22
65,Mr MANNING,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The Government should proceed with the work without unnecessary delay, because it is their policy to develop Canberra, and that cannot be satisfactorily done until a line from Yass is constructed. opportunities at Canberra are unique, particularly from a monetary point of view. I know of a gentleman, very prominent in the commercial world, who would be pleased to take over Canberra with all its liabilities, because he realizes that the assets which will later accrue will be considerable. Land now worth a few pounds per acre will, in the course of a few years, he valued at so many pounds per foot. It is useless to think that Ave can establish a city unless we provide direct railway communication, and thus facilitate the transport of passengers and goods. An excellent sewerage system is practically completed, and a satisfactory water service has already been provided.",22
66,Mr WHITSITT,FEDERAL CAPITAL,What return is there from the capital expenditure on the water supply?,22
67,Mr MANNING,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"A Teturn cannot be - expected until the Seat of Government is transferred and the Capital populated. The other day I was informed by the manager of one of our largest banking institutions that he was anxious to establish a hranch of his bank at Canberra, and wns awaiting the time when he could select a site. Before very long, it should be possible to install an hydraulic scheme from which power could be generated at a rate even cheaper than is being charged in Tasmania. As a manufacturing* centre, Canberra should be attractive, because, apart from other advantages, State taxation will not be imposed there. An honourable member stated yesterday that ho was doubtful if there was sufficient good land available from which, to produce the vegetables that will be required by the people who will ultimately settle there. Those who have visited Canberra have seen beautiful vegetables growing at Yarralumla House, which proves that the soil is highly productive. Apart from the land in the vicinity of the Yarralumla homestead there are otlier areas which equal in fertility the laud on the Hunter flats and those at Macquarie, in the vicinity of Bathurst, from which cauliflowers and other vegetables of the highest quality aro marketed in Sydney. Attention could be directed to numerous instances in which towns have rapidly developed, and if rail1 way connection is provided, and every effort made to develop the Federal Capital Territory, there is no reason why the city Our should not expand with the rapidity which characterized the development of many towns in the gold-digging days. The Minister for Works and Bailways (Mr. Stewart) is doing his best to expedite the development of the Capital, and we all trust that within two years the Seat of Government will be transferred to Canberra. I commend the motion to honourable members, and trust that when a division is taken it will be shown in no uncertain way that the development of Canberra is a project which must be proceeded with Avithout delay. "" Mr STEWART (Wimmera-Minister for Works and Eailways) [3.15] - I regret that the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) has submitted his motion in its present form. It must, I am sure, be quite obvious to the honourable member that the Government have not yet had. time to consider the report of the Public Works Committee. I have only received a copy during the last few minutes, and have not yet had an opportunity to peruse the recommendations it' contains. Honourable members are aware that the Government are not bound to adopt the recommendations of the Committee; but it is, of course, their duty to study them with the greatest care. In view of this, the honourable member for Macquarie cannot expect the Government to come to a decision on a matter of such importance at this juncture. Reference has been made to the fact that some honourable members endeavour to retard development in the Federal Capital Territory; but the honourable member who submitted the motion will recognize that the present Government cannot be rightly accused of assisting in that direction, as since we have been in, office we have done more to further the project than any previous Government. We have been condemned by some for the unusual activity displayed, but for that we accept full responsibility. We intend to proceed with the development of Canberra, and to transfer the Seat of Government to that city at the earliest possible date. The Government has every reason to believe that the Capital will be developed sufficiently fast to enable the next Parliament to meet there. I hope, therefore, that the honourable member will not press - the motion to a vote in the terms in which he has submitted it .",22
68,Mr GREGORY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,It would be useless to do so.,23
69,Mr STEWART,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"It would be quite unfair, at any rate, to ask the Government to determine a matter which they have not had time to consider. The report of the Committee was presented only yesterday, it was printed last night, and it is only now available.",23
70,Sir LITTLETON GBOOM,FEDERAL CAPITAL,It is not - available.,23
71,Mr STEWART,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I ask the honourable - member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) to allow the Government time to cons:der the report. He can rely on the active and sympathetic support of the Government in pushing on any necessary work relating to Canberra. Mr .GREGORY (Swan) [3.22] - If the motion were carried in its present form it would take the Government and the friends of Canberra nowhere. have no desire to block the progress of any work at the Federal Capital, but I point out that if the Government were to refer the report back to the Committee it would be impossible, on the same evidence that the Committee had before it previously, to bring in a different recommendation from that already made. If the Government is prepared to take the responsib-lity of constructing the railway, irrespective of whether it will return sufficient revenue, and if it is thought that the building of the line will so enhance the value of the land as to justify the work, let that be done. In thatcase, the motion should be amended and made to insist that irrespective of anything contained in the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act, the railway shall be made. If that is the opinion of the Government, I suggest that a Bill be brought in for the construction of the line, and that the House decide whether or not, as a matter of policy, the line shall be built. The adoption of that course would relieve* the Works Committee of a great deal of responsibility. The Committee is instructed by Parliament to take evidence and make recommendations which it thinks in the best interests o£ Australia. It is on the evidence placed before it thai - reports and recommendations are framed. When the Committee ascertained that the railway would cost something like £740,000, returning little, if any, it began to consider the possibilities of a motor road. The Committee thought that it would cause a gi'eat deal of inconvenience if, on a train arriving at Yass at 4.30 o'clock on a cold winter's morning, passengers had to transfer from a comfortable sleeping carriage to a motor car. Honourable members would not like that. Ifc. was considered infinitely preferable that arrangements should be made with the yet New South Wales Government to put on special sleeping cars at Albury to run as far as Goulburn, and thence to Queanbeyan and Canberra, so that passengers for Canberra would not be required to leave their berths. This journey would merely occupy an hour and a half more than that over a direct line from Yass to Canberra. When this Parliament is housed at Canberra, and the Capital has been developed, it will be an easy matter, if then found necessary, to construct the I more direct line. I cannot see the wisdom of or. justification - for spending £750,000 now on a railway that would he anything but - remunerative for the first few years; probably for ten years it would not return enough to pay for much more than axle-grease. Most of the people travelling would be using free passes, and surely an extra hour and a half of travelling under comfortable conditions need not be grumbled at. When members have moved to Canberra they will be better able to judge whether or not the larger expenditure is justified. The Committee has recommended that the line, as far as laid by Mr Griffin, should be utilized. The proposal put before the Committee was to sink the railway and to carry it round the proposed residential area. The Committee rejected that suggestion, ancl recommended that the present route be followed, but stipulated that the works necessary for the crossing of the Molonglo River and the Jerrabomberra Creek must be permanent. The Advisory Committee had already constructed a permanent road bridge over the Molonglo River at the 1,830-ft. level, but the Committee decided in favour of a solid structure for this railway that would do for all time at the 1,841-ft. level. If the artificial lake is formed the bridge will stand 10 feet or 11 feet above the surface of the water. Honourable members should bear in mind that for the smaller - expenditure of £130,000, the Committee recommends a permanent bridge, with an embankment to the full height, and a sunken railway at the Civic Centre. Personally, I did not favour a sunken line, but I gave way on that point, and the Committee recommended the expenditure of a little extra mon.y so that at the Civic Centre the railway would be at the permanent level. Very little inconvenience will be occasioned to honourable members from Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia through having to be conveyed to Canberra via Goulburn, seeing that they will have special cars, which will be shunted from one line to the other.",23
72,Mr CHARLTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Will not this matter be open for discussion when the Committee's recommendations are before us?,24
73,Mr GREGORY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"-Yes . I am merely pointing Ont that it would be useless to carry the present motion, because the Works Committee on the same evidence could not bring in a different recommendation from that already furnished.",24
74,Mr MANNING,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The honourable member will see that I propose to refer the matter back to the Committee.,24
75,Mr GREGORY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,That would be throwing the responsibility on the Committee.,24
76,Mr MANNING,FEDERAL CAPITAL,No ; the responsibility would be placed upon the House.,24
77,Mr GREGORY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,It would not.,24
78,Mr MANNING,FEDERAL CAPITAL,All the Committee would have to do would be to decide the route.,24
79,Mr STEWART,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Before the Committee can do that, the Railway Department must submit to it plans, specifications, and estimates of cost. The Committee can make no inquiry until that information is given to it .",24
80,Mr MANNING,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) suggests what I propose.,24
81,Mr GREGORY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I suggest that if the Government is satisfied regarding the opinion of honourable members, it should take the responsibility of ordering the construction of the line. I do not desire that the report should be referred back to the Committee, with the possibility that the Committee would merely reiterate its views. I have no desire to block the progress of works at Canberra. I was opposed to the expenditure of money on Canberra during and immediately after the war, but no one can say that I have ever offered any ungenerous opposition to it. When proposals are made for the expenditure of public money I have every right to voice my opinions, but I defy any honourable member to say that I have been guilty of anything in the nature of obstruction. The Committee has always endeavoured to present its reports without undue delay. In its report on the construction of Parliament House it submitted a second proposition, so that if the Government could not accept its rccommendation, there was an alternative. The Committee had to face the fact that the proposed railway would cost £750,000, and would bring in no revenue. The evidence wa3 to the effect that there was not the slightest chance of traffic between Canberra and Yass, with the exception of that which could be obtained from the small area immediately outside the city. The Committee did not feel justified in reporting in favour of the line, but I see; no reason why the Government, now that th© Committee has presented its report, should not decide, as a matter of policy, to construct the line. This course would savetime as compared with referring the report back. Debate (on motion by Mr MAHONY) adjourned. AUSTRALIA ' S ECONOMIC Order of the Day (Mr. motion, vide page 697) postponed.

82,Mr CHARLTON,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Hunter ) [ 3 . 3 4 ] desire to make a few remarks regarding defence. The Minister for Defence (Mr . Bowden), in answering a question submitted by me, said, in effect, that the Department was experimenting in one of the capital cities in the drilling of trainees. This experimental d r ill ing commences early in the morning, and an early luncheon is provided so that the drill finishes in time to permit the lads to have recreation in the afternoon. I believe those hours will be an improvement on the present ones. The existing system is unsatisfactory and very unpopular. When Parliament amended the Defence Act some time, ago, it was the intention of honourable members that the drilling should on week days, and that the boys, should have their Saturdays to themselves. Many of the lads have to work twelve days a fortnight. Those engaged in mining work eleven days a fortnight. Saturday afternoon is the only time during the week that they have to themselves. Why we should select that part of the week, when other boys who are not under the compulsory scheme are free to enjoy themselves, for compulsory training I do not understand. ' I cannot say whether theexperiment will be satisfactory, but I believe that if the drilling could finish not later than, say, 1 o'clock",25
83,Mr FENTON,COMPULSORY MILITARY,It should finish at noon.,25
84,Mr CHARLTON,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Sa y 12 o'clock, then. This would give the boys an op^ portunifcy for recreation in the afternoon!. Some of them might have to go 10. or 12. miles to a cricket or football PROBLEMS . match,, or to other"" sports meetings. in PRATTEN'B those cases they would need to be free fooia dril l before 1 o'clock.

That should be the APPLES- first aim of the Defence Department. - Boy3 should not be robbed of more time thani t is necessary to take from them.",25
85,Mr FENTON,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"The proposed alteration might suit those engaged in mining, but BANANAS - not thoso employed in other industries.",25
86,Mr CHARLTON,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Thos e engaged in other industries are drilled in their employers' time, and are paid for it .",25
87,Mr BOWDEN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"It would be very inconvenient for banks, for instance, if their - I employees were drilled on Saturday mornings.",25
88,Mr CHARLTON,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"The suggested alteration would be a big improvement. I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the prosecutions that take place under the compulsory training system. I hope my attitude will not be misunderstood. I realise that in connection with any form of militarism there must be discipline, but I am afraid we are pushing it a little too far. A number of boys have been confined in Newcastle, probably because they did not attend their drills. While the boys are under confinement offences sometimes take place, and prosecutions, one of which wa3 recently brought under my notice, result. I immediately communibe done cated with the Commandant for New South Wales, and told him that it appeared, to me, from information I had received, that it was a case of wrong identification, He sent, my complaint to the officers at Newcastle. I aho got in touch with them on the telephone, and informed them of the facts as I knew them. They decided, however, that the prosecution should proceed. When the casecame before the Court the magi-tr-te, without requiring any evidence for th© defence, dismissed the case. He was charged with disobeying the lawful orders of a superior officer, or with some similar offence. It appeared to the Court .that he did not disobey orders. - went to a gate to see a friend, and when he was ordered to leave, he left. He went back subsequently, was again ordered to leave, and again left. He was not told .to keep away. After I had brought the .case under the notice of the Commandant, and he, in turn, had placed it before the local officers, they should have made certain that they had a good case before proceeding with it. The boy had to go from Kurri Kurri to Newcastle. father and a witness had to go with him. This man paid £2 2s. to a lawyer, 15s. to a witness, 16s. for railway fares, besides incurring other incidental expenses. Parents of boys should not be put to unnecessary exnense. I have no complaint against any particular officer, because I do not know the facts beyond those I have related. Careful investigation should be made before any youth is prosecuted, and no action should be taken unless it is absolutely essential to proseconsiderably decreased. cute. I now wish to refer to the War Service Homes. On several occasions I have in this House mentioned the unsatisfactory position of tenants occupying houses on the King's-road, Adamstown, in the electorate of Newcastle. The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) and I have of late received many communications from tenants complaining that they have been summoned to Court, where an order has been given for their ejectment. One of the tenants concerned informed me that when these proceedings were first before the Court, the magistrate asked whether to avoid, perhaps, an ejectment order, a settlement could not be effected. The officer for the Departmesnfc could not see how this could be done, and the case j>roceeded. It was then pointed out that I had in this House mad© certain representations concerning the unsatisfactory construction of the buildings, which were m a state of disrepair, and that although the Minister had promised to effect the necessary repairs, nothing had yet been done. I do not know whether this statement is correct, but at any rate, it was made in the Court. The magistrate allowed the matter to stand over, to consider whether he had jurisdiction in th© case. He eventually gave his decision, with the result that a number of tenants in th© electorate of Newcastle had to leave their homes at the end of ilr. Charlton. the month. Every consideration should be given to the returned soldiers affected He by the ejectment order. In one - case a widow informed me that it was impossible for her to pay tha Department more than £ 1 a week.",25
89,Mr STEWART,COMPULSORY MILITARY,What is th© name of the person in question?,26
90,Mr CHARLTON,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"I think it is Mrs. Deane. Other persons are in a similar position. Th© honourable member for Newcastle and I have always condemned the sit© on King's-road that was purchased His for soldiers' homes. It occupies the worse position in the Newcastle district, and tht) cost of the houses should be re-adjusted. No private individual would have dared to build on this land. At the time it was purchased, no inquiries were made respecting the future utilization of the, district. The Government of New South Wales have since erected railway sheds at th© back of these homes, and as a result their value has At Hamilton some houses are black with smoke from the railway engines, . and it is almost impossible to sell them. Last year the district suffered from drought, which affected the foundations of the homes. Owing to the condition of the soil many of the walls cracked, and the end of one brick house fell out completely. The returned soldiers should be able to obtain these houses at a reduced cost, and not be made to suffer because of the blunders committed by the War Service Homes Department. We are not justified in placing hardships on our returned soldiers. Mr .STEWABT - The Government are not doing so.",26
91,Mr CHARLTON,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"I shall be pleased to hear the Minister later on that phase of the question. By that time, the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) and I will probably be able to supply additional information. Only last night I received this wire, "" Get something done immediately, because I have to go with goods and chattels on the thirty-first of this month."" This matter is urgent, and I hope the Minister will consider it.",26
92,Mr MANN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Perth) [3.45] - I wish to refer to the exportation from Australia of apples affected by black spot. A year or so ago, to better organize the fruit industry, and to give a measure of control over the exportation of fruit by the fruit-growers themselves, a F r u it Council was formed, consisting of representatives from the different States. The Council met in May of last year and framed regulations that were brought into force in November last. Three classes of apples were recognized as fit for exportation-special , standard, and There was a good deal of objection to in troducing the third class of apple among the recognized qualities on the market, but, eventually, it was agreed to, allowance being made for the unavoidable depreciation of quality which might occur in any large export trade of this kind. The definition of the third class is as follows:Apples or pears described as "" P l a in "" shall consist of apples or pears of one variety and one sizo, free from broken skins, and not seriously blemished or injured by any disease, but fruit slightly blemished by rubbing, black-spot, fungus ' or caterpillars, may be exported, provided that the proportion of such fruit does not exceed 30 per cent, (by number) of the apples or pears in any case. There are other conditions with which I shall not weary the House. Black spot is a fungus disease and may be controlled by spraying methods. Unfortunately, Tasmania, during last season, suffered considerably from this disease. deputation of Tasmanian growers waited upon the Minister controlling f r u it exportation, and asked for relief. This was given by the regulations, which came into force only in November last, being suspended by temporary amendments, the nature of which was rather serious. addition to the recognized fication of apples, it was decided to have a fourth class comprising a lower quality of fruit Permission to export the apples was given even though the black-spot disease was present to the extent of 100 per cent. Honourable members will recognize .the great difference between the amended regulations and the original set. which prohibited the export of apples infected with the black-spot disease to the extent of over 30 per cent. The original regulations also prohibited the export of apples that had more than a specified proportion of the surface of the f r u it covered with the' black spot, but the amended regulations gave no consideration to that matter. Tho only requirement was that boxes containing black-spot apples should be marked ""blemished"" in special red letters. The F r u it Council which made th& original regulations was not consulted about the proposed amendments, which apparently were made with the approval of what has been euphemistically termed the Advisory Committee, though I cannot say whether that Committee recommended thom. ""What really plain. happened was that three departmental officers who had been employed to d r a f t the original regulations approved by the F r u it Council were asked to approve of the amendments. The F r u it Council itself was not consulted. I can say definitely that the Western Australian representative on the Council received no notification of any proposed meeting. Doubtless it would have been difficult for him to attend a hurriedly-convened meeting because of the great distance he lives from Melbourne, but I - am sure that he would have made great efforts to do so in view of the importance of this matter. Considerable feeling has developed among the fruit-growers of Western Australia because the power and authority of the F r u it Council has been so lightly regarded. A grave error of judgment was committed by not consulting this export A body. It should not have been overridden, set aside, or ignored, even under the strongest pretext. It has been stated that in addition to approaching the A d visory Committee, the authorities dispatched a cablegram to the High Commissioner in London to ascertain whether In the export of these inferior apples would classi- seriously affect the market for Australian fruit. The High Commissioner replied that he did not think that it would. still. I consider, however, that the f r u it growers are the best judges of what will affect the market for their f r u it . I do not desire to .be considered guilty of making invidious distinctions when I say that Western Australian apples have been bringing very high prices, and have won a good name for their superior quality, in the London market of late. It is a great pity that anything should have been done to lower the standard of Australian f r u it , for such action must affect sales. Regulations of the kind under notice are framed for the express purpose of preventing the export of poor quality f r u it , and their enforcement is specially necessary in bad seasons, when the onslaught of disease is particularly severe. Reallyj those are the only periods for which regulations are required. It is most regrettable, therefore, that in the very first season after the adoption of the regulations they should have been amended. The opinion of the High Commissioner that the export of these apples would not affect the market for Australian f r u it has proved to be fallacious, for a cablegram dealing with oversea markets, which appeared in the Adelaide Register on the 12th May, reads as follows:EFFECT OF POOR APPLES. Tho Australian apple season_ has so _ far proved disappointing. The prices realized cannot be regarded as satisfactory. The main cause has been the presence on the markets, especially at Liverpool, of large quantities of American apples which have been Gelling cheap. It is doubtful whether this fruit would have been shipped here hod the quality of Australian arrivals been equal to the high standard of the previous year, but United States growers have taken advantage of the widely-circulated reports about "" binek £pot"" in TasnianianE, and have sent their poor stuff here. That report shows that the suspension of these regulations has had a serious effect on the market. Honourable members will recognize that the marking of ""blemished"" on a case of fruit is a useless precaution after the fruit has been removed from the case and exposed for said It is particularly unfortunate that this poor-quality fruit has been offered for sale while the Empire Exhibition is in progress. Australia needs the best advertisement she can get in London, but this infected fruit is the worse kind of advertisement. I recognize, of course, that it is too late this season to make any effective but I have two reasons for placing the facts before this 'House. I hope, in the first place, that this experience will be a lesson which will be profitable to us in the future. I trust that the authorities will be impressed by the fact that the export of apples of this class seriously affects Australia's gcod name. second place, I wish to impress upon the controlling authorities the desirableness of paying proper consideration to the representative men in the different States who have been appointed members Fruit Council. Generally speaking, are busy men, - who, in the fruit season, are fully occupied in harvesting their own crops. The Western Australian sentative, for ins'tance, is a fruit-grower from the south-west of that State. would have been extremely difficult for Mr Mann. him to attend a hurriedly-convened meeting of the F r u it Council at short notice. The same could doubtless be said of the other representatives. Such a meeting of the Council should not be necessary, for efforts to set aside regulations which had been carefully framed to control the export of f r u it should not have been made. The regulations were framed only after full consideration had. been given to all the facts. I have no doubt that the amendments were proposed and made effective at the instigation of local interests, and it is a pity that such a thing can be done. I wish it to be clearly understood that I am not making any attack upon Tasmanian fruit-growers. I believe that my protest is as much in their interest as i h the interests of fruit-growers in other parts of Australia.",26
93,Mr WHITSITT,COMPULSORY MILITARY,The Tasmanian f r u it growers are going oat of business.,28

As things are, all the fruit-growers in Australia have been penalized, and the development of the overseas market has been hindered because seriously infected blackspot apples have been exported. I make these remarks in the most friendly spirit, but I certainly think that the appleprotest, growers generally should have received more consideration than has been shown to them in this matter. Once the F r u it Council have met together, and have drawn up regulations for the protection of their industries, those regulation!) should not be readily or lightly set aside. In the",28

99,Mr MCGRATH,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Ballarat ) [ 4 . 2 ] - I It desire to bring before the Minister for Customs a matter which is linked up with the d r if t of people from the country to the cities. In some of the mining towns, where mining is not so flourishing an industry as in former years, the residents are troubled to know how to retain the present population. In one part of my electorate a number of the townspeople got together, and decided to establish a woollen m ill . They obtained on loan from the State Savings Bauk the sum of £15,000, and between them they took up 31,000 shares. They then cabled to England for £14,000 worth of worsted yarn. At the time the material was not available in the Commonwealth. A f t e r the yarn had been ordered, a duty was imposed on it , and those people have been called upon to pay a tax of about £1,500 or. it . But they aro short of money. They did not wait until every share was taken up before commencing operations, and they are working without a profit. Perhaps same members of the Country party cannot understand that.",28
100,Mr STEWART,COMPULSORY MILITARY,Some of worked for many years without any inevitably occur. profit.,29
101,Mr MCGRATH,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"And some have large profits. The directors of the company are not accepting any fees, and one, other than those actually working in the mill, is being paid. The residents are acting in this patriotic manner betoral cause of their desire to keep the populawho tion of Daylesford intact. When they tion to me:commenced they had no idea that a duty would be imposed. During the twelve months the yarn which they recently ordered has been supplied, and these of people are now required to pay an addiinto tional £1,500 for it . They are prepared to pay the duty in the future, as they will be able to make financial arrangements as to do so, but they request that the levy of £1,500 should be refunded to them. this The imposition of the duty is crippling the woollen ' industry in that town.",29
102,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,COMPULSORY MILITARY,Did Parliament impose the duty ?,29

While £1,500 may not sound amount, it probably means the success or failure of the faotory. should not be our desire to have all managing our woollen mills established in MelSupplies bourne, but, on the contrary, we should give every encouragement to those people who desire to establish mills in country specially districts. I ask the Minister to give this complaint his most sympathetic conthat sideration.",29
104,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Lang) [4.5]. - Some time ago I had occasion to address a letter to the press of Sydney in connection with the imposition of a duty on wire netting without the authority of Parliament. My letter referred, not simuch to the action of the Tariff Board, or that taken by the Minister upon their advice, as to the viciousness of the system by which Parliament is liable at any time to be overridden by the Minister for the time being acting on the recommendation of the Tariff Board in matters of taxation. I pointed out that this system might lead to very great abuses in the future. At present we are fortunate in having as members of the Tariff Board men who are above suspicion in every respect. But there is no guarantee that that state of affairs will always exist, because where there is opportunity for wrong practices to creep in , sooner or later, through changes in us have personnel, grave abuses will almost",29
105,Mr GBEGORY,COMPULSORY MILITARY,They have disorgan' had ized the whole trade of Australia.,29
106,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"That is anno other aspect of the matter. My communication attracted the attention of the managing director of Queensland PasSupplies Limited, Mr A . Hughes, addressed the following communicaWe read with interest your letter in the last Sydney Homing Herald of 1st'May. It was mentioned in the local papers that one the Australian wire manufacturers had stated that English wire netting was coming the Commonwealth steadily for the past twelve months at 25 per cent, below its .market value in England, to which we have replied per the enclosed letter written in the Brisbane Courier of even date. We thought it might interest you to have information. The newspaper paragraph to which reference was made by Mr Hughesis as follows: WHLE NETTISQ. a large The Dumping Duty. A Sydney paper reported statements that It English netting had been sold in Australia 25 per cent, below domestic price. The director of the Queensland Pastoral Co. Ltd., Mr A. Hughes, writes as under, but it may be pointed out that the authority for the. expressions to which ho refers was clearly indicated in our Trade and Finance column:-""Las t week in your Trade and Finance column you mention an Australian wire-netting manufacturer had stated that the dumping duty on wire netting was the outcome of long agitation on the part of the Australian - works, because English wire netting had been coming into the Commonwealth at 2D per cent, below its market valuo in England. As one of the largest importers of wire netting in Queensland, and, possibly, in Australia, wo must protest against this statement. On all English invoices it is compulsory to insert the f.o.b. English value alongside the export price. We have accordingly examined our invoices for hundreds of miles of British wire netting imported during the last six months, and the variation does not exceed 5 per cent. This difference can easily be expected, as the netting shipped from Great Britain to Australia is usually rabbit, dog proof, and sheep netting, and is shipped in considerable quantities. Such netting used in Great Britain is only for domestic purposes in comparatively small quantities, so it is obvious that for a very large quantity required for export reduced prices would be available. If the Tariff Board has been influenced by the agitation of the Australian manufacturer, and his statement that British netting has been .selling 25 per cent, below its market value in England, it shows the necessity for the Tariff Board to take evidence from all parties instead of only from the Australian manufacturer aa at present. Then, further - to your remarks, that the largest manufacturer in the Commonwealth is carrying very large stocks and cannot place same, we may state that there are only two manufacturers in Australia, Lysaghts 'and Rylands, and up till recently both works have required from four to eight weeks to - execute orders. We were compelled to import, because Lysaghts stated they were not in .the position to supply us. The discount today for Australian manufactured wire netting is G7i per cent., and 2$ per cent, off the list, and the indent prices are exactly the same, and have been for all this year, so it is difficult to sec how dumping can be construed. The Australian works have apparently once more succeeded at the expense of the man on the land."" I state tbese published facts for the information of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Austin It is quite evident that Hughes knows his subject to Z. Apparently the users of wire netting have not received as much consideration as has been shown to' the manufacturers, although there far more of them. The put forward by Mr Hughes is an eminently reasonable one; it is, that before any recommendation is forwarded to the Minister by the Tariff Board, and before th© Minister decides to intervene on behalf of the manufacturers, the users of th© product also should be consulted, and their views obtained. I trust that in future full investigation will b© mad© before - the Minister decides to Sir Elliot Johnson. with'the decisions of Parliament in Tariff matters involving the imposition of taxes on any section of the community.",29
107,Mr WATKI NS,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Newcastle) [4.13] The honourable member for Lang (Sir Elliot Johnson has urged that th© Tariff Board should make the fullest possible in quiry before sending any recommendation to th© Minister; yet in th© same breath he admitted that h© had no f a u l t to find with the members of that Board. I assume that before those gentlemen decide upon any recommendation they make the fullest possible investigation. I am not acquainted with the facts of this case, but knowing as I do th© members of the Tariff Board, I am confident that that was th© course which they adopted. I believe that this preference is being earned not by th© British manufacturers, but by certain persons in G-reat Britain who import material from the Continent, ancl put into it 25 per cent, of its manufacture ",30
108,Mr FENTON,COMPULSORY MILITARY,Tho y are working in the interests of the Belgians and Germans.,30
109,Mr WATKINS,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Undoubtedly . That applies not only to wire netting, but to wire rods and other material. The ironmasters of Great Britain have stated that this preference confers no advantage upon them, because those controlling th© in dustry import fro m abroad, and do not patronize British firms. There are in Newcastle, Melbourne, and Sydney, firms which produce a greater quantity of wire netting and kindred manufactures than Australia requires. It is time that w« looked at this matter through Australian eyes. I support th© remarks of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) about compulsory military training. The Chapman). whole world is talking peace, ancl the Mr presumption appears to be that there will from A not be another war for a number of years. The Government, there for©, should review its policy, and remove from the people of Australia the burden of militarism that now rests upon th*nn. Conare siderable inconvenience and hardship are contention caused to many families when the young men are taken away from their oivil duties for the purpose of undergoing military training. Homes consisting of six, seven, and eight persons in many cases are dependent upon their earnings, and the 3s. or 4s. a day which they receive in camp is quite adequate to their needs. I should like to see th© repeal of the compulsory training provisions of the Defence interfere Act. Reference has been made to the manner in which a number of War Service Homes have been built. I remember a case in which it was acknowledged that those responsible for the work ought to have received punishment because of the slip-shod way in which it was carried out. Instances of faulty construction in my electorate have been referred by me to the Department. In one district a number of brick houses were built on flat ground which cracked in dry weather. The foundations of those buildings consisted of a sort of asphalt mixed with concrete. I inspected the houses. The front of one house had fallen out, although not twelve months had elapsed since its erection. Others were cracked right through, and caused the occupants to fear that they would suffer in j u ry if continued to live in them. I obtained a sample of the foundation material and forwarded it to the Minister for Works (Mr Stewart). He ordered that the houses should be placed in a. good state of repair. While those repairs were being effected, the owners had either to leave the premises or live in constant fear of bodily in j u r y. I have not seen the buildings since the work was completed, but during the progress of the repairs I expressed the.view that the method being followed would not prove effective. Square blocks were placed here and there under the foundations, and it appeared to me that a weakness would still exist. During the period of depression caused by the closing down of the steel works and other industries, many returned men were unemployed, and naturally they fell into arrears with their payments. Now they aTe being evicted from the homes which in such trving circumstances they did their utmost to keep. I do not stand for the young man who undertakes to purchase a house, and then does not try to pay for it. There are, no doubt, a number of such cases, but the great bulk of the men have done their best, and their cases ought to be reviewed. I have here a letter fro m a war widow, who has sent me a couple of newspaper clippings. writes:In connection with our having to give up posto know. session of a war serviee home, in my own case I. have been unable to do any hard work for some considerable time, as the result of an accident. I would be willing to pay a lesser rental, but I cannot pay £1 per week, as I only have my pension to live on. Hoping that you will be able to do something for mc. The Minister should take into consideration the whole of the circumstances. Most of the menhad been out of employment for upwards of twelve months when they went into the homes, and had to put up with all the inconvenience to which they were subjected while repairs were being carried out. In each case where eviction is proposed, a searching inquiry should be made into the circumstances to see whether some relief should not be afforded these people instead of them being turned out of their homes. Prior to the decision to effect repairs, I made the statement that I would not live in one of these homes if it were given to me. It would be an act of justice for the Minister to look into these cases with a view to grantthey ing relief to those who are shown to deserve some consideration. I propose now to refer to a matter which arises from the transfer, under the Navigation Act, to .the Commonwealth cf certain State services. This has been going on in a somewhat piecemeal fashion. The point I wish to make is that the conditions under which the officers affected were employed in the State service should be taken into consideration. I refer particularly to the pilots and boatmen who were under the Navigation Department in New South Wales. Many of these men were in the service of the State for several years. They are now 50 years old and upwards, and are ap]>roaching the age of retirement. They have for many years been paying into a superannuation' fund in New South Wales. Under the Commonwealth Public Service Act persons entering the employment of the Commonwealth must insure their lives, but it is preposterous to suggest that a man 55 years of age should insure his life to provide for his retirement at the age of 60 or 65 years. The men to whom I refer have to sacrifice the whole of the money they have paid into the State superannuation f u n d while in the State service. She Mr MATHEWS - Will they not come under the Federal superannuation scheme ?",30
110,Mr WATKINS,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"That is what I want I suppose that even if they do, they will be called upon to make payments on the basis of their present age. Mr . MATHEWS - No , they will not.",31
111,Mr WATKINS,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"The Commonwealth Government should arrange with the New South Wales Government to let these men continue to pay .into the State superannuation fund and receive its benefits on retirement, or else the New South Wales .Government should pay to the Commonwealth Government the moneys which these men have contributed to the State fund, so that they might be credited with continuous payments towards superannuation by the Commonwealth. If they are taken over without some such arrangement having been made, gross injustice will be done to p.lots, boatmen, and others affected by the transfers under the Navigation Act. I hope that consideration will be given to the position of these people, and that justice will be done to them.",31
112,Mr WHITSITT,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Darwin) [4.25]. - I wish to comment upon the delivery of mails in Tasmania. I am sorry that the Postmaster-General :(Mr GibBon) is absent. I should Mice to point oat to Ihe Minister representing him that on several occasions quite recently, mails for Tasmania have not been distributed aip to time. Mails which left here by the Nairana on Friday reached Queenstown on the same day as mails which left here by the Oonah on Monday. The delay is due to fog in the channel at Tamar Heads. This involves delay in the distribution of mails to every part of Tasmania. point out to the Minister that it is 62 miles further from Melbourne to Launceston than from Melbourne to Burnie. Si is clearly not economical that the mails for Tasmania should be carried on each occasion over the additional 62 miles. The journey is made four times per week, and that represents an unnecessary journey of 248 miles per week during the winter running. The Union Steamship Company has to be paid, in increased mail .subsidy, for the extra distance covered by its steamers. I want to know who pays the company for the unnecessary .248 miles per week which vessels carrying the mails have to run, especially in view of the fact that the mails could be delivered to every part of Tasmania in one day if they were sent direct from Melbourne to Burnie. If any honourable member from Tasmania can suggest a better proposal than I have suggested, I shall be willing to accept but there is no doubt that the present practice »s not business-like. .The little steamer Marranoah left Melbourne on Saturday, went to King Island, unshipped cargo at Stanley, and from there went to Burnie, and the maik she carried reached Queenstown 24 hours before the mails which left Melbourne on Friday by the Nairana. I hope that the Postmaster-General's Department will investigate this matter, and do something to prevent unnecessary delay in the delivery of mails to Tasmania. Only last week I was delayed for three hours at the Heads owing to the fog to which I have referred, and such delays occur week in and week out during the winter months. Some references have been made to black spot in apples. Black spot is caused by a continuous wet season, but it does not affect the flavour of the apple. I suppose that we all have some black spot in us, but if it affects us no more than black spotaffects apples we have nothing to fear. The apple must Tecum to the earth from which it sprang unless it is consumed within a short period after ripening. The apple industry of Tasmania is languishing mow for the lack of markets, not because of ithe black spot. This industry cannot stand the expense incurred in continuous spraying week in and week out. It is far better to allow the people who are starving in European countries to get .apples at a reasonable price - than to let the apples I affected in this way go to wastei. Mr F. MCDONALD (Barton) [4.31] I do mot 'know whether the experience of other honourable members has been the same as mine, but I can assure .the House that cases which have come under my notice compel me to say that the Repatriation Commissioners are not giving to Teturned soldiers and their dependants that sympathetic consideration we might very well expect from them. It is true that their task is a difficult 'one, but the hardest cases they are called upon to handle do not seem to be dealt with sympathetically. I refer to case3 in which men who received injuries at the war, and were, perhaps, operated on, went to work as quickly as possible on their return, and were subsequently unfortunate enough to become ill . Despite the opinion of their private medical man that their illness was traceable to injuries received during the it ; war, the opinion of the medical advisers of the Commission has been that their disability was not due to war service, and the applicants for assistance have not been able to establish the fact that it was. There are even harder cases in which the returned soldier has died through the illness that has come upon him in the circumstances I have just related,- and has left a widow and children, who are unable to establish to the satisfaction of the Repatriation Commission the fact that the father's disability was due to his war service. I shall not say very much in regard to the Repatriation Commission, because I understand that the Government propose some changes, but from investigations I have made. I gather that the Commission has not made sufficient inquiries into some of the cases that have come under my notice, and that too often the stereotyped reply is given, "" Death not due to war service."" It is a very difficult matter-in fact, it is humanly almost impossible for the dependants of a deceased (returned soldier to prove - bhat his death was due to war service. We all remember the statement made by the honoraMe member for Calare { Sir Neville - Howse), - Whom we accept as an authority in these matters, no man who went to the war could ever be the same again. These men were accepted as physically fit; they were injured .at the war, and possibly had to undergo operations during their period of service, and, if after the lapse of years sickness comes upon them and they die, the onus of proving thab their deaths are due to war service should not lie on their dependants. That is altogether too harsh a - condition to impose, a view which I urge the Government to impress upon the Repatriation Commission. Quite a number of cases of this kind have come under my notice, and in not a single instance - has relief .been obtained - as a result of an application to the Commission. Here is a typical letter received by me a few months agoif. wish you to appeal to the Minister for .Repatriation on .my behalf, also for my four fatherless children-fou r boys-for reconsideration to grant me and Children a. pension to help mo 'feed and clothe them. My husband was a - healthy young man when :he went to the war, and was* able to work and keqp mc ,and the children comfortably. When he .came back from the wor he was a very sick and .crippled man, until ""he died and left me and children practically paupers, tit is painful 'for me to .write this, but it is true, and - I think and hope that the Minister for ^Repatriation will reconsider the Deputy Commissioner's decision. I am - sending discharge for you - to have a look at, hoping you will send it back - to me. I 'shall hand this letter to the Minister for Repatriation. T 'find from the. discharge certificate that this man had two years and thirteen days' service in all, and one year and 297 days abroad. He was discharged as medically unfit, not due to misconduct. It is inhuman to tell this woman, who is cast upon individual or State charity, that she must 23rove that her husband's death was due to war service. She told me, when I interviewed her, that no officers from the Commission had come to her to make inquiries. It seems to me that there has been a very incomplete inquiry into this case by the Commission if no officer of the Department has visited her in order to ascertain the facts. I have' had under my notice other cases entailing some more, and others less, hardship, and I think it a great shame that our people should be treated in this way. If the letter from this widow could not move the hearts of the Commissioners, surely the postscript asking for the discharge to be sent back should have done .so. Although the promises made to her and her children have not been kept, she wants that the return of her husband's discharge,' which shows that at one time there was a husband to protect, clothe, and feed her and the children. I understand that steps have been taken to form a committee of honourable members to deal with cases such as this. I trust that it will be given ample power to secure redress. Above all, I urge the Minister to do justice to those who aro suffering in the manner I have mentioned. MrSTEWART (Wimmera-Minister foiWorks and Railways) [4.401 - The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr. Watkins) was good enough i o give me some indication of the cases to which he intended to refer, and although the files kept a|t the central office are not so complete as those in the office of the Deputy Commissioner in the State of New South Wales, still they furnish some information. The honourable member was correct when he said that certain houses to which he referred had 'been faultily constructed. When he first brought the matter under my notice, 'by a telegram, in March last, I informed him, also by 'telegram, that I had had the case inquired into, and had had the defects remedied at the cost of the Commission. The honourable member has'not seen the houses since they were repaired, but he tells us today that he understands the repairs are .not satisfactory. I shall have inquiries made, and if the honourable member's statement is correct the houses will be put in proper order. However, for the information of the honourable members who have referred to the matter of ejectments, I propose to give some figures regarding five cases which have occurred, all in one group of houses at Newcastle. The first case is that of a tenant named Rail, whose arrears amount to £110 Is. 2d. His last payment was on the 29th May, 1923. The second case is that of a man named Mulholland, who owes £128 l is . , his last payment having been made on the 31st August, 1922. The next case is that of a man named Hughes, who owes £80, the last payment having been made on the 22nd June, 1923.",32
113,Mr MCGRATH,COMPULSORY MILITARY,Are these tenants not in good health?,34
114,Mr STEWART,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"I understand that ill health has not been put forward in any of the cases as a reason for the non-payment of rent. The fourth case is that of a man named Alford, who owes 1 £101 3s. Sd., the last payment of £2 having been made on the 3rd March last. The fifth case, the one referred to by the honourable member for Newcastle, is that of a widow named Mrs Dean, who owes £122 19s. 4d. There is no record of the date of the last payment. The Department has had the greatest difficulty ih dealing with these people. They will not leave the houses, and they will not pay rent. We cannot allow them to remain indefinitely as occupants, and the only way in which we can get them out ""is to apply to the Court for ejectment orders. The occupants force this course on the Commission, trusting by press propaganda, and in various other ways, to enlist the sympathy of the public. I am not insinuating that the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) or the Leader of the Opposition"" (Mr Charlton) are deliberately endorsing action of that kind. I have found both those honourable members very fair in all their ' representations, but I quoted those cases, which are among the worse with which we have to deal, to show how extremely difficult it is to handle some of the applicants. Many of those people refuse to reply to letters, or pay rent, and defy the Department to eject them. We cannot allow them to live rent free indefinitely. In every case of genuine hardship through i ll health or other circumstances over which the applicant has no control, the policy of the Department is to extend the fullest sympathy and consideration. While I remain in charge that policy will continue, and if any honourable member knows of a case which warrants special consideration, I shall have it investigated. I promise that, we shall deal sympathetically with every deserving applicant, but I cannot agree to suspend ejectment proceedings where people are deliberately endeavouring to evade their responsibilities. We have dealt firmly with such cases in the past, and shall continue to do so. I cannot, on the spur of the moment, accede to the request of the honourable member for Newcastle, that the ejectment orders be suspended pending a further review of the circumstances, but I shall seek further information by telegram, and if there should be any suggestion of hardship the proposed action of the Department will be reconsidered.",34
115,Mr OKEEFE,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Denison) [4.48] - I endorse the statements of the Leader of the Opposition and other honourable members regarding the hardship that is frequently inflicted on the parents of trainees who neglect their drill. I suppose that while the law remains in its present form, prosecutions must take place, but instances of parents having been unduly penalized are constantly brought before honourable members. The prosecuting officers should be instructed to ask for leniency where it can be shown that the parents are not in a position to pay fines. I know of recent prosecutions in Tasmania in which fines amouuting to several pounds were imposed upon boys, and had to be paid by the parents. This punishment falls very heavily upon parents who are not to blame for the boy's truancy from parades. A common reason why boys will not' attend the drills is that these take place during hours when other boys are able to enjoy that recreation which youth will have. The trainees absent have themselves from drill in spite of parental instruction, but magistrates do not seem to regard the oircumstances of the parents, and impose fines of £ 2 , £ 3 , and £5. That policy is bringing into disrepute the system of compulsory training, and is causing many of us who were believers in it to resolve to abolish it at the first opportunity. The recent disastrous war proved that a great deal of the time and money spent in the military training of youths is wasted, because the methods of warfare are constantly changing. No doubt, the law must be administered, but justice could be tempered with more mercy than is shown at the present time Public servants, after twenty years of service, are entitled to extended furlough, but often they are not in a financial position to take advantage of their holiday. The Grand Council of Public Service Associations, representing all the unions connected with the Public Service, waited upon the Treasurer some time ago, and requested that officers entitled to long-service furlough should receive in advance pay for the period of leave. The Treasurer replied that the matter would be decided after the Prime Minister had returned to Australia.",34
116,Dr EAHLE PAGE,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"I have settled that matter. Mr O'KEEPE - The Treasurer's decision must have been arrived at recently. I am very elad that he has met the reasonable request of the public servants in that regard. On the 22nd November last, the Public Service Arbitrator completed the hearing of evidence in connection with a claim by Federal officers in Tasmania for increased salaries. The award, which was favourable to the officers, was not delivered until the 5th February, because, I understand, the annual vacation intervened. The Act requires that an award shall lay upon the table of the House for 30 days after the assembling of Parliament. Parliament did not meet t ill the 26th March. meant that the increases would not be payable before the 26th A p r i l , or five months after the officers had, by evidence, established their claim. It is not fair that officers should be penalized by a delay for which they were not responsible, and I ask the Treasurer to consider the advisability of dating the increases from the day on which the hearing of evidence was completed.",35
117,Mr LATHAM,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Kooyoug) [5.0] There is a matter affecting the administration of the Postal Department which I desire to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General. the past it has been the practice to pay ladies employed in the Department what is known as a marriage allowance when they retired from the Service and were about to marry. This allowance has been withdrawn, lately, and 'many inquiries have been made as to its reinstatement. It is, I think, desirable that a decision should be arrived at on the point at an early date in order that those ladies to whom this is a matter of considerable importance may know exactly what their position will be.",35
118,Mr DUNCAN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"HUGHES (Boothby) [ 5 . 1 ] - I wish to add a few Avords to the protest made by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) concerning the action of the Government with regard to the export of apples with black spot, which I should be interested to hear explained by the Minister. The honourable member for Perth divided his remarks into two parts. In the first place he inquired what was the authority for the action referred to. I do not wish to say anything about, that. What I am concerned with is the sale of the apples in England. It seems to mc perfectly obvious that even if the export boxes are marked ""' blemished,"" that marking, to all intents and purposes, is useless when the apples arrive at the other side of th© world. Not one person in a hundred buying apples in England will know if the boxes in which they were imported were marked"" blemished "" or not. The apples will be sold in shops in the ordinary way, and if people ask their origin they will be told that they are Australian apples. One honourable member, I understand, suggested that even if the apples showed the black spot on th© outside, they might still That have hearts of gold. I venture to suggest, however, that apples retailed in England will bo sold on their face valuo, not on their heart value. It is unfortunate that the Department should have selected this season in particular for the export exemption to Tasmanian growers. I know that the Tasmanian orchardists are in a most unfortunate position, and my sympathies are with them, but I deny the wisdom of the concessions to Tasmania at. the expense of the good name of the Commonwealth so far as the export of. f r u it is concerned. I endorse what the honourable member for Perth has said. I In hope that a similar course will not be adopted in future, and I trust that 'the regulation will be withdrawn as soon as this year's apple crop has been disposed of, if not before ",35
119,Mr A GREEN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Kalgoorlie) [5.5] - I support the remarks made by the honourable member for Denison (Mr O'Keefe) concerning the position of members of the Postal Sorters TJnion. As the honourable member has mentioned, section 14 of the Arbitration (Public Service) Act provides that every award shall be expressed not to come into operation until a future date, not earlier than after the expiration of 30 days after the award has been laid before both - Houses of the Parliament. Sub-section 3 of the same section requires the Prime Minister, within fourteen days after receipt of the award if the Parliament is then sitting, or, if not, then withgiven. in fourteen days after the meeting of the Parliament, to lay it before both Houses. In the case of the Postal Sorters Union, judgment was given by Mr Atlee Hunt on the 16th November, 1923. Parliament met on the 26th March of this year, so even if the business had been expedited by the Government the award, could not have come into operation until the 26th April. Had Parliament been sitting when the award Was made, it could have come into operation on the 16th December. It appears, therefore, that the postal sorters' increments' have been' withheld for a period of three months and ten days. Members of the Public Service should not be placed in a more difficult position than ordinary' workers. Sir John Gorst, who will be remembered by the older members of the House as a prominent Democrat in . Imperial politics, . laid' down the dictum that the Government should be a model .employer. .In - this case, the Government should give the members of the Postal - Sorters .Union a fair deal. I trust, therefore) that the award will be made retrospective as from the 16th December last.' It is unfair that the incresary, ments which the Arbitrator decided were due to t.hem should have been withheld for so long. I trust that the Ministry will look into this matter and do a simple act of justice to the postal sorters. Another question to which I desire to direct attention is the position of NorthWest coast settlers in regard to fruit supplies.. We areProtectionistsin Western Australia. No doubt the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) and also the honourable member for  me; but, broadly speaking, we are Protectionists in Western Australia. Though we desire to ""sec industries' established in our own State, we are not altogether jealous of the progress made by the manufacturing industries on the eastern sea-board. But when hardship is inflicted upon a certain section of our people, as in the case of residents in the north-west of Western Australia, we feel that we have a just claim for consideration. The people of Wyndham, Broome, Carnarvon, and other sea-ports of the North-West, are unable to get a supply of good tropical fruits.",36
120,Mr GREGORY,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"The trouble is that under the Constitution relief cannot be Mr A GREEN"" - I know that the Constitution Act prohibits discrimination between one portion of Australia and another, but I am wondering if the Minister for Trade and Customs has authority to make some temporary arrangement to enable our people settled there to obtain the necessary supplies until such time as. we are able to grow bananas and other tropical fruits in the North-West. At present the people are interested chiefly in the pastoral industry and pearl shelling. They have no time for fruit-growing, even if it were demonstrated that bananas could be successfully grown there. An arrangement such as I suggest would not injure the Queensland banana industry. There are about 6,000 residents in the North-West.  remarks apply to the whole of Western Australia.",36
121,Mr A GREEN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,No ; we can get fine Australian bananas in Perth or Fremantle at a reasonable price. ,36
122,Mr A GREEN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"We can. If necesI could bring some across, with the Perth prices, to prove my statement. In the circumstances, if we can come to some arrangement to enable the people of the North-West to get tropical fruits, I shall be prepared to allow the duty on bananas to stand. The residents there are completely isolated. They rarely get fresh vegetables. The coastal steamer service is not at all satisfactory. Vessels leave Fremantle every four weeks. Even if Queensland bananas could be transhipped at Fremantle and sent away to North-West coast ports at once, they would arrive in a condition unfit for human Consumption. An attempt has been made to cater for their needs, but without success. I have had numerous requests and telegrams from people throughout the north-west . of Western Austraha asking for this concession. If what I have suggested would, in the slightest degree, injure the banana industry in Queensland or the northern portion, of New South Wales, I would not urge the Minister to take action in the d.rection indicated. Unless the Government are prepared to admit bananas free of duty, provision should be made for settlers in the north-western portion of Western Australia to obtain supplies from Java or some of the Dutch Islands. Some effort must be made to give these people an opportunity of obtaining tropical fruits.",36
123,Mr GABB,COMPULSORY MILITARY,""" Yes, we have no bananas.""",37
124,Mr A GREEN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"It may be a laughing matter to the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb), but it is one of great importance to the people whom I represent. As the ports on the North-West coast are within three days' steam of Java, the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Austin Chapman) might make some arrangement, if only of a temporary nature, whereby bananas from Java could be admitted free of duty, and thus meet the requirements of many deserving people in that portion of the Commonwealth. My copiments must not be regarded as an indication of opposition to the present protective policy of the Government, because I say, "" Good luck to Australian industries,"" and trust that will prosper. I cannot, however, see anything attractive in a policy which provides lucrative employment for a large number of workmen and substantial profits for manufacturers in some States, whilst"" others in an isolated portion of the Commonwealth are deprived of real necessities and benefits enjoyed by those in more thickly-populated centres.",37
125,Mr GREGORY,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Swan) [5.17] - The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr. A. Green), I know; realizes that under the Constitution it is impossible for the Minister for Trade and Customs to differentiate between States in the matter of Customs duties. The honourable member, in common with others who recognise the great hardships experienced by those endeavouring te settle and develop that portion of Western Australia to which he refers, should realise that his best course, in order to achieve his objective, is to join with those who protest against the high duty imposed upon imported bananas. I do not think Parliament, when imposing a duty of 8s. 4d. per 100 lb. on imported bananas, realized the effect of its action. Prior to the imposition of a duty the trad© with F i j i was worth £800,000 a year to Australia, and our trade with F i j i was valued at £250,000 a year. Our trade is now practically worthless, because we say, in effect, that we do not want their business, as we are endeavouring to settle people on land worth £100 an acre in Queensland. To do this the people of Western Australia experience considerable hardship.  does the honourable member suggest?",37
126,Mr GREGORY,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"I ask the honourable member for Hume to consider the distance between Queensland and the north-western port3, and to realise the time taken and expense incurred in carrying fruit between those centres. I do not agree with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A. Green) when ha says that consideration should b© given only to those in the north-western portion of the State, because people in the southern portion of the State are equally penalized in this regard. A gentleman engaged in the banana-growing industry expended £3,500 in endeavouring to establish a banana plantation at Carnarvon, and failed. Representatives of Queensland must admit that the banana is a fruit which deteriorthey ates very rapidly, and, consequently, heavy losses are incurred when consignments are transported a considerable distance. If the Constitution permitted it th© Government should admit bananas into Western Australia free of duty, and I am hoping that when the Constitution is amended-realizin g how a Protective Tariff inflicts hardship on .all industries in Western Australia-consideratio n will be given to this aspect of the question. Large tracts of territory in Western: Australia, on which there is room for hundreds of thousands of people, are awaiting development, and the time must come when the Constitution will be. 1 amended in such a way that consideration can be shown to one State a& against another* or special concession* granted to Western Australia. While the Constitution remains as it is at present, the Minister for Trade and Customs, or the Government, cannot differentiate in the matter of Custom* . duties. In the meantime, we are justified in - asking the Government, when giving lations consideration to Tariff anomalies, to see territory, have been .strained. whether it is possible to make a conthe cession in regard to a f r u it , the cinal and food values of which candistinctly not be questioned. Prior to the introduction of the Tariff, we were building up a fair trade with Java, as Australian goods were exported, and fairly large consignments of bananas were shipped bulk to Western Australian ports. A times a fair proportion of overripe bananas, which would have been useless if taken to Perth, were sold at reasonOn able rates on the boats at the different ports of call; but since the imposition a duty the residents of Western Ausbut tralia, and particularly those in trie North-West, have had to do without f r u When the Government are considering the Tariff amendments, I trust they will see if a reduction in the duty cannot made in order to ' g i v e these people whom reference has been made an opporwhich tunity to obtain supplies of a commodity which is a necessity, particularly to the young folk.  desire to support the remarks of the honi orable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A Green) on behalf of those people in the fenced against these pests. for North-West, who arc unable to obtain supplies of f r u it . I do not think, ever, that an exception should be made vouring to combat these pests. in their case alone, because if a differentiation could be made the whole State should participate. Prior to the placing of a duty upon imported bananas, a reciprocal trade was in operation beturers. tween Western Australia and Java; and the people in that country were beginment ning to import grapes, apples, flour, chaff, and other Australian products, and Western Australian people were receiving in return tropical fruit s that could be obtained from other ports. An atplentifu l in Western Australia. tempt has been made to transport bananas from the eastern States to K goorlie, and, although the carriage rail was fairly rapid, it was not a ticable proposition, as the very quick terioration and high freight made the price at which they were sold excessive. Even when a limited supply was availstroying able at Kalgoorlie, bananas were a luxury, and not a poor man's f r u it . has been pointed out by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), we canfactory not differentiate between States u n t Constitution is amended. Our trade rew i th F i j i , although it is British Prior to introduction of the Tariff, the trade medibalance of approximately £400,000 was in Australia's favour. The honourable member for Lang (Sir Elliot Johnson) read a communication from certain large importers and users of wire netting in which it was stated that in the Tariff Board was expected to make t full inquiry into both sides of any question it was considering before making a recommendation to the Minister. the question of wire netting, the Board consulted the representatives of the of manufacturers-ther e were only twono consideration whatever was shown to the many thousands who have to use it . this article. This is an aspect of the matter which the Minister should caref u l ly consider. In Australia we have to be contend, not only with the rabbit, an to imported pest, but also with the dingo, is a descendant of dogs brough*into this country by the Dutch 300 or 400 years ago. Both pests are plentiful, and special fencing is required to protect stock and crops from them. The settlers n Australia are inconvenienced, and their . lands rendered practically useless, unless It is most unreasonable that Parliament should im howpose burdens on settlers who are endeaThe Tariff Board should see that the protection and settlement of our vast areas is of more importance than the protection of the interests of a couple of manufacSettlers are severely handicapped, it is unreasonable to provide employfor workmen and profits for manufacturers at the expense of the over the taxed settler. During 30 years the rabbits have made an onward march not across the continent, and are now The Government took the precaution of a l - erecting two lines of wire netting, by each about 1,000 miles in length, pracbut these have proved ineffective, and dethe pastures and crops of the settlers are now being destroyed by rabbits, and in parts of the State dingoes are also destock. Settlers in Western Australia are now spending very, large sums As in erecting thousands of miles of verminproof fencing. If wire netting of a satisquality can be made in Australia, il the and sold as cheaply as the imported article, by all means let our netting be purchased from local manufacturers, but the unfortunate people who require that commodity should not be called upon to bolster up industries that are far less important to this country than theirs. Poison carts are employed in tlte endeavour to eradicate the rabbit. settlers might as well try to sweep back the ocean tide. Their land must be wire netted if they are to prosper at all. The price of this article is now double what it was in 1914. Since most people cannot afford to purchase it at the present figure, there should bo no hindrance to their acquiring it at the lowest possible price. About eighteen monts ago I endeavoured to secure 10 miles of netting. The quotation in the eastern States was £62 per mile, ancl the lowest price 1 could get in Western Australia was £64. If I find it a bad financial proposition to fence my property with netting at that price', how much more unfortunate must be the position of young settlers who are called upon to meet such an expense before they have obtained a return from their land? It costs £400 to fence a 640-acre block. If the Tariff Board had not listened to the views of, I was going to say, the profiteers associated with the manufacture of netting, it would have given different advice from that received by the Government.",37
127,Mr FORDE,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Capricornia) [5.38] - I should not have spoken at this stage had it not been for the unwarranted attack by the honourable member for Swan (M.r. Gregory) and the honourable member for  party members-o n the banana industry. It is evident from their remarks, however conscientious they may have been, that they are not ai* fait with the conditions in that industry, which is giving employment directly to approximately 3,200 people, and indirectly to over 10,000 persons, in Queensland. The honourable member for Forrest has referred to certain grievances and anomalies, the blame for which he attributes to the present Government. Yet in everydivision in this House the honourable member, who is Deputy Whip to the party opposite, is seen running about, as last night, to whip up supporters to save the Government from defeat. I warn the electors of the insincerity of certain honourable members, who on grievance day give voice to a lot of meaningless grievances about the wrongs being done to the backbone of the country, but who, when there comes a crucial test on a vital question, are most active in rounding up the supporters of the GoThe vernment. The honourable member for Forrest has spoken of the awful doings of the Tariff Board. Was he not a party, to its establishment? Did he not by his vote approve of its appointment? Did he not also vote for the appointment of a Commission to administer the Federal Capital Territory, thereby taking that matter out of the hands of Parliament? I appeal'to honourable members opposite to be consistent, and support the Labour party in its efforts to re-establish responsible government. Let them support by their vote what the Country party used to plead for-the restoration of parliamentary control. I represent an electorate in which there are thousands of banana-growers. Suggestions have been made which, if given effect, would lead to the removal of the protection afforded to the banana industry, with the result that 3,200 growers of this fruit in Australia would be practically ruined because of the importation of hundreds of thousands of pounds' worth of bananas from countries where black labour is employed. I be- * lieve this Parliament stands for the protection not only of the secondary but also of the primary industries against the 7>roducts of black labour. There are 16,000 acres uuder bananas in Australia. Queensland is the greatest bananagrowing State in the Commonwealth. In 1916-17 the plantations covered an area of 11,795 acres, and in 1921-22 had' increased to approximately 16,000 acres. The value of the yield in 1916-17 was £232,481. In 1921-22 it was £732,758. Are we to hand that over to F i j i and Java? I say ""no."" Today, about 10,000 acres of land is 1 under banana plants that have not come into bearing. I admit that there is a temporary shortage of this fruit, but it is due to the ravages of the bunchytop disease in the northern rivers district of New South Wales. That disease has reduced banana - production in northern New South Wales very considerably. Next spring, however, the production in Australia will at least be ample for local requirements, even if - there is not a surplus. The growers are not receiving - undue protection, because up to the 2lst May., 1922, the import duty was 2s. 6d. per Mental, or three-tenths .of a penny per.lt>.., and on that date the rate was increased to Id. per lb. Considering that the growerj of .oranges and lemons are protected by a duty of I d . per lb., and of apples, pears, peaches, and other fnesh fruits 6s. per central, or f d . per lb., - the banana industry is not unduly (protected. It should be remembered that apples, pears, peaches, and other fresh fruits, including oranges and lemons, are grown much nearer big centres of population than the localities where bananas are produced. Many o? the 'banana-growers of Queensland axe .under a great disadvantage on this o.TOount. In my electorate, - for instance, titey have to cart their f r u it sometimes 2-5, 30, and even 40 miles to the nearest, uuul often a small, railway station. In F i j i , from which the eastern States of Australia obtained all theiT bananas before the industry in the Commonwealth was built up, the labour is done by imported Indians, whose wages amount to from Is. to 2s. per day, as compared with 12s. to 14s. ,per day paid in Australia. IT we are to maintain a fair standard of living for the people engaged in the industry here, we must give some protection to those who are prepared to employ white men, and who ,are bringing up white families. Mr John Warburton,- the Conference Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society of Australia .stated, in his - evidence - before the Interstate Commission, in 1918.:Tn. Fiji, among the Indian coolies, the indentane system has 'been broken, and the planters will he obliged to give a - higher price. Instead of jiaying Is. per day, as the standard now is, tncy will probably iiave to pay even 2s. per day for ordinary labour. N,o true Australian can have any doubt as to the need for the protection of an Australian industry against competition such ,as would have to be met from Fiji. ' As I have already indicated, ther.e will be plenty of bananas after this winter to meet Australian requirfimen-ts, ewen assnming that the ,bunchy->top disease will «onturae to affect the plantations in northern New SoTitib. Wales. For some time after the duty on bananas was imposed the wholesale price in Melbourne Mr Forde. was cheaper than it had been before the duty was levied. I '.submit that the impost is not exoessive, and that the Queensland 'climate as eminently .suited for the growing of '.this fruit. Parliament should have no hesitation about granting .the necessary protection to those who have - established banana farms dm the scrub country of Australia, - and are endeavoring to make a living under white labour conditions. We cannot .allow the F i j i grower to compete unfairly .against the Australian grower. The banana industry is promoting land settlement in the tropical and subtropical parts of Australia. If it were not for the banana .and sugar industries, we should not be able to develop the northeastern fringe of Australia as it .is being developed .today. Mention bas been made of the facit .that Amtaatiaa exportation to F i j i has .fallen fo'ff. I admit, to a certain - extent, the .truth of that, but the circumstance 'is not wholly attributable to the fact that Fijians cannot .send bananas to Australia. That statement is .a pretext for seeking to remove protection from the Australian grower. In 1918-19, Australian exnorts to F i j i amounted to £443,9.81; in 192223, they amounted to £352,744. Those figures certainly represent a decrease, but the duty .on bananas is not wholly responsible for that, although the imports of bananas from F i j i to Australia in 1917-18 were £125,083, and in 1922-23 were nil. That - amount of money has been kept in Australia to tenable the bamana-growers of northern New. South Wales and Queensland to make a living by employing Australian labour. Most of the banana-growers are struggling men. They are workers from the farms, the rail-, way lines, the mines, and the construction camps, who have put their savings into the business. Many of them occupy leasehold land in different parts of my electorate, where they are struggling to make a living. I would be recreant to the .trust placed in me by the people who sent me here if I listened, without protest, to the statements of some of the honourable members who sit on the corner benches. It is a shame that alleged Countiy . party representatives should come here and endeavour to 'set one 'section - of primary producers at the throats of another section. Recently, when I was in Perth, Western Australia, I went to several fruiterers and found - that I could huy bananas at Is. 6cl. a dozen. Certainly they told me that there was some difficulty in getting continuity of supplies, which was said to be owing chiefly to the inadequate means of transport. I believe that something can be done - to provide cheaper transport between Queensland and Western Australia, thus - enabling banana-growers to place on the markets of the western State adequate supplies of bananas at a reasonable price. 'The banana-growers of Queensland are in favour of supplying the wants of the consumers of Australia at a reasonable price, but they object to being exploited. I am pleased to be able to say that owing to the action of the Queensland Labour Government in launching a progressive scheme for marketing farmers' produce, exploitation by middlemen and sharks who handle the produce is being prevented. When members of the Opposition attack these profiteers and exploiters, who are filching from the man on the land his hard-earned reward, where are the honourable members of the Country party to be found ? They get behind this Flinderslane Government and support it in bolstering up this kind of thing. I appeal to them not to attack the Queensland banana-growers, but to treat justly the primary producers of Australia engaged in growing fruit, whether in Victoria or Queensland. If their object to benefit the primary producer, they will come behind the Australian Labour party, which stands for a fair deal for all producers, whether they work on the farm or in the factories.  I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Austin Chapman) the urgent necessity that exists for .taking advantage of an offer that has been made to the Government by a British shipping firm to provide a direct shipping service - with refrigerated space to Eastern ports, particularly to Shanghai and Hong Kong, at competitive rates. There is an immense trade available to us in China, but we are losing it to America and other countries, because we have no direct shipping service with the East. The population of China is rapidly becoming westernized in the matter of both food and clothing, and there is no doubt that Australia could do an immense trade with that country if we had a direct shipping service. We could export to it flour, fruit, butter, leather, and a hundred and one other commodities that we produce. It has been said that the average Chinaman is so poor that he cannot buy our butter, fruit, and other produce; but we are apt to forget that in China the population is so immense<-it is something like 500,000,000-that even if only 5 per cent, had sufficient wealth to buy our goods, they, would provide an immense market for us. China is geographically nearer to us than to America, and is our natural market in that respect. It is much nearer than Great Britain, to which we send most of our produce. About twelve months ago I introduced a deputation to the Minister with the object of interesting him and the Government i d a proposal to subsidize a direct line of shipping to the East. The trade which we could have built up there we have not obtained, because the shipping service is very irregular . It is also indirect, necessitating transhipments; thei'e is little or no refrigerated space; and freight rates are excessive. The Minister informed the members of that deputation that if we would come forward with a .concrete proposal, it would receive sympathetic consideration. A little time ago, I introduced .a second deputation, consisting of representatives of the wheat corporation, is the flour millers, the fruit-growers, the butter exporters, the bacon curers, the leather. manufacturers, and representatives af many other important interests. We placed before the Minister a definite offer made by William Crosby and Company, on behalf of Ellerman, Bucknall and Company, to provide a six-weekly regular service to Shanghai and Hong Kongfor a subsidy ol £40^00 a year. The firm also undertook, if sufficient freight were offering, to provide, in return for an additional subsidy of £1*0 ,'000 a yeai, a monthly instead of a six-weekly service. The offer included the provision of ample refrigerated space at very reasonable rates, which were particularly acceptable to exporters, and the carrying of ordinary freight at rates not exceeding those prevailing between America and China or Great Britain and China. It was a particularly good offer in view of ithe fact that, should anything in the nature of a freight war arise, the firm would have to drop its freight rates to meet the competition. After that second deputation to the Minister one of the Melbourne daily newspapers published articles strongly criticizing the proposals put forward as "" spoonfeeding the producers."" It was stated in those articles that a Japanese firm of shippers was already providing an ample shipping service between Austraha and the ports referred to. Although I wrote a letter to that newspaper refuting the published statements, it refused to publish it. I now wish to take the opportunity of saying that there was no foundation in fact for the statements made in the articles. The president of the Export Section of the Chamber of Commerce conducted long negotiations with the Japanese firm in an endeavour to get from it an undertaking that it would provide a regular service with the East. He was unable to obtain any satisfaction. It is incorrect to say that a regular service is being run to the East .today by a Japanese shipping firm. That firm, as far as I know, provides no refrigerated space, without which any shipping service to the East is of very Little use. Most of our produce requires to be shipped in cool chambers. Not very long ago, when the question arose whether the Government should subsidize a great secondary industry in Australia-the locomotive-building industry - it did not take very long for the Government to make up its mind that it would be advantageous to Australia to subsidize that industry to the extent of £50,000 on a certain contract. I do not find fault with that action, but if the Government considers it reasonable to subsidize a great secondary industry to the extent of £50,000, and can make up its mind on the point with a certain amount of rapidity, it is extraordinary that twelve months should elapse before it can reach a decision regarding a £40,000 subsidy to provide a shipping service to the East. If it is fair to subsidize a secondary industry it cannot be unreasonable to subsidize a primary industry. A subsidy for this shipping service would not be a subsidy, because the exporters of product's to China could not charge prices in excess of the ruling market rates. The subsidy would merely provide them with a means of getting their produce to the waiting market, where they would have to sell it in competition with the produce  of other countries. In view of the remarkable speech made by the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) at the Sydney Royal Show recently, when he stated that it was the intention of the Government to earmark a certain proportion of the Customs revenue for the purpose of subsidizing shipping to assist the primary producer, it is incomprehensible to me that the Government should turn this proposal down. I urge the Minister to take advantage of the offer without delay. Doubtless it cannot remain open indefinitely, and further delay may cause it to be withdrawn.",39
128,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Eden Monaro-Minister for Trade and Customs) [6.0] - The Government realise the value of the Eastern trade, and are making full inquiries into the matters that have been spoken of. The subject has also been referred to the Board of Trade. We want information, not from interested parties, but from responsible men over whom we have a measure of control. The request of the honourable  a shipping subsidy has been before the Government for some time. He probably knows that, since he waited on me with a deputation asking for a subsidy, another vessel has been placed on the Eastern trade route without the payment of any subsidy at all.  3pace ?",42
129,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"I have not the details. The vessel is certainly carrying cargo. The Government are anxious tq encourage trade between Australia and the East with its teeming millions, but a proposal to pay £1,000 a week as a shipping subsidy cannot be dealt with in five minutes. Mr E. RILEY - Will the House have an opportunty to consider any proposed shipping subsidy?",42
130,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"That will depend upon the action the Government may determine to take. If that direct action is such that the Government should shoulder the responsibility for it, we, like any other self-respecting Government, would take that responsibility, for I fail to see how the honourable member for Gippsland draws an analogy between the locomotive contract and a shipping subsidy. ",42
131,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"I believe that the action, of the Government in placing the locomotive contract in Australia, thus giving employment to Australians, met with the approbation of the great majorit y of the people. It is extraordinary how various are the standpoints from which Tariff matters ate viewed. For instance, for placing a dumping duty on wire netting I have been taken to task by the very people who applauded mo loudly and vigorously when I put a clumping duty on South A f r i c an maize, because that country gave cheap railway freight from the point of production to the point of export. If a dumping duty had not been imposed on wire netting, who would have received the benefit? Not the settler or pastoralist. We know that the Australian wire is the best and cheapest. As a sufficient quantity of wire netting cannot be obtained from Great B r it a in to supply the Australian pastoralists and the men on the land, the importer is - compelled to sell some Australian wive and some imported wire, whether there is a dumping duty or not. The dumping duty takes the extra profit fro m the importer. I am not quite satisfied of the sincerity and earnestness of the gentleman who says that he is the largest importer of wire in this country, aud that the dumping duty is a bad thing for Australia. What would happen if wire netting were not manufactured in this countiy ? The manufacture of wire in Great Britain is controlled by a combine. We know what happens when there is no competition, in industry. At present, thousands of Australian working men, earning decent wages, and consuming the primary products of this country, are engaged in manufacturing wire netting.",43
132,Mr MANN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Th c Government cutting out competition. . Mr AUSTEN"" CHAPMAN - The r e is such a thing as unfair competition. Does the honourable member, think it fair to charge £8 a ton more for wire netting in Great Bri t a in than in Australia? The British manufacturers supply their own customers and then cut prices to get a market in Australia. The honourable member is consistent, because he believes in buying the cheapest article at all times. I cannot understand any man who does not desire the progress of Australiau in dustries.",43
133,Mr HILL,COMPULSORY MILITARY,It is in the interest of Australian producers that the Government are asked for the shipping subsidy.,43
134,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Does not the honourable member think that we should make thorough inquiries before agreeing to an expenditure of £40,000? Thei Government were wise in delaying their decision, as, in the meantime, an extra boat has been put on the Eastern trade route.",43
135,Mr HILL,COMPULSORY MILITARY,I do not think refrigerated space is provided on that boat.,43
136,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"The provision of the extra vessel is a healthy sign. In imposing a dumping duty I simply carried out the law. Section 4 of the Industries Preservation Act readsTf the Minister is satisfied, after inquiry aiid report by the Tariff Board, that goods exported to Australia, which are of a class and kind produced or manufactured in Australia, have been or are being sold to an importer in Australia at an export price which is less than thu fair market value of the goods at the time of shipment, and that detriment may thereby result to an Australian industry, the Minister may publish a notice in the Gazette specifying the goods as to which he is so satisfied.""",43
137,Mr GREGORY,COMPULSORY MILITARY,I contend that there is no home market.,43
138,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"B r it a in consumes 70 per cent, of its own wire netting.",43
139,Mr GREGORY,COMPULSORY MILITARY,Nothin g of the sort.,43
140,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,Then the information obtained by the Tariff Board and the Government officials must be wrong.,43
141,Mr GREGORY,COMPULSORY MILITARY,My authority is a telegram that I received from the Agent General for Western Australia in London.,43
142,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"The honourable member's policy is to import goods are manufactured across the seas. He advocates the introduction of bananas from ' F i j i , where the natives work for 2s. a day. Without a Protective Tariff, how could we pay white men's wages? Section 4 of the Industries Preservation Ac t continuesUpon the publication of the notice there shall be charged, collected, and paid to the use of the King for the purposes of the Commonwealth, on those goods imported into Australia, a special duty (in this section referred to as ""the dumping duty""). The amount of the dumping duty, in each case shall be the sum which represents the difference between a fair market value of the goods at the time of shipment and the export price. In accordance with the requirements of the Act, the question of imposing a ing duty on wire netting was referred to the Tariff Board for inquiry and report. After long and careful inquiry the Board was satisfied that wire netting was being dumped into Australia, and that such dumping was detrimental to the Australian wire-netting industry. This being so, there is no alternative to granting the Australian industry the protection provided by Parliament in the Industries Preservation Act. If any one is to be taken to task for the dumping duty it is Parliament, since it passed this Act. I suggest to the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) that, if he objects to the dumping duty, his best course is to have the Act taken from the statute-book of Australia.",43
143,Mr GREGORY,COMPULSORY MILITARY,I have tried my best to do that.,44
144,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"The honourable member's failure proves that the majority of the people are against him. This is a Protectionist country. Our people believe in a White Australia, the payment of white men's wages, and the preservation of our industries so that wo can provide for our own requirements instead of importing from overseas. To hold this continent we must populate it, and this cannot be done unless we have sufficient industries to keep our men in employment. The imposition of the dumping duty does not affect the price of the netting to the farmer.",44
145,Mr GREGORY,COMPULSORY MILITARY,That is nonsense.,44
146,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"The importers of wire netting charge the farmers the same price as is charged for Australian netting. If an importer imports netting at a lower price than that of Australian netting, he does not pass on the advantage to the farmer-h e merely pockets the extra profit.",44
147,Mr GREGORY,COMPULSORY MILITARY,What is that statement worth 1,44
148,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"The price of netting in Australia is less than the fair market value in England. This is due to the existence in Australia of wire netting mills and the payment of bounty on the netting produced. In England the price of wire netting for home consumption is fixed by an association, and if the Australian industry were crushed out, and the trade of Australia left in the hands of the British makers, there is every reason to believe that the prices to dump- Australia would also be fixed by the British association. I can prove these facts to any honourable member who has a doubt about them. It has been said that the demand in Britain for wire netting is small. A very important factor is that the British association gives a rebate of 6£ per cent, for purchases of to 250,000 yards (140 miles) for home consumption.",44
149,Mr GREGORY,COMPULSORY MILITARY,Has the Minister not received a reply from the High Commissioner? I have already had word from the Agent-General for Western. Australia in London.,44
150,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"The chief point for consideration, however, is not the prices, important though they are, but the capacity of the British mills to supply Australia's requirements. Their total output is less than that of Australia. Out of their total production, they require for home consumption four-fifths of what they make, only one-fifth or thereabouts coming to Australia. Thus the competition of the Australian mills not only keeps the prices down, but is absolutely essential to an adequate supply of wire netting to the Commonwealth. Without the products of the Australian mills many thousands of square miles of country would be unprotected from the rabbits and wild dogs. Britain does not produce enough wire netting to supply our needs, and if that country were allowed to dump wire netting here, extra profit would be"" placed in the pockets of the importers. It would make no difference whatever to the men in this country who need the wire netting. Everybody admits that the Australian-made wire nett ng is superior to that made in : Great Britain. I cannot see that the honourable members who addressed themselves to this subject have any reason for complaint. The amount of money involved is very small, and honourable members should remember the old adage, "" Prevention is better than . cure."" If the manufacturers in England find that they cannot dump the netting in Australia at from £ 6 to £ 8 per ton less than they sell it to the people of Great Britain, they will soon cease the practices which necessitated the imposition of this duty. Wo must think, not only of the farmers and graziers who use wire netting, but also of the 4,000 men employed in the Australian wire-netting industry. We must think, too, of the men who work in our iron and coal mining, and limestone-burning industries. We must also consider our transport workers. This is a big industry. If we allow wire netting to come into this country at the price the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) wishes to pay for it , what will become of the thousands of employees engaged in the Australian industry? Would he have us close down our coal mines and cease working our iron ore deposits ? ' What would become of Australia if we pursued to its logical conclusion the policy he advocates?",44
151,Mr GREGORY,COMPULSORY MILITARY,I would close down those industries before I would kill the farmers.,45
152,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"We are not doing anything that will kill the mers. I defy the honourable member to contradict my assertion that British wire netting is sold more cheaply in Australia than in Great Britain. The farmer would not get cheaper wire netting >f we removed the dumping duty. The wire manufactured in Australia is the best, and is sold more cheaply than the imported wire.",45
153,Mr GBEOOBY,COMPULSORY MILITARY,Why should we worry to fight for the importer?,45
154,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"That is exactly what the honourable member is doing, although I think he does not realise it. I have given the facts, and, they show that he is actually fighting for the importer. ;""",45
155,Mr GREGORY,COMPULSORY MILITARY,I am not fighting for him.,45
156,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"The facts prove that the honourable member is doing so. The farmers and graziers in Australia are getting better and cheaper wire netting than are the users of wire netting in Great Britain. In those circumstances for whom, other than the importers, is the honourable member fighting? The farmer is not in any worse position with the dumping duty than he would be without it . The same thing applies to the dumping duty on primary products. We have heard an eloquent speech this evening on the subject of bananas. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mt. A. Green) wishes us to make Tariff distinctions between different parts of Australia. We shall need to alter the Constitution before that can be done. On every occasion when that has been attempted,' the results have been disastrous. Is it a fair thing for that honourable member to contend that we should let 16,000 acres in Queensland and a considerable area of land in New South Wales on which bananas are being grown by white labour, revert to its original bush, state in order that we may obtain bananas from Java and Fiji, where they are grown by Indians who are paid 2s. a day? We are spending a considerable sum of money in Australia to eliminate bunchy-top, ancl I think that we shall succeed. Are we to give no consideration to our own people and our own country? Such a policy will not find favour with the j>eople of Australia. The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) drew attention far- to the desirableness of amending the Superannuation Act. I remind him that the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde), on the 2nd April, 1924, asked the Treasurer the following question, upon notice: Whether he will take early action to have - section 36 of the Superannuation Act of 1922 amended in pursuance of his promise in this House while discussing ' the Estimates last year, in order to bring in those officers who had been taken over from a State Service, .but who had not .been ton years in the Commonwealth Public Servico at the date of their retirement or death V The Treasurer {Dr Earle Page) made the following reply: It is the intention of the Government to submit a Bill to Parliament during the present session for the purpose of amending the Superannuation Act of 1922. When 'the amending Bill is heing prepared, .consideration will be given to the claims of the officers referred to. Honourable members know that when the Treasurer promises a thing, it is as good as done.",45
157,Mr SCULLIN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"I suggest to the Minister that the Government should introduce the Bill early, because many officers wno are concerned wish to know how many units they may subscribe for..",45
158,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"The point mentioned by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) is ,a good one, and the matter will be considered. The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) made a request for the remission of duty which had been paid on certain yarn for the Daylesford woollen mills. The case seems to be a hard one, but I am afraid that very little relief can be given, because the yarn was imported after the Tariff had been imposed. was a deferred duty, and it is impossible in such a case to make a refund. However, I shall look carefully into the matter, and if the honourable member can show me a way in which relief can be given, I assure him that I will consider the matter favourably. This is a co-operative company, the directors of which receive no payment; and, so far as I know, no dividends have been declared. W it h respect to the exportation of blaek-spot apples, the facts are simple. Tasmania, last season, had a very poor apple crop, nnd a number of small f r u it growers waited upon the Government.and asked for relief from restrictions which, if not . altered, would mean ruin . Honourable members know that on account of the wet season last year many apples were slightly more spotted than usual. It was pointed out to the Government that unless relief were given, many small orchardists would be ruined. Mr O ' KEEFE - That is the fact.",45
159,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Their duty representations were considered by the F r u it Council. I have been taken task by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) because the Western. tralian representative on the F r u cil was unable to attend the meeting. could not compel hi m to do so, though should have been glad had he been there. Thr majorit y of the F r u it Council s quired into the circumstances, and recomExhibition. mended that permission be granted export the apples, because,, in their opinion, no harm would be clone to the oversea' market. In addition to obtaining the. opinion of the F r u it Council, I cablegram to the H i gh Commissioner .London to ascertain whether any serious effects would follow the export of the f r u it , f told him that the cases containing f r u it would be marked "" blemished "" so that thei-e 'could be no misunderstandsuch ing, and I also stated that no apples under a certain size, or with broken skins, would be packed. The H i g sioner replied that the market would bo affected by the sale of this f r u it if proper precautions were taken in Engcommitted. land. Honourable members may be sure that not only were proper precautions taken on the other side, but suitable cautions were taken on this side also. By temporarily amending the regulations the Government gave the small orchardable It ists in Tasmania an opportunity to save their homes and their orchards, and I do not think that the slightest damage was done to anybody. The exports from Tasmania have been much smaller than usual. That has been due to the bad season, and also to the careful inspection of the f r u it offered for export. The difference between last season and a normal season was tremendous, and, in the circumstances, I think that the Government did the right thing. It is not always possible to confine trade within strictly defined limits, and the Government cannot be blamed for giving temporary relief to the Tasmanian growers in respect of the last apple crop, especially as it acted on the advice of the F r u it Council and their the High Commissioner. Surely it was proper to act mercifully towards the small orchardists. U p to date, about 47,000 or 50,000 cases of these apples have been sold. I agree that in ordinary circumstances it is dangerous to interfere with the customary trade procedure, but when extraordinary circumstances arise it. is the of a Minister to take his courage in his hands, and do what he believes to to be best in the interests of an industry. At the same time, I think that we Ausought to do all we can to maintain it Couna high standard for our exports to I England. The most severe criticism in I respect of these apples came fro m an ex-member of this Parliament, Mr Orchard, in - a Commissioner of the British Empire He condemned our action in to unmeasured terms, but I was able to prove to him subsequently that we were justified in doing as we did, and he was manly enough to admit it . He had seen sent a only the condemned apples, and not those in we were allowing to go. Mr O ' KEEFE - No person who knew this the facts could do otherwise.",46
160,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"If some action had not been taken by the Government, many small orchardists would have lost their homes and their h Commisfortunes. If a similar set of circumnot stances arose, I would commit the same f a u l t again-if , indeed, a f a u l t has beeu I think these people were entitled to reasonable consideration, and so are the Australian banana-growers, notprewithstanding the remarks of honourable members who favour the importation of F i j i an bananas. I suggest to those honormembers that they should encourage the people in the north-west of Australia to grow bananas. I admit that it was unfortunate that the representative of Western Australia was unable to attend the meeting of the Fruit Council which agreed to permit the export of the Tasmanian black-spot apples, but the majority of its members were at the meeting which made that decision. That action prevented the ruin of a great many small orchardists, and the market has not been .seriously affected.",46
161,Mr SPEAKER,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Rt.Hon. W. A. Watt). - Does the Minister desire to continue his remarks after the dinner adjournment ? Honorable MEMBEBS - Hear , hear!",47
162,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"I have dealt with all the matters that I can deal with in the time at my disposal, and I am afraid that in so doing I have won approbation from the wrong quarter. If the honourable members whose complaints have not been dealt with will see me at my office, I shall be pleased to do what I can for them. Question resolved in the negative.",47

164,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Hunter) [8.1] - I draw attention to the length of time for which the Commissioners are to be appointed, namely, five, four, and three years respectively. Five years is too long. Three years is sufficient. Before five years have expired, there may be some necessity to change the policy. It would be very difficult to dismiss the Commissioners before their term of office had expired. Unless they are found guilty of wrong-doing as Commissioners, there is no power to get rid of them. If they were dismissed they would have a claim against the Commonwealth. By the time three years have elapsed, we should have some 1 idea of the success or otherwise of, the new system of control. The Government may then see the folly of their action; but if these men were removed from office they would require to be compensated. If the Commission were such a success that we desired to continue it , we could, at the end of two or three years, renew the appointments.",47
165,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"If we are to attract good men to the position, we must give them some reasonable tenure of ofiice.",47
166,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"An appointment for three years, with the right of renewal at the end of that period, subject to the satisfactory working of the Commission, would be a sufficient inducement to a good man ",47
167,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,There is not the same security.,47
168,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Thre e years is quite sufficient. Many good men enter this House for three years.,47
169,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,They do not always remain that long.,47
170,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"This is experimental legislation. We do not know whether or not it will be a success. The CommisDAB WIN. sion may not be. required after a year"" or two. I had intended to move an amendment, but I do not want to delay the business of the Committee. I desire, however, to record my disapproval of the long terms set out in the clause.",47
171,Mr STEWART,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Wimmera-Minister for Works and Railways) [8.5] - If honourable members will look at the next subclause, they will see that the term really BILL. is three years. The periods of five, four, and three years apply to the members of the first Commission, but thereafter, the term is to be three years. If the three Commissioners were each appointed for three years only, their terms of office would expire on the same date.",47
172,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Then make the terms three years, two years, and one year.",47
173,Mr STEWART,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I think that the Leader of the Opposition will, on reflection, agree that such terms would be too short. The period of five years will apply only in the initial stages. The point raised by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), that three years is too short a term to attract a really good man as the first chairman, is worthy of consideration - - ",47
174,Mr FENTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Maribyrnong) [8.7] The idea underlying the fixing of the terms mentioned in this clause seems to be that - the present Ministry expect to continue in office for about two years longer, and that during the following three years their successors will be unable to make any change in the personnel of the Commission. the Ministry, however, that if this party is returned with a majority at the next election, the first session of the new Parliament will be devoted chiefly to repealing the bad legislation of the present Government.",48
175,Mr FOSTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Wakefield) [8.SJ - The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr . Fenton), by his indiscretion, is putting the whole country on its guard. the Leader of the Opposition will not press this matter to a division.",48

We should make the clause absolutely safe. It should be entirely beyond the power of a Commissioner to make any illegal profits put of the Commonwealth funds, or to take advantage of his position as Commissioner to benefit himself at the expense of the Commonwealth. Subclause c, as printed, defeats the real in I hope tention of the clause.",48
179,Mr FOSTEB,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Th c same provision appears in many Acts.,48
180,Mr OKEEFE,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The purpose of the clause is clear. It is to prevent a Commissioner from reaping personal pecuniary benefit from a contract over which he himself, as Commissioner, has control.",48
181,Mr FOSTEB,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Every member of this House is in the same position. Mr O ' KEEFE - But every member of this House will not be a Commissioner. If any member of this Parliament desires to become one of the Commissioners, it is. his plain duty now to vote to pass the clause in such a way as will make itimpossible for him to make profit im properly at the expense of the Commonwealth. As printed, the clause enables in any contract or agree- a Commissioner, or Acting Commissioner, ment made by or on behalf to reap a monetary benefit from the transof the Commission, or actions of the Commission., so long as he ticipate in the profit of any does so as a member of an incorporated such contract, or agreement company consisting of more than 25 or in any benefit or emolument arising; therefrom. persons.

Every day we hear of com1 panies whereone big; shareholder has 1 the controlling interest, the other share> holdersbetween them not holding anything like the same number of shares) as he-does. I , ask the Attorney-General (Si r Littleton Groom) to givemy amendment serious consideration, because, under the clause as it stands,, any one of these Commissioners might, as a shareholder in a company, be interested in contracts or transactions involving the expenditure of huge sums of money over which the Commission will bave control. If , as I assume, it is intended by the clause to prevent such a thing, let U3 do it thoroughly, and let us say that no Commissioner shall be entitled to hold shares in any company, without respect to the number of persons forming it, having business relations with the Commission. Let us say that no Commissioner shall be - financially interested in any of the transactions over which the Commission will have control. I do not say that the men who will apply for positions as Commissioners under the Bill would do this kind of thing, but we should put it beyond the power of the Commissioners to do it. We have already agreed to appoint a Commissioner at a salary of £3,000 a year, and have made provision, for two subordinate Commissioners, who are to be paid by fees an unspecified amount. The subordinate Commissioners may be men deriving large incomes from their private, bus'iness or profession, and' yet under the Bill they may draw fees amounting to £3,000 a year for their services as Commissioners, though the whole of their time will not be employed in the work. They should be satisfied with that. I believe that just as good men will apply for these positions if we put it beyond their power altogether to be financially interested in any expenditures over which the Commission will have control. The issue raised by my amendment is clear, and I need not further explain it. If it is agreed to, a consequential amendment will become necessary in a later part .of the clause.",48
182,Mr STEWAET,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Wimmera-Minister for Works and Railways) [8.19] - I quite appreciate the object the honourable member has in. proposing his amendment. It, is to prevent members of the Commission having any financial interest in the transactionswhich they will control. I can. assure the honourable member that the matter' dealt witli) in his amendment was given, very careful consideration. The portionof the clause towhichhe takes exception, has: really been taken the constitutional provision, under which we oceupy our present positions.. Under section44 of the Constitution, dealing with the disqualification of candidates for election to either House of this Parliament, it is provided that any person shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives who, amongst other thingsHas any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth otherwise than as a member and in common with the other members of an incorporated company consisting of more than twenty-five persons. With the exception that the word "" Commission "" is substituted for the word ""Board,"" the clause is identical witha section of the Public Service Act which we passed last year, dealing with qualifications of members of the Public Service Board. This is the usual statutory provision in such cases. I have no knowledge of any breachof theconstitutional provision, to which I have referred! iii the history of this Parliament.",49
183,Mr OKEEFE,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Outsid e this Parliament, and the Federal Public Service; 1 many breaches of the kind have occurred?.",49
184,Mr STEWART,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I listened to: the honourable member with a good deal' of sympathy, because, in common with every other member of the Committee, I desire to prevent such improper conduct as he has referred to.",49
185,Mr OKEEFE,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I believe that, but the Government has not done so in the clause under consideration.",49
186,Mr STEWART,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"If the honourable member will turn to clause 9, which the Committee has just passed, he will find that it provides thatThe Minister may suspend a Commissioner, or an Acting Commissioner, from ofiice for inability, inefficiency, or misbehaviour, or neglect or failure to carry out any of the provisions of this Act. or theregulations.",49
187,Mr OKEEFE,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"That would not pre> vent a Commissioner, as a shareholder in a company, profiting improperly under a contract with the Commission if he elected to do< so.",49
188,Mr STEWART,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"This Parliament will be sittingat Canberra; where the Commission' will Be carrying on itswork, and is it likely that any mani worthy of the position of Minister will,, under Ms from very eyes* permit a Commissioner intterested in acompany to make financial profit out of the works carried out at Canberra? I am sure that honourable members will see that the-Commonwealth will bo amply safeguarded by this clause as it stands, in conjunction with clause 9. I have said that this is the customary provision, specifically designed to prevent what the honourable member fears might take place.",49
189,Mr OKEEFE,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Denison) [8.25] - The Minister has said that he considers the Commonwealth will be sufficiently safeguarded by the fact that the Minister, under clause 9,' is given power to suspend a Commissioner, but I direct his attention to what happened only within the last few months in one of the States of the Commonwealth. The State Government has under its control a very big work, which is being carried out under Government supervision, aud by the expenditure of public money. It invited applications for a position very similar to that which one of the proposed Commissioners will hold. The successful applicant, who, by the way, came from Victoria to the State I represent, secured the position. He was trusted by the Government, who had the power to suspend him. He drew a reasonable salary for his work, and was expected to give his best services. Within a year or so from the time of his appointment, it was discovered that he was secretly interested in some contract. He was the officer whose business it was to recommend the acceptance of certain contracts. Tenders were invited for the purchase of a large quantity of valuable blackwood, on a big area of land which was being cleared by the Government. It came out in evidence elicited by a Royal Commission appointed by the Government to inquire into the matter, as soon as it got wind of it, that this, official took advantage of the position he held ancl advised the Government to accept a certain tender. It was found that he was, secretly, of course, a partner of the successful tenderers. He advised the rejection of other tenders that might have been more advantageous to the Government. Mr M . CAMERON.'-Was the company to which he belonged the lowest tenderer ?",50
190,Mr OKEEFE,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I could not say, but the point is that this official - was found to be a shareholder in the company that, upon his advice, secured the contract. When this kind of thing can take place, what becomes of the Minister's argument that the power to suspend is a sufficient safeguard ?",50
191,Mr STEWART,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"If the honourable member's amendment was carried, it would cut off the greater part of the field to which we must look to secure suitable men for these positions.",50
192,Mr OKEEFE,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Surely the Committee will not accept au argument like that.,50
193,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,The same objection has been raised to every amendment suggested by us.,50
194,Mr OKEEFE,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,It might be used in many other cases with far more reason than this. Does tlic Minister seriously contend that we shall be unable to secure suitable meu for the Commission if we do not permit them to be members of companies interested in transactions in which Commonwealth money will be involved?,50
195,Mr STEWART,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,I do not say that.,50
196,Mr OKEEFE,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,That was what the honourable gentleman's interjection implied. He said that my amendment would seriously reduce the . field from which wo might expect applications for these positions.,50
197,Mr STEWART,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,That is different from the interpretation which the honourable member put on what I said.,50
198,Mr OKEEFE,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I do not wish to misrepresent the honourable gentleman. If no stronger argument than that suggested by him can be urged against my amendment, I trust the good sense of the Committee will carry it. I should like to hear the views of some honourable members on the other side. I am satisfied that every member of the Committee is as anxious as I am myself that the men occupying positions as Commissioners at Canberra shall not deal improperly with public funds. The Minister might well accept the amendment and thus make certain that the obvious reason for the insertion of the clause in the Bil l is carried out. There are hundreds of companies operating today in which there are more than 25 persons and in which one individual may hold a controlling interest by possessing more than half the shares. If the Minister would postpone the consideration of the clause and have an amendment drafted to carry out what the clause really intends-that is, that power shall not be given to any Commissioner to juggle with the funds of the Commonwealth- I would be willing to accept it.",50
199,Mr WEST,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"East Sydney) [8.32] - As iv matter of fact, the provision in the Bill is on the lines of what is provided in the Constitution, but I rise to point out that under the present system of the notation of companies, debenture-holders are often more concerned in the success of trading firms than are the shareholders themselves. In order to defeat income taxation and probate duties many proprietary - concerns have been floated into incorporated companies, the original proprietors becoming debenture-holders entitled to 9 per cent, or 10 per cent, per annum and a further .division of the profits should tlic dividends of the shareholders in the year exceed 10 per cent, or 12 per cent. The clause under consideration makes no limitation in regard to the Commissioner or Acting Commissioner being n debenture-holder of a company concerned or interested in any contract made with the Commission.",51
200,Sir LITTLETON GEOOM,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,I r merely deals with shareholders.,51
201,Mr WEST,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,In future Bills of this kind. 2>rovision will have to be made to meet the case of debenture-holders of the class I have mentioned.,51
202,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"[8.86] - The provision to which exception has been taken has found a place in legislation of this character for the last 25 years. The cases mentioned by the honourable member for Denison (Mr O'Keefe) were those in which a dishonest person had done some secret act. If the Commissioner appointed under this Bill is honest individual desirous of doing something wrong, he can secretly transfer whatever shares he may have in a company to his wife and carry on nefarious practices as long as he likes. But let us take the case of a Commissioner who may have a few hundred pounds invested in some trading concern. Should one of the employees of the Commission buy from that firm a few pounds' worth of goods without the Commissioner's knowledge, the honourable member for Denison would make the Commissioner guilty of an indictable offence. As I have already pointed out, the man who is actually dishonest could overcome the difficulty of having an interest in any private concern doing business with the Commission by transferring that interest to his wife.",51
203,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,But if the Commisimportant sioner does that he breaks the law.,51
204,Mr OKEEFE,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,The Bill will allow him to do tliese things without breaking the law.,51
205,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"No . Eor the last 20 or 30 years the same provision has applied, and I challenge the honourable member for Denison to cite a single case in connection with any Board or Commission in which anything of the sort he fears has occurred. It would be a great mistake to alter .the sub-clause.",51
206,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Hunter) [S.37] The honourable member for Denison (Mr. O'Keefe) is to be commended for bringing forward his amendment. It does not follow that, because we have already passed legislation containing the provision to which the honourable member objects, we should keep on passing it. I can remember cases of corruption during past years, although a provision such as this has been in. force. But in. any case, for a salary of £3,000 we should get a man who will, give his whole time to his particular job and who will not concern himself with the operations of private firms witli which the Federal Capital Commission may have dealings. The argumentof the Ministeifor Works and Railways (Mv. Stewart) that if the clause is not allowed to stand as printed, the Goveirnment's choice in selecting a Commissioner will be limited, is very weak. The same objection has been raised every time an amendment has been, moved. I see no reason why the Commissioners shoidd not be put in the same position as a member of a a dis- shire council in New South Wales, who is not entitled to have an interest in any contract entered into with the municipality of which he is a councillor.",51
207,Mr FOSTEB,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Unde r the general municipal law of Australia acouncillor is entitled to be interested in a contract with such a company as is provided for in this clause.,51
208,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I am speaking of the New South Wales law. Cases have been proved against municipal councillors in New South Wales, and those councillors have been expelled from their positions.",51
209,Mr FOSTEB,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Many have' not been expelled, and yet there are cases of corruption in New South Wales.",51
210,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"My purpose is to avoid the possibility of corruption on the part of the person who will occupy. the position of Chairman of 'the Federal Capital Commission. He will have unlimited power. Parliament will know very little of what is happening. To say that the Government cannot get a sufficiently qualified man to accept a position at a salary of £3,000 per annum unless he is allowed to be connected with companies that may be trading with the Commission, is to make easy the path to 'corruption.  would also apply to the other Commissioners, who may on'ly be called in occasionally.",51
211,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"It applies to all the Commissioners, but I am referring particularly to the Chairman of the Commission, who will occupy a very independent position as .compared with his colleagues. He will only cadi them in when he requires their .services. He will really dominate emery thing; lie will really dominate Parliament. Once' the C'ommis.sion gets into working .order this I-Iorase .will have very little say in connection affairs at Canberra, which is an additional reason for .agreeing to the amendment. We should clearly provide that the Commissioners must not be interested in companies. Do the Government oppose the amendment .because they have some one in mind for the position of Chairman ?",52
212,Mr STEWART,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,No .,52
213,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I accept the Minister's word, but one would think that Ministers had some one in mind when they stipulate that he may be a man holding shares in a number of companies.",52
214,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,The honourable member might as well say that the framers of the Constitution were actuated by the same motive when .they inserted a similar provision in the. Constitution.,52
215,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,There .are many provisions in the Constitution that need - amendment. The worse feature of our legislation is that the language of one measure is slavishly repeated in another. We work along in the .same old groove.,52
216,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,This provision in Constitution has worked very well so far.,52
217,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I do not know that it has.. No .one has condemned it more than has the .honourable membei' at certain times,",52
218,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Not .this provision.,52
219,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member has condemned the expenditure of public money where independent power has been given to Commissioners. The Federal Capital Commission will handle a great deal of public money, and I am anxious to prevent any Commissioner being a shareholder in a company.",52
220,Mr FENTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The amendment would cut out the Government's particular friends. They want "" big business men "" for the job.",52
221,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"My concern, ancl that of the honourable member for Denison, is to make the Bill as perfect as possible, and safeguard the interests of the public. Can we do so by leaving the clause as it stands? It is. no argument to say that the amendment would restrict the choice of the Government, and prevent them from getting suitable men for the job. It is ridiculous for Ministers to say that they cannot get a suitable man unless he is .connected with a number of companies in Australia. Mr STEWART. - The lionorable member is not arguing fairly.",52
222,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,My argument is .as with fair as that which the Minister has put up against the amendment.,52
223,Mr OKEEFE,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"It is .a fair argument to ask whether the Minister would give some one £3,000 a year to manage his own business, and at the same time allow that manager to be interested in other businesses which had dealings with it.",52
224,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"He would not. Whenever corruption has occurred, it has been in consequence of persons who had authority in connection with - Government institutions being pecuniarily interested in private concerns. In connection with the War .Service Homes, we have heard of the Commonwealth having to pay dearly for the association of Government officers with private saw-mills and other businesses. I cannot see why the Minister objects to a fair and reasonable amendment which would improve the Bill, and casts no reflection upon anybody. If there - are no qualified men other than those who are interested in public companies that may be supplying the material to Canberra, the outlook for Australia is bad. But I believe that plenty otf capable men are available for these positions, and we should take - every precaution to safeguard - the - public .interest. There is no party significance in bhis Bill, and I cannot (understand why honourable members opposite .so obediently follow the parry Whip, and refuse to listen to logic, I ask the Minister to reconsider his decision, and accept the suggested amendment. The draftsmen are very able officers, but it is still possible for the collective wisdom of the Comsidered mittee to suggest improvements to the Bill.",52
225,Sir LITTLETON GBOOM,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Darlin g Downs-Attorney-General ) [8.491 - The Leader of the Opposition has asked the Committee to be guided by the example of New South Wales in regard to munievery cipal legislation, and I suppose that ested. it T prove to hi m that the provision in this Bill is in accordance with the New South Wales law, he will be satisfied that we are doing the right thing.",53
226,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,I said that no municipal or shire councillor in New South Wales can vote on a contract in which is pecuniarily interested.,53
227,Sir LITTLETON GEOOM,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Th Local Government Act of New South Wales provides- A person (who is not a director of n company) shall not be disqualified for a civic office by reason only of having a direct direct pecuniary interest in any agreement trading with the council as a member and common with the members of an incorporated company consisting of more than 25 persons. The Local Government Act of Victoria contains this provision- But no person shall be disqualified' from being or continuing a councillor of any muniprovision cipality by reason of- . . . . (b) being a shareholder or member of any incorporated company consisting of more than 20 persons which has entered into any contract with or done any work under the authority the council The Leader of the Opposition sugwhich gested that a man should be disqualified for membership of the Commission if he no were a shareholder i u any company doing business with the Commission, and have shown him that in New South public interest. Wales and Victoria there is a limitation of the disqualification. The reason the limitation is obvious. A company of less than 20 shareholders is more or less in the nature of a proprietary concern, the shareholders in which may have what is identified. might be regarded as a direct managerial interest in promoting its welfare. The object of the provisions in State Acts is to disqualify those men have a substantial proprietary interest in companies for doing business w i the councils of which they are members.. Experience in all States has shown that that is the safeguard that is necesquite sary. The men who framed the Constipying tution had experience of government i all the Australian States, and' thisBill f35] re-enacts the provision which they conproper.

229,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Hunter) [8.53] - for inI t is evident that the draftsman has or rummaged the Constitution and State in Statutes, and in accordance with the provisions he found therein has framed this Bill . Apparently we are to learn nothing from experience.",53
230,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Is not the in the Bill based upon the experience of all the States?,53
231,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Yes , but whereas the Local Government Act of New South of Wales provides that a municipal councillor shall not vote upon any contract in he is pecuniarily interested as a shareholder in a small company, there is such restriction in this Bill , and the Commissioners may do as .they choose. I We should do something to protect the The Chief Commissioner should hold no interest in a public for company, because, whether the shareholders number five or 5,000, whether his interest be 50 shares or 50,000 shares, there will always be an inducement for him to favour the concern with which he",53
232,Mr FOSTER,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Wakefield) [8.55] the Some day Canberra will be a big city, who and the purchases by the Commissioners will cover the whole field of industry. t h Therefore, the amendment suggested by the Leader of the Opposition would unduly restrict the area of selection. I am sure that some men who are occupublic positions, in which they are n absolutely indispensable, have legitimate investments in companies with which they, - in their public offices, do business. *We expect to have on the Federal Capital Commission representative men from different professions. We shall not get the best men if we l i m it the choice in the manner proposed. It is hardly conceivable that any leading architect or engineer could be chosenfor a seat on the Commission, who had not an interest in some big concern that might supply material for the construction of the city. The wisdom of all Parliaments endorses the provision which is contained in the Bill. - Mr HURRY (Bendigo) [9.0] - The clause has been carefully drafted, but it is not possible to provide for every contingency. It is difficult to know where to draw the line. Let me give an illustration. I happen to be a member of a company with a capita] of £100,000, but ' my holding is confined to 100 shares of f l each. business of the company is the manufacture of collars, ties, &c. Suppose that, in the course of time. I became a member of this Commission-say , one of the two Assistant Commissioners, I presume that two Commissioners will form a quorum, and if I happened to be' absent at cne meeting at which the Commission accepted the tender of this company for a bale of shirts for the men, I might find myself liable to a fine of £500, or imprisonment for a term of three years, because I happened to have 100 shares in the company.

247,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Swan) [9.21] - This clause gives the Commissioner power to borrow money without Parliamentary authority. We shall be told that the Commission cannot borrow except with the consent of the Treasurer, and then only upon such terms and conditions as, and for the purposes which he may approve. A Commission such as that to be appointed, finding it necessary to borrow, say, £3,000,000 or £4,000,000, may obtain the approval of the Treasurer but not of Parliament. It is known that no public work, the cost of which exceeds £25,000, can be undertaken until it has been referred to the Public Works Committee for investigation and report; and according to the Act. under which the Committee is appointed this House has to approve of such work before it is carried out. But before money is borrowed by the Commission for any work, and before the work is proceeded with, Parliamentary approval should be obtained. If the Commissioners should require, say, £.1,000,000, in order to carry out some particular work, a Bill embodying the necessary autliority should be submitted to Parliament. I move- . That before the word "" For"", at the beginning of sub-clause 1, the following words be inserted :- "" Subject to Parliamentary authority and"". The sub-clause would then read: "" Subject to Parliamentary authority and for the purpose of the exercise of any of its powers under this Act the Commission may borrow money . . . ."" Whichever party is in power, Parliament should be consulted as to the moneys to be borrowed by the proposed Commission.",56
248,Mr YATES,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Adelaide) [9.25] - I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), as I consider it the lesser of two evils. Personally, I only wish to emphasize the fact that Parliament has no right to delegate its authority as is done in this Bill. What is meant by incorporating in the Bill a clause of this character? The Government are floating a loan of £10,000,000, concerning which we know nothing, and when the Treasurer is interrogated he merely replies that £5,000,000 is required for the redemption of Treasury-bills and a further sum for something else; and so on.",56
249,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Parliamen t had to pass a Loan Bill before that could be done.,56
250,Mr YATES,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"If authority has been given, I know nothing of it. If Parliament, was aware of the flotation of the loan mentioned, why has the Treasurer been questioned concerning it ?",56
251,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,He must have obtained Parliamentary authority.,56
252,Mr YATES,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Yes , without Parliament really knowing what that authority connoted. Apparently the present practice of borrowing will continue until the Government come up against a stone wall, which is the only thing that is likely to stop them; and, from my point of view, the sooner they strike it the better. I have raised my voice on numerous occasions against the borrowing policy of the Commonwealth. The Labour party has always had on its platform a plank relating to the cessation of borrowing excepting for public works which will show a sufficient return to cover interest on the capital expenditure and provide a sinking fund. Up to the present, that has not been done in connection with any Commonwealth loan. A sane financial proposal, and one which was supported by only three members, was that submit.ted by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) during the war period. If that had been adopted, we would not. have had a huge monkey of debt on the back of the Commonwealth, as we have today, and we would not be taxing as we are the soldiers who fought for us. The proposal was said to be impracticable. We had, we were informed, to borrow from the capitalists. The honourable member for Bourke suggested that a credit of £20,000,000 should be established at the Commonwealth Bank, which could be operated upon for the purpose of carrying on the war; but no one.considered - it workable. Some members of the Labour party did not know that the proposal embodied a principle advocated by their party for many years, and if effect had been given to it we would have financed our war operations out of revenue, instead of fictitious capital, and emerged from the war practically free of debt. The honourable member for Martin  tize on the question of finance. We have got beyond that. Not only the Commonwealth, but the whole world, is in a less bog in regard to finance. The value of the German mark and also that of the French franc has depreciated, and America now holds one half of the world's gold. Notwithstanding this, it is the intention of the Government to continue borrowing. If we cannot do better than at present, we had better go back to the people and say we cannot conduct Commonwealth affairs on our own money, that we have to borrow, not here where the interest would be paid to our own people, but overseas. There are some, of course, who will say that to borrow locally would place the Commonwealth in very much the position of a snake which endeavoured to devour itself by commencing at its tail. Mr Andrew Fisher said that he intended to borrow £20,000,000 locally for war purposes. A Httle later, he met the financiers, who slimed all over him, and eventually swallowed him. They told him that it would not do to raise £20,000,000 in the Commonwealth in one sum, but that it would be necessary to borrow in instalments of, say, £5,000,000 each. It is on record in Hansard that the present Speaker, who had recently entered this House after holding office as Treasurer of Victoria for some years, then said that, if a loan of £20,000,000 were placed in one sum on the local market, it would disorganize and disrupt the producing interests of this country, as the money was not there to be borrowed. We made a beginning by borrowing £5,000,000 to carry on for a while, a further £7,000,000 was raised within three months, and other larger amounts at comparatively short periods, until £300,000,000 was borrowed in a country which it was said could not contribute £20,000,000, without serious injury being done to industry. The joke of the whole procedure is that we have raised nearly £300,000,000 within ten years, and that the producing and manufacturing industries were never more flourishing than they are today, although it was said that a local loan of £20,000,000 would draw from them their very life-blood. If I [36] were to suggest a satisfactory scheme of public finance, it would be rejected by the House, just as was the suggestion of the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) at the beginning of the war. I have always held that the hope- employment of an inconvertible note would be advantageous. The Adelaide Register revealed the truth when it pointed out that it was a good thing that, of the money required for repatriation purposes, £5,000,000 was to be borrowed within the Commonwealth, because, by the time that money had been expended in making provision for the needs of the soldiers, most of it would have flowed back to the banks, ready to be loaned out again. The juggling that is indulged in, under the name of finance, is making millionaires on the one side, and keeping the workers poor on the other. Our opponents tell us that Australia will rue the day when the Labour party attempts to put its ideas on finance into operation; but I say "" Speed the day."" It is now proposed to build a big city, and to give the Commission unlimited power to borrow. This means that the burden carried by the people will be increased in connection with the building of Canberra. I desire to place on record my protest against the method of administration proposed for a great city that we shall never have.",56
253,Mr WEST,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"East Sydney) [9.33] - I am afraid that the Prime Minister (Mr. Bruce) is not fully seized of the wide powers proposed to be granted to the Commission. The clause provides that "" for the purpose of the exercise of any of its powers under the Act. the Commission may borrow moneys to such amount, in such manner, and on such terms, as the Treasurer approves."" Even this Parliament has not such wide power as it is proposed to give to the Commission. Loan money, raised in London, is paid to the credit of the Treasurer, but not one penny of it can be soent until - the Constitution has been complied with. Section 83 of the Constitution providesNo money shall be drawn from the Treasury of the Commonwealth except under appropriation made by law. But until the expiration of one month after the first meeting of the Parliament, the Go-. vernor-General in Council may draw from ihe Treasury and expend such moneys as mi», be necessary for the maintenance of any Department transferred to the Commonwealth, and for the holding of the first elections for the Parliament. The Prime Minister knows very well that before this Parliament can expend any money on the Federal Capital Territory, it is necessary for a message to be received from the Governor General recommending the appropriation, and for the usual resolution to be carried in Committee of Ways and Means. This Bill, however, makes no such provision. I do not think the Government intended such wide powers to be given to the Commission.",57
254,Mr BRUCE,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The Commission is more limited than that.' It has to submit estimates of its expenditure, and the Treasurer's consent can be given only within those estimates.",58
255,Mr WEST,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Unde r the Bill, the Treasurer can authorize a loan, and allow the expenditure of money without the usual resolution in Committee of Ways and Means.",58
256,Mr BRUCE,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,The Commission has power to borrow only within its own estimates.,58
257,Mr WEST,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"I do not desire it to have power ' to borrow on the credit of the Commonwealth. If I had my own way, I should confine all borrowing to our own money market. This morning, I asked the Treasurer, upon notice, if it was not a fact that £3,500,000 out of the £10,000,000 loan being raised in London was required to pay interest on existing loans. I obtained my information from a cablegram giving the news published in the London Times.",58
258,Dr EARLE PAGE,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"That money is being borrowed for developmental works, such as post-offices, &c.",58
259,Mr WEST,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,I do not think there is any Act of the Commonwealth giving such wide powers as those with which it is proposed to clothe this Commission. I suggest that the clause be postponed to enable lionorable members to look more closely into its effect.,58
260,Mr BRUCE,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Flinders-Prini e Minister and Minister for External Affairs)[9.41] - I had not the privilege of hearing the remarks of the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) in regard to this clause, but I desire to make its meaning perfectly clear. The clause deals with' the actual manner in which the money is to be.raised. gives the Commission power to borrow moneys with the consent of the Treasurer, and on such terms as the Treasurer approves, butiit in no:sense gives unlimited borrowing power to the Commission, apart from the consent of the Treasurer. The Treasurer authorizes the manner in which, and the time when certain moneys can be borrowed. It is a limited power, and it is not the Treasurer who determines and limits the amounts to be borrowed. The only amount that can be borrowed under this clause is the sum provided in the Loan Estimates of the Commission for the particular year under consideration.",58
261,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Thos e estimates are not presented to Parliament.,58
262,Mr BRUCE,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"A later clause provides that estimates of both revenue and expenditure must be prepared, and submitted to the Minister for approval, the Minister, of course, being responsible to Parliament. The point I wish to make perfectly, clear is that the Commission is not given unlimited power to borrow the moneys, with no responsibility, on the part of any one, to Parliament for the action taken. ' If , however, it is the wish of honourable members that the authorization of the issue of loans by the Commission shall be subject to Parliamentary sanction, the Government has no objection whatever to such a provision. I stress the point that the estimates of the Commission are to be submitted to the Minister. It would be rather unusual for Parliament to authorize the issue of loans by a Commission'. It would not, as has been suggested, be in accordance with the established practice. The Bill is really one to establish a form of municipal government for the Federal Capital Territory. It is true that there are to be three Commissioners, but control by a number of commissioners is a well recognized form of municipal government. In a number of cities in the United States of America, apart from the particular example of Washington, this form of local government' is established. Municipalities generally are not required to seek Parliamentary sanction for the loans that they issue. In most cases authority is granted by executive act. The consent of the Governor has to be obtained, and that virtually means the consent of the Ministry. That is what is contemplated in the Bill. The Bill It follows the usual practice, and no departure from accepted theory is proposed.",58
263,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,Will the loan estimates be brought before Parliament before the loans aro floated?:,58
264,Mr BRUCE,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"No . There is a disadministration, tinction, here, between Joan and venue expenditure. Clause 22 provides that estimates must be prepared, and will be prepared in the ordinary way as loan and revenue estimates. They piust be submitted to the Minister, and no expenditure can be incurred by the Commission until they have been passed and approved by him. A second safeguard has been included in the Bill, namely, that even when the estimates for loan expendishall, ture have been approved, no loans can be issued by the Commission until the terms and the period for the issue have been posedapproved by the Treasurer.",59
265,Mr WEST,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"How does the Prinie Minister get out of clause 83 of the Conmean stitution, which says that "" No money shall be drawn from, the Treasury of the Commonwealth except under appropriament tion made hy law "" ?",59
266,Mr BRUCE,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"There is no need to "" get out of "" that provision, or indeed of anything, because no money will soldiers, be drawn from the Treasury. . We aro now dealing with the power to raise loans, which will be raised, not. by the Government, but by the Commission The provision referred to does not apply in this particular case.",59
267,Mr WEST,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"If a loan be raised, will it not be paid into the Consolidated venue, and will not the appropriation have to be made .before the money can be spent?",59
268,Mr BRUCE,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"No . None of those The clause saysthings will be necessary. I rose to speak on this clause because I thought it desirCommission, able that the Committee should have a officer clear explanation of the position.",59
269,Mr GBEOOBY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"There is in . the Bill a Commission, further qualification relating to works over £25,000.",59
270,Mr BRUCE,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Yes . They submitted to the Public Works CommitThis tee. The provisions are such as are usual when administrative duties are handed over to what is practically cipal authority, but if it is the wish of the Committee that the proposed safeDowns-Attorney-General guard regarding borrowing-and again I stress the point that this relates to loan, expenditure-shoul d be induties cluded in the Bill, the Government is prepared to accept it. To apply the same principle to the revenue estimates would bo to destroy the . basis - of - the of the Capital by the reCommission. The Government does not object to the amendment of the honourable they member for Swan (Mr Gregory). Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to Clauses 21 to 25 agreed to. Clause 26(2.) In the making of appointments of officers for the purposes of this Act, - preference subject to competency, be given to returned soldiers. Amendment (by Mr STEWART) proThat sub-clause 2 be left out.",59
271,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Does this amendment that there will be preference to returned soldiers for the appointment of Commissioners, hut not for the appoint of persons to other positions ?",59
272,Sir LITTLETON GBOOM,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"The provi- sions of the Public Service Act, which provides for preference to returned will apply to other appointments. Amendment agreed to Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 27 agreed to. - Clause 28 (Notice of action).",59
273,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Swan) [9.52] - This is one of the strangest clauses I have ever seen. It is proposed to appoint CommisResioners with almost absolute powers of control, hut, when any person has a grievance against them, very drastic provisions are introduced to safeguard them. An action shall not be brought against the or any member thereof, or any of the Commission, or person acting in hie aid, until the expiration of one month after notice in writing has been served on the member, officer, or - person, clearly stating the cause of action, and the name and place of abode of the intended plaintiff, and must he of his solicitor or agent. looks very much like giving a special form of protection to the Commissioners and their officers which is not given to a muniother residents of the Territory.",59
274,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Darling ; [9.53] - The el'ause follows the usual practice.

If so, is it proposed to include provisions in the Bill that the regulations shall he submitted to this House?",60
276,Sir LITTLETON GBOOM,SEAT OF GOVERNMENT,"Darling Downs-Attorney-General ) [9.56] - The power to make, regulations is set out in the clause. The procedure is defined in the Acts Interpretation Act, so that the machinery for the purpose need not to be repeated in every Act. The Acts In terpretation Act of 1904 says that regulations must be notified in the Gazette, . that they take effect from the date of notification, and that they must be laid before both Houses of Parliament within 30 days of the m'aking thereof, or, if Parliament is not then sitting, within 30 days after the next day of sitting of Parliament.

In submitting the motion, I desire to inform honourable members that arrangements have been made hy the Government to extend the tenure of office of the two Deputy Presidents of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, Sir John Quick and Mr N . A; Webb. They were appointed for a period of two years, which expires in June next. The Government have asked them to accept an extension of their term of office for a further period of two years, and I am glad to say that both have agreed to do so. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [9.59]. - Some time ago I received a letter from the Postmaster-General (Mr Gibson) stating that the Postal Department would push on with the erection of the Post Office at the corner of Maroubraroad and ANZAC-parade, ' Kensington. This is a rising district, and the population has greatly increased. In the Departmental Digest of New Works there is no reference to the establishment of this post ofiice, and I am anxious to know what is holding up the work. There must be some mistake, and I ask the Minister representing the Postmaster-General to inquire into the matter.",60
