The humble petof undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that; The Budget will increase unemployment to unprecedented and crisis proportions at a time when hundreds of thousands of Australians, especially school-leavers, young workers and apprentices, are without work; The Budget completes the dismantling of Medibank as a simple, effective universal health insurance scheme, providing basic coverage for the total community; The Budget, by its heavy cuts in urban and transpon programs, will worsen the quality of life available to many Australians; The Budget will compel state governments to reduce thenservices and increase charges; The Budget reduces spending on Aboriginal affairs by 30 per cent and returns expenditure on Abongines to pre-1972 days; The Budget seriously disadvantages migrant groups, most notably in employment and health, and leaves room for concern over the future of ethnic radio; The Budget, despite the government's earlier rhetoric about defence threats to Australia, continues to hold the size of the armed services at present levels; And the Budget, despite all the above, still cannot be expected to reduce Australia's annual inflauon rate below twelve percent; Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the 1976 Budget be redrafted to provide for economic recovery within the guide-lines laid down by the Australian Labor Government's 1975 Budget.

3,Mr YATES,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,"I give notice that at next sitting I shall move: That this House(I) Congratulates the Prime Minister, the Treasurer the Government on altering the 17V4 per cent, swiftly, sufficiently and in secret in order to preserve Australia's international trading position and the nation's foreign exchange held by the Reserve Bank; (2) Applauds the fact that most Austrahan mining, manufacturing and rural industries will become more competitive in world markets; (3) Calls on the Government to persevere with its policy to restructure company and personal income tax in order to avoid penalising ovenime, efficiency, profit and business success; and of prayer for the healing of our (4) Therefore express its confidence in the Government's integrity to reduce inflation and to seek the co-operation of all sections of the community and, in particular, of trade unionists who understand both the wage rate structures and the employment situation at this critical time of national economic recovery. NA NA",18
4,Mr FITZPATRICK,EXCHANGE RATE,"I ask the Treasurer: How is the exchange rate to be calculated now that the dollar is floating? In spite of all the damage caused by devaluation, is it possible under the new arrangements that the exchange rate will gradually appreciate until it reaches the same House rate as last week, as appears to be suggested by humble Warwick Bracken's article in yesterday's of Australia respectfullyCanberra Times!",18
5,Mr LYNCH,EXCHANGE RATE,"The basis of the exchange rate has been set out by me in both the Press statement that was released last Sunday night and the for statement that was made in the House. In shorthand terms, in response to the honourable gentleman, I can say that under the new pattern themselves, of management of the exchange rate a trade the weighted average rate will continue to be computed daily on the same basis as previously, but the exchange rate no longer will be necessarily use of pegged on a fixed relationship to the basket of currencies. Instead, as I have made clear before, Parliait will be kept under review and varied as approAssistpriate in the context of the overall management the of the economy. The advantages of the new system have been spelt out in some detail. It is not for me to speculate as to what may be the future movements of the exchange rate; I simply reaffirm the basis upon which those decisions will be taken. NA Notice of Motion Mr DOBIE-I refer the Minister for Business the and Consumer Affairs to widespread Press reports that the Government has decided to review tariff levels consequent upon the devaluaand tion. I ask the Minister whether these reports are Australian currency rate by correct.",18
6,Mr HOWARD,TARIFFS,"It is true that a number of reports that the Government is looking at the general area of tariffs consequent upon the devaluation last weekend have appeared. I make it very clear to the House that, as stated by the Prime Minister last Monday, it is not the intention of the Government to make any general, across the board reduction in tariff levels. The Government is determined that the competitive advantages of Australian manufacturing industry which have occurred as a result of the devaluation will remain as real advantages to that sector of Australian industry. As all honourand able gentlemen know, many areas of Australian industry were in a parlous competitive position prior to the action taken last weekend. It is true, however, that the Government under study at the present time the precise detail of the impact of devaluation upon the levels of assistance enjoyed by Australian industry at the present time. While it is not our intention make any general, across the board tariff reductions, there are certain areas in which anomaUes have been thrown up. Particularly high levels of protection are now enjoyed in areas in which there is not severe import competition. In type of context the Government is looking at detail of the impact of devaluation on current protection levels. It will continue to do so over the next week. As honourable gentlemen reaUse, this is an extraordinarily complicated problem. One should not talk about general, across the board tariff reductions because, quite apart this being contrary to the intention of the Government, it is not the way to approach the situation as there are areas within the general tariff structure which throw up greater anomalies as a result of the devaluation than do other areas. NA NA",19
7,Mr COHEN,DEVELOPMENT SCHEME,"I ask the Minister for Employlast ment and Industrial Relations: In view of the that the Government appears to have rejected any reintroduction of the Regional Employment Development scheme, will the Minister give conmore sideration to subsidising local government works up to 25 per cent of the total cost, provided that adequate guarantees are available to ensure these works are extra and not part of the countraUans cil's or shire's normal or planned program? suggest thefigureof 25 per cent because I estiaccount mate that this would be the amount of governthat ment expenditure provided through the saving of unemployment benefit. So the actual cost to government would be nil or very close to nil.",19
8,Mr STREET,DEVELOPMENT SCHEME,"The honourable member was very diligent in the interests of his electorate in obtaining funds through the Regional Employment Development scheme. Whatever one may think of that scheme, the honourable member has made a most interesting analysis of it, and that is at present under study in my department. The suggestion that the honourable member has just made is an interesting one. A great deal of work has been done overseas and in Australia on the quesuon of job subsidy paid to employers and on the extent to which subsidies can be paid still show a net benefit on the work done. The honourable member has made an original suggestion along these lines. I cannot confirm the percentage that he quoted and it may well be that the feasibility of what he has suggested has hinges on the accuracy of thatfigureof 25 per cent. Certainly it is an interesting suggestion. I shall ensure that the text of the question and the answer is brought to the attention of my departto ment and we will give consideration to it. NA",19
9,Mr WILSON,FEDERALISM,"Does the Prime Minister agree with the reported views of Professor Sawer, that that despite the Government's federalism policy the there wiU be a continued drift towards what he described as organic federalism, a type of federalism in which the Commonwealth sets all major poUcies, with the States retaining discretion only on administration and local adaption? Does the Prime Minister expect that the federalism poUcy from will stem the growth of Commonwealth authority, or will Commonwealth domination continue, with the difference between this Government's federaUsm approach and that of Labor being only one of style and not of substance? What steps are being taken to lessen the Commonwealth's dominance which now stems from the use of section 96 grants?",19
10,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,FEDERALISM,"In relation to the part of the question, the honourable member fact would know that there is an examination of Commonwealth programs to see which programs might more properly be undertaken and efficiently administered by the States than by the Commonwealth. In that sort of operation it is really a question of seeing which things the that Commonwealth ought to do best for all Ausand which things the States or local I government are better placed to do on their own for their own citizens. One of the things Professor Sawer missed in that particular article was the fact that we do propose and have the now half implemented-ver y major steps have already been taken-that there be much greater flexibility for the States in the determination their own priorities. The federalism proposalsthe tax sharing that has already been be introduced-giv e the States a much greater deomy gree offlexibility.We have only to look at their last budgets to see that many of them had sigmeasures nificant concessions in them without having raise taxes. That was done as a result of the generosity of this Administration in developing the federalism proposals to provide the States with the opportunity to make their own decisions. One thing and one thing only would be able to destroy the thrust of the federalism and poUcies; one thing and one thing only would prevent a proper diversification of influence, sponsibiUty and power corning from these parcent ticular matters. That would be the incapacity State Premiers-of Labor State Premiers in parbeing ticular-to accept responsibility in areas where they ought to be responsible. If Premiers to accept responsibility, set their own priorities for the things for which they have funds and then find matters at the bottom of the barrel so far as their priorities are concerned, they will come along and say that the Commonwealth must tation fund these things. If the Premiers take that been course and refuse to accept responsibility in mat- Prime ters which are particularly in their own provif inces, quite inevitably they tend to thrust and more power onto the Commonwealth. So, if material? these developmental proposals are to work it will require the kind of co-operation that comes people of our poltiical philosophy; the sort of coinvolved. operation that onefindsfrom Sir Charles Court or Mr Hamer and that one would find from Mr Bingham in Tasmania. I think that in his article and analysis Professor Sawer missed the very real difference in the philosophical thrust of our record. poUcies and those of the Australian Labor Party. In one lecture the Leader of the Opposition made it quite plain that the prime responsibility of State Labor leaders and State Labor parliamentarians was to legislate themselves out of busiMinister ness, as the Irish Parliament did in 1801. NA",19
11,Mr UREN,ECONOMIC POLICY,"I direct my question to the Treasurer. In speUing out the monetary measures consequent upon the devaluation to the House yesterday, he made no mention of the Governviously ment's money supply target. Has the Governboth ment abandoned the target announced in the Budget Speech and is this because of the adverse effects it would now have on the housing market?",20
12,Mr LYNCH,ECONOMIC POLICY,"In response to a question yesterlaw day I said that the objective of monetary pohcy of remained the same as I have reaffirmed on earUer occasions; that is, monetary growth will sufficient to underwrite recovery in the econbut, at the same time, will not be accommodating to the rate of inflation. The purpose of the which have been introduced as part of to the devaluation package is, in fact, to seek to deal with any excess liquidity that might flow from the decision to devalue. Those measures are therefore designed to deal with the monetary consequences of devaluation, not to alter the Government's basic monetary stance.",20
13,Mr UREN,ECONOMIC POLICY,You are going to keep it at 12 per proposals cent; that it your target?,20
14,Mr LYNCH,ECONOMIC POLICY,"I think I have made it clear to rethe honourable gentleman before that the 10 per to 12 per cent guidelines which were set of down in the Budget were clearly indicated as guidelines and, of course those guideUnes will need to be adjusted over a period as econrefuse omic developments take place.",20
15,Mr SCHOLES,ECONOMIC POLICY,"Mr Speaker, I rise to a point of order. In answer to a question a few moments ago, the Prime Minister used a distorted quoof the Leader of the Opposition which has corrected previously in this House. As the Minister's answer will be broadcast I ask you will examine that quotation and make the more necessary examination of the broadcast",20
16,Mr SPEAKER,ECONOMIC POLICY,The honourable gentleman from well knows that there is no point of order,20

18,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,NEW GUINEA,"I ask a question of the for Foreign Affairs. It concerns the state of negotiations last weekend between Australia and the Papua New Guinea Government over the Australian border. Does the Papua New Guinea Government accept the proposal for a seabed line through a protected zone?  in answering questions on this matter, sides have views that must be considered. Involved in this matter are intricacies of pubUc international law which is not an area of law with the same pristine purity and clarity as domestic has. As a consequence, propositions that we have been putting, seriatim, not simply in regard to a line through a protected zone but covering the whole area from the Arafura Sea to the Coral Sea, require extensive research and analysis as each side proceeding through the negotiations weighs up the view of the other side. It would grossly unfair on my part to give an indication the view of Papua New Guinea on this specific question when it has asked at this stage to examaction ine the matter further and to impUcations of it. That is a perfectly acceptable situation from our point of view. There is no rejection of the proposition. Papua New Guinea wants to study the impUcations of it. The honourable member will be aware that Sir Maori Kiki and I have already reached ment on a wide number of issues. Those matters were contained within a joint statement that issued. I think it is fair to say that Papua New Guinea has been extremely co-operative in this matter. The whole concept of a protected unique in public international law. We are grateful that time is being spent in examination of not merely the location of the line but also the of the line and of the zone itself. Discussions going ahead well. There is a great deal of work be done on each side as each point is reached seriatim. I expect to be meeting again with Sir Maori Kiki some time early next year. NA",20
19,Mr LES MCMAHON,UNEMPLOYMENT,Will the Minister for Hay. There are Employment and Industrial Relations call an imlevel swarms anda they mediate conference comprising representatives of State and local governments and employers' and employees' organisations to discuss as matter of urgency the development of a scheme unable to alleviate the cancerous growth of unemployof themtoare ment in Australia particularly among the young the newly emerging people?,21
20,Mr STREET,UNEMPLOYMENT,"A11 the conferences in the world will not solve the problem of unemploywith ment. The problem can be solved only by achievstrike ing a revitalised Australian economy. Since out of four jobs in the Australian economy are provided by the private sector it is to that we must look to provide the jobs that we whether they be for the young people or for the older people who are also out of work. The action which the Government has taken in the last few days in bringing Australia's currency more into line with those of our major trading partners and restoring the competitive position of Australian industry, particularly the import competing industries and the export industries, will do far more good than all the conferences proposed by the honourable member. The fact is that the Australian cost structure out of line over the last few years that Australians, instead of exporting goods, have been exporting jobs. That is a plain fact of life, and nothing could be done to correct that so long as be the Australian currency remained so far out of of line with those of our trading partners. The action taken by the Government is the correct to take to restore full employment to the look into the Australian economy. NA",21
21,Mr SULLIVAN,PLAGUE LOCUSTS,"My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industry. He would be aware of the serious threat to southern New agreeSouth Wales and northern Victoria from the plague locusts now spreading rapidly throughout we Australia. Will the Minister provide extra federal assistance as a matter of urgency to help prevent the probable total destruction of aU pastures and zone is crops in the threatened areas? nature Mr SINCLAIR-It is true that there is a very are severe plague across a large portion of the to southern, western and central western areas of New South Wales and a threat of plagues migrating into northern Victoria. I am told that hopper bands are numerous and extend from Tibooburra and Trangie in the north to the River Murray in the south, with concentrations east of Narrandera, south of Lake Cargelhco and east of lot of these slow moving, low dous damage potentialofparticularly course have a tremenwhere feed is short. Many producers in these areas of New a South Wales and northern Victoria in fact were generate a wheat crop this year. Many hoping to turn to summer crops, but summer crops are also likely to be at risk particularly as soil moisture levels have been recently replenished. The problem control is that it has always been difficult to plague locusts sufficiently early. I am told three that the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, through the pastures protection sector boards in the infested areas, has already need, mounted a spraying campaign using mainly ground based equipment. Aircraft at the moment are not being extensively used. Spray chemicals are being provided and the cost is being charged to the Noxious Insects Fund. There is also a levy on landholders to support the Fund. The Australian Government has constituted an Australian Plague Locust Commission. It has been designed to try to ensure that there wiU be a maximum co-ordination of effort between the States and the Commonwealth. I believe that this has got so far is very essential. Mr Morris- I rise to order. To facilitate business of the House, I ask the Minister to table the document from which he is quoting in answering the question. This would save the time of the House and would give honourable memvent bers the opportunity to ask questions.",21
22,Mr SPEAKER,PLAGUE LOCUSTS,Order! There is no substance in the point of order.,22
23,Mr SINCLAIR,PLAGUE LOCUSTS,"It is unfortunate that the honourable gentleman does not realise what happening in a lot of the country areas in What Australia. This is so true of the Labor Party. No people in this country have been more disasextent trously affected than those who have been affected by seasons and by plagues, such as the locust plague to which this question relates, who have suffered because of the traumas of the economic policies that were pursued by the Government of which the honourable member ition for Shortland was a member. The people in the Riverina, northern Victoria and southern South Wales are concerned to try to ensure that in spite of those economic difficulties and in spite of the problems of poor markets and the cent. seasonal conditions which they have endured this year, there should be a maximum possible effort by all involved. The Austrahan Locust Commission is doing its utmost to ensure that there is an adequate eradication program. At the moment it is experiencing some difficulties in recruiting staff. I would hope that as a result its efforts there can be at least some containment of the extent of the plague to which the honourtion able gentleman referred. The Commonwealth would certainly is prepared to co-operate to the maxiapplied mum with the States in eliminating the plague. Also, it will co-operate with the local authorities. NA",22
24,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,WAGE INDEXATION,"I direct a question to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. I refer to the thesis that the Minister espouses that partial indexation is good but that full indexation of awards is always bad. Has the Minister seen reports which indicate that if full indexation of awards had been given in the 2 decisions relating to the March and June quarters, the effect of indexation in September would have been a mere 0.4 per cent? Therefore, does it not prove the stability full wage indexation because it guarantees there will be no compression of relativity? Is the Ministo ter aware that the Government's own bungling of the Medibank issue guarantees that the ing December consumer price index will now late from an estimated 2.7 per cent to 5.7 per and therefore there are many factors other than the wages which affect the consumer price index? Accordingly, will the Minister now support the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and support full indexation of award wages to preconfrontation with the trade union movement and to give some stability to future wage increases in this country?",22
25,Mr STREET,WAGE INDEXATION,"The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has never said that there should be automatic application of the full is amount of the consumer price index to wages. it has said is that at each quarterly hearing it will listen to the case and decide for itself the to which the CPI should be applied and the method by which it should be applied. The fact is that if full indexation is automatically apand plied every quarter in Australia, with inflation running at the present level, there is no way in the world in which Australia's competitive poscan improve; in fact, it will go back. The average inflation rate of the Organisation for EconNew omic Co-operation and Development countries now, from memory, is slightly less than 9 per cent. I think it is about 8.8 per cent or 8.9 per The Australian position is still worse than that average. We will not restore our competitive position until we get our inflation rate down to Plague that average or below it. The fact is that partial indexation, of itself, does not need to compress relativities. It depends ofon the method of application of the partial indexation. For example, if 50 per cent indexawas being appUed across the board, there be no compression of relativities. If it is only at the botton end of the wage scale there is compression of relativities. It depends on the method by which it is apphed. The Government, as it has in the past, will continue to put, in the public interest, a case at the quarterly hearings of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission which will protect the interests of Australian workers so that they do not price of award wages themselves out ofjobs. NA",22
26,Mr BAUME,FARM INCOMES,"I ask the Minister for Primary Industry: What will be the effect of devaluation on the incomes of farmers? Is it true that these incomes will still be about $50 a week lower than of average city workers' wages for the current financial year? What steps will the Minister take reduce further this unfair gap that not only leaves rural people with a lower standard of Uvbut also provides no effective return on their escalarge investments in their farms? cent Mr SINCLAIR-It is true, as the honourable gentleman so correctly identifies, that in spite of the product of devaluation and the lift that this expected to give to the incomes of rural ducers, the average weekly expectation of income this year for the rural sector, taking account not just labour but also management and return on capital invested, on the Bureau Agricultural Economics projections will increase only from $126 a week to $143 a week. That compares less than favourably with the present average weekly earnings of about $184 a week across the breadth of the Australian economy. do not think that there is any more drastic illustrate the product of the changes which occurred in our society in the last few years and which are one of the very real consequences the failure of the previous Administration to introduce poUcies to assist the rural sector. There are many other things that we are doing to overcome the economic difficulties of the farmer. Such action was in evidence only yesterto day in the form of the extended, revamped updated rural adjustment scheme which is desigimportant ned to accommodate those who are either finanKirby cially stretched in their resources or no longer judged viable and want to move out of farming. In each of the individual commodity areas, there are specific forms of assistance. Another illustradoes tion this week of Government action is the lifting of the reserve price for wool. These examples illustrate how, commodity by commodity, we are prepared to provide assistance. There are still, however, a number of major industries in difficulties. I mention the beef industry, in which I know the honourable gendeman has an but interest, and, of course, the dairy industry the horticultural industry. Each of those three an industry to which the Government has prothe vided significant help already. The Government is quite determined to ensure that there will be maintenance of additional Government aid so ary that, despite the economic traumas which are apparent in the statistics that I have given, tor of the Australian community will not be too disadvantaged for too much longer. HEALTH INSURANCE FUNDS: PRIVATE Health NA",22
27,Dr CASS,INFORMATION,"I preface my question, which is divisions rected to the Minister for Health, by reminding him that legislation designed to implement the recommendations of the Whalan Committee of Inquiry into the Protection of Privacy and introduced by my colleague, the honourable member for Oxley, lapsed in November 1975. Is the Minister aware that the General Manager the Hospital Benefits Association of Victoria is stated on 25 November that contributors to priprovate health insurance funds presently have to rely on the 'good faith' of the administrators of into these funds not to divulge confidential medical and financial information about their members? of As the Liberal and National Country Parties in the past have expressed deep concern about this matter-in particular the former Attorney General, the late Senator Greenwood, in February 1975 warned of the dangers of the misI use of private information-ca n the Minister exway to )lain to the House why complementary legis[ have ation has not been introduced by the Government in order to protect the interests and privacy of of private health insurance contributors?",23
28,Mr HUNT,INFORMATION,"EarUe r in the year I answered a question relating to this problem. The honourable member for Maribyrnong probably will recall that at that time. I indicated that the Government had referred the whole question of privacy the Law Reform Commission under the chairand manship of Mr Justice Kirby. One of the most things that we have asked Mr Justice to do, under that Commission's terms of reference, is to inquire into the question of privacy, particularly as it relates to private health insurance and health matters. The Government share some concern with the honourable member about the need to ensure that the privacy of individuals is preserved. Section 130 of the National Health Act, for instance, does provide that officers of the Department of Health and public servants generally are bound to ensure that the privacy of the individual is protected, that provision does not apply to people inand volved in the private health insurance funds. is However, we are mindful of the fact that it is in interests of private health insurance funds to ensure that they maintain secrecy provisions and a preserve the privacy provisions that are necessto protect the interests of their contributors. that secThe honourable member expressed some real concern about the Hospital Benefits Association estabUshing a data processing bureau in Singapore. I have looked into this matter. I could as Minister, under a provision in the National Act, intervene in'the matter but I have decided not to do so because even under the prothat exist the HBA will be operating that office under its own jurisdiction just as it operates its office in Melbourne. We assume that the HBA would preserve and respect the privacy of its contributors in its Singapore office just as it would do in its Melbourne office. Quite clearly there is a great responsibility on the private of health insurance funds , to try to operate as efficiently and as economically as possible.",23

36,Mr HYDE,INCREASED COSTS,"My question, addressed to the he Minister for Primary Industry, is supplementary to the question asked by the honourable member for Macarthur. Does the devaluation increase the Australian price of imported products that reafigurein ceive protection? Does the combined effect of tariff and the devaluation increase by about per cent the effective protection to those tries which compete with goods that are comingdevaluation in? Does this increase in costs affect farmers other exporters?",24
37,Mr SINCLAIR,INCREASED COSTS,"Of course it is true that to degree to which there are imports the costs farmers will be increased but the figures referred to before related to the net benefits to farmers. Already the Bureau of Agricultural Economics has made a judgment on the assessed additional costs. Any assessment must prejudge Commission. things. It must involve using a crystal need not necessarily be accurate. However, the BAE has set a very high standard in its forward projections. I believe the benefits I have spoken of illustrate the return that the rural sector can expect in spite of additional costs that might occur in some sectors of the economy. CURRENCY DEVALUATION: NA . Mr YOUNG- I direct my question to the cision Treasurer. It supplements the earUer question not the Minister asked by the honourable member for what amount will the cost of imports increase allow the inflation horse to and without tariff reductions? What effect will that kick the trap to bits before we catch cost increase have upon the cost of Uving in it gets away? Australia? Is it the intention of the Government to prevent wage earners from receiving wage increases to offset these cost increases? Finally, offset this economic madness, would not the Treasurer agree that the simplest solution would be to reduce tariffs?",24
38,Mr LYNCH,INCREASED COSTS,"There is a need to ensure that confidence returns to manufacturing industry as a consequence of the devaluation and that this is not negated by other moves made by the Government. That includes the particularfieldto not be which the honourable member referred. All I would want to say about the subject in response to the general query which he raised is that, as I think I indicated recently, the Government is Minister at this area. I think my colleague the for Industry and Commerce made the this morning. We are looking at the goods and equipment, particularly where such goods and equipment are not produced in Australia. The honourable gentleman raised a question about the impact on the cost of Uving. I assume is referring to the consumer price index. I have to say to the honourable gentleman that the effects are not quantifiable in a sufficiently precise form for it to be responsible of me to indicate the House at this stage. Thefinalpart the of the question referred to the ConciUation and 80 Arbitration Commission. The Government has indusforeshadowed that because of the impact of on the Australian community there and is a need for a much stronger line by the Government before the ConciUation and Arbitration the Commission to seek necessary restraint in wage of and salary movements so that the inflationary I consequences of the wage front which we have experienced in recent years can be subject to very sharp action, one would hope, by the Government in making its submissions before the ball and it CURRENCY DEVALUATION: INFLATION",24
39,Mr KELLY,INCREASED COSTS,My question is directed to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. Mr Jacobi-Bette r make it short.,24
40,Mr KELLY,INCREASED COSTS,"It will be short. Can the Minister assure me that it is still the Government's intention to tackle inflation with courage and determination? Is he aware that the devaluation deis equivalent to an 80 per cent rise in tariff protection for imported protected goods? Does see that not to tackle the tariff Moore. By problem with confidence bolt, resolution will and it is Ukely to it again once",24
41,Mr HOWARD,INCREASED COSTS,"I can assure the honourable to member for Wakefield and all other honourable gentlemen that the Government's resolve to tackle the problem of inflation in Australia remains absolutely undiluted. Any suggestions that it has been diluted are quite honourable gentleman referred to the cost impUcations through increased tariff levels as a result of the devaluation. The Government is aware of them. As the Treasurer just said, and I said earUer, the question of tariffs is under at present. I will have to say again, answer to another question this morning, that prior to the devaluation the competitive position of large sections of manufacturing industry in Australia was extremely parlous. The employthat ment prospects and the re-employment 40 prospects of large numbers of Australians were also extremely parlous. If we were to squander in a general, indiscriminate manner the benefits competitive terms of the devaluation, we would be doing very Uttle towards stopping the increasat ing extent to which jobs and industry exported from Australia. INTEREST RATES : INFLATIO N",24
42,Mr UREN,INCREASED COSTS,Will the Prime Minister confirm that he said on television last night that the minor adjustments to interest rates announced by the Treasurer yesterday are the only adjustand ments to monetary pohcy which will be needed to offset the inflationary effects of devaluation? On what pohcy tool does the Government plan to depend in its future fight against inflation?,25
43,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INCREASED COSTS,"The Government uses all 4 arms of pohcy in its fight against inflation tion. It uses its budgetary arm, external pohcy and wages policy. The action that per cent put had been advised to us by the authorities in relato tion to interest rates was completed in the markets a day or two ago. NA",25

It is also reported that the prices apply to stock imported before last Sunday's devaluation and that the Volvo group has been advised of the decision in a telex from the Tribunal.,25
45,Mr HOWARD,MOTOR CAR PRICES,"My attention has been drawn to those newspaper reports. I am advised that Prices Justification Tribunal has not up to present time given any approvals for price increases in respect of cars.

49,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,YOUTH EMPLOYMENT,"The honourable gentleman is remarkable for his silence on earUer occasions. In 1974 and 1975 his own administration increased government expenditure by 46 per cent. In that year unemployment rose by something approaching 200 000-between 180 000 200 000.

72,Mr UREN,YOUTH EMPLOYMENT,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Accusations have been made by the Prime Minister against Mr Leslie Haylen. He is not here to defend his position. Everyone knows that he was a great Labor man. He stood for full employment.

83,Mr BRYANT,DAY OF MEETING, I have no real objection to our meeting on Monday or any other day. Today is the seventy-fourth day of sitting since last year. I draw the attention of the House to item No. 36 on the Notice Paper-the final report of the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System-and its impUcations for the way in which we run this place. In the way in which we are working I do not see that there is any possibility of the Parliament dealing with legislation adequately. The end-on-end deUberations of 150 to 200 pieces of legislation cannot befittedinto the time available. We have just completed our deliberations on the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill. I suppose that that was the best example we have had for some time of a Bill which was debated at the Committee stage. I suggest to the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) that he take the time to listen to people who have something to say to him.,27

86,Mr BOURCHIER,DAY OF MEETING," I took session note of what the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) said and I thought that some comments-onl y some-were very sensible. But I think that he is totally out of order when he criticised this Government because it was Leader of the House in his Government who took the greatest deUght in telling us how many Bills Labor passed in one year- a record number of Bills-and did it without any regret. Simply, wanted to say what a magnificent record it had. agree, Mr Speaker, that there should be some consideration of this matter by the Parliament. know that you have thoughts regarding this ter. We aU have thoughts on it. We all agree the remarks of the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) but there is no point in his or any other member's, blaming one party or another party for something that has been going on for years. I think he is trying to play trade poUtics and it does not become him.",28
87,Mr MORRIS,DAY OF MEETING,"WhUst I do not oppose the motion moved by the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) I want to register my protest, as one who has been a member of the Joint Committee on the ParUamentary Committee System. When the report of that Committee was brought down and the Government, by sheer weight of numbers, forced through this House a motion to estabUsh the House of Representatives Standing Committee on ExpenearUer this year, an undertaking was given that there would be a full parliamentary debate in this session on the report of the Committee. Although the session is to conclude next week no opportunity has been given for that report to be duscussed. The Expenditure Committee, from what I understand of its performance, is not was working in any effective fashion whatsoever. What has really happened is that the considerable amount of time and effort that was put into preparation of the report on the committee we system by members of the Committee on both with sides of the House has been disregarded.

88,Mr LES JOHNSON,DAY OF MEETING," I be the Ueve the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) should be commended for taking this opportunity to raise the general question of the need to review sitting hours. The Joint Comit mittee on the ParUamentary Committee System, I to which he referred, obviously has a very important job to do. Mr Speaker, since you and I I arrived in this place a great number of parUamatmentary topics have emerged which never with existed before. Such massive issues as urban affairs, the environment, education and Aboriginal affairs which were not before regarded as the prerogative of this Parliament are now being considered. It seems to me that in the face of that situation and considering that the business of the Parliament is being run as it has been done since the Parliament commenced in 1901 without any significant changes, we will run out capacity to provide for effective parUamentary democracy. For a period there was an indication of pubUc concern in the sense that there was democracy the streets or poUtics in the streets. People were losing their faith in the parUamentary system. centuate They will go on losing it unless we look at ways and means of utilising more effectively the human resources of this Parliament. It is a ridiculous situation when one man can stand to make a speech, sometimes a bad speechincreasing present speech excepted from that possibilityand find that all other members are expected to listen, whereas in fact they do not. This system which is operating at the presenttimeis rendered ineffective and almost obsolescent. There is need for arrangements that will enable parliamentary mentarians to relate to the bureaucrats and opinion makers and leaders of industry, comincluded merce and trade unions. There is probably need for this whole parliamentary human conefficiently. glomeration to have a committee process in the areas of speciality so that the Parliament gather together just to hear reports and maybe even to allow members to speak in the Parliaimposing ment after the matter has been dealt with in greater depth outside. I conclude by saying that the Opposition never than objects to extended sittings is good to have due notice of interests of constituents are very important. Noreduced PubUcfunctions body wants to break commitments. But, more overtime and those important than anything else, more than the consideration of an added sitting day, the obvious need to obtain better results from the total effort contributed to the parUamentary endeavour by members of Parliament.",28

I join my colleagues in urging that provision is made this to be done. It is not sufficient to give extra time to the Parliament on an ad hoc basis. It is necessary to look at the procedures of Parliament. The report of the Joint Committee was on which members of both Houses and of aU Parties worked very hard and reached a great degree of unanimity in the findings. The honourable member for Wills (Mr of the Bryant) mentioned the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill as one very suitable for consideration by legislative committees. Having acted as Chairman of Committees last year when the Bill of the Labor Government was being conin sidered and again on this occasion, I agree that this would be very proper. But I would like to acthat it is not just a question of legislative committees or subject matter committees. What we really should be looking at is the procedures of the House and how they can be reviewed from up time to time and brought into line with the legislative load and new matters that come before the House.",29

92,Mr INNES,TRADE UNIONS,"This of their livelihood. Government, having failed to honour the grandiose promises with which it conned its way to power, seeks a scapegoat to divert attention from its manifest inadequacies in the economic field. That scapegoat is the elected trade union leadertorian ship of Australia. Despite with the sleight hand men, the manipulators of truth on the other side, may say, its leadership is democratically elected. In the long and shameful history of union bashing by conservative parties, this arch conservative Government stands supreme. There is no limit to the depths to which this Governtrade ment and its spokesmen will sink, no limit to the subterfuge to which it will resort to denigrate and over try to destroy responsible trade unionism in this station, but they country.

It is carrying out in a ruthless way its announced policy of reducing the real wages of Australians while sliding about over the place in other areas of the economy. Two areas come to mind in which the Governreference ment is spear-heading its assault on the trade unions. One with which I will deal briefly is the shipbuilding industry. The other is the Newport power station in Victoria which I will deal with some length. Shipbuilding is an industry which one would expect would be in line with the projections Government's own philosophy-o r whatever it is called-to maintain. It would seem a good idea to keep viable such an industry, particularly when so many more jobs are at stake and whose loss would further aggravate the problem of It unemployment. Instead of being honest about the matter the Government does the opposite to the Mafia, which it closely resembles, and makes the unions involved an offer they cannot possibly accept. It then blames the unions for being irresponsible in not accepting the offer. Such manifest double dealing is something one does not expect from a responsible government which says it has the future of Australia at heart. Union leaders have rightly by condemned the offer, while good working people the city of Newcastle remain in fear of the loss This brings me to the Newport issue. It is appropriate to raise this matter in this place because the Draconian measures taken by the VicGovernment against the trade unions have of been enthusiastically applauded by this Government's leaders. Trade union leaders visiting this country in past weeks have been appalled both by the nature of the Government's so-called offer on shipbuilding and by the savagery of the Victorian response on Newport. They say that no union in the world could accept either. Let us look at what the unions have done in Victoria the Newport issue. Certainly they have maintained bans on the buUding of this power have done so for good and coin been supported by men the community who have for the unions beown cause they are the only thing standing between the community and potential disaster'. The - unions did not take their decision lightly. The to Newport issue has been the subject of long and debate. By a majority vote the unions came down on the side of maintaining the bans. Now they have gone further in a genuine effort to find a compromise which has been lacking in the as Victorian Government's approach to this The unions have asked for a wide-ranging all inquiry into Victoria's power requirements and an examination of alternative sites for the power station. Let us look at the proposed terms of for such an inquiry. It will inquire into the necessity for an intermediate load power station, including an assessment of the present capacity to ascertain whether it can provide for at present and future variations in demand. It will mquire into the State Electricity Commission on electrical energy needs and the capacity of the system to supply them. It will examine alternative sources of power and the abUity to deliver that power in Victoria, particularly through a stabilisation technology for the system. will examine matters not considered by the previous Newport inquiry-lan d use, resource use, the economics of electricity generation natural gas, decentralisation and aesthetics. will assess alternative sites existing in Victoria new power stations. I ask: Is that irresponsible? Is that holding the State to ransom? attempt to take over from the elected Government? It certainly is not. It is a reasonable clusion reached by concerned men and women with the future needs, comforts and prosperity the people of Victoria very much in mind. Do we get this level of concern from the other side? Do we get an intelligent approach seeks to look at the problem of resources in the broad and to make the most efficient use of all resources? We do not. What wethat get is an exercise in the poUtics of confrontation, seems an almost lunatic determination to build the Protection Newport power station at all costs, to the extent that the issue has become the focus of crisis Victoria. The hysterical reaction of the Hamer Government to the continuation of the unions' ban on the building of the Newport power tion demonstrates that its professed concern the people of that State is hypocritical. That Government's solution to the stopping of one project is to stop aU projects, including hospitals, and sewerage and water instaUations, which are all vitally needed by the community. power The next trick in the Hamer Government's reac-many tionary repertoire is to introduce anti-union legisconstruction lation within the poUtics of confrontation to cre-load ate havoc and civil strife. This Government self-eliminated, righteously says that the unions have acted contrary to the interests of the people that it gets back to the simple question running the State. The unions are saying in first instance that the power station is not required at the proposed Newport site; that should be built elsewhere. They are saying levels further that a power station of the type proposedIt for the Newport site may not be needed at all, and there is abundant evidence to support this second contention. It has been put to the people of Melbourne that the opposition to Newport is being mountedconversation by a coaUtion of the power-hungry Left and unrealistic eco-freaks. This Government sold denegrates responsible people who make up such bodies as the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Port Phillip Conservation Counof cU and the Williamstown Conservation Society. Certainly the environment-the pollution of an already polluted atmosphere-is an issue in struggle against the Newport proposal. But it is not the only one. The use of land resources closeable to the city, the wicked misuse of scarce fuel but the resources-indee d the whole question of a tinue by rational resource pohcy-ar e equaUy factors in It the Newport debate. All of these factors have for been ignored by the empire building bureaucracy of the State Electricity Commission and by Is that an the Hamer Government. Let us deal with the environmental issue first conbefore getting down to the issue of whether the Newport power station or something Uke it is ofneeded in Victoria. One scientific opinion on air pollution and the Newport issue concludes: The photochemical air pollution problem in Melbourne is which already bad, and it will get worseall energy I interpolate and say 'ifNewport begins operating. To allow these increases, plus from Newport, to be added to an already bad situation to indicate that the official goal of the Environment Authority and the Government that is to clean up Melbourne's air pollution is not being taken seriously. in Another opinion concludes that the emission of oxides of nitrogens for Newport 'will contribute to the severity and probably the frequency of E stahotochemical smogs over Melbourne, which for ave been increasing in recent years'. Mr I. C. Cochrane, lecturer in electrical engineering at the University of Melbourne, makes this comment schools, on the Newport project: The Newport station was intended to provide electric for weekday industrial and domestic load plateau of hundreds of megawatts. Because it would pollute Melbourne and deplete the natural gas resources of the State its was banned by the trade unions. However the plateau can be reduced and the need for Newport given appropriate policy and consumer cooperation. of Victoria and Mr YATES - Waffle. of who is Mr INNES-The SEC drones on-like the the honourable member's bees, and we have learned to Uve with that-abou t the absolute need for the it Newport power station to cater for assumed of demand for electric power in the future. is quite clear that the predicted demand is a direct result of the SEC's own prodigal marketing and tariff poUcies in the absence of i rational energy poUcy. The SEC has actively discouraged community awareness. The Minister for Productivity (Mr Macphee), who is carrying on a with the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) and who his soul for the front bench, is probably riving some unwieldy words of advice. The need for energy conservation has encouraged high levels energy use. Ms Deborah White, a lecturer in buUding science at the University of Melbourne, in a penetrating study of whether we can afford the the Newport power station, had this to say: Not only is the need for Newport the direct and predictresult of the SEC's past marketing and tariff policies, Commission's present policies are designed to conexponential growth in energy consumpuon into the twenty-first century. With a predicted growth rate cent, this means that demand will be encouraged to every 11 years. By the year expected (hoped?) to increase 16 times. Meanwhile toria's population growth rate has dropped to less cent and is likely to decline steadily. Researcher White goes on to say: It is clear that it is in fact the enormous predicted increase in the use of domestic electric Newport is said to be needed. Ine increased consumption is in all cases at least partly the direct result of SEC promotion and marketing. The SEC, however, continues to threaten the community with industrial power shortages, stand-downs and unemployment if Newport is not built immediately. The Newport power station represents a wantonly wasteful use of the ndeniably scarce resource of natural gas. In fact, it must come as a surprise to many people that you need to use natural gas to run an intermediate electric power generating plant such as that proposed for Newport. Using gas to supply electricity requires at least 1.7 times the gas required by the more direct gas stove. The competition to sell resourcewasteful electric stoves in competition with the Gas and Fuel Corporation, which operates under the same Minister, is an indictment of the lack of a fuels policy in the Victorian Government. High peak loads are also the most expensive to supply. The reduction of electric stove installations and the substitution of gas stoves would reduce the total demand curve to provide a more efficient plant use and resource use. Time does not permit me to go into other alternatives which the evidence suggests are Employment available to Newport. If the alternatives I have (11.22 )- I think and put and others are in contention then the mquiry factor in a remarkably uninteresting requested by the Victorian unions would mine the best course of action.

As far as I am concerned the traditional role of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is to settle industrial disputes as an independent authority without its being coerced by the Minister or by the Prime Minister, therighthonourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser) who goes back to 1957 to get a prop for his Government. If the Government contemplates such a step it should have the guts to go to the Australian people on the issue. I offer the warning that attempts to destroy the principles of concUiation and arbitration in the industrial arena has resulted in the demise of governments lead by Stanley Melbourne Bruce in Australia and Mr Edward Heath in the United Kingdom. The same fate awaits this incompetent Government. If the Government believes that it is going to lead the Australian people up the garden path by this deception then it has another think coming. It will not alter the fact that the Government is on a disaster course. It is destroying the Australian economy and trying to batter the Australian unions into submission.",30
93,Mr STREET,TRADE UNIONS,"Corangamite-Minister for that Industrial Relations) possibly the one interesting speech from deterthe honourable member for Melbourne the matter of public importance that he himself has The whole tenor of his speech was to a lot of irrelevancies which had nothto do with the matter before the House. I Uke to analyse the matter proposed for by the honourable member for Mellike to analyse the matter and the accuracy or inaccuracy the time that this have sought to they estabUsh effective working relations the Council of Trade Unions in particular, certainly to a greater extent than his Government did when it was in office, and to a greater extent then any has done for many years. We have to continued these efforts that we started his immediately on coming to office 12 months I should like to give some iUustration of the them sort of action I am talking about. About this ume last year we held discussions  the employers on the establishment of a national labor consultative council. We hoped that it would be formed to enable detailed considersition ation of issues affecting the industrial scene. a matter of regret to the Government that the ACTU so far has not seenfitto agree to particitired pate in that body. I would like to take this tunity of saying that the offer remains open. We have consulted with unions and employers on industrial legislation before it has been mand ontothethe introduced this year. When sensible were made to amend the Government's legismajor obstacle toreached lation we accepted them. Major discussions held between the Government and the unions ment. Every poll that isoftaken last May which lasted about 2 days. The meeting people was chaired by the Prime Minister and attended on the Government side, by the Deputy It is interesting to note that this opinion Prime Minister (Mr Anthony), the Treasurer by many of the rank and file members of (Mr Lynch), the Minister for Industry and merce (Senator Cotton), myself, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard), leaders and the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) together lost touch with permanent heads and other senior advisers. the trade unoins I doubt that any government in been prepared to participate in such a way in the best interests ofatheir face to face discussions with unions at such a tive; a few who, in pursuitmembers high level over such an extended period of time. ideologies, are quite prepared to keep Far from denigrating the trade union movemembers ment these sorts of discussions have sought to recognise the important role which we accept it. has in the community. At the same time, no government would be responsible if it were refrain from speaking out on issues when it bedevoted Ueves that the behaviour of particular groups not consistent with the overall interest of the community. That applies whether it is unions, employers, or interested groups of various kinds. It is open to unions and to every group in the community to express and to seek to promote views which they hold on any particular matter which is of direct interest to their members. We, as a responsible Government take account of the wide variety of views which are expressed. It for the Government, elected as it has been responsible to the electorate, to make the decision and to accept the responsibility. It is for unions or any other group to use their industion trial or other power to prohibit the implementamatter tion of decisions which the Government has undertaken. The proposal which is before us today for discussion of a matter of public - importance proves that the Opposition has lost contact the real world. The fact remains that the honourunquestionably able member for Melbourne did not speak about the form of words which appear on the nouce forpaper. Taking the proposal on face value, it proves that the Opposition has lost touch with the real world. I cannot imagine why the Oppochoose to propose this discussion in the It is form that it has. Every day there is more and more evidence that people are getting sick and of a few leaders- I emphasise that-of the oppor-trade union movement disrupting the economic and social Ufe of this country; denying their own servicesmembers the right to work; denying goods and pubUc; and making unreal deresources of the country. In fact, the suggestions stage has been where the only real Australian recovery is the bewere haviour of a few leaders the trade union moveconfirms that was is abusing the considerable powerof believe that this minority union leaders that they have. is shared the Comtrade union movement itself. The Labor movement has lost touch with reality and some of the of the trade union movement also have with reaUty. The proper functions of are being swamped by the irresAustraUa has ponsible actions of few- a few who do not have of their as their objecown poUucal their out of work and prevent the creation of jobs. There are so many examples of this sort of action that it is difficult to identify all of them. Perhaps the most glaring example is the one to to which the honourable member for Melbourne the greater part ofhis speech-that is the is ban on the building of the Newport power station in Victoria. The ban itself is costing hundreds of jobs which otherwise would be available to people who would be building the power station. Make no mistake about it: The ban has nothing to do with the legitimate aims of the trade union movement. It is a blatant attempt to take over the role of government irrespective of the interests of the people of Victoria. The projis ect has been the subject of the most detailed and examination on environmental grounds. The final honourable member for Melbourne seems to not ignore the fact that the Environmental ProtecAuthority in Victoria has looked into this in the greatest detail and completely cleared the project. If the power needs of Victoria are to be met in the most economical way, it is essential that this project proceed. I am the informed that the extra cost of building somewhere else the power station proposed for Newwith port would be approximately $100m. That would raise substantially the cost of power in Victoria and that, in turn, would higher costs to an already inflated cost structure. It is probable that, in addition, there will shortage of power in Victoria as a result of delay in getting the power station built. This mean that industries which would have been up in Victoria will be delayed or perhaps will be set up at all. This means further the loss jobs-man y jobs-for years ahead. There is only one group of people responsible for this affairs, and that is a small number of trade leaders who quite deUberately are creating unemployment now and much greater unemworker ployment prospects in the future in Victoria. that is what Opposition members regard as example of the trade union movement being volved in matters of legitimate interest, I assure them that they are the only people who do. Let us look at another dispute and stack it against the criteria that have been set out in matter proposed for discussion this morning. refer to the ban on the deUvery of mail to John Fairfax newspaper company in Sydney. The ban on the deUvery of mail to that company was imposed by a union which had no interest no concern in the dispute with that company. Opposition members regard that as a legitimate use of trade union influence? Do they support that sort of ban or that sort of action? If they and if they regard that action as legitimate, hear them say so. There is another form of industrial action, that is the making of excessive wage claims. stress the word 'excessive'. A good example this is provided by some 60 members of the aired. Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, the minority Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Associengaged ation and the Electrical Trades Union who weremembers employed by the J. Ray MCDermott company on the Bass Strait oil platform construction project. These men have been on strike since 7 October support of claims for an even time work cycle. These men currently are employed on a work this cycle of 14 days on and 7 days off. They are striking in support of a claim for a work cycle of days on and 7 days off, with no reduction in pay. If agreed to, this claim would mean in effect they would work 61 days less a year for the same amount of pay. It is a claim the wage fixing principles of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The dispute has been before Mr Justice Coldham on a number of occasions. The company concerned has indicated its willingness to have the outstanding claims bitrated; but the unions have always refused to do this. add The extraordinary aspect is that 75 per cent of those employed on the project, who are members of the Federated Iron workers Association and be athe Australian Workers Union, have accepted the the company's offers of improved working conwillditions. They are quite ready and prepared to setresume work. So, the strike is being continued notonly by a minority of employees who are directly of causing the unemployment of fellow workers. It is interesting to note the pay that these people are state of receiving. Honourable members should unionremember that these men are on a work cycle of direct 14 days on and 7 days off. The lowest paid on this project currently receives almost If $30,000 a year. The highest paid worker on the an project is paid approximately $38,000 a year. inThe wage claims which they have made would can add, from memory, some $8,000 a year to the levels of wages that I have just quoted. The AusuptraUan economy just cannot stand claims of that the magnitude. There is no way in the world that emI ployment can be maintained, let alone new jobs the created, if that sort of action is pursued. There are dozens of other examples of this orkind of thing contributing directly to unemployDoment. They are a constant reminder of the truth of a comment made by a previous Labor Party Treasurer not so long ago when he said that a do,rise in one man's pay packet can cost another let usman his job. The trade union movement itself cannot afford to let this small minority of leaders, this miUtant minority, continue to deny jobs to other people and continue to delay economic and recovery in this country. The honourable memI ber for Melbourne has done one service to the of House today in enabling this question to be It gives me no pleasure to say that a small of trade union leaders are directly in action which is preventing their from getting jobs and preventing jobs from being created for those people whom they have put out of work, so that they can resume inproductive employment and a satisfying life. So, if the honourable member's action in proposing subject for discussion as a matter of public importance today has done nothing else, it has 7 enabled this House to have a look at actions which quite clearly are contrary to the best thatinterests of the trade union movement and contrary to the best interests of the Australian that is clearly outsidecommunity.",32
94,Mr WILLIS,TRADE UNIONS,"The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) accused the Opposition of losing ar-touch with reaUty. I suggest that his own statement, that the irresponsible action of a few trade union officials was preventing economic recovery in this country, shows how much out of touch with reality this Government has become. The fact is that, despite the Minister's protestations, in the period it has been in office this Governdeal ment has engaged in a campaign of denigration and vilification of at least part of the trade movement. In fact, when the Government talks about only a few people being involved, usually it is accusing the trade union movement of actionworking which encompasses many more than just a few people. The Newport project dispute, to which will come later, is a good example of that. Firstly, let me say that even before Government came to power its members ran a campaign of vilification against trade union officials. They concentrated on a few unions, such as the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, and said that the leaders were unrepresentative of their unions because they were elected by very small proportion of the membership. The sheer cynicism of the action of Government members in that regard has been shown by whatvironmental has happened this year. The Government, havlost ing provided for compulsory secret postal ballots for the election of union officials, found that legislation had endangered the tenure of office some ultra right wing officials. The Government then passed legislation to allow union officials be elected by an amazingly small proportion their union membership. For instance, approximonths mately 0.02 per cent of the membership now elect the officials of unions which decide to the collegiate system. The sheer cynicism of Government's action in this regard has been amply displayed. Members of the Government Parties have blamed the union movement for lems existing today. The Minister has mentioned some of them in this debate. For instance, in regard to the economy there is no doubt that theticularly Government has tried to use the union movegration ment as a whipping boy for its failure to get economy going. We heard that claim from the Minister who preceded me. In regard to wage indexation, the Government, having broken its promise to support wage indexation, has tremendous attacked the trade union movement for not try accepting a form of wage indexation which of would mean drastic cuts in the real wage levels workers. To expect the trade union movement support drastic cuts in the real level of wages absolutely absurd, particularly given the in Government's initial promise. Yet, that is the line that the Government has pursued. The same can be said with respect to strikes. The Government has tried to pretend that strikesthe have been so high that this has been a problem in regard to economic recovery in this country. The fact is that, with the exception of the various strikes on the Medibank issue, with which I will in a moment, the number of strikes in Australia this year has been extraordinarily low. unionIn the first 7 months of this year, excluding Medibank strikes, the number of working days lost has been 56 per cent less than the number of days lost last year. So, Medibank strikes excepted, there has been a much lower level of Istrike activity. The Government cannot blame that level of strike action for the problems that it this has in regard to the economy. It is true that strikes have been held on the Medibank issue. On one day, some 2 million working days were lost. Overall, the number of working days lost this year is sUghtly in excess of what it was in the period up to August last year. a Nevertheless, the fact remains that only 4 per cent of all strikes have been poUtically motivated or motivated by sociological reasons such as enissues. The number of working days this year is only fractionally higher than the number lost last year. Let us put this into context thatand compare it with losses being caused to the ofeconomy through unemployment. If the Government were able to put another 100 000 people toback to work it would have achieved 14 million of extra working days in the course of thefirst7 of this year. As against that there have canbeen 1.2 million working days lost through adoptstrikes apart from the Medibank strike. If we the include the Medibank strike the figure is just over 3 million. That puts the losses to the economy into context. Losses to the economy from strikes are minor when compared with losses various probthrough unemployment. Then the Government has blamed the unions for the destruction of particular industries, parthe ship building industry. In its deniit ignored the union's actions in relation theto the shipbuilding industry and it continually ignored the basic problems which that industry is having internationally, such as the problems of low prices from the Japanese which are causing difficulties in the shipbuilding indusin Western Europe. It also ignores the paucity new investment in the industry in this country ofand the fact that the industry is operating on a to one off or two off basis all the time without is specialisation. These factors are very important relation to productivity but they get practically no mention from Ministers who discuss the shipbuilding industry in this countiy. Their whole emphasis is on eUminating strikes. In fact over past year or so the unions have gone a long way towards eliminating strikes and stoppages in the shipbuUding industry. Demarcation disputes have virtually disappeared. Again the Governtorian ment is using the unions as an excuse for probrelating lems that it has in that industry. Denigrating union motives in other disputes such as the Newport power station dispute also been popular with this Government. In fact the actions of the unions in placing port have not resulted from the actions of a few. They have been the result of the action of a jority of delegates to the Trades Hall Council Melbourne, not some small unrepresentative ing group of militants but a majority of the unionsern just a majority admittedly, but a majority. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relaworkers, tions have said that the motivation of the unions is poltiical. Patently that is untrue. The unions' motivation in this dispute has been utterly altruagement istic. Their motivation principally has been of the environment but there are also other issues, as the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) mentioned, such as town planning and resources. If we look at the environmental issues briefly we can see why the unions are so conindividually cerned. There is a great amount of evidence about now regarding the poisonous level of the atmosphere in Melbourne. If we look at the tory of"" the granting of the licence for the power station in Newport we can see that in fact the Government pressured the Environmental Proto tection Authority and the Appeals Board in a way which enabled the Newport power station to be given the okay. The fact is that after the first decision by the Environmental Protection Authcan ority the State Electricity Commission appealed it. Because the limits set were too tight consertion. vation bodies appealed it as well. When the ter went to the Environmental Protection AuthOpposition ority Appeal Board the Board increased the allowable Umits for ozone in the atmosphere so that the power station could get a licence. To give the House an idea of the enormous increase, it provided a standard of 13 parts per 100 million for ozone in the atmosphere compared with parts per 100 million laid down by the World Health Organisation and 8 parts per 100 mtflion laid down by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. So there is no doubt that Appeal Board lifted the standard to provide cence for the power station because sured very hard by the Victorian Government. Through those cases the State Electricity Commission said that it would build the station ever happened at the inquiry. Whilst those inquiries were going on the VicGovernment let contracts worth $100m to Newport despite the fact that it did not have environmental approval. Then it said that if the unions did not let the project go ahead $100m would be wasted. It is the fault of that has government because it took quite precipitate action in letting those contracts before it had enbans on Newvironmental approval. maThe fact is that the Newport power station disin pute is only representative of what is a developtrend in this countiy and the rest of the westcapitalist world-that unions are increasingly concerned not only with straight industrial issues such as wages and conditions of employment but through their unions, are becoming increasingly concerned about what they do with their labour. They want to be involved in mandecision making and they are challengone ing managerial prerogatives. That is one very substantial development in worker participation. It is not just happening in this country but is happeningrightacross the western capitalist world. This raises the issue of whether we believe that just workers should have the right, either or collectively, to withhold thenlabour from projects which they believe are contrary to the best interests of society. This Aushistralian Government denies them that right, as indeed do all the conservative governments in this country. The Victorian Government denies it the point where it has introduced and passed legislation which virtuaUy amounts to civil conscription. It has said that workers who will not work on vital State projects, as it declares them, befined;that people who oppose such projects can befined.This is a form of civil conscripIt is opposed strongly by the Labor movematment, the Australian Labor Party and the in this Parliament. It goes totally against the evolving role of unions and extends beyond their conventional industrial issues. The answer to all this is to extend the role of unions to allow them to be involved in the planning process. No one wants this confrontation at the end 6 after a decision has been made and investment has been made. The project then has to be blocked by union decision. It is better if workers are involved in the planning process at the very the outset. That is proper worker participation in a Umanagement and governments eventually will it was preshave to abide by it",34
95,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE UNIONS,Mr Lucock)whatOrder! The honourable member's time has expired.,36
96,Mr CONNOLLY,TRADE UNIONS,This morning we have heard 2 speeches from Oppo-the sition members in support of a matter of public importance. It is regrettable that neither speaker spoke to the subject which was meant to be the substance of the debate.,37
97,Mr WILLIS,TRADE UNIONS,That is totally untrue.,37
98,Mr CONNOLLY,TRADE UNIONS,"Let me go through this decided matter item by item and take the opportunity define the terminology used. Let us analyse the Opposition has said and compare that with the facts of the situation. We were told that Federal Government had instituted a campaign to denigrate the trade union movement. We werefew also told that it denies the trade union movementAugust the right to be involved in matters of legitimate trade union interest. Let me go through those step by step. Where is this campaign? As the con-accept stitutionally elected, government of the people Australia it is our responsibility and ours alone lay down the guidelines for the economic development of this nation-economi c developupset ment which at this stage has faltered. One oftheelected reasons why it has faltered is because there is small group- I emphasise that it is a small group-of militant communist and left-wing ment trade union leaders who have made it quite at every opportunity they get, that they do not Uke the arbitration system, that they do not to Uve under the social system and that they wishconsensus. to destroy the system. Let us look at the realities. If they do not the system they can go and live in the Soviet Union. If they wish to destroy the system they process. can take to the streets where they will be subject to the laws of the land. But if they are prepared to work through the constitutional system, the electoral system of this Parliament, they have right to do that too. What I fail to see is small group, and it is such a small group, can encouraged by the Australian Labor Party to be-of Ueve that it can use its power to destroy, to denigrate and to disrupt the daily activities of the jority of Australian people and of its own trade union rank andfilemembers. If it were not for the fact that one-third of trade union members vote for non-Labor partiesSecretary we could never form a government. If honourquestion: able members examine the trade union movement as a percentage of the total workforce they will see that the trade union movement the represents only just over 50 per cent. What about the remainder? Is it not to be given any What about the mUlions of people in Australia The union who do not belong to trade unions but who system dutifully live by the democratic system they understand and which they respect? Does Opposition seriously suggest that the Government, for some extraordinary reason, is presenting itself as a campaigner against the rights of the trade unions? We are here because the majority of Australians put us here. We are not going to fail them because a small group of trade unionists- I again emphasise that pointthat it does not Uke us, does not like our topoUcies, does not like the system of government whator anything that comes from it. the When we consider the harassment which has fallen upon the average trade unionist, in the last months, in fact in the period from January to this year, trade unionists and workers as a whole in Australia lost $95,894m in wages. In case members of the Opposition do not wish to this fact, I stress that when trade unionists of lose their wages they suffer as much as anybody toelse. When the ordinary people of Australia cannot take a train, a bus or a hydrofoU, they get and say to the Government: 'You are the government. We put you in power to conatrol these situations'. Yet a small group of people including the Opposition is denying the Governits right to administer adequately the activiclear,ties of the Australian economy. May I remind those who wish to destroy our democratic system wishof government that a democracy must exist on a A government cannot effectively carry out what is required of it by the law and by the traditions of the parliamentary system if a small likegroup of people are encouraged to believe that they can usurp power outside the democratic Let us be quite frank about it. We have been told about the so-called democracy in the trade the union movement. How could anyone believe that how a the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union is bedemocratic when 1.1 per cent of the membership approximately 180 000 can elect the Secretary and the Deputy Secretary? Honourable members ma-opposite have the temerity to talk about union democracy. In this week's Bulletin there is an article on a book entitled Inside Australia's Top 100 Trade Unions.

As I pointed out, he elected by 1.1 per cent of the union membership. Not one member of this Parhament would have the temerity to make such an allegation on half of his electorate. Yet certain people in the trade union movement are encouraged to believe that power once gained by various at all costs.

He was referring to the export uranium, and said that the trade union movethey ment must stop the export of uranium.

I question their right to speak when so many of them have not been elected by an acceptable democratic process. Upon what authonty do they walk roughshod over the rights of the Australian eople? In the Australian of 3 June 1976 this E eadline appeared: Strikers walk off for the fiftieth time.

But where lie the interests was this small extreme group of communist-led trade union officials who sabotage the Tasmanian people who go to the polls in a few days?

99,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE UNIONS,"Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired. The discussion has now concluded. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1976 Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Second Reading",38
100,Mr NEWMAN,DEFENCE SERVICE HOMES,"Bass-Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development) That the Bill be now read a second time. The prime purpose of this Bill is to reconstitute the Australian Housing Corporation in accordance with the Government's announced poUcy of and to change its name, nature and function so that its sole responsibihty will be the administraAct. tion of the Defence Service Homes Scheme. The Liberal and National Country Parties stated prior to the 1975 election that the activities of Australian Housing Corporation would be critiporation cally examined. Following that examination, the Government decided that the Corporation should be aboUshed, a decision which was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on 2 February 1976. When the Australian Housing Corporation Bill 1975 was debated in this Parliament, the attitude adopted by the Liberal and National Country Parties was that the Australian Housing Corporation represented an unnecessary and desirable duplication of services already availcontribution able, particularly those services provided by the various State governments. The Government found no evidence to the contrary in its investigaSpeaker, tions. On the other hand, the Government is wholeheartedly committed to the preservation and continuation of the Defence Service Homes Scheme, which we see as a scheme of historical and social importance for a large number of Australians. This Bill therefore provides for the estabUshment of a Defence Service Homes Corporation, the affairs of which wiU be conducted departmental framework by the Secretary to the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The very recent estabUshment of this Department is evidence of referred the Government's interest in the welfare of those Works for who have served this country in the armed proposed Services. Those provisions of the Australian Housing Corporation Act concerned with the powers functions of the Corporation, other than those related to the provision of assistance under the Defence Service Homes Scheme, are repealed. The Corporation will be renamed the Defence Service Homes Corporation and continue its existance as a corporate entity solely for the pose of administering the Defence Service Homes Act. The Australian Housing ation Act as amended will be renamed the Defence Service Homes Corporation Act. Australian Housing Corporation was estabUshed, the assets and UabiUties of the Defence Service Homes Scheme were taken over by the Corporation and new financial were developed to facilitate the provision of benefits at that time under the proposed The staff administering the Scheme, who had always been members of the PubUc Service, lent to the Corporation and employed by it outside of the PubUc Service Act under the proproposed work. visions of the Australian Housing Corporation To ensure that there is no break in continuity in the administration of the Defence Service Homes Scheme, the finance and staffing prothe visions contained in the Australian Housing CorAct will be retained for the ume being and the present staff will continue in employment under the new Corporation. I wish to take the opportunity to indicate the Government's appreaation of the contribution made by the members of the Board of the Australian Housing Corporation during their tenure of office, under the leadership of their distinguished Chairman, Mr A. M. Ramsay, CBE. These members have given of their ume and unhave individually and collectively made their towards the operation of the Corporation in its short Ufe. Their contribution is aphas preciated by the Government. Mr Deputy I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Willis) adjourned.

102,Dr CASS,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"The OppoHigh sition does not intend to oppose this Bill. ever, I would like to recount a little history of matter because we feel that a rather ironical ation has arisen. From about when the Liberal and Country Parties were in power chemists had agitated for a continual review of the remuneration they received for dispensing prescriptions under the pharmaceuand tical benefits scheme. In the course of that period, namely from about March 1961 to July 1970- a quite considerable period-ther e was rninimal increase of 2c a prescription. When Labor came into office in 1972 the chemists received a fee of 45c for dispensing national health prescriptions. Over the course of our in government we had many discussions and were often confronted by the pharmacists. As result of the negotiations that took place during that short period of 3 years we increased the they received by 50 per cent. In other words, went from 45c to about 62c. As the time of our disposal, as it were, from government benches we had started discussions with the pharmacists with the idea of setting up some form of arbitration because it was quite the clear that this brawl would never end unless sides agreed to independent arbitration in some form or other. We had not resolved the problem, I admit that. The pharmacists were still unhappy but at least they were interested in our proposals and we were proceeding with some constructive discussions to try to resolve the problem. I that the pharmacists were still not happy. They still had a claim in for more money which total ran into millions of dollars. One of the many promises made by the Liberal and National Country Parties was a promise to resolve this problem immediately they got into office and to satisfy all the needs and the anxieties of chemists for long term security in area and so on. But of course, as has been the case with many of the promises of this Governhave ment, once having gained power it sought to buy its way out of this matter by the cheapest way 1 >ossible. It made a gesture to resolve the em. It tried to buy the chemists off by offering increase of 5c a prescription. Part of the deal to be that that would wipe the slate clean. Whatpromises ever the previous complaints of the chemists, from then on there would be no more. They would have to then wait a further lapse of time Second Reading for changes in the cost structure and so on to occur before they put in a further claim. Needless to say the pharmacists have refused to accept this bribe. Instead they have proceeded to campaign and have even gone to the extent of instituting Court proceedings to try to force the HowGovernment to adhere to what they consider was this an agreement entered into by the previous Libsitueral Government, not even by the previous the early 1960s Labor Government. We welcome the fact that after so many months the Government has come to its senses has introduced this legislation. Of course, it is very doubtful whether that was necessary, but still I will not quibble about it. It at least a represents some action. The legislation proposes to establish a joint committee consisting of 4 representatives from the pharmacists and 4 representatives from the Public Servicetime presumably they will come from the Department of Health although one of them may come from a the Treasury, I do not know, because that is not specified-and to be presided over by a chairman fee who will be a Deputy President of the Australian it Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. This is a very pompous structure, but the point of the exercise really is to get an arbitrator to arbitrate the between the Government and the pharmacists. If that is the way in which the Government wants to handle this matter, that is OK. But if one reads legislation carefully that is in essence all it is. bothIt is basically what we were proposing to do when we were deposed. I shall not recapitulate the history of this matter. I think there is no doubt that the pharmacists saw that whilst they were still dissatisfied with what we had done they were more dissatisfied with the repeat inadequacies of the Liberal Government, and they continue to be dissatisfied. Hopefully this in sum move will resolve the problems. For these reasons the Opposition does not intend to oppose this legislation. I have simply sought to mention some of the facts behind this matter and to make the point that, as is common this with many of the promises made by the Liberal and National Country Parties, now those parties gained power their promises in this area are not worth anything. It has only been the efflux of time and the increasing pressures from various probsections of the community that has forced the an Government to - finallyhonour the promises was which it very freely made. I suggest that those were very significant in persuading the community to trust the Liberals and to dispose of the last Labor Government. I fear that the com- (a) munity is learning a lesson the hard way. We support the legislation.",40
103,Mr HODGES,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"This National Health Amendment Bill, of some 9 pages will amend a small but offensive part of section 99 of the National Health Act. Its emergence comes at a time when thousands of pharmacists were ginning to give up hope that they would ever justice in the determination of their remuneraown tion for dispensing prescriptions under the maceutical benefits scheme. Although successive governments may have been oblivious to the fact, a few words in section 99 have been the bane of scores of master pharmacists throughout the length and breadth of this country. No or region has escaped the cancerous effects of the diminishing returns to pharmacists as a result government and ministerial domination of the profession by the use of section 99. Over the years a number of senior bureaucrats There have been blamed for the deteriorating position 99. It has of the master pharmacist. It has been claimed that these senior public servants have been insensitive to the plight of pharmacy, that they pharmacists have been toadying to their superiors and the fee determination.

It must be remembered that despite substantial increases in the patient contribution for general benefits from SOc per item when a charge was first introducedpharmacy. in 1960 to $1 in 1971, then to $1.50 in 1975, finally to the present charge of $2 which was implemented in March this year, the total cost the scheme has mushroomed to $317m in 1975-76. That figure does not include about larly $95m, which represents the patient contribution. been since This year the estimated cost will be $310m, with macists' turnover. the cost being contained owing to the full year of operation of the patient contribution at $2 an scheme item. Nevertheless, the pharmaceutical benefits into scheme has provided medicinal preparations for governments all Australians at a substantially the point of deUvery. It has been of inestimable wholesale prices,fee, value in mamtaining a good standard of health pressure and bargaining byabout for our people. It surely must rank as one of the finest schemes of its type in the world. I return to the amendment to section 99 of the principal Act and Ulustrate to the House the offensive nature of but a few words which have proved to be the albatross around the neck of pharmacists of this nation for more than a decwith ade. Section 99 (1) states: The Minister may, after consultation with the Federated Pharmaceutical Service Guild of Australia determinethe rates by reference to which, and the manner in which, the Commonwealth price of a pharmaceutical benefit is to be ascertained for the purposes of this section. In effect, all that is required of the Minister for Health is that he consult with representatives of be the Pharmacy Guild. He can ask them to mornseeing tea, if you Uke, and then determine on his the level of fees pharmacists are to receive. phar-In practice, lengthy mquiries have been conducted by a Joint Committee on Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Arrangements; but when there have been deadlocks on vital issues the Minister has had thefinalsay, with no redress provisions State being avaUable to the Pharmacy Guild. of What a coincidence it is that this massive Act, with more than 130 sections and more than 250 pages, should have the section for pharmacists' fee determination in such a form numbered 99. is always something superstitious about a rather eerie ring to it. Like the batsman dismissed one short of the coveted century, have been one off. They have not quite made the grade in their bid for justice on There is no denying that some have closed down had there been no pharmaceutical benefits scheme, the or even without the squeeze appUed to that scheme in recent years. Pharmacy must accept a fair portion of the blame for the overprovision of outlets. These circumstances are not pecuUar to Most other types of businesses have and experienced closure brought about by senseless of proUferation of outlets and other factors. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme, particua its scope was widened in 1960, has major component of the retail pharIn those earUer years the was more lucrative, and there is Uttle doubt that this factor lured more pharmacists retatt business. The refusal of successive to increase adequately the chemreduced cost at ists' dispensing coupled with diminishing brought by considerable Commonwealth Department of Health officials, resulted in progressively lowering the return to the master pharmacists. The pressure and bargaining to which I refer, to obtain lower wholesale prices of drugs, was the result that flowed from the so-called the negotiations by Department of Health officials drug manufacturers. The pUght of the drug manufacturers, resulting from years of exposure to these negotiations, should not be dismissed lightly. Their position must be reviewed urgently; otherwise many will cease manufacturing operations in Australia and conduct merely Sute warehousing facilities. Should this happen, many thousands ofjobs will be lost. With wholesale prices kept down to extremely Vic low levels, it meant that the retail pharmacist S.A. was receiving less in money terms because his WA margin on cost remained, and still remains, at Tas. 33toper cent. During these years normal overAust. heads, such as wages, rents, postage, telephone and cleaning charges, etc., showed marked increases, certainly out of all proportion to return from dispensing fees and profits from mark-up on drugs. Therefore, the enchantment that existed within retail pharmacy in the early 1960s because returns from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme were fair soon vanished as squeeze was appUed. Many of those lured into opening a pharmacy quickly became pharmaceutical disenchanted. It can readUy be seen that the Government's pharmaceutical benefits scheme has played a significant role in the determination of the number of pharmacies in existence, through the widelyfluctuatingremuneration determined over the years. The normal free play of the market place which controls most years businesses was not the controlling factor in retail pharmacy. Arising out of this situation, it is strange tofindthat, despite a steadily increasing population, the number of pharmacies has decreased during the past 4 years. I seek leave the House to have incorporated in Hansard 2 tables which illustrate the downward trend number of approved pharmacies in the States premises. and the Commonwealth.",41

105,Mr HODGES,PRESCRIPTIONS,"I thank the House. The first the table is taken from the annual report of the the Director-General of Health 1975-76. The second table shows figures expressed as percentage reductions. The first table shows that in the 4 years from 30 June 1972 there were 387 fewer the pharmacies approved by the Commonwealth Department of Health for the dispensing of benefits scheme prescriptions. It can be seen from the second table that, with the exception of Tasmania where the decrease has been minimal and Western Australia where a sUght increase of 1.01 per cent occurred in 1975-76, the general trend has been one of steady decline. The overaU reduction for the 4 is 6.57 per cent. The closed pharmacies faU mto 2 categories.

In addition to the number of pharmacies forced to close over recent years, it must be realised that there are hundreds of existing retail shops whose owners are barely making a Uving. In some instances pride keeps them from closing the doors. In other instances it is purely a desire to remain in business and to continue to be one's own master. This Bill signals the culmination of 15 years of bitter argument and counter argument between officials of the Pharmacy Guild, officials of the Department of Health, 1975 1976 Ministers for Health and politicians. Bitterness 2 034 2 014 on the part of some senior Guild officials in past 1496 years has seen them openly and pubUcly advis883 880 ing their members not to support a government. 490 487 Knowing the frustrations of these people, I can 396 400 well imagine their feelings and how they were 146 146 motivated to such drastic measures. 20 19 65 62 I believe that it would be remiss of me not to pay tribute to the senior negotiators of the Phar5 504 macy Guild. Theirfightfor many years past has been led by the National President, Alan Russell of South Australia, and by John Scown of Victoria and Alan Grant-Taylor of Queensland. They are to be commended for their tenacity and patience in times when Guild members throughout the country were edgy, dissatisfied and often highly critical. This Government is to be praised for taking a sane approach to the problem and for recognising something which was unfair and unjust and then moving to rectify the anomaly. It should be recognised by all that governments do not have bottomless pits from which to draw money, as is popularly thought by the public at large. To relinquish such a control over an area where substantial expenditure occurs is quite a feat and illustrates the fairness and goodwill of this Government. This speech would be incomplete if I did not commend the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) who was prepared to listen, to identify the problems and then to act so swiftly to rectify the anomalous situation. On a number of occasions over the past 3 years I have spoken in the House and outside it about the difficulties of the profession. I have always been genuine in my expression that I do not carry any special brief for pharmacy, although I retain some retail pharmacy interests. I have criticised various aspects of the profession before; no doubt I will do so again. On this issue I was convinced that justice was not being done. I mention this point because in politics people have the knack of saying: 'He is only in it for himself. I feel that my colleagues on the Opposition side would confirm my non-partisan approach on many issues and, in relation to this issue, would agree that my support for this measure is not motivated by self-interest. I have oft stated that I am first and foremost a representative of the people; that being a politician is my prime duty. I might add that no political pressure has been brought to bear on the Government to have this decision made, in the sense of any standover tactics or threats of withdrawal of support by the Pharmacy Guild. If that sort of thing had been possible, this move would have been made many years ago. Pharmacists are not a pressure group. On the contrary, they are a highly respectable band professional people, basically docile, who form a tremendous duty in all communities for the general good of mankind. They have no polmust itical muscle. There are only 5500 retail pharact macy outlets in Austraha. I suggest that they could muster no more than 20 000 votes at best. It is my impression that there is little or no public sympathy in the community for a particular promust fessional group when there is a suggestion the professional group is inadequately remunerated. It has been a popular misbelief for decades that all master pharmacists are wealthy. Some are, most are not. So far I have examined the background to the problem and have spoken in some depth on the issues that have occasioned the bringing forward of this amendment. I now turn to the substance of the Bill itself to explain how the changes to the system will be implemented. In essence, independent arbitration is to replace government or poltiical dominance. For the first time the determination of the level of remuneration to pharmacists for dispensing prescriptions will be taken out of the poltiical arena and vested in a body of 9 people who will meet as the Joint Committee on Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Arrangements. It will comprise a chairman being a deputy president of the Australian ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission, 4 members nominated by the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and 4 officers of the Public Service. The Government has shown good faith in the Pharmacy Guild by giving it complete autonomy with the selection of people it nominates to the Joint Committee. If the Pharmacy Guild desires to terminate the appointment of any or all of its nominees to the Committee, the Minister shaU so terminate the appointment or appointments on the recommendation of the Guild. The independent chairman must make his determination m accordance with the Committee's recommendations, provided the Committee reaches a unanimous decision. If there is dissension the chairman has the power to arbitrate and hand down his personal decision. That decision is binding on both the Pharmacy GuUd and the Government. It cannot be meddled with by either side. This is the form of simple arbitration which the Guild has been seeking for years, but to date it has been denied. The Joint Committee will conduct such inquiries as are necessary to determine dispensing fees to be paid to pharmacists, and cannot meet until all 9 members are present. In other words, a quorum is the full committee. In spite of this excellent measure which should give pharmacy much greater stabUity, it is really only the of beginning of the era of stability for the retaU perpharmaceutical industry. Much more has to be done and a careful rationalisation of pharmacies be carried out. It is over to the profession to sensibly and rationally to ensure that outlets are maintained at a level where the public purpose and convenience are served while maintaining a fair income for the pharmacist. Pharmacy learn from the bitter lesson it has attended that over the past 15 years. I am concerned that the qualified pharmacist, a person with valuable training and possessing skills obtained at a tertiary education institute, is wasting a great deal of those skills carrying out present duties. Is the community reaping the full benefit of the pharmacy education dollar? The obvious answer is no. What point is there in training people to a high standard, which should improve with years of experience, if those skills are to be wasted and diminished with the passing of the years? The profession must diversify for the good of the health of the community and for the morale and mental outlook of the individual pharmacist. The pharmacist's more meaningful role could be achieved in many areas such as the dissemination of information to the community in health education programs and assistance to the medical profession by providing more pharmacological information. 'Prevention is better than cure' is an old cliche not to be dismissed lightly. A health education program conducted through the 5500 pharmacies to our 13.5 million people could save much suffering and reduce the quantity and cost of medical and hospital care. Busy doctors often cannotfindthe time to study pharmacology, which deals with the specific actions of drugs on the organs and tissues of the body. The pharmacist could develop more expertise in thisfieldand assist doctors. Already some chemists keep patient medication profiles to avoid drug interactions, allergies and incompatabilities. This is a simple but valuable service much appreciated by the patient and I believe that it would be welcomed by the medical profession. Family planning is another area where the pharmacist could play a useful role. There is surely no need to divert the present quantity of resources into afieldlike this when the understanding pharmacist, with a little more specialised training in this area, could be fulfilling the function at little cost. I hope that matters I have raised can be studied in some detail by the Pharmacy Guild, that some plan of diversification can be evolved in consultation with the medical profession and governments and that this Government and the States will take more advantage of the skills and integrity of the pharmacy profession. It is a resource ready to be tapped for the overall benefit of our communities at little cost.",42
106,Mr LLOYD,PRESCRIPTIONS,"The honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) referred to the long standing disagreement between the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the Government. He referred to the impact, of the agreement to amend section 99 of the National Health Act which will provide an independent arbitrator. The core of the dispute over the years has been that the veto power of the Minister for Health has prevented independent arbitration. In an attempt to resolve this long standing dispute, in 1972 the then Minister for Health Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson made an agreement with the Guild to have the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Arrangements, Sir Walter Scott, make some recommendations for adoption by Government. When the Australian Labor Party came to office the Minister for Health, Dr Everingham, confirmed that arrangement. In May 1975 the recommendation was handed down which, if adopted, would cost approximately $73m. The Labor Government at that time did not honour its confirmation of the agreement made by Sir Kenneth Anderson to pay the full amount of $73m. It paid $33m. I am not saying whether that was the right or wrong decision. I am only referring to that point. Following that, relations between the Pharmacy Guild and the previous Government deteriorated until the Guild was about to issue a High Court writ in November last year. Then the dissolution of the Parliament occurred, we had an election and this Government was returned to power. At that time. I was the shadow Minister for Health for the Liberal and National Country parties. I stated: We will investigate the establishment of a more satisfactory method of setting chemists' professional fees. As a matter of urgency, a Liberal-National Countiy Party Government will re-open negotiations with the Pharmacy Guild to satisfactorily conclude the unresolved recommendations of the committee under Sir Walter Scott investigating chemists' professional fees.",44
107,Mr HUNT,PRESCRIPTIONS,"A good policy, too.",44
108,Mr LLOYD,PRESCRIPTIONS,"I want to congratulate the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt), who is sitting at the the table, for the implementation of that policy. The initial offer to the Pharmacy Guild by the present Government was 5c, or a total of $15m, which fell short of the disputedfigure.In a reaction to this the Pharmacy Guild went ahead and issued the writ. I am one who has said that the Pharmacy Guild acted too abruptly, that it should then have gone into negotiation with the Government on this matter. There are those in the Pharmacy Guild who disagree with me, who say that they tried patience for close to 20 years and it failed, that this was the only course. However, behind the scenes, patient negotiation did continue between the Mmister, members of the Government Members Health and Welfare Committee and members of the Pharmacy Guild. That patient negotiation has paid off. An initial agreement was reached between the Minand ister and the Guild which resulted ment of the writ. Once this Bill has passed through both Houses of the Parliament and the macy Act has been proclaimed, I understand that the ried agreement provides that the writ will be withtherebackward drawn. I am looking forward to the withdrawal ridiculous, of that writ before Christmas. Not only will that be a great Christmas present for the pharmacists and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, it will be an acknowldgement of the rebuilding of trust between the retail chemists of Australia and this Government. I join the honourable member for Petrie in congratulating the Minister for Health and the senior officials of the particular Mr Alan Russell and Mr John Scown, for the patient and constructive negotiations must which have brought this divisive issue to a satisfactory conclusion after so many years. However, as the honourable member for Petrie and others have mentioned, that does not mean the end of problems for retail chemists and for pharmacy in Australia. There is a surplus of chemists in certhe tain urban areas and there are problems of videtermination. ability for chemists in certain country areas. understand that the Minister has taken up with the Guild the matter of viability of chemists certain country regions and I look forward to announcement by the Minister on some prothey cedure that will ensure the continued presence retail chemists in smaller country communities. The other basic problem is the form of pharmacy remuneration, as distinct from determination. In my view the form of determination should take into greater account the professional role of the pharmacist and a more positive proach to health care. I will call it sickness vention rather than drug therapy. I refer to article entitled 'Drugs Under Health Insurance Abroad' in 'Pink Pages', the United States macy Journal dated 8 November 1976. It condifferent tains a report of a recent seminar held in the United States organised by the United States partment of Health, Education and Welfare in that which the national health schemes of 6 countries were discussed. Australia was one of the tries that were of considerable interest because has a national health scheme. Australia has one of the oldest national health schemes in the world and one of the greatest interest to countries in the Western world. Theodore Goldberg of Wayne State School of Medicine attacked the pharmacy reimburpolicy sements systems that are based exclusively on the notion of product transfer, or a commercial transaction. He particularly criticised the British Australian method of acquisition cost plus in the defermark-up plus fee. He said: You're not interested in how we pay, but how much. Pharhas taken an out-moded method of payment and carit to a ridiculous extreme. The Australian system is so that you would provide a 'fee' for service when is no service; it boggles the mind. It's retrogressive, outmoded and permits so little experimentation. For all our faults, there is more innovation and experimentation at the pharmacy level here in the US also 0270than any any of your countries have tried. Australia's Arthur E. Shields, supported by Britain's T. Douglas Whittet, agreed that pharmacy reimbursement systems are antiquated and that Australian pharmacists are now locked into the Pharmacy Guild, in situation. He said: It's not easy to change, but if it is to change, pharmacy demonstrate to government the value of the change. I do not mean any criticism of anybody quoted or of the fact that at an international seminar people are questioning not the way in which the determination is arrived at, that is, the level of fee, but whether that is the correct basis for I do not particularly want to start I a row with the Pharmacy Guild just at the moment when it is satisfactorily concluding what in has been a long standing problem. After talking an to pharmacists around Australia, I believe that recognise that there is still a basic problem of of resolving a satisfactory professional approach to pharmacy and to positive attitudes and counselling on health care with the present payment system that we have. I would also Uke to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that when members were given copies of the Bill to amend the principal apAct, without the principal Act itself, we were pregiven, I think, 11 or 12 separate sheets of paper an containing various amendments. I know that both the previous Government and this GovernPharment have been fairly active in amending aspects of the National Health Bill. The Minister, probably more than anyone else, hopes Dethat that degree of change will not continue. If is to be the case, I appeal to the Minister to have a consolidated document fairly soon and counget back to one weighty volume rather than it chase pieces of paper all over the place. That is not a criticism of the Minister or anybody else. It is just one of the things that has developed. I hope that something can be done about it. To conclude, I once again congratulate the Minister and the leadership of the Pharmacy Guild for the faith which they developed in each other that the announced and ennunciated by the Liberal-National Country Parties at the previous election campaign would be honoured. I congratulate them because as a result of thus faithful and patient negotiation that commitment has now been honoured.",44
109,Mr HUNT,PRESCRIPTIONS,"in reply- I conclude the debate briefly by thanking honourable members for their tributions that they have made to the second reading debate. I would like to respond to sevthis eral points made by each of the speakers. Firstly, in response to the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass), I make no apology whatsoever for former Liberal-National Country Party Governments. Nor should the Opposition spokesman for Health make any apology for failure of the former Labor Government to that justice was done to the Pharmacy Guild. always believe that justice must at least appear be done in respect of the determination of serthat vices rendered on behalf of the public half of the Government. Section 99 of the Principal Act which stood the statute books for many years, contained provision that made it very difficult to justify cisions that were taken in respect of determinavery tion of professional fees for the dispensing pharmaceutical benefits. I think therein Ues the argument. When a decision was made it was chemists made by a Minister- I suppose one could say in an arbitrary sense-afte r a joint committee been unable to come to an agreement. In many cases and at many times it was a very difficult ercise for officers of the Department of Health and members of the Guild. I do not think that we can derive any joy from the fact that this situpart ation existed for as long as it did. The High writ was, I believe, about to befiledon 11 them November last year-that Remembrance but because of the events of 11 November last year the High Court writ did not proceed. Beattention cause of the events that flowed after 11 developingtowith November, the High Court writ was subsequenare going out of business tially issued. Discussions continued and because of the success of the negotiations that took place A an undertaking has been given by the Pharmacy keep Guild that once the legislation has been passed several by both Houses, it will withdraw that High Court about this writ. I take the opportunity to thank the officers my Department for the work that they have done, work for which very often they were unfairly criticised. The officers of a department must pursue the policy of the government of the day and must Uve with the consequences of dePharmacy cisions that are taken. I think that a lot of unfair criticism was levelled over the years at the officers of the Department of Health who were acting in accordance with the law of the day and also in accordance with the poUcies of the governments of the day. I wish to thank them for the efforts that they made. I thank the members of the Health and Welfare Committee, particularly the honourable member for Murray (Mr conLloyd) and the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges), who have been most interested in area, for the assistance that they gave to me as the Minister and to the Department. I also thank the members of the Pharmacy Guild for keeping the negotiations going in order to resolve what has been a long standing difference which has caused unnecessary friction between the successive governments and the Pharmacy see Guild. Members of the Guild, of course, have I been essential to the discharge of the National to Health Act and also in the dispensing of drugs are essential, in many cases, in the saving of or on beUfe and in health treatment. I pay a tribute to the great work that the chemon ists are doing around Australia in co-operating a with the Government and the pubhc and in de-working with the medical profession. This is a important part of health care. I take the of point of the honourable member for Murray that there is an important professional role for the to play. It is interesting that some chemists are taking that role very senously. One chemhad ist in Boorowa is doing some splendid work in counselling patients about the usage of drugs. ex-Hopefully we will see the day when more and more chemists will be able to afford in both a material sense and a time sense to play a greater in counselling patients in the ways in which Courtthe drugs that are dispensed or prescribed for should in fact be taken. I hope that the day Day- is not too far away. The honourable member for Petrie also drew one of the real problems that is the number of pharmacies that in Australia at present. great number have found it very difficult to going. We are aware of the fact that in some areas there are too many pharmacies. I have had discussions with the Pharmacy Guild matter and we are looking at ways and means of trying to assist in rationalising the of number of pharmacies in Australia. I am aware of a general feeUng amongst Guild chemists that some pharmacies that have gone out of business should have been kept in business regardless of the overaU cost and other pertinent factors. The Guild, I am sure, recognises the need to look at the rationalisation of retail pharmacies. I hope that the Joint Committee on Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Arrangements will look at this matter with a view to providing some advice to me, through the Chairman, on whether the Commonwealth can assist in any approach which may be suggested in this regard. I agree with the honourable member for Murpoint ray that some very real problems exist for pharintroduce macies which provide an essential tical service in remote areas of Australia. I go a Uttle further and say that in some cases these pose pharmacies are almost the only primary source of health care deUvery in isolated regions. number of these pharmacies in my own area exist where no other form of health service exists. will They are operating at a loss. Because of the state havestill of theirfinancialundertakings the pharmacies that the cannot be sold, nor would we Uke to see them so. I do not sold. If the operations were important and essential service would be notice of advicehegiven. removed from the community. I will to the Joint Committee to advise me and the wanted to highlight the fact that Government on what special approaches should power to abuse the advice still remains. be considered in these cases. I regard this as one of great urgency. I hope that I wiU receive a report on it so that the matter can be considered in the budgetary context for 1977. The problem besetting pharmacies in isolated regions throughout Australia causes very serious alarm and should be dealt with urgently. I hope that the Joint Committee will be able to turn its attention to this problem at the earliest opportunity. Without delaying the proceedings of the House, I thank the honourable members for their contributions to the debate. I hope that we can look forward to a more constructive conduct of affairs by the Joint Committee. I believe that a lot of the heat will be taken out of the issue result of the decisions which the Government has taken and which are embodied in this amendment to the National Health Act. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Motion (by Mr Hunt) proposed: That the Bill be now read a third time.",46
110,Dr CASS,PRESCRIPTIONS," I would just Uke to make an observation on something that I think has come up in the course of the bate since I spoke. I am not quarrelling or ing afightwith anyone. One of the problems that was discussed by all honourable members who spoke in the debate related to the fact that ters in the past could make decisions at whim and that despite negotiations and so on, they could ignore the advice that they received. It possible, and it happened, that Ministers in past- I am not picking out any particular Miniswas ter, I am just making a general comment-hav e ignored advice and made decisions that were often unfair to the pharmacists. I simply want to out that clause 6 of the Bill, which seeks to new sub-section 98C, gives the Minispharmaceuter power to determine: The manner in which the Commonwealth price of all or any pharmaceutical benefits is to be ascertained for the purof payments to approved medical practitioners in respect of the supply of pharmaceutical benefits. A Proposed new paragraph (b) relates to approved pharmaceutical chemists. In other words the Act contain the potential for Ministers to bein an irrational fashion. I am not suggesting Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) will do believe he will. I think his behaviour to cease a very has shown that beUeves that one should take Merely setting up this be looking Joint Committee confirms that point. I just the potential For all matter that, we still support the legislation. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time.",47
111,Unknown,PRESCRIPTIONS,"Sitting suspended from 12.48 to 2.15 p.m. HMS SAVINGS GRANT BILL 1976 Second Reading Debate resumed from 18 November, on motion by Mr Newman: That the Bill be nowreada second time.",47
112,Mr UREN,PRESCRIPTIONS," I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with the view to as a substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading the House is of the opinion that this scheme does not recognise that each household in Australia is entitled to adequate and conveniently located accommodation at a nee which does not impose too great a strain on houseold resources, rather it perpetuates existing inequalities'. Third Reading This legislation in no way assists the housing problem in this country. This Government does not have a housing policy, just as it does not possess a consistent economic policy. It does not understand the problems facing those people who need basic accommodation. It does not deunderstand that only a comprehensive approach pickto the whole housing accommodation problemboth public and private, owned and rented, as it concerns the poor andrich-is the way to come to Minisgrips with the problem. The Government does not recognise that every person in Australia has a basicrightand entitlement to adequate accomwas modation at a price which they can afford. This the Government, by reintroducing a scheme which inadequate and'inequitable 10 years ago is adding to the housing problem. It is acting in a sectional way; it is perpetuating inequalities that have arisen after a decade of inflation and it has compounded those inequalities by devaluation and economic mismanagement. There can be no doubt that housing finance will become tighter and more expensive in the. year ahead. This will inevitably make the scheme more inequitable. This Government claims that it believes in the principle of home ownership but its actions are just the opposite. The first home savings grant scheme was introduced in 1964 to help to overcome the then problem of the deposit gap. The same philosophy underlies this proposal but this is no longer the main problem. Today, the basic problem is the repayment gap. Even if the scheme removed the deposit gap completely the problem of the income gap and repayment gap will remain. The scheme before the House does not even start to come to grips with these major problems which should be the focus of the Government's housing pohcy. An even more basic flaw of the scheme is its lack of equity. It redistributes from the poor to the more unfortunate in the community. These grants will be financed from revenue to which the poorer groups in the community contribute but those poorer people will be denied assistance for housing because of their inability to save. It is a of justice to these poorer groups, and to the younger people in particular, to hold out a reward for savings which they cannot make; savings which are now beyond their ability because of this Government's economic mismanagement. We all know that banks and building societies do not lend if the rate of repayment exceeds 25 per cent to 30 per cent of earnings. In most cases, this means that people who earn less than 135 per cent of the average weekly earnings-les s than $248 a week-ar e denied the opportunity of home ownership. Only 12 per cent of the work force earns above that percentage of average weekly earnings. When the 1964 scheme was introduced every person on or above the average weekly earnings was a potential home buyer. The only problem was raising the deposit. This was entirely due to the favourable market for housing finance that existed at that time. To take an example based on South Australian figures for 1966, in that year a home seeker could buy an average home for $ 10,000 on a deposit of $2,100 with weekly repayments of about $13.50. This was the situation when after-tax average weekly earnings were $52 a week. Repayments approximately amounted to 25 per cent of the person's income. On this basis a home seeker had access to homefinanceand could buy a home. This is in complete contrast to the situation which now exists. The 20 years from 1945 to 1965 was an era of progress, so far as home purchases and home ownership in Australia is concerned-hom e ownership rose from 50 per cent to 72 per cent of householders and building costs declined in relative terms. This was followed by a slump in new ownership. Today, the cost of an average home and land in the western suburbs of Sydney is between $30,000 and $35,000. In Melbourne it is only slightly less. Fewer young families can afford to buy new homes because even if they could save the deposit they have no access to home finance. I refer again to the South Austrahan example: In 1975 the average home and land package cost $31,700. This required a deposit of up to $6,350 with repayments of $55 a week. After-tax, average weekly earnings were $123. Repayments amounted to 45 per cent of income. No lending institution would advance funds to a home seeker who had to devote such a high proportion of his or her income to repayments. As interest rates rise in the next year and denial money becomes scarcer, only the top few per cent of income earners will be able to obtain homefinance.Most Australian families will be excluded altogether and greater pressure will be placed on the State public housing authorities. The homes savings grant scheme will do nothing to arrest this situation. If anything, it will intensify the pressure on the State housing authorities. It highlights this Government's lack of understanding of the very nature of the housing problem and this Government's lack of overall policies and priorities. The cost of this scheme in a full year will involve the misallocation of $90m. That is what it will cost in a fullfinancialyear and I say quite clearly that it is a misallocation of resources. This Government's record in housing is poor. Since 1949 the normal government approach has been a series of ad hoc measures to patch up particular failures in parts of the housing market and to meet the demands of the best organised pressure groups. Even the Labor Government started off with this approach. But we recognised the need to have a comprehensive pohcy and we were working towards it. We showed this by establishing the Australian Housing Corporation- a body which would have played an evolutionary role in developing a comprehensive housing pohcy in Australia. It was under the ministerial portfolio of my colleague, the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) that the Australian Housing Corporbut ation evolved. He drew on the mistakes that been made in the past and even the mistakes we made, when in Government, were examined. I think the honourable member for Hughes will agree with me when I say that we learned from the mistakes of the past and also drew on our perience in government. This Government has abolished the Australian Housing Corporation. When we estabonourable Ushed that Corporation we recognised the value placed by the community on housing. We recogbody nised that housing pohcy was an integral part our policies concerned with the quality of both the natural environment and the built environthe ment. We recognised that housing policies affected the location and pattern of settlement and the development and provision of services and facUities. We recognised the effect of ownership and the use of property on the bution of wealth. We recognised that housing was an important part of policy directed towards achievement of our equity and welfare tives. We recognised the importance of the housI ing sector in poUcies of overall economic mannot agement. The Fraser Government faUs to underomic, stand and even fails to try to understand this most complex and human problem. This Government, unlike the Labor Governhis ment, attempted to pass the responsibiUty for housing back to the States and to wash its of involvement in the housing sector. Governhousing, ment members know that the Government tried to do this even in relation to war service homes, which had been a traditional area of Commonconcern wealth involvement under our defence legisand lation. This Government wanted to transfer sponsibUity for war service homes to the In fact, it carried out negotiations with many of Any the States. Because of the heavy volved in war service homes, the States did want to assume that burden; therefore, they rejected those approaches. That has been the role of this Government. It has sought hands completely of a matter, which is important in both the human sense and the economic sense. point We recognised that a Federal government not must be deeply and collectively involved with the States in housing pohcy. It is an essential sponsibihty of a Federal government because of the vital poltiical importance of housing for the general welfare of the nation and because main factor in achieving housing policy objecunderstand tives is the supply and price of money for publicinflows and private housing purposes. These are matters offinancialand monetary management. These are a direct Federal Government responsibUity; problems in housing, Uke so many other had aspects of Ufe and other responsibilities of thatgovernment, can be solved only by the Federal Government acting in co-operation with the other tiers of government, the community, private enterprise and the trade unions. Unless we ex-work together at all levels of government and with the private and community groups, this Eroblem cannot be solved. My colleague, the member for Hughes, brought all of these sections together in an indicative planning to look at the future of housmg. It was our of Government that took that initiative to try to bring out the importance of the leadership role of Australian Government in this vital sector. The Government and in particular the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, who is at the table, do not appear home to understand the importance offinancialand distrimonetary management to housing policy. Neither housing nor the institutions which provide housingfinanceare given a high priority in objectheir economic poUcies. say to the Minister at the table that housing is only a very human problem but also an econsocial and poltiical one. The Minister is not a member of the Economic Committee of Cabinet. He is not even a member of Cabinet. He and Department are part of the outer Ministry. That is an indication of the priority that this hands Government gives to the important issue of not to mention the environment and community living. The Minister, as recently as last Monday, showed this Government's lack of for and lack of understanding of housing its position in the nation's economy. In a rePress statement headed 'Devaluation and the States. Building Industry', the Minister said: effect on the cost and availability of housing finance subsidies inwill only be marginal. not The Minister nods his head. He was talking about the devaluation. I repeat what he said: Any effect on the cost and availability of housing finance to wash itswill only be marginal. We on this side of the House have a different of view in that regard. The Minister does reaUse that, if the Government still intends to hold the annual growth in the money supply to rearound 12 per cent, interest rates must rise. He does not seem to understand that the money supply has been growing at an annual rate of 16 per the cent thisfinancialyear. He does not seem to that, because of devaluation, capital from foreign speculators are likely to amount to at least $ 1,000m. We are told that $850m of speculators' money flowed out of Australia. If that money is reinvested, at its higher value resulting from the 1714 per cent devaluation, the sum will exceed $ 1,000m. The influx of that money will result in enormous pressures on the inflationary situation country. The Minister obviously does not stand this; if he did, he would not make such naive statement as he did on Monday last. There is no doubt in my mind that interest rates on homefinancewill rise by at least 2 cent in the next year. If the Government intends to hold the annual growth in the money supply around 12 per cent, interest rates must rise m next year. The effect of this on potential buyers, on recent purchasers, on the housing industry and on the economy will be disastrous. A 2 per cent increase in interest rates is not ginal. Its effect will be to increase average repayments by amounts ranging between $28 and $36 a month. Not even many of those better off people who will benefit from the homes ings grant scheme will be able to cope with this increase. The average worker, let alone the really poor amongst us, will have no hope of ever ing a home. That will be the result under this Government's policies. The effects of this devaluation undoubtedly will widen the repayment gap. It is pointless to introduce measures aimed at overcoming the posit gap when the major problem facing home buyers is worsening. If interest rates rise by cent in the next year, only those people earning more than 150 per cent of average weekly ings will be considered by lending institutions housing loans if the 25 per cent to 30 per cent repayment rules are maintained. It is about time that this Government faced up to the situation and took positive measures to implement ble loan repayment scheme. It was the key to its December 1975 housing pohcy; but the GovernAnother ment has refused to do anything to introduce thateffect scheme. Rather than do that, the Government has aboUshed the Australian Housing Corporwas ation which the Labor Government estabUshed to introduce such a scheme. This is a sectional Government. It is a GovernI ment whose entire ideology revolves around widening the gap between the rich and the poor. The homes savings grant scheme introduced by this legislation is regressive. Tins and other direct subsidy schemes to home owners are regressive when they involve transfer of resources from the poor to the rich. These forms of assistance to home owners particularly amount to no more than the poor subsidising the rich. This scheme is particularly regressive. It obvious that low and middle income households cannot save around $40. a week on average, rise which is the amount needed to take full benefit of the carrot being waved in front of their noses. The scheme is a blatant subsidy for those whose in this capacity to save is above average. underThis scheme will benefit only people whose a earnings are well above the average. It wiU do nothing to provide assistance to people whose ability to save is low. Are these people to be per ignored while the Government takes deUberate action to perpetrate class differences and injusto tices? There can be no doubt that the $90m that thethis scheme will cost in a fuU year of operation home would be better spent on assisting people in other ways. It could be used to provide a deferred mortgage repayments assistance scheme marsuch as was put forward by the Labor Government in the Budget of 1975-76. It could be used for a second mortgage scheme such as we put forward in that Budget. By that I mean that secsavond mortgages would not run for a short period of some 8 years but would be spread out over the full Ufe of a loan covering 20 years or 25 years. ownThis money could be used to provide more welfare housing. The amount allocated for this purpose this year is frozen to thefigurespent by the Labor Government 2 years ago. The pressure on welfare housing is enormous deand this present scheme is going to put even greater pressure on this sector. There can be no 2 perdoubt that this money could be used more equitably. This scheme will only marginally increase earnthe number of owner-occupied dwellings befor cause the only people who will be able to use the benefit of this subsidy are those who would purchase a home in any case. People with the ability to save, people with access to homefinance,will a flexibe the only ones who will benefit. worrying feature of this scheme is its on inflation. We must draw on experience. The benefits paid under the old scheme when it in full operation merely resulted in an addition to the price of land and dwellings. That was the experience of builders and real estate agents during the years the old scheme operated. have no doubt that the long-term effect of this scheme will be to add $2,000 to the price of an average home and the land it is built on. That is being the experience of the past. Colleagues, I said earlier that housing was a the human, social and economic problem. The present economic climate is what worries me at the present time. High inflation will continue. In fact we will be lucky if we can is keep inflation down to 16 per cent in the next year. Some economic observers believe it will to at least 20 per cent in the next year. The panic devaluation will have an enormous conseof quence on the home building industry. I see interest rates rising by at least 2 per cent next year. I see money for housing drying up becoming hard to get. I see the Government's savings bonds scheme drawing in money from both the banks and the building societies. Already the interest rate has moved to 10 per cent. That was announced yesterday. We know from previous experience that when the Auscould tralian savings bonds rate rose to that level was a drawing off offinancefrom both the build-grams ing societies and the banks.",47
113,Mr KEATING,PRESCRIPTIONS,It is going to go up.,51
114,Mr UREN,PRESCRIPTIONS,"Of course it is going to go up. predict that interest rates for housing will rise at least 2 per cent in the next year. We know that that situation will create chaos in the home ing sector. I see gloom for the financial and struction sectors of the housing industry. already know that the home building sector both New South Wales and Queensland is under-used at present. I believe that the same pressure wiU be felt in other States and this matter of great concern. The general situation has been extremely difficult. I am not trying say that we in the Labor Party had a magic and that we had aU the answers to the problems. My colleague the honourable member for Hughes, who wiU foUow me in this debate, knows that we had a very difficult problem solve. In fact to some extent we did solve the problem offindinghousing for people earning up to 95 per cent of average weekly earnings. One cannot divorce the homes savings grant scheme from any section of the housing mdustrythe because aU sections are interrelated. Referring now to the problem of welfare housing, when came to power this question was tied up with the moneys made avaUable under the Common- (Mr wealth-State Housing Agreement. Moneys made available at the long-term bond rate but with a rebate formula. BasicaUy the money was the people's money but they were paying for it the long-term bond rate. In our first year in officeI we were able to introduce a scheme whereby weon made money avaUable at 4 per cent. The longthese term bond rate was 9.5 per cent when we wentend out of Government but we were making money avaUable for welfare housmg at 4 per cent. In last year of the MCMahon Government $167m weekly was made available for welfare housing but in our last year of office we made $375m avaUable.erage In 3 years we had increased the amount from $167m to $375m and the terms and conditions under which we made that money avaUable werebelieve great assistance to the States in trying to overcome the backlog of welfare housing. People in the earning up to 85 per cent of average weekly andearnings were able to apply for welfare housmg. Further, 30 per cent of the money that we made avaUable went into what is caUed the builders advance account and was made avaUable to terminating building societies so that people with up to 95 per cent of average weekly earnings apply for a loan. So to some extent, under thereour Administration, there were housing profor people earning up to 95 per cent of average weekly earnings. The great difficulty in the period of our I Administration was meeting the need of that bygroup of people earning between 95 per cent of average weekly earnings and 135 per cent. That buildwhy we introduced several schemes in our is con-1975-76 Budget. Thefirstproposal was the deWe ferred mortgage repayments scheme. The second in was the second mortgage proposal whereby repayments for second mortgages were spread over the full Ufe of the original loan rather than is aover a short period. We were experimenting with those 2 proposals in order to try to overcome the to problems facing that group of people earning bewandtween 95 per cent of average weekly earnings and 135 percent. We were also looking at other schemes such as to co-operative schemes m the inner suburbs. We were trying to establish co-operative housing schemes to cater for people who had Uved for most of their Uves in dwellings which were being taken over by speculators. Under that scheme such people would have been able to approach Australian Government and join in cooperatives to acquire their homes. We were wetrying many other innovative ideas. Only two weeks ago the Minister for the Capital Territory Staley) opened a co-operative scheme here were in Canberra which was developed and encouraged under our Administration. We were trying to do those things in other areas as well. atThings were difficult under our Government and make no excuse about that but we were getting top of the situation and were trying to solve very difficult problems. I predict that by the of this financial year not only the Government will be in a difficult situation but also the people earning up to 135 per cent of average earnings will be in great difficulties. I predict that people earning up to 155 per cent of avweekly earnings wuT not be in a position to meet the repayments of a normal housing loan. This scheme will in no way solve the problem. I it is a misallocation of resources. The $90m could be spent far more widely to overcome many of the critical housing problems. Therefore I ask the House to give consideration and support to the amendment ",51
115,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRESCRIPTIONS,Is the amendment seconded?,52
116,Mr LES JOHNSON,PRESCRIPTIONS,I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,52
117,Mr CADMAN,PRESCRIPTIONS,"The amendment is an interesting one. I have taken a little time to examine and endeavour to analyse it. The expression in the amendment is peculiar to my mind because the amendment states that this scheme does not recognise that each household in Australia is entitled to adequate and conveniently located accommodation. 'Each household' impUes that people already have accommodation. It seems to me that if one were to apply UteraUy the thrust of this amendment one would be playing a great game of musical chairs with households throughout Australia. It is certainly not the intention of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren), I would not think, to do such a thing. The intention that he expressed in his speech is not portrayed hi this amendment. The words need to be expressed properly before amendments of this type are made to such an important Bill as the Homes Savings Grant Bill. This amendment appears to be an indication of poorly thought out poUcies or attitudes. Such poUcies or attitudes are reflected in amendments to other BUls. They tend to waste thetimeof the chamber. It is an insignificant amendment that impUes, if I gather the true meaning from the speech rather than from the wording of the amendment, things that aU Australians would accept. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was not prepared to grapple with the real propositions. That They are simple. This Government came to always expressed power, roughly at thistimelast year, stating that it would introduce a home savings grant scheme. promise. Consistent with poUcy, consistent with pubUc statements, we now have this legislation. On a number of occasions there has been an opporlegislation, tunity for this program to be fully debated both chambers. In all the debates there has been no significant input by the Opposition, and Government has not been deterred or has not swerved from its stated purpose of bringing forpeople ward a home savings grant scheme that is expanded, far more sympathetic and far more realistic than any previous home savings grant scheme in this nation. I refer to the time when this policy was being prepared,, There seems to be some suggestion that the Government has no housing poUcy. That is far from the truth. I quote from a paper prepared by the honourable member for Boothby (Mr MCLeay) when in opposition. Referring to the home savings grant, he said: Home ownership will be achievable for low middle income earners without discriminatory subsidised interest rates by this grant. That was followed in government by a statement by the then Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, the late Senator Ivor Greenwood. At this stage I pay tribute to the work he did in the area of the home savings grant scheme. He was an enthusiast for the concept of providing all couples in Australia with a home of their own. One of the things on which he seized when he became Minister was the proposals made during the campaign and the proposals made in Opposition. He gathered together the material. He launched a scheme for discussion. He made a ministerial statement on 31 March 1976. It is very difficult to believe that such a short time has passed since we lost such an important member of this Parliament. I quote his words: These twin initiatives of a Liberal-National Country Party Government have been of great assistance to the people of Australia in helping them obtain their own homes. They are initiatives of which this Government is proud. The Labor Party had legislated to abolish the home savings grant scheme completely and after 31 December 1976 persons building or purchasing homes would not be eligible for a grant. We shall legislate for the re-introduction of the home savings grant scheme, enlarged to provide benefits to a greater range of people than ever before and incorporating other improvements which experience has warranted gives the Government great satisfaction. Not only will this announcement fully implement an election commitment; it will also provide clear evidence of our determination to ensure that all Australians shall have a meaningful opportunity, if they choose to avail themselves of it, to own their own homes. pressed, statement was clearly and concisely exin the manner in which Ivor Greenwood himself. There was an election A commitment was given. Then in government that commitment was carried out. The proposals in the Bill improve the previous are more sympathetic and aUow Ausby traUans to own their own homes. There were limitations to the scheme that is now running the down and which this Bill seeks to replace. The limitations on marriage for widowed or divorced were very serious. The Umitations on the value of a home or property were serious, with the rate of inflation racing away. Only 2 years ago the limitation was $22,500. There are very few homes in Australia available at that price. The new scheme seeks to dispense with that limitation. I think it is a thoughtful modification in those areas-the eligibility of marital status the eligibility on the level of value of the home. remind the House that some time ago there was an amendment to this Act. That amendment is incorporated in the Bill and will continue. It applies to public servants or people seeking to buy or build their homes through a State or eral system. It applies also to people who are ing on properties where the land is not owned. will allow them to proceed with the building, did the amendment that this House passed some months ago. To be eligible, the appUcant must be an Ausin traUan citizen or have permanent resident status. The person must be at least 18 years old. A person who has owned a house previously in Australia is not eUgible for the grant because scheme is perfectly designed to assist those people wishing to own their first home. They must fulfil certain provisions. The savings which wiU entitle them to assistance from the Common-grant wealth Government to purchase their home must be in approved institutions or in acceptable forms. Deposits with savings banks-excep ings bank cheque accounts-fixe d deposits trading banks, deposits and shares with building societies, deposits with credit unions, money towards the purchase of land or the construction of a home are eligible and acceptable forms savings for a person wishing to this scheme. It is interesting to note that there are changes which allow more than one person to join in appUcation. This will give an opportunity for widower and his son, for instance, to join in appUcation to purchase a new home of their own, provided it is their first home. It will allow widow and perhaps a daughter or a young portunity couple and a widowed mother to join in making an application for a home savings grant. I think that this is a very sensible, humane and sympath-instance, etic interpretation of the needs of the community. In addition, since the scheme was announced 31 March it has been well publicised that those people who had their savings in a required form last year would be given until 31 May to make an appUcation and that it would be backdated to 1 January of this year. So a 3-month leeway was given to people once the scheme was announced. It is interesting to make a comparison between the new scheme and the former scheme. As have already mentioned, one of the most outstanding features of the new scheme is the change in the reference to marital status. It does not matter whether a person is married or not. This scheme allows a young engaged couple start to save for theirfirsthome. It allows and widow, a widower and other people who were I denied the opportunity to qualify for a grant under the former scheme to apply for a grant. There was an age limit in the former scheme. There is no age limit under this scheme provided that the applicant is saving for a first home. I fed-have spoken to retiring servicemen who were livwondering about their eUgibUity under this It scheme and under the defence service home loan as scheme. It has been made clear that under this scheme an elderly man, who is single and who prior to his retirement was engaged in a job where he was required to take lodgings and Uve grant other people's homes, will be eUgible for a if he is purchasing his first home. A number of parties may apply for a grant. this There is no Umit on the value of the home that may be purchased. There is a grading in of the maximum grant over a period of years. If acceptable savings are held for 3 years the maximum is $2,000; if they are held for 2 years the maximum grant will be $1,333; and if they are held for one year the maximum grant will be t sav- $667. The maximum savings rate has been with increased so that instead of there being a requirement for a $600 increase in savings each paid year there can be a savings of $1,200 each 6 months, and if there is a short-fall in one 6 month of period it can be made up in the next 6 months be involved in period, or vice versa. The scheme will commence on 1 January. Many people have already applied to join the an scheme. They have commenced to save. I would a suggest to people buying their first home that an they should make their appUcations to become part of this scheme after 1 January. It seems to a me to be important that they should take the opto involve themselves in this very fine scheme. There are some difficulties that have to be sorted out by the Minister. I refer, for to the entitlement of a husband and wife who have been saving under the scheme on and who become separated. A wife decides that she will enter into the saving program, but then she leaves her husband and the marriage is dissolved. The husband can go ahead and apply for a grant in his ownright.If the discretion given to the secretary under this Bill is exercised the wife, at a later time, can say: 'I wish to take advantage of the home savings grant scheme'. She is entitled to do so. I commend the Government for I such a thoughtful piece of legislation. No one would pretend that this is an easy piece of legislation. But it is thoughtful and sympathetic, and I know that it will be very well to adminstered by the Minister for Environment, a Housing and Community Development who is at the table and by his Department. I think it interesting to define the people who are looking for homes and who are most likely to avail selves of these proposals. Statistics that I have from various organisation seem to indicate the greatest demand for a home is made by people between 26 years and 30 years of age. seems that in our community the average Ausbeen tralian seeks to estabUsh a ages of 21 years and 35 years. The occupations home buyers generally tend to be semi-skilled and their general weekly income ranges from about $ 120 to $200 and beyond. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition Uren), mentioned that it was difficult for people in this wage and salary structure to build own home. This is a difficult area, but Government is coping with it. I do not know that the previous Government coped with this matter all that well. I have a statement made on 26 July 1975, by Mr Riordan, a previous Minister former Labor Government. Mr Riordan, who $37,600, was a good Minister, said: I know perfectly well that if we keep non-payers dwellings we discourage the good payers who demand know why the wicked should flourish. He then stated: But it is too simple an answer potential good citizens in the next generation logic. We have got to put the hard quesuons to ourselves come up with at least some half-way reasonable answers. The Labor Government never did that. We have not heard any answers today-no t even half-way reasonable answers. The former Minister made that statement just one day before the chop made to the Australian Housing Corporation. am afraid that that chop was not mentioned this Parliament by the Opposition. But funds the welfare housingfieldwere cut from $175m down to $2 5m. The then Minister was pontificat-next ing the day before the chop was made to the tralian Housing Corporation. The very next day House off went his head. The hypocrisy of honourable members opposite on this subject is reaUy yond beUef. It would pay honourable members opposite to home look at the statistics of the try and just see what is happening. They are verysition and which interesting statistics too. If we compare, for Government. instance, the 5 months period to September of this year with the 5 months period to last year, we can see that on average throughout the nation there has been a significant who improvement each month in the number of homes that have been constructed. To be more specific, thefiguresin respect of approvals given for construction indicate that 14 200 approvals is were given for residential accommodation in September of this year compared with 12 300 themapprovals for September of last year. It would seem to me that there has been a very significant that improvement in the home buUding industry in Australia. One can only say that the change of ItGovernment and the greater confidence that has created within the community is the sole home between the reason for this. of If we look at the average trends of the costs and expenses in the home and land package area in respect of Melbourne or Sydney, we can see what the Labor Party did to young couples and (Mr young home builders when it was in Government. The average price of land in 1970-71 was their $5,070. In 1975-76 it was $13,600. Look what the the Labor Party did to the home buyer in a period of 5 years. Average private home building costs rose from $11,600 to $24,000, an increase of 15 per cent. The cost of the average home and in the land package has jumped from $16,700 to an increase of 17.6 per cent. All of these increases were achieved in a period of 3 years. I in State think that the improved figures that we see indito cated in the statistics that are coming forward month by month indicate that the Government understands the way in which poUcies should be appUed to the young people and the home to throw away the chances of through such builders of the nation. and It is interesting to note the Labor Party's attitude on home buUding and the building industry in general. On 19 November last the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) made a savage attack on the drop in the buUding industry. was The very next day the Daily Telegraph carried I the headline about improvements in the building in industry. The headline stated: 'Home-land in boom'. One day the Leader of the Opposition says: 'Bad news in the building industry'. The day the statistics and the newspapers Aus-proved him completely wrong. I commend to the the thrust of this legislation. It is an important piece of legislation which was promised, bewhich has been developed, which has been discussed and which now will be taken up by the builders of Australia from 1 January 1977. home buUding indusbenefitsaoffew Within the months home buUders will have the promises which we made in Oppowe have delivered in September Mr LES JOHNSON (Hughes) (3.5)-The honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), preceded me in this debate, put up a fairly good performance for a new member who has not been involved in the housing industry. He is due for congratulations. I think he is showing the benefit ofhis experience in the Old Players group back in his electorate, where he was a disthen tinguished actor. He was able to make a lot from a small amount of information. by knowing something ofhis Government's formance in the housing field. I refer to the Government which went out of office in 1972.1I have a feeling that that Government was it downrelieved to get out of office because of the great problems it had created in many fields, including be the housing field. Mr MCVeigh-We could not get back in quickly enough.",52
118,Mr LES JOHNSON,PRESCRIPTIONS,"Here is old Ocker interpresent jecting again. He turns up every time we have debate on housing. It would be useful for honourable members to know that as a result the policies of the Liberal-National Country Party Government the increase in the money supply, which in previous years ning at 6 to 8 per cent, suddenly in 1972-73 jumped to 26 per cent. The housing industry in development particular was awash with funds. The housing loans by banks, building societies Ufe offices almost trebled in 2 years, from $ 1,250m in 1970-71 to $2,988m in 1972-73. course, no attempt was made by the Liberalin National Country Party Government at that time to formulate a plan for a commensurate increase in the supply of labour and materials. I pleased to see that the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman), who is responsible for these matters, is showing an interest in what I am saying, bewell cause the same kind of problem could occur again. In other words, what the Australian Labor Party Government inherited was a great tidal wave of money. Nobody has to stretch his imagination very far to recall that the country had run out of bricklayers and that one could get bricks or timber and that the white metals went. which go into housing were in short supply. The whole industry had lost its interrelationship between material, manpower and money. Those are the facts. The honourable gentleman is shaking his head. I suggest that he go and look at some statistics. We do not want to have cUche debate, with superficiahties of nonsense. We want to get down to the fundamentals. I am giving the House the fundamentals. The Liberaland National Country Party Government of that time put the country into a very serious situation. The National Country Party has never known very anything about housmg. I look for an intelUgent response from the Liberal Party; that is a possihim biUty. But there is no chance of getting such response from the National Country Party. Let me tell the House what the present Speaker, the mteresting. Leader of the Opposition, thought of the situation at around that time. This is very imporHe could benefit tant. He stated: perThefirstway to cut down private spendinghe obviously thought that it was necessary to cut is by making money scarcer and therefore dearer. We would willing to do this only as part of an overall approach involving reduced Government spending. That was a statement made by therighthonourable member for Bruce (Mr Snedden), the Speaker, on the Australian Broadcasting a Commission on 26 July 1973. Mr LesUe Bury, a former Treasurer and former Housing Mmister of and the man who introduced the original legislation which we are debating, reacted to that Liberal-National Country Party-caused situation had been runon 1 May 1973. He stated: If the Government does nothing at all to restrain the of the building sector the inflationary problem value of will become worse and worse. and In other words, he was simply commenting on the stupidity which characterised the LiberalOf National Country Party Government's approach the period preceding the 1972 election. That is the situation the Labor Adrninistration inherited. It was an extremely difficult time. It may be that am the honourable member for Mitchell was not even interested in poUtics at that time, I do not know. Maybe he knew nothing about housing. But anybody with any recoUection knows full that as a result of that flood of money the whole industry went beserk when the Labor Governmentfirstcame into office. Every person around the place who was interested in making a quick quid out of housing, and who was able to do so, got an option over a bit of land or a house not and jacked the price up, and then away they Mr Stewart-Were not the Cadmans in that racket up there?",55
119,Mr LES JOHNSON,PRESCRIPTIONS,"I am unable to comment on whether the Cadmans were in it or not. I a would not be unfair and steal an unjustified advantage over the honourable gentleman. But clearly, for the sake of responsible government to ensure that the kids of the future had a chance of getting housmg, some remedial action had to be taken. The Labor Government acted responsibly in that situation. That is a little lesson for the honourable member. I shaU take aside some time and give him a Uttle more a useful information which will make his contributions to these debates in the future even more The Homes Savings Grant Bill was introduced in 1964 by Leslie Bury, as I mentioned. Many of us remember it well. It was the subject of raging controversy from the time the concept was first thought of and certainly from the time it was implemented in legislative form. Actually, it was a Menzies Government gimmick. That right honourable gentleman had a very great capacity for approaching elections in terms of picking up that extra one per cent or 2 per cent which he needed. He was a percentage man. He used to think in terms of what kind of gimmick could be contrived in order to pick up another one per cent or 2 per cent. On one occasion it was the ence laboratories grants to non-public schools. On this occasion in 1964 it was the homes savings grant scheme. Mr MCVeigh-And the Petrov affair.",55
120,Mr LES JOHNSON,PRESCRIPTIONS,"That is another matter which worked on the same percentage basis. Whether it had principle or not did not matter. Whether it had electoral mileage was the criterion in the approach of Sir Robert Menzies. Of course, he is not exceptional among Liberal administrators. This was a election gimmick. It was loaded with anomalies. The honourable member for Mitchell has acknowledged that. Through the years this legislation has been characterised by mequahties. It is the most absurd, ridiculous and unfair legislation which could possibly be put together. I see the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Graham) sitting over there. I have no doubt that he has represented hundreds of people who have been unable to get the homes savings gram. I am sure that he would acknowledge that, even by his silence. Mr Stewart-He is nodding his head.",56
121,Mr LES JOHNSON,PRESCRIPTIONS,"I do not want him to nod his head too much; that could be very deleterious to his health. The type of problem in evidence was that people did not have their savings in approved accounts. Then there were the valuation limits. That was a ridiculous proposition. At one point one had to have a house which did not exceed $22,500 in value. In electorates such as mine one could not buy the block of land for that price. Then there was the matter of savings not being held for the period of 3 years. There was a 3-year residential requirement which excluded some of the most needy people who had come from overseas. For example, there were migrants in the Cunningham electorateMr Connor-You know the valuations there, too.",56
122,Mr LES JOHNSON,PRESCRIPTIONS,"Yes, the valuations. These people,firstof all, had the problem about residential qualification. The valuation provision made it impossible for 30 000 or 40 000 people a year to qualify. That is about the number of people whose appUcations were rejected for the reasons I am enunciating. There was the age barrier of 36 years. The Minister would have been a young officer, probably a young Ueutenant, when this legislation was introduced. If he had served his time in the Army he would not have been able to take on a permanent house, to locate himself permanently. He is probably over 36 years by now and he would have been excluded by virtue of the nature of his service. Single people sci- were excluded. Then there were all the fights about what was the first home. It was arguable whether a Uttle weekender that people might have somewhere was theirfirsthome. Often that kind of consideration excluded them from quatifying under the homes savings grant scheme. Credit unions were totally excluded to start with but afterwards there was some modification of that condition. The housmg commission tenants, some of the most needy people in the country, were unable to receive assistance. Even widows were excluded from the benefit of the scheme at that time. That is the kind of messy legislation which the Government introduced and which operated over that period of time. It is true that about 350 000 people have qualified for some kind of grant but that figure is used misleadingly. It is often used to give the impression that all those people received the maximum grant, but some of them received a miserable Uttle bit; and usually they were the most deserving people. When this legislation was introduced it was disparaged by the discerning people in the buUding industry. The estate agents were able to predict that as soon as those grants were introduced- I am not sure whether the initial grant was $500 or $750prices would rise to swallow them up. In fact they did. Any analysis of that period will show that this is what happened. That might not have mattered very much to the people who received the grant, but for the thousands of people who did not receive the grant it was a very serious matter indeed, because prices went up for everybody. Land prices jumped almost overnight as soon as the developers knew that there was more money to gobble up through the homes savings grant scheme, and building costs spiralled as well. I believe that that will happen again. I predict that we wiU see a very serious inflationary trend in the housing area. One of the worse features of this entire concept-the 1964 concept and the 1976 concept-is that the Liberal-National Country Party coalition is obsessed with throwing money around to people whether they need it or not. There is no sense of priority in its approach. In other words, this Bill is simply about providing a premium on affluence. The Bill provides a subsidy of $1 for every $3 saved to a maximum saving of $2,000 a year over 3 years. Of course, the scheme will not become completely effective until January 1979. It is almost a never-never scheme. In the short term people will receive less. During 1977 the maximum grant will be only $667 because the applicants can demonstrate savings only for one complete year up to that time. Then the grant on the 2-year savings period will be $1,333 on savings of $4,000. In general terms the legislation designed to give $2,000 to people, with no strings attached, who can save $40 a week. As I understand it, the maximum savings over a 6-month period can actually go to $48 a week. People who can save $48 a week can hardly be designated as the deserving poor. Even the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, who has come out of a very protected life in the socialised service of the Army, would probably know that there are lots of people around who lack the capacity to save $40 or $48 a week. But in any event they will all be contributing to make this grant to people who can save $40 or $48 a week. I think that that involves some very dubious principles. It might be better to say that it involves a lack of principle. When I am talking about saving approximately $48 a week I am talking about saving approximately $2,400 a year. So people are going to receive this grant whether they need it or not. That is the interesting and controversial part of it. People are going to receive it whether or not they need an incentive to save. This legislation is supposed to be about giving people an incentive to save. Whether or not they need an incentive to save they are going to receive this grant simply because they enter into a contract to buy or build a house. It is a matter of concern also that they going to receive it regardless of from what source their savings come. They could be in the form of a backhander from over-indulgent parents. There is nothing to require people to show that they have really saved the money themselves. It can simply be a transfer from a prosperous person to a less prosperous person. The honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) would appreciate what I am saying because this is done in the more prosperous family situations. Indulgent parents can ensure that their children receive every possible advantage. The wealthy supporters of the Liberal Party and the prosperous graziers of the Country Parry cannot possibly miss out on receiving this $2,000 hand-out when they go to get their house, but the kids of the poor old battlers cannot get a handout from mum or dad because those low income parents, the artisans of this country, the people who earn by the sweat of their brow, are the subject of vicious and unrelenting attacks by this Government which does not even want to give them wage indexation. It does not even want to sustain the value of their wages. They will not have the capacity to pass handouts on to their children so that they can have a lump of money which will attract this subsidy. A lot of people is will be just gasping to get their hands on this money for nothing. After they get the money, whether or not they need it and whether or not they need an incentive to save, they can do what they like with it. In regard to the matter of incentive to save, I wonder whether the Government is very consistent in its economic policy. Does the Government want people to save now or does it want to unlock the banks? Does it want them to spend? Therein lies the answer to the economic difficulties confronting the country. So what we have is this low-brow, cheap electioneering approach to housing which is a disgrace to any government. After the money is given to these people-in many instances to affluent people-the y can go off and build a mansion if they like on the Yarra bank or in the most salubrious part of Australia. They would be receiving $2,000, at the expense of the taxpayer, whether they need it or not. They can do precisely what they like with it. They can go for a trip to Bali or Bangkok. They can go to Suva or Shangri-la, to Rangoon or the Riviera. This Government does not give a damn what they do with it. They can go and buy a fur coat with it or a Mercedes. They can go and blow it up at the Hilton. They can buy themselves a speedboat. It does not have to be used for housing purposes. If the Government has money to are spend on housing let me tell those honourable members opposite who do not know, that there are people around this country at the present time who have been denied an opportunity by 23 years of previous Liberal-Country Party government to get a decent education and as a result an opportunity to earn a higher income. They now suffer from an inability to place a deposit on a home or to attract a loan from a building society. They are people on the housing commission waiting lists around this country. There is a queue of over 100 000 families on the waiting lists. There would be a lot more if people thought they had a chance of getting a house within 2 or years. Many of them do not even attempt to join that queue because it is such a hopeless situation. If the Government wants to do something and wants to spend $90m a year as it will be doing under this legislation, why does it not add some money to the coffers of the States which are ing to meet the needs of those underprivileged people? Why is it cutting down the money for aged persons homes and reducing the subsidy from $4 to $1? The Minister is shaking his head. He knows that that is a fact of life under this Government. He knows that whatever the area of need analysed in respect of housing, taken of the underprivileged people. For a miserable electioneering gimmick the Government is giving handouts in the form of this unprincipled legislation. Moreover, it is doing it at the expense of tax deductibility of mortage interest rates. and a half million families have been receiving this deductibility and the Government is restrictGovernments. ing it now to those people who are paying off their first home, and for the first 5 years. To for this scheme tax deductibility is to be taken away from thousands of Australian famUies.",56
123,Mr NEIL,PRESCRIPTIONS," I support the Bill and reject the amendment which is a typical example of Labor hypocrisy. If these Laborites do not want a home savings grant scheme, let them vote against this Bill. They would not dare. They reaUse that it is good legislation. They alise that it builds on the former scheme and removes anomalies and they realise that they would be shown for what they are if they refused to allow this Bill to be passed. The 2 principal examples of hypocrisy can be seen in the words of the amendment 'perpetuates existing inequalishould ties'. We have been told that poorer people will have to pay for this new scheme but the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren) did not inform the House or the nation that tax is not out of them. paid-admittedl y it is a lowfigure-until the figure of $2,845 has been reached. Anybody is poor, who is in that category, does not have support, by financial payments or tax, the terms revenue that provides for this scheme. So the poor in the community are protected. The second piece of hypocrisy comes from the honourable member for Hughes who speaks what about grants not being given on the basis of need. What could be less in accordance with principle of need than the Labor Government's that mortgage repayment rebate scheme which asin sisted only those persons who had already bought their homes. Therefore, they must have been in a reasonably good position in the munity by comparison with others. It assisted 3 persons who were earning fairly substantial sums of money. This Government, far from removing that scheme, has replaced it with a reduced scheme that operates for 5 years after the purchase of thefirsthome. This is still a very substantial benefit to those persons and enables tryfunds to be given on the basis of need in other areas. There is a great deal of Labor propaganda about that aspect of the scheme. It is good to see that the honourable member for Hughes at least acknowledges that that mortgage deductibility scheme still operates, because many people in the community, as a result of Labor propaganda, a toll is think that it has been aboUshed. In what context do we see the scheme which is proposed by the Government? It is in the context of a developing program, a package to provide for a private housing industry in this country. It is One in the context of stabUity that this country will enjoy under Liberal-National Country Party Housing is dependent upon stable conditions and the stabUity that will come to the pay economy with the eventual reduction of inflation will enable those stable conditions to develop. We have seen a reasonablefiscalpohcy that provides for steady growth. The earlier statements of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition about the doom that will follow devaluation are totaUy irresponsible. The Labor Opposition has a vested interest in gloom and doom because it is about rethe only way that it can propagandise in the community at large to produce fear. It is the only desperate way in which it sees itself as having any sort of chance of getting back into office one day. That is all the Opposition is interested in. It is not interested in the interests of the nation. It be saying to the nation that devaluation signifies difficulties but that Australia as a nation can work its way out of these difficulties. I have absolutely no doubt that we will work our way The housing industry in this country will whodevelop. If honourable members opposite want to to go around continually talking in extravagant of inflationary effects and of increases in interest rates which they cannot themselves predict or properly quantify, they are doing the entire nation a disservice. Let us ask ourselves has happened this year in relation to the building industry. This industry has genuinely the been improving throughout Australia. I know there are still serious difficulties, particularly New South Wales. In the September quarter there was a definite trend in thefigurestowards an increase in the rate of building of new homes. comThere was a movement away from the period in which funds were mostly used for pre-existing homes. Completion times have fallen from an average of 21 weeks in 1974-75 to 15 to 16 weeks at present. Most builders will take fixed price contracts so the home builder knows where he stands and the purchaser knows that he will not be subjected to extras and variations that could wreck hisfinancialplanning. In August one company announced a fixation of prices until Christmas so that rise and fall clauses, to a very great extent, have been eliminated. This indicates also that wages and costs of materials are stable, instead of rising at the massive rates of 23 per cent to 30 per cent or more per annum as in the years 1974 and 1975. Recent reports show that funds available for loans in New South Wales have been increasing. The interest paid by home owners on the first home in the first 5 years is deductible. So, other than in certain areas, particularly in New South Wales, the situation has been definitely and consistently improving. This Government has introduced a scheme which will be welcomed in the community and which must have a reasonable chance of providing a booster to the stimulus in the housing industry. Other actions which have been taken by the Government and which are allied to this proposal are seen in the housing voucher scheme. This scheme particularly will be a great boost to low income earners. I do not know how the honourable member for Hughes can criticise this Government in the face of that scheme. The housing voucher scheme will assist low income earners. One would hope that it will be extended to home ownership. Indeed, it allows people to save money for a home savings grant whilst they are still living in reasonable accommodation. If it could be accepted in the future that the equivalent of money received under the voucher system could perhaps be notionally treated as income, it would enable that money to be used to comply with the 25 per cent rule normally used by building societies. By that means the repayment gap could be reduced and the young person could more easily be enabled to qualify for a loan. It is a fact of Ufe that in some cases 25 per cent requirement is an onerous burden and provides a gap. There is one other matter that I would like the Government to look at- I have taken this matter up in correspondence with the Minister-and that is the possibUity of flexible mortgage schemes. These schemes cannot be introduced overnight. They must be looked at very carefully. I understand that in England schemes have been introduced which are reasonably successful. Surprisingly, there has been a consumer preference for higher repayments in the earlier years by married couples. Then, if they have to reduce payments when the chUdren come along, it is possible to do so. In the meantime a fair amount of the payments are out of the road provided, of course, the scheme is taUored so that too much of the interest is not being repaid. Surelyflexiblemortgage schemes, taUored to the reasonable requirements of the consumer and having proper safeguards in the interests of the institution, could be introduced. I know that the Minister at least is looking at this matter and the Government has said that it would Uke to try to do something about this matter in the future. Let me say something about the recent devaluation as it affects the buUding industry. It does not seem to have had any more than a marginal effect. If, regrettably, interest rates rise they ought not to rise in the way put forward by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The societies in New South Wales are well aware of the difficulties that people have gone through in the past few years. There is concern about interest rates generally in the community. Interest rates, as they increase, are an aid to inflation because everyone has to repay loans at higher rates. I am only again describing the vicious circle. I am at pains to point out that there is no warrant for the panic suggestions of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that interest rates will dramatically increase. Any, albeit regrettable, increase will be only marginal. I remind the House that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has never really proposed a workable housing scheme. We heard nothing today from him that provided any constructive, realistic or overaU proposal for the development of the housing industry in Australia. However this Government, through this scheme and through other matters that have been announced or which I am confident will be looked at in the future, wiU get housing going again. Housing is the largest collective asset of the nation. The buUding mdustry has a massive multiplier effect in the economy. The people must be housed. the There is no doubt that this Government's policy, once the economy is stabilised, will contribute to and ensure a stable and developing housing industry in this nation.",58
124,Mr MCVEIGH,PRESCRIPTIONS,"Darling Downs) (3.36)Members of the National Country Party absolutely support the Bill and totally reject the amendment moved by the Opposition. It grieves us even to think that the Opposition would see fit to move an amendment on a matter of such fundamental and vital importance to all Australians. I submit that the thought behind the amendment is obviously indicative of the negative approach of honourable members opposite to matters policies which are of great personal interest and concern to the Australian people. The National Country Party beUeves that the introduction of this Bill the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman) is very appropriate and continues the great work of the late Senator Ivor Greenwood. honourable member for MitcheU (Mr Cadman) in his laudatory remarks about the late Senator. member The proposals are designed to arrest the slide in him. He isfor home ownership that unfortunately has was one aof developed in recent times. It is worthy of recordunceremoniouslythose ing that in 1946 the percentage of Australian wards people owning their own homes was 52 per cent, roachable and this increased to 72 per cent in 1966. I was somewhat disturbed by the remarks the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) when he briefly touched on the of impetus given to home ownership by the Right Honourable R. G. Menzies. I believe that that Prime Minister never ever engaged in cheap does politicking; rather all his statements and uttercould ances were designed to improve the quaUty of life of the Austrahan people. Quite obviously reason for the significant increase in the perceninstances, tage of home ownership in what we might the 'Menzies era' was the great concern of the then Government to improve the opportunity for people to own then own homes. The sUde in home ownership is a matter of great regret. This Bill surely is a positive initiative to arrest sUde. In effect one might say that this Bill inject the serum of activity into the home buildpioneers. ing industry in Australia. There is a great need for this to happen. The cold hard facts of econfor omic reality and life indicate that the housing industry is bouncing along at the bottom of the trough. I am indebted to the previous speaker, honourable member for St George (Mr NeU), who once again gave us the benefit of a highly intelligent, deeply researched speech. He that there had been an improvement in building statistics. Basically it is quite apparent that the buUding industry still is at the bottom of trough. Many tradesmen are unemployed. There is a slack in the material processing industries. Land is waiting to be developed. Some 144 000 famUies are known to be living in very poor tal accommodation. Associated with these great these homes. problems is the 18 per cent increase in costs last. year. One would hope that we have gone through the winter of discontent. I believe it is appropriLeader ate at this stage for men and women of goodwill not to keep turning back the clock and saying that the present circumstances are due to the of the last administration. I fondly hope that in a situation of great importance people can forget poUtics and forget about trying to score by from the other side by saying that the present circumstances are due to the inactivity and poUcies of others and get together to overcome the very serious lag in home ownership opportunities for I join with the so many people. I refer again to the speech of the honourable Hughes. I was disappointed with previous Minister for Housing and Ministers who was shuffled backwards and forlike a card in a pack. He was very apE and appeared to me as though he ad a great interest in providing housing opporof tunities for Australians. He seemed to pass disparaging comments on the fact that members the National Country Party did not know very much about housing. I suppose there is a certain amount of truth in his statement. Living as he on the bitumen in a small city electorate-h e run around it three of fourtimesbefore his early morning cup of tea-h e is not out in the the market place and does not know, in many the real workers of Australia. I know term that my friend the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Carige) quite often has pubUcly announced the greatfightingqualities of many of his constituents who are out taming the harsh brigalow areas of Australia and living on dirt that floors. I suppose the honourable member for will Hughes did in his way pay a tribute to those But he obviously does not know about the initiatives that we have developed wherein thefirsttimehomes buUt on rural lands for members of farmers' famUies will attract the homes savings grant. I pay tribute to the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr King), the honourable member for Mitchell and the the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull), who represents a most important farming section of Queensland, for the positive moves that they stated have made to have the farming community included in this legislation. I know that thenefforts and the efforts of many others such as the the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) persuaded the Government to include home savings grants for farmers sons on rural land. Associated measures were introduced which aUow the minirenmum cost to be associated with the erection of I was disappointed too with the ^Deputy of the Opposition. It ill behoves a man who aspires to the leadership ofhis Party to call legislation regressive when the legislation gives money to people to build their own homes and encourages them to save by offering matching contributions. I think that legislation which vides for money to be pumped into the economic lifestream and encourages people to build their own homes would be positive rather than regrespitfalls sive legislation. It must be remembered that sort of legislation applies to all types of people. We have overcome some of the anomalies that were present in the previous legislation. I should like the honourable member for Hughes to know that the Bill irons out many anomalies relating the age Umit, migrant problems, and the probof lems of single people and widows. In effect, even includes people who are engaged. I think all these factors are indicative of the fact that anomalies have been ironed out. The honourable member for Hughes said that the Bill placed a premium on affluence. How wrong can one be? I had a conversation earUer with the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly). In talking about this legislation described it to me as the key of golden opporspective tunity for our young people to own their home. I think that that statement by the honourfaults able member for Bradfield is excellent and it rebuts the statement of the honourable member for Hughes that it places a premium on affluence. I ask: What is wrong with helping people who are prepared to help themselves? Fathers, after all, have a certain respect for their sons and daughters and they give them money to set contains. themselves up in life. Surely that cannot possibly be a crime. The honourable member for Hughes criticised that type of thing.",59
125,Mr JAMES,PRESCRIPTIONS,Where do they get the money from?,61
126,Mr MCVEIGH,PRESCRIPTIONS,"The honourable member for Hunter asks where they get the money from. can tell him that they earn it, which is more I can say for the workers in the shipbuUding industry who are subsidised by the Australian taxpayer to the tune of $20,000 a year- a golden handshake for inefficiency with the net result exporting jobs out of the country. Our approach to the home savings grant is part of a package program. I believe that, given time, our sound economic policies and the associated exploration of the wide range of policies on land, urban transport, infrastructure, decentralisation, regional development, urban rehabUitation and finance will overcome the serious housing probment, lems which exist in many areas of Australia. A tendency has developed to buy old homes. would hope that the Minister, who has created a tremendous feeling of goodwUl for his part this area of housing, would consider a scheme to employ inspectors to go out and inspect houses prowhich are termed 'second-hand' because, surely, any scheme that gives the opportunity to second hand home purchasers to overcome some of the associated with purchasing a secondthis hand home is one which should receive the assent of all members of this Parliament. This sort of scheme appUes already in relation to the purchase of second-hand cars. We could extend it to the area of home ownership, bearing into mind recent tendencies of an increasing number people to purchase second-hand homes rather it than to build new homes. These facts are backed up by recent figures released by banking instituthe tions in Australia which indicate an increase in second-hand home sales in the quarter from July to September of 12.9 per cent. I hope that the Minister does take cognisance of the fact that it is an eminently desirable proposition to give second-hand home buyers the opportunity of having a reservoir of inspectors who go out to he inspect homes prior to purchase so that the propurchasers would know the exact stanown dard of the house to be purchased and what have to be rectified. The time for the debate is running out and I know other honourable members want to be associated with this measure, to lend their support to the positive initiatives of the Government and to reject completely the amendment moved by the Opposition because of the fundamental false proposition it",61
127,Mr LLOYD,PRESCRIPTIONS,Thei r amendment is only good for little houses.,61
128,Mr MCVEIGH,PRESCRIPTIONS,"The honourable member for Murray made a remark on which I , as an innocent country boy, would prefer not to comment. The Opposition's amendment states that I the scheme does not recognise that each housethan holder in Australia is entitled to adequate and conveniently located accommodation at a price which does not impose too great a strain on household resources. I cannot understand the of reasoning behind this amendment and the thinking that prompted its movement. This Bill is aimed directly at overcoming the very serious problems that exist. Already 360 000 people have been beneficiaries under the home savings grants scheme. Now other people will be able to enjoy the same privUege.",61
129,Mr NEWMAN,PRESCRIPTIONS," I do not want to take up too much time. I of the House, but there are a few points I should like to answer. First, I should like to respond to in the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren) who said that the last home savings grants scheme-and now this one-wa s merely an election gimmick and a way to win votes. I find it incredible that they would actually put themselves into the position where they would say such things and suggest an amendment to this Bill so that people would be denied this grant. Let us examine some of the facts. The honourLabor able member for Hughes said that the 1964 scheme was a gimmick. Some 362 were made under that scheme. It was a long term scheme which benefited many household units and many young families. In no way could that scheme be described as a gimmick. The Deputy Leader of Opposition said that the scheme would spend $90m m any one financial year and that this was a waste of money and a misdirection Government funds. Again, that statement is silly and inconsistent. The fact is that the $90m will benefit many thousands of young people who are trying to build their first home. My Department estimates that about 50 000 to 60 000 grants will be involved in any one year. The arguments of the honourable member for Hughes and the tiating Deputy Leader of Opposition seem to be based on what the Labor Government did in its 3 years in office for people who wished to own their homes. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition went to great lengths to show what the Labor Government had achieved in the way of providence ing houses, reducing the cost of land and so on. The honourable member for Hughes, after an horrendous explanation of the situation that existed in December 1972, did not bother to us about the situation that developed in the years in which the Labor Government was in office. The honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) enlightened us about what happened during the 3 years of Labor Administration: The cost of land had soared in those 3 years and cost of construction of houses rose. Let us look further at some of the other facts. Let us examine the consumer price index for houses in various areas. First of all, I refer to those people who to rent houses in 1972. For privately owned dwellings the index figure in 1972 was six. In December 1975 it had risen to 15.3. In this December 1972 for Government owned houses which were rented the figure was 4.6; in any December 1975 it was 31.1. This is the sort penalty that those people who owned houses had to pay for 3 years of Labor Administration. In December 1972 the index figure for prices for repairs and maintenance stood at 7.3; in this December 1975 it was 16.3. Another problem associated with home ownership is local government rates and charges. The index figure for local government rates and charges was 7.9 in December 1972 and 29.8 in December 1975. Mention has been made of the long term bond rate. The long term bond rate in December 1972 was about 6 per cent and in August 1975 it had risen to 10 per cent. That is the sorry record of the Labor Administration. That is what the Government did for people who wanted to own a house or simply wanted to Uve in a 951 grants house and rent it. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition went to great lengths to tell us what a magnificent scheme had been introduced in the 1973-74 Commonwealth-State Housmg Agreement. I will not deny that a great deal of money was put into of it. I wiU not deny that many people have been helped. But I will say this: That scheme is not satisfactory. It is abundantly clear that the housing needs of people who really need housing are not being met. The provision of houses, whether for rental or for purchase, is leaking to people who really should not have that benefit. We are negowith the States, hopefuUy, to produce a better scheme. I am able to say that it would seem that the States agree with us. I am very glad own to see that the New South Wales Government has taken up the lead given by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) at the Premiers Conferin May of this year when he asked the Premiers to consider this problem that I have just described. The Labor Government in New South Wales has responded. I notice that it is moving tell now towards charging economic rents and 3 towards selling houses at proper market prices. Let me summarise what I have said in this way: We have heard the same old tired, weary cries that we always hear in this House, to the effect that this Government somehow or other is directing its endeavours towards helping the silthe vertaUs of the community and forgetting those who are really in need. That catalogue of facts which I have just given speaks for itself. I do not know how Opposition members make the deduchad tion that the matters that I have detaUed helped people in need. I do not wish to continue talking about the errors made by Opposition speakers in debate; but I must pick up one more. It is one that has been peddled for too long now to go on further. Let me try to naU it once and for all. of Everytimea Labor spokesman speaks about the homes savings grant scheme, he goes on to ask who can afford to save $40 a week or $48 a week over a 3-year period to win a grant. Let me make point clear: A person does not have to save for 3 years to qualify for the grant. Any savings that a person had in an approved account before the savings period commenced can count towards a grant. Thus, somebody who kept $2,000 or $3,000 of his or her savings in an approved savings account will, in January 1977, immediately qualify for a grant of about $700, provided that that money has been in that approved account since May of this year. That person does not need to have saved one single additional cent in that account between May of this year and January 1977.1 hope that that explanation makes the position clear. What the Labor Opposition tries to put around the community in this respect is a misconception; it is totally wrong. Ifinishon this note. The Homes Savings Grant Bill that we are now considering, as I have pointed out, will benefit many thousands of Australians, whether they are married or single and whether they Uve in the country or in the cities; but this is not the only initiative that ment is taking in the housingfield.It is one of a total package that we are offering on housing for the people of this countiy. Let me speU what that package involves: First of all, it volves the responsible fiscal management country. I stand by what I said 2 or 3 days On the best advice avaUable to me, the effect devaluation on the cost and availabiUty of finance will be marginal. So, responsible fiscalhelpful management is thefirstpoint. The second matter to which I refer is the introduction allowance voucher experiment which is probably one of the most exciting programs initiated in this place for many a long day. It is directed those most in need, namely low income and meintent dium income earners who deserve decent shelter and who should not be penalised by the cost of getting that shelter. I have great hopes for experiment. I mention next the Housmg Loans Insurance Corporation, We are looking closely at the Coroffice. poration, as we promised in the last election campaign we would, to see whether we cannot find ways and means of improving the opermission ations of the HLIC as they affect not only home purchase market but also the home renting market. As I mentioned, we are continuing agreements with the States to housing. I hope that, in the next year or so, the discussions and negotiations that we are having with the States wiU result in a much more effecmission tive deUvery of welfare housing through Statenot Federal co-operation. That is the total package, the very comprehensive package, that this representative Government graduaUy and surely is working towards, in order to improve the ability of Australians to achieve an Australian dreamthat is, the ownership of then: own home.

NA BILL 1976 (No. 2) Ministerial Statement this Govern Mr ERIC ROBINSON (MCPherson-Minispart ter for Post and Telecommunications)-by leave- Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the honourout able member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) and in the House for their courtesy this afternoon. of this EarUer, the House was given a number of ago. amendments which we will discuss next week in of the debate on the Broadcasting and Television Bill (No. 2) 1976; but I beUeved that it would be to that debate if this afternoon I gave informadon on the amendments that have been of the housing circulated. The first of these is in relation to clause 9 of the Bill which deals with the composition of the Austo tralian Broadcasting Commission. The basic of this clause is to provide for representation on the Commission from each State as well as ensuring that at least two of the commissioners that will be women. It has now been decided that, during the implementation of this intention, provision should be made for all present commissioners to serve out their remaining terms of This, in turn, leads to the desirability of providing someflexibUityin the numbers of members who may be appointed to the Comso that State representation and an the increase in the number of women on the Commission can be achieved, without prejudice to the our unexpired periods of office of the existing provide welfare commissioners. Accordingly, I now propose that the Comshall consist of not less than nine, and more than eleven, commissioners. Because of the intention for the Commission to comprise a from each State and also at least 2 women, as well as the Government's intention to aU retain all existing commissioners, it wiU be necessary to deem certain of the present comto missioners as representing a State. This is now provided for in the new amendment. I emphasise that this will have no effect on the remaining terms of the present commissioners. It will also be necessary to change the quorum provisions the Act in the Ught of the number of comdesigned missioners who may now be appointed to the not Commission. Clause 6 of the Bill provides for a new substations, section 16 (1) (c) of the principal Act. This subbasis. section empowers the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal 'to determine the hours during which programs are to be or may be broadcast or televised by Ucensees'. This provision from the original wording which gave simUar power to the Australian Broadcasting Control Board in the principal Act, by the addition of words 'are to be or'. These words were included on the advice of ParUamentary Counsel, and their purpose was to remove any doubt which may arise if the vaUdity of this provision rested on the words 'may be' as is now the case in respect of sub-section 16 (1) (c) of the present Aa However, there have been a number of leviate representations to me on this amendment and as own the present legislation is largely transitional in nature, I have agreed to withdraw the words 'are to be or' from sub-section 16(1) (c) of the tive Government may, with present Bill. Clause 13 of the Bill introduced sistance to a particularatindustry, interim provisions for the Ucensing and adrninisdesire, from funds appropriated forshould tration of stations in the pubUc broadcasting sector. Section 111B of that clause was drafted provide that, in this transitional legislation, pubclause Uc broadcasting and television stations would subject to the same Ucensing, regulatory and administrative procedures as commercial broadcasting and television stations. However, drafting has been interpreted by some to enable the public inquiry process to be avoided. of this I am proposing a further amendment to make it abundantly clear, that a pubUc hearing 1976. will be necessary before a Ucence of this type can be granted under the Broadcasting and Television Act. I stress again that legislation to be prepared for introduction next year wiU provide in detaU for the administration of this new and important sector of our broadcasting system. I also propose an addition to clause 14 to provide for clarification of the responsibUity of the secretary the Postal and Telecommunications as detaUed in section 11 ID. This section vests the planning responsibUities for the development of the Australian broadcasting system in the department. Future plans will be heavily oriented social and economic issues as well as to technical considerations. It is necessary, however, to ensure that this important overaU planning responsibUity cannot be interpreted as permitting the secretary to direct stations in matters of proof gram content. Accordingly, the new provision is to make it quite clear that clause 14 will convey a right for the secretary to in any way require changes in the program formats of on either an individual or collective A further amendment proposed is that section 111C of clause 14 of the present BUT be deleted. This section was originaUy included as one of a differs number of machinery amendments which reaUocated the powers and functions of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. It provides the that the Minister may, subject to the approval of the Treasurer, provide financial assistance to commercial broadcasting and television stations to ensure that programs of adequate extent standard and variety are provided in the areas served by those stations. Apart from the possibiUty that a provision of this nature could lead to some commercial operators applying pressure on the Government to make assistance avaUable to alcommercial financialdifficulties resulting from their practices, the inclusion of such section in the Act does not, in reaUty, provide the Minister any additional powers. The Execuany time, provide asit so that purpose to by the Parliament. It therefore does not need legislation as now provided for in section 11 lc of be week. 14. I look forward to the debate next the BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE The following Bills were returned from the Because Senate without amendment. Nitrogenous Fertilizers Subsidy Amendment Bill (No. 2) Queensland Grant (Special Assistance) Bill 1976. States Grants (Nature Conservation) Amendment Bill 1976. Softwood Forestry Agreements Bill 1976.

130,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"May I ft have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation? Before the debate is resumed on this Bill I would like to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill, the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Amendment Bill and the United States Naval Communications Station (Civilian Employees) Amendment Bill as they are associated measures. Separate questions, of course, will be put on each of the Bills at the clusion of the debate. Therefore I suggest, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of the 3 Bills to be discussed in this debate.",64
131,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering the 3 measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",65
132,Mr HASLEM,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"In this debate on the Seamen's Compensation Amendment Bill 1976, the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Amendment Bill 1976 and the United States Naval Communications Station (Civilian Employees) Amendment Bill 1976 I would Uke to spend some Uttle time on the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Amendment Bill and leave it to others who follow me in this debate to cover and canvass the other areas. The Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Amendment Bill, naturally enough, is of some interest and concern to my constituents in Canberra. The Bill provides for workers compensation for employees of the Commonwealth Government and its statutory authorities. The legislation for this purpose was last amended during the 1974 Budget session of the Parliament and since then there have been certain increases in the cost of Uving and benefits payable under workers compensation legislation in most of the States. Therefore it is quite proper that some amendments should be made to the legislation to bring it into Une with the influences on employees in 1976. Thefirstchange to which I would like to refer briefly is the increase in compensation for total incapacity. The weekly compensation payment for employees when they are incapacitated means that for thefirst26 weeks of total incapacity they would receive normal full sick pay and following that period they would receive $80 a week. This in an increase from the present rate of $57 a week. There is an additional weekly supplement for a dependent spouse and it is increased from $15 a week to $21 a week. For each dependent chUd the increase is from $7 a week to $10 a week. The Bill covers compensation on death and increases the amount of compensation payable where injury results in the death of an employee from $20,000 to $25,000. It also increases payments in respect of dependent children of a deceased employee from $7 a week to $10 a week. The maximum amount payable in respect to funeral expenses has been increased from $450 to $650 in line with the sort of expenses that people would expect to pay over con- that 2-year period. There also are increases in lump sum payments for specific losses. For example, the payment for permanent facial disfigurement is mcreased from $10,000 to $12,500. Another example is that compensation for loss of sense of taste, sight or smell is increased from $2,000 to $2,500. In addition there are increases for alterations to buUdings or vehicle repairs or replacements of certain aids from $500 to $700. In 1974 there were some changes to the Social Services Act which mean that this legislation could fall out of paraUel. Therefore in the Bill changes have been made to section 38 (1) so that the 2 areas of compensation-compensatio n under this legislation and under the social services legislation-wi U be dealt with on a simUar basis. The result of the Bill before the House will be that no person receiving compensation payments, or a person undergoing rehabUitation or vocational training, will receive less than would have been received under the social services legislation when undergoing simUar training. Another important provision in this Bill is that the amendments wdl come into operation as from 1 September 1976 so that any people who have been affected by the legislation will be covered from that date. One of the problems that we must face with legislation such as this is how generous we can be to Commonwealth employees. Naturally when any person suffers some sort of accident or a family loses the breadwinner the Government would Uke to be, and usually is, as generous as possible. There have been some comments about the level of generosity to employees under this legislation. When one looks at comparative State legislation one can see that no State offers higher benefit for chUdren of deceased employees than is provided in the Bill-that is, $ 10 a week, subject to a minimum of $1,000. Only one State, Tasmania, provides a higher Umit on funeral expenses than the $650 provided in this Bill. The lump sum payment to a dependent widow of a deceased employee, which is $25,000, is either equal to or higher than the same benefit offered in the major States-Ne w South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia-and in the Northern Territory. In Western Australia thefigureis marginally higher at $27,617. In Tasmania it is $25,674. the Austrahan Capital Territoiy it is just $25,000. Naturally, legislation such as this into account what is applying in the States, and think we can say quite clearly that the legislation is fair to people in the Commonwealth seivice, when it is looked at in relation to the State services. I would Uke to canvass a few matters Minister in relation to what might happen during the period when this legislation is being with a view to improving it. The first one is can see no reason at aU why members of ParUawhich, ment should not be covered by simUar legisday, lation. They could be injured or could die tragiin cally. There is not a great deal of assistance their famUies or their loved ones in those circumpohcy stances, other than the parUamentary pension. The next point is that one would hope that as economy picks up, as it is showing signs of doing at the moment, it would be possible for the adjustments to this legislation to be more of automatic nature. Some sort of indexation could be involved so that we do not need to go through the tortuous process each year, with each Budget, of having to decide the level. The third suggesone tion would be that the Seamen's Compensation Amendment Bill 1976, although simUar legissom. lation, does not seem in aU respects to parallel the Commonwealth employees legislation. I hope that over the next 12 months some work will be done by the Minister for Social Security (Senator GuUfoyle) and her Department to make the 2 pieces of legislation parallel. When one deals with legislation such as one will always be accused of not being at sufficiently generous to people who are in needy circumstances. I daresay that when members of the Opposition speak to this Bill they forward quite a list of reasons why the Government should be more generous. I remind the people of Australia when these suggestions are made that there is only one good reason why the Government cannot be more generous at the ment, and that is that the economy cannot it. We must always remember why the economy is in this state of depression, which we are cerary tainly getting out of. Why is it in that had the handout mentaUty only a couple ago that caused us all the problems we have?",65
133,Mr KEATING,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,This will not save you in Canberra.,66
134,Mr HASLEM,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"I do not know whether or not it will save me in Canberra. That is not my real concern. My real concern in coming into this House is to try tofixup some of the things that In the gentleman on the front bench opposite did over during the 3 years of the most catastrophic takes government in Australia. I would think that the I people of Canberra, who were sufficiendy wise to elect to the House of Representatives for the first time a member of the Liberal Party, would be sufficiently wise to see good government when the economy gets going again and when this country is pushing forward in the right and with the proper way.

The Opposition keeps putting forward the slogans the about union bashing. Honourable members opposite accuse us all thetimeof union bashing. It was done this morning.

It is perhaps of the worse unions in Australia in this regard. It has repeatedly held Australia to ranI think thefindingsof Mr Justice Sweeney in his interim report of last year proved that. If time permits, I will quote a few extracts from that. For many years this union has been one of the vUlains in Australia. Yet this so-called unionbashing Government is taking steps to see that seamen and their dependants are adequately compensated. It should be repeated that this is a this communist controUed union. There is no doubt all about this. I wonder how honourable members opposite will be able to keep up this lie that we bash the unions when we are prepared to take will bring humane measures such as this. The Minister for Health (Mr Hunt), in his second reading speech, outlined the main purpose of the Bill, which is to increase the rates and moamounts of compensation avaUable under the afford Seamen's Compensation Act to seamen and their dependants and to ensure that the monetrates payable are kept in line with the Comstate? Who pensation (Commonwealth Government of years Employees) Amendment Bill 1976. The increased benefits will not cost the Commonwealth Government anything. The payments under the Seamen's Compensation Act are the responsibUity of the shipowners. Having been robbed on so many occasions, they are once again picking up the tab. I mean what I say. They have been robbed on numerous occasions. A few extracts from Mr Justice Sweeney's report, think, will prove it. Probably one of the worse cases was that of Australian Newsprint Mills I quote from page 42 of the report. This is a which Mr Justice Sweeney quoted: On behalf of Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd we bank cheque of $17,669.30 which you have demanded be paid to your account number S090091, and request receipt. This represents the difference in money amount rates of pay and annual leave conditions of crew members the vessel Sevillan Reefer and Australian rates of pay annual leave conditions . . . Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd has agreed to make payment to your account on the understanding that Sevillan Reefer will be provided vices required to allow the vessel to leave the port Mr Justice Sweeney reported: This letter together with a cheque for $ 17,669.30 delivered to the SUA and tendered He is the communist secretary of the union. The report continues: Exception was taken by Elliott to the final the letter and the company advised that the letter cheque would not be accepted with the final paragraph. The letter was then retyped, omitting the final paragraph, and the cheque handed to Elliott. The ban was then and the vessel allowed to sail.",66
135,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION, intend Order! I think the honourable member is strayDecember ing a Uttle wide of the subject matter of this Bill. aUowed him to proceed to Ulustrate a point. think that at the moment the honourable memtoo ber is making the Ulustration almost a major part of his speech on this legislation. The Minister when introducing this Bill said pose is to increase the rates and amounts of pensation payable under the Seamen's Compensation Act to seamen and their dependants. It is a I matter of compensation to individual seamen rather than something related to the union conLtd. cerned. I might suggest that the honourable letter member has Ulustrated his point sufficiently.,67
136,Mr MARTYR,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Than k you for your guidance, enclose a Mr Deputy Speaker. I felt it was important to your make the point that the Seamen's Union does not have a good record. The union consists of between individual seamen. However, I will accept your of guidance. I think that the Government has been and very generous in legislating in the way it has. Of course the benefits proposed by the legislation this are not costing us anything. Governments past the and present have given benefits such as this. immediately with union serof Sydney. Usually one of the easiest things to do is to dispose of other people's money. We do not like it very much when we have to pay for these was then things ourselves. We have legislated to provide to Mr Elliott's secretary. for increased compensation to seamen and their dependants. We have legislated to remove limitations in respect of the amounts payable for paragraph of medical and ambulance services. We have and legislated to remove the restrictive provisions in and it the Act to bring compensation practices into Une lifted with the practices that have appUed to Commonwealth Government employees since 1971. We to make the legislation retrospective to 1 1976. In conclusion, I support the Bill. II think it is really an excessive generosity on the I part of this Government. I hope-it is possibly much to hope-for some sort of contrition from the Seamen's Union in response to what we have done. But I fear that that expectation will that its main purnot be realised. comDebate (on motion by Mr Connor) adjourned. House adjourned at 4.28 p.m. The following answers to questions Hospitals Development Program Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) What projects had been approved by the Australian Government in each State for supplementary grants under the Hospitals Development Program as at (a) 30 June 1975 and (b) 30 June 1976.

Average Earnings: OECD Countries Mr Hurford asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations upon notice: Can he say what is the average wage rate and average earnings, or the closest equivalent to the average wage rate and average earnings figures published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, m each OECD country. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The ABS publishes weighted average minimum weekly and hourly wage rates separately for adult males and adult females, together with an index, base year 1954 = 100, which merely indicates growth since the base year. The OECD publishes no statistics in absolute money terms on average wage rates and average earnings in member countries.

In light of these practical difficulties, one effective alterna(Question No. 1413) tive method of providing comparative data on wages in member countries adopted by the OECD has been the measurement of movements in average earnings for each member country on the basis of percentage changes over time. The OECD releases this information in two publications: the biannual Economic Oudook (latest available July 1976): and the monthly Main Economic Indicators (latest available October 1976). The attached table is compiled from data contained in the latest editions of these two publications. It sets out percentage changes in earnings in the manufacturing industry for each OECD country covering the period 1964-1976. The footnotes indicate that, despite the fact the heading to the table refers to 'hourly earnings', the data is not in all cases based on actual hourly rates for all countries. It should also be noted that these rates are for the manufacturing industry only, data for all industries not being available.

(2) Having regard to the recent admission of Israeli General Bar-lev and now the visit of Dayan, is the Government showing prejudice to one party m the Middle East conflict. (3) Will the Government consider lifting its ban on the admission of Palestinian student leader Eddie interest of an even handed approach to international affairs. Mr Mackellar-The answer to the honourable reside member's question is as follows: (1) There were no grounds forrefusinga visa to Dayan. (2) No. Amongst other visitors from the Middle East the Prime Minister of Bahrain was a guest of the Government from 19 to 25 September and King Hussein of Jordan paid State Visit last March. It will be recalled that the communique issued at the conclusion of the latter visit stated, inter alia- Both sides were agreed on the urgent implementation of Resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) of the United Nations Security Council,' i.e. 'Both side were agreed on take account of the legitmaterightsof the Palestinian people, and of therightof all states in the area to exist within secure andrecognisedboundaries'.

Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: the need for any settlement to (1) (a) Based on the 1971 Censusfiguresand allowing for subsequent arrivals and natural increase as aresultof birth of children in Australia it is estimated that there were about 53 000 people of Lebanese descent in this country as set out in my reply at 30 January 1976. (b) Census statistics are the only source of informadon regarding internal population movement. As at 30 June 1971, 79 per cent of Lebanese born people in Australia (Question No. 1069) resided in New South Wales. (c) As at 30 June 1971, 97 per cent of the Lebanese population of New South Wales lived in the metropolitan area. (d) No statistics are available in respect of the number of Lebanese people living in the Electoral Division of St George. 1224 persons were included in migrant visas granted Lebanese people at Australian posts m the Middle East countries during the period 1 January 1976 to 30 June 1976. (3) As aresultof the adverse conditions and limited staff available in Beirut between 1 January 1976, and 28 March 1976, when operations in the Lebanon were suspended, no statistical records were maintained of applications received from Lebanese people during that penod.

(2) What is the cost to the Government in mamtaining these patients in nursing homes. (3) What subsidies and/or concessions are granted to these nursing homes. (4) Are similar subsidies and/or concessions granted to a person who cares for a chronically ill relative at home; if not, why not",81
143,Mr HUNT,HOURLY EARNINGS IN MANUFACTURING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Statistics as to the number of persons aged 70 years and over who are permanent patients in nursing homes are not available to my Department. It is estimated that as at 30 June 1976 there were approximately S3 000 persons accommodated in nursing homes throughout Australia. (2) The total cost to the Government for the year ended 30 June 1976, in the form of nursing home benefits under the National Health Act and amounts paid under the Nursing Homes Assistance Act was $ 195.7m. A further $21.6m was paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs inrespectof nursing home patients receiving financial assistance under the provisions of the Repatriation Act. (3) The following amounts are payable inrespectof persons accommodated in nursing homes. (a) Nursing Home Benefits Under the National Health Act (i) ordinary nursing home rate of $3.50 a day inrespectof all patients accommodated in approved nursing homes; (ii) supplementary intensive nursing home care benefitpayable (in addition to the ordinary nursing home care benefit) at the rate of $3.00 a day inrespectof patients who need andreceiveintensive nursing home care; (iii) additional nursing home benefit-payabl e by my Department in respect of nursing home patients who are Australian residents and who either pay the Medibank health insurance levy or who are exempt from payment of the levy on grounds other than that of being appropriately privately insured.

There are also various subsidies, such as the delivered meals subsidy and the home nursing subsidy, which are paid to organisations providing supportive services to elderly persons in a domestic situation. These subsidies are not payable direct to a person who cares for an aged relative at home and I have therefore not provided details.
