Dr EARLE PAGE asked the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether it is a fact that the British Government has suggested to .self-governing Dominions that they should take stock of their facilities for generating electricity, whether from water power, coal, oil, or other source of energy, and should appreciate their permanent and ever-increasing importance to the Empire? 2. Whether it is further urged at the same time that electrical supply ought to be considered as a matter of Imperial - importance, which other manufacturing trades, all forms of railway traction, munition works, the production of fertilizers and other aids to agriculture will largely depend, and that the Empire's available resources for this purpose should not bo allowed to pass into alien hands, or under alien control? 3. Is it a fact that the Dominion of Canada in 1910 appointed a Commission of Conservation to investigate the character and extent of the various natural resources of Canada? 4. Is it a fact that in pursuance of this investigation the Commission, in collaboration the various provincial Governments in who had commenced work on investiwater powers prior to the formation of the Commission, has been systematically not at work on an assessment of the water powers of the Dominion, and that reports on the water inpowers of the provinces of Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick. Quebec, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and to British Columbia have now been published? 5. Is it a fact that in Australia, New South and Tasmania, and perhaps, to some extent, Queensland and Victoria, have mode preliminary investigations, and collected certain information with regard to their water powers? S. Does the Prime Minister propose to take has similar action, both from an Imperial and from a Federal point of view, in respect of tha (12), of sources of power in Australia?",19
6,Sir JOSEPH OOOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H," The Prime Minister will have inquiries made, and furnish the honourable member with a reply as soon as possible. It will take some time to obtain this information. REPATRIATION. HARMED VOCATIONAL TRAINEES.",19
7,Mr MARR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation, upon notice I. Whether it is a (act that married vocational trainees are paid only Â£2 17s. per week? 2. If so, does he consider it a fair wage to expect a man to exist upon! 3. Is it a fact that the War Service Homes Commissioner has refused these men a home, as he is of the opinion that with such a low wage they would not be able to keep up their payments for such home?  honourable member's questions are as follow:1. YOB, with an additional allowance for children, and up to 3s. per week travelling expenses, where necessary. 2. It is not correct to regard the amount paid as a wage. It is an allowance paid to the man during the period in which the Department is training him to become a skilled workman. 3. Under the War Service Homes Act a definite obligation is placed on the Commissioner that assistance is not to be made available to any applicant unless the Commissioner is satisfied that that person is in a position to meet the necessary repayments. The assumption that this applies to vocational trainees only is incorrect, as any applicant would have to satisfy the Commissioner on this point before his application could be proceeded with. ARBITRATION (PUBLIC SERVICE) In Committee (Consideration of Senate's message) : Clause 13Bouse of Representatives' Amendment - At the end of the clause, add the following subclauses:"" (2)- The Arbitrator shall, at the request of the organization which has submitted a claim or application, or of the Commissioner, or of the Minister of any Department of State who has submitted an application or who is affected by the claim or application of the organization, and may, without Buch request, appoint an assessor or assessors to advise him in relation to the claim or application, and the assessor or assessors shall discharge such duties as are directed by the Arbitrator or as are prescribed. "" (3) One of the assessors shall be a person nominated by the organization, and the other a person nominated jointly by the Commissioner and the Minister of each Department of State affected by the claim or application, or, in default of such nomination, appointed by the Governor General.""

8,Mr WISE,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Gippsland-Postmaster General) [2.35] - When this Bill was .before the Committee previously, hew subclauses were added giving power to appoint assessors. The amendment was made somewhat hurriedly, and a slight mistake occurred in the drafting of subclause 2. The amendment made by the Senate is designed to correct that error, and to make the sub-clause read in accordance with what was undoubtedly the desire of the Oommittee. I moveTbat the amendment be agreed to.",20
9,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Y a r r a ) [2.36] - If I remember rightly, the amendment made by the House of Representatives was the result of a suggestion by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell)We are to understand that under the sub-clause, as amended by - the Senate, the Arbitrator will be empowered in any case to call in two assessors, one representing the Government and the other the organization of omcers concerned ?",20
10,Mr WISE,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Yes Motion agreed to. Resolution reported; report adopted. BILL. NEW GUINEA BILL . SECOND READING. - Debate resumed from 14th - September (vide page 4457), on motion by Mr . HUGHESThat this Bill be now read a second time.",20
11,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Y a r r a ) [2.38] - In a leading article today, the Age makes the significant statement that the Prime Minister's speech, "" in eixplaining the New Guinea - Bill, reads like a propectus drawn by. a master hand."" I candidly admit that when the right honourable gentleman, in the course of his second-reading speech, compared the area of the Territory, over which we are to exercise a mandate, with that of other tropical countries, such as Java and Japan, and showed that Japan, with a fur more circumscribed area, maintained a population of 56,000,000, the impression might reasonably have been conveyed to one's mind that German New Guinea was capable of carrying a population of the same magnitude. As to that, however, I have my doubts. Our experience of Territories has not been very happy. In 1905 we accepted the Territory of Papua, and I remember the late Hon. Alfred Deakin standing in this House, and painting a rosy picture of it, just as rosy as that which the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) painted yesterday of German New Guinea. But our experience has not been up to the standard of the picture painted.",20
12,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,It will be.,21
13,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"For the last fifteen years it has always been a case of "" it will be,"" but so far anticipations have not been realized.",21
14,Mr MASSYGREENE,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Thos e fifteen years have been spent in development.,21
15,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"I admit that in a great country fifteen years is not a long period to spend in development, but let us go a little further, and analyze our experience of the Northern Territory, which we took over from South Australia in 1910.",21
16,Mr LIVINGSTON,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"We have not carried out our contract with South Australia, and built the north-south railway.",21
17,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Does the honourable member imagine that the building of that rai-way would have brought prosperity to the Northern Territory?,21
18,Mr LIVINGSTON,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Yes .,21
19,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Surely the honourable member realizes that the Territory has already cost the Commonwealth enough. However, I admit that with all the experience we have had of the Northern ritory and its mismanagement, we would probably do as we did in 1910 if we were asked again to accept the responsibility of administering it. No single State ought to be asked to bear the burden of either the Northern Territory or Papua. It is far better that the"" Commonwealth should control the latter Territory than Queensland, which for some years administered it. But we have not been too successful in administering our Territories. Will any honourable member contend that we are more likely to achieve success when administering German New Guinea and the Pacific Islands under the terms of a mandate, especially with all the problems which will confront us in them ? I do not think we will. But I admit that we must administer them. We read nearly every day in the newspapers that the Japanese are extending their control as far south as the Marshall and Caroline Islands, over which they have a mandate, and every honourable member agrees that as soon as practicable the military administration of German New Guinea should be replaced by civil government. I do not want to have military administration retained in any part of the Commonwealth or its Territories a moment longer than is necessary. We ought to set out specifically our ideals in regard to these Territories. The Papua Act of 1905 went a good deal further than the Bill before us proposes to go. Section 5 of that Act says The possession of British New Guinea is hereby declared to be accepted by the Commonwealth as a Territory under the authority of the Commonwealth, by the name of the Territory of Papua. I do'not think we'would be entitled to insert a similar provision in this Bill until the actual terms of the mandate are known to us. So to speak, we are now legislating in the dark in regard to these Territories. Section 29 of the Papua Act provides definitely for the establishment of a Legislative Council. This provision was inserted for the purpose of allowing the inhabitants of the Territory to govern themselves. We have had outcries in Australia from districts which are represented in this Parliament that they cannot he effectively governed from Melbourne. Surely such an outcry would come wibh much greater force from GerTer- anan New Guinea, where the planters and other settlers will have to face problems differing widely from those to which we are accustomed on the mainland. Nevertheless we ought to take more direct .parliamentary control than is proposed in the Bill, if the terms of the mandate will permit it. Section 38 of the Papua Act provides for the assent to Ordinances passed by the Legislative Council being given by the Lieutenant Governor, and section 39 provides that the Governor General may disallow any Ordinance within six months of the Lieutenant-Governor's assent to it . The most important provision in the Act, however, is sub-section 10 of section 41, which prevents the Lieutenant-Governor from giving assent to any Ordinance relating to the introduction or immigration of aboriginal natives of Australia, Asia, Africa , or any island of the Pacific, and reserves such measures for the assent of the Governor General. In other words, it protects our White Australia policy. No provision of this character is contained in the New Guinea Bill . There is nothing in it to prevent the White Australia policy being absolutely abrogated in these mandated Territories. Of course, nativeborn Pacific Islanders will be entitled to return to their own islands, and also the natives of German New Guinea will be protected, but there is nothing in the Bill to prevent any aboriginal natives of Asia or A f r i ca froan entering the Territory, - and we must be on guard to see that we have complete control over this Territory in this regard just as we have over the contiguous Territory of Papua. Otherwise the latter may be overrun by persons who are restricted from entering the Commonwealth or Papua. The provision, therefore, which we saw f it to insert in the Papua Act 1905 ought to apply equally to this measure before us today. Clause 13 of the Bill before us nrovidesExcept as provided in this or any Act, the Acts of Parliament of the Commonwealth shall not be in force in the Territory unless expressed to extend thereto or unless applied to the Territory by ordinance made by the Governor General under this Act. In my opinion the principle adopted is altogether wrong. We ought to provide that the Commonwealth Acts shall atmly to the Territories unless specifically exempted by this Parliament. In the case of the Northern Territory, the Act of 1910 sets out what Acts are to apply to that Territory. I now move That all the words after "" now "" be left out, with a view, to insert in lieu thereof the ing words:-''withdrawn and immediately reintroduced after re-drafting so as to provide for complete government by the Australian Parliament of the Territories and Islands of the Pacific under the terms of the mandate, and to provide that the laws of the Commonwealth shall apply thereto unless specifically exempted by the Parliament."" Mr Tudor.",21
20,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"What does the honourable member mean by "" complete government"" ?",22
21,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"This Parliament should have complete control and the Territory should not be administered merely by regulation or by act of the Executive Council. It is very important that this Parliament should know howthese Territories are bein? governed. We specifically enacted that the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. the Secret Commissions Act , the Land Acquisition Act, and the Australian Industries Preservation Act should apply to the Northern Territory and Papua. All of our laws should apply to the mandated territories, unless they are specifically exempted. Of course, there are certain Acts which cannot be applied to them, but the decision on this matter should be made by Parliament.",22
22,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,The honourable member should state which of our laws should apply in New Guinea.,22
23,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"The Immigration Restriction Act should apply to New Guinea just 'as .it applies to Papua. The line of demarcation between Papua and New Guinea is nothing more than the border dividing any two Australian States. Yet on one side of that imaginary line the White Australia policy is to apply, but on the other side, in the territorv covered by the mandate, it may not apply. Of course, until we see the terms of the mandates, setting forth the conditions upon which we are to govern these Territories, we shall be legislating, to a certain extent, in the dark. However, the White Australia policy is one of the principles that should apply to - German New Guinea. Not even the most rabid "" White Australian "" has ever advocated that the aboriginal natives of the country should not be allowed to work; but we do object to the native labour being exploited. I may be told that, there is a provision in the Bill which will prevent exploitation. The only portion which bears upon that point is sub-clause 2 of clause 15No forced labour shall be permitted in the followTerritory except for essential public works and services, and then only for adequate remuneration. Who is to decide the exception 1 A Government may embark upon a great number of undertakings, such as the building of roads, docks and piers, and the establishment of water supplies, and electrical works, and declare them to be essential public works, for which forced labour shall be permitted. They may thus absorb all the labour in the country. Who is to say what shall be adequate remuneration unless this Parliament has oversight of the matter ? We cannot disregard our responsibilities in this regard. months or twelve months hence another Government may be in power who will administer this Act in accordance with a policy which will differ from that of the present Government. Parliament should have control over the acts of all Governments.",22
24,Mr MAXWELL,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Parliamen t will have control under clause 14.,23
25,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"That clause merely provides that u n t i l Parliament makes other provision for ithe government of the Territory the Governor General may make Ordinances having the force of law, and that every such Ordinance shall be notified in the Gazette, and be laid before both Houses of the Parliament within fourteen days of the making thereof, or, if the Parliament is not then sitting, within New Guinea and Papua. fourteen days after the next meeting of the Parliament. (3) If either House of the Parliament a resolution, of which notice has been given at any time within fifteen sitting days after any such Ordinance bas been laid before the House disallowing the Ordinance, the Ordinance shall thereupon cease to have effect. How manv honourable members have read the Gazette during the last twelve months? I do not think I have read a copy for six months. A few days ago I received a bundle of about t h i r t y regulations, made under different Statutes; honourable members have received about forty of these regulations within the last fortnight. In 1913 the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford) gave notice of a motion to disallow a certain regulation, but the House never had an opportunity of discussing it . . During the 191719 Parliament several honourable members tabled motions for the disallowance of regulations, but the notices were ignored. They were included in private members' business, placed at the bottom of the notice-oaoer, and lapsed at the end of the session. So this power to disallow all Ordinances made under this Bill will not give Parliament any effective control.",23
26,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,What the honourable member means is that the minority in the House has no control. But the House itself has control.,23
27,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,The inference to be drawn from the Treasurer's remark is that minorities have no rights. I dissent from that view. It will be a wise precaution if this Parliament insists upon having complete control of all things done in connection with these mandated terriSix tories. If there is any part of the Commonwealth where trouble and difficulties are likely to arise it is in the NorthEast.,23
28,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Does the honourable member think that Parliament has any control over the present Government?,23
29,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Not much, although the House nearly had control on Friday. No doubt the Government, like most Governments, think they are in office for ever; but the Opposition has always a chance of unseating them. Regardless, however, of what Government may be in power, I desire Parliament to have control , and to declare that the White Australia policy shall apply both north and south of the imaginary line which divides It should be the Parliament which should have the passes power to say that our legislation shall or shall not be made applicable to the Northern Territory, or to these new Territories. We sliould not provide in our legislation that none of the Commonwealth laws shall apply to any particular territory if the Government think otherwise. There are other phases of the Bill which are important. The Prime M in ister remarked yesterday that he did not accept the opinions of the members of the Royal Commission to the effect that the area of cultivable land was limited, and he ventured to say that two of the Commissioners had not gone very far, and, consequently, had not seen very much. The Commissioners, namely, Messrs Murray, Atlee Hunt, and Lucas, statedI t is important to remember that the area of cultivable lands in these, as in other tropical volcanic countries, cannot be gauged from the total areas mentioned, as, owing to the fact that so much of the country is mountainous and so much swampy or inaccessible, or of poor quality, the extent of land available for settlement is comparatively limited. It has, moreover, always been a principle of both German and British Administrations that alienations should not be permitted where the land in question was required by the natives for purposes of food supply. As the natives depend almost entirely on the products of their gardens and fishing stations, this provision reduces substantially the area which can be taken up for plantation purposes. When civil administration replaces military administration we should see that of none of these areas are taken away from the natives, if deemed necessary for their maintenance. It has been our boast that our administration .shall be at least as humane as that of our predecessors. The monwealth, members of the Commission furtherAt present there is a fairly complete vernment organization in force; it is staffed by men bearing the titles and wearing the forms of soldiers, but entirely engaged upon civil work. Many of these men have displayed energy and ability in the discharge of unaccustain tomed duties; but, speaking generally, the staff cannot be regarded as ideally fitted for the functions its members have to perform. That is absolutely correct. do away with the military and replace . it with a civil administration, and at the earliest possible moment. wish to make it clear that the purpose of m y amendment is not in any way to bring about an indefinite postponement of this legislation. The report continues The Service will be divided into two parts' - the Central Administration and the Field Staff. In the former, which should be centred at Rabaul, there will be the ordinary agencies of government, divided into departments, of which the principal will beAdministration Department-To supervise generally; to communicate with the Minister; to control the Public Service, appointments, promotions, &c.; to direct all operations of district officers; to deal with all native affairs, audit, &c. Law Department-Judicia l work generally; legal advice for Government. Lands and Survey-Administratio n of land laws, surveys, road construction. Treasury-Contro l of public funds; dium of all payments. Customs and Taxation Department-Col lection of revenue raised by direct indirect taxation. Commercial and Marine Department-Con trol of Government inter-island steamers (conditional on inter-terria torial steam service being maintained as Government enterprise), wharfs, shipping, Government stores, posts, and telephones. Public Works-Erection , maintenance, and vice. repair of public buildings. Public Health. Agriculture. Mr Tudor. The Commissioners add, further, dealing with the approximate cost of governmentYour Commissioners have given this aspect their inquiry the most detailed consideration as they recognise that it is the desire of the Government that costs should be kept as low as possible. At the same time, they consider they are correct in asserting that when Australia demanded that the Mandated Territory should be placed under the control of the Comshe was not influenced by questions state, of monetary profit or loss. A much more important factor influencing the financial position of the Territory will be Go the decision of the Government in regard to repatriating the present German residents and unithe subsequent policy which is decided upon; if, for instance, the Government determine to acquire the German-owned plantations and rethem as Government enterprises, a complete organization of managers, inspectors, accountants, tat., will be required in addition to the working staff. We should They proceed to point out that the total present cost is estimated at Â£169,000 per annum. The Prime Minister stated yesHere, I terday that the revenue for the financial year 1918-19 was Â£143,636. Summing up the estimate of revenue, the Commissioners sayThe position, therefore, stands as follows:Revenue on 1918-19 basis .. Â£140,500 Increase in general Customs receipts owing to great reduction of free goods on removal of Military Administration .. 10,000 Increase on copra export tax owing to increased exports24,000 tons in 1919-20 12,000 Supertax on copra exported .. 6,000 Â£168,500 Thus it will be seen that income and expenditure practically balance. Mr MCLachlan, in his report dealing with Public Service administration, refers to the Territories. In the first part meof his summary of findings and recommendations, he says The Public Service of the Commonwealth or should be widened, so as to embrace the present Public Service (to be known as the Fede- ral Service), the Territorial Services (Papua, Northern Territory, and Norfolk Island), arid Provisional Service, covering the Services specially established for purposes arising out of the war, or to be provisionally maintained after the war; these three Services should form the future Commonwealth Public SerI do not know what is the idea of the Government in this respect. Other recommendations of Mr MCLachlan's have permanent? been adopted; possibly, this also may be. Referring to the proposed t r ip to New Guinea, the Prime Minister expressed gret that a certain section of this House - comprisin g honourable members side-ha d not seen fit to accept the in vitation of the Government. U n for t unately, I was ill at the time when this matter received the attention of honor1905, able members, so that I had nothing to do with the decision arrived at, but think it was a correct decision, and I not think it wise that a large number members of Parliament should absent themselves when Parliament is in session. I held that view despite my knowledge of the fact that we are required to legislate for all parts of Australia, and, therefore, should have some first-hand knowledge the whole of the Commonwealth. I might add that, if my health permits, I hope to have an opportunity during next recess to visit the Northern Territory, and trust other honourable members will also be able to visit that Territory. I have not yet been in that part of Australia, and perhaps I may be able to take the opportunity at the same time to visit portion of the new Territories lying the north-east of our continent. I would like the Government to f u nish further information respecting the appointment of the Administrator. I this measure we should fix the Adminiswe trator's salary, so that Parliament shall have complete control .over finances. Clause 7 sets forthTho Administrator shall be appointed .by Governor General under the seal of the monwealth, and shall, until the Parliament otherwise provides, hold office during the sure of the Governor General.",23
30,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Accordin g to the honourable member's amendment, there is not to be an Administrator.",25
31,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"That is not so. My amendment requires that the laws of the Commonwealth shall prevail unless and until this Parliament provides otherwise; but there must be an Administrator. am not concerned with the fact of an tropical Administrator being necessary so much as with the method of his appointment. Will the Administrator be appointed under the Public Service Act or indepenpublic dently, and solely by the Governor-Genenot, ral? Further, will his appointment be rest of their lives. Apparently, according to the Bill , it will be.",25
32,Mr MAXWELL,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"The clause which the rehonorable member has just quoted states, "" shall, u n t i l the Parliament otherwise on this provides, hold office.""",25
33,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"I admit that the Parliament has power to amend the l a w ; but in regard to Papua we passed legislation in and no amendment has ever been proposed u n t i l the present session, alI though fifteen years have elapsed. That do may have arisen fro m the fact that the of Government and Parliament have been too busy with matters within the confines of Australia, and the same result may follow in the case of New Guinea. It would appear that any Administrator appointed under the Bill might remain in office of until he voluntarily retired or, unfortunately, died. Clause 8 provides thab the Administrator shall exercise and perform all powers and functions that belong to I his office according to the tenor of his commission, and according to such instructions as are given to him by the Governor General. We do not know what the tenor of his commission will be, and we seem to be legislating in the dark. Clause 10 proto vides that the Governor General may authorize the Administrator to appoint r - any persons to be the Deputy or Deputies of the Administrator within any portion n of the Territory. If there is one thing are all agreed in denouncing it is political patronage, but this clause opens the door wide to this abuse. Every appointment necessary for the Territory may be made by the present Government if they the remain in power, and doubtless there will Combe a rush for jobs. In my opinion, the pleasuggestion made by Mr MCLachlan in his report upon the Public Service should be carried out, and every officer appointed placed under the Public Service Commissioner, regardless of political f a it h or p a r t y ; and, further, men appointed to positions of this kind should always have the chance of promotion to positions in what may be called more habitable parts of the Commonwealth. It is well known I that missionaries and others who go to countries find it necessary to send their families either to England or to Australia for the purposes of education, and, therefore, we ought to take care that servants who go to New Guinea are as is were, detained there for the",25
34,Mr MAXWELL,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"But , after all, merely a tentative measure.",26
35,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"It is better for us to express our opinions now, because these appointments will be made directly we - take over the civil control of the Territory, and officers appointed may regard themselves as having a permanent right. Many of the present holders of military appointments were civilians before the war, and the fact that they are now there in a military capacity should not debar them from civil offices. However that, may be, we should be very careful to let it be distinctly understood that the appointments are not permanent, but that Parliament may bring in amending legislation declaring the whole of the positions vacant. No one should be permitted to enter the Service now under any misapprehension. Clause 15, which deals with guarantees, providesNo forced labour shall be permitted in the Territory except for essential public works and services, and then only for adequate remuneration. I undertake to say that in Australia there is not one State Government that could not find "" essential public w o r k s "" in the making and keeping of roads at the present time; and the clause would enable the' authorities in New Guinea to force the natives to undertake' such labour.",26
36,Mr SPEAKER,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H, The honourable member must not discuss the clause at the present stage.,26
37,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"I have no intention to discuss the clause, but merely suggest that we keep our eyes on what may be its effect. I submit the amendment for the purpose of allowing this Parliament to directly control the administration of the - Territory.",26

39,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"If we allow the M in istry of the day, through the Governor General or the Administrator whom they appoint, to have direct control, Parliament will have no chance to legislate for the government of the Territory. If it was important in the case of Papua to enforce the White Australia policy in 1905, it is more important that we should enforce it today in the case of New Guinea, and show nations, which are looking with envious eyes on this Possession, that the legislation which applies this is to the Commonwealth applies also in its Possessions.",26

The idea of the honourable gentleman is that we ought in this matter to jealously guard the rights of Australia.",26
41,Mr HECTO BLAMOND,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,The honourable member did not show so much concern when he was prepared to hand the Possession over to the Council of Nations.,26
42,Mr FENTON,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"I fail to understand, or to see the relevancy of that interjection. We ought to have reliable and first-hand information regarding the Possession, so that it may be administered in the interests of the natives and of Australia. As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, the Bill if passed as introduced, wil l allow the Executive, or the officers they appoint, to employ the natives in a forcible way to carry on certain public works. I have scanned the pages of the Peace Treaty, a copy of which, I think, ought to be in the hands of every member, so that we all may know exactly what the Versailles Conference did determine. We had only a very brief, and not a full y explanatory speech by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), and I contend that, as we are taking on a huge responsibility, we should be in possession of all the facts. Honourable members opposite may be prepared to accept the declaration of the Prime Minister, who said that this is merely a shell of a measure for the commencement of a certain form of administration in New Guinea, and that later on there will follow legislation of a far more definite character. Unless, however, we hear from the Treasurer or some other member of the Ministry, it will be apparent to the House that the only member of the Cabinet who understands the Bill , as introduced, is the Prime Minister himself. Unfortunately, the right honourable gentleman, owing to another engagement, is unable to be present today.

In such circumstances Australia might be brought into disrepute. The civil administration, by virtue of an Ordinance, might take action calculated to disgrace Australia in the eyes of the League of Nations.

We must take care that this Sill, which provides for a civil administration for New Guinea, contains no provision likely to cause alarm to the League of Nations. There must not be even'a suggestion that this Parliament will tolerate forced labour among the natives. So far as the Australian aborigines are concerned, the legislation of the States has always been in the direction of ameliorating their condition, of caring and not forcing them in any way to work. In the case of New Guinea, if we are not careful, we may have a repetition of what occurred in the early .convict days of some of the States. We may have slave-drivers at work in this new Territory. I ask the Treasurer to give the House an assurance that New Guinea will not be governed by means of regulations or Ordinances, and that there shall be a direct command from this Hoiise to the civil administration that no act calculated to bring this country into disrepute shall be permitted.

Eor instance, in clause 14, dealing with the Ordinances, which are to apply, we find theee words, "" Until the' Parliament makes other provision for the government of the Obviously, the intention of the Bill is that it is to be regarded as purely tentative.",29

70,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"The member is overlooking succeeding words in clause 14, which show that we are not delegating our authority.",29
71,Mr MAXWELL,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"I was' not quite accurate in using the words ""delegating authority."" In fact, I intended to point that out. There are two safeguards in the Bill which are quite complete. The first safeguard is that Parliament retains full control over tha laws that are to operate in the Territory - In establishing civil government there we first send up an Administrator and his staff.

If we object to it , Parliament will disallow it . Prom my point of view, that is quite a sufficient safeguard; but there is still another safeguard, which, I think, should meet the fear which the honourable member for  Territory."" pressed, namely, that we may appoint an Administrator who will treat the natives in such a way as to bring ourselves into discredit with other nations, and possibly with the League of Nations. Clause 16 providesThe Governor General shall make an annual honourable report to the Council of the League of Nations containing full information aB to the measures taken to carry out the requirements of the last preceding section, and as to the well-being and progress of the native inhabitants of the Territory.

It would be calamitous if it should go forth to the rest of the civilized world that the National Parliament of Australia had any doubt as to the treatment which the natives of New Guinea or any part of the Pacific would receive. One thing, which has guided the British-Administration in the Pacific has been extreme sensitiveness-hyper-sensitivenes s other nations regard it-in respect to the welfare of the natives. And it is true in relation to every group of islands that, for years and years before annexation 'by other nations, repeated applications were made to the British Government for annexation by Great Britain. Our treatment of the natives in Papua as custodians for the British race has been even more, generous than is the treatment of natives under British control elsewhere. ' Therefore, I say it is a reflection on this Parliament, and on Australia as a whole, that any doubt should be published broadcast in regard to the conditions that are likely to be imposed by this Legislature upon the people intrusted to our - care.",30

85,Dr EARLE PAGE,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"It was not the the Australian Parliament, but the QueensParliament, that did so, and caused such a revolt of feeling. throughout the Teat of Australia, that I venture to Bay it was one of the main things that contributed towards the bringing about of Federation. Public sentiment throughout Australia was that there ought to be a definite Australian attitude towards the forced Kanaka labour question. I have - met many traders from Papua'and. the South Sea Islands, and the only complaint I have heard has been that the Australian and British Governments are treating the natives too well, and will not allow traders and others to exploit them without let or hindrance. In - regard to the question of forced labour, the people of the Commonwealth have to pay taxes in order to meet the cost of constructing roads and providing transport to carry out the ordinary functions of government In Papua, there is no money amongst the population, and it is necessary that the operations of government, which are to improve the country for the betterment of the natives themselves, should be contributed to by them. There is no way in which that can be done except by a contribution of labour, which cannot' be designated as slavery, because in every case some payment is made. The payment may not be much according to our money values, but it may bo considerable in the eyes of the natives, and it is a remarkable fact that many natives who have been indentured in Papua have returned and asked for a further - period of indenture. I think these facte dispose of the contention that forced labour can be and should be dispensed with. I can see no objection to the form vernment and procedure provided for in the Bill.

92,Mr BRENNAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Batman) [3.55] This Bill brings to us one of the first bitter fruits of those four years of futile human slaughter which men call war, and whioh we were promised would make the world safe for Democracy. I should not like that this House, or my constituents, or others, should be under any misapprehension as to my view of that vaunting spirit of Imperialism which now encumbers us of go- with these dangerous and expensive Territories. I took occasion to say, before the end of the war, and' I Tepeat no\v,' that in my view nothing short of foolish ambition, inflamed by a certain amount of malice, induced the. representatives of this country to concur in that breach of faith by which the war was ended in encroachments on the territories of other nations, and seizures Of land which did not belong'to us, and which we had engaged not to take. So much by way pf introduction. There are some, of course, who will repeat today, as there were those who asserted during' and before) the war, that the control of further territories, in the Pacific was necessary to the defence of Australia. I take ths view that every movement of ours in the nature of territorial aggression which, extends our'responsibilities, whether undear s mandate or by some warlike seizure, extends also our dangers. When the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) was speaking yesterday, he referred to.those whoi n years gone by had ventured the view that even the great State of Queensland was. incapable of development or not worth developing.

There was some f a in t excuse, perhaps, even for extension of our governmental interfernp-mlation. ence in regard to Papua, but what already described as the vaunting ambiscription tion of those whoi are anxiouB to add our already huge unused mainland other .great undeveloped territories, can be in my view only-harmful and dangerous.

I am opposed to coni n any form. I am opposed to to that last remnant of conscription which we have in thsCommonwealth, by which we conscript the infants for the defence of the country under the pleasant title of "" compulsory training."" I am certainly opposed to the conscription of coloured races for the defence of any territory under the control of Australia, and therefore, whilst I am against this Bill generally and all that it ' stands for, yet, as it must become law, I have some hope that it will not be disfigured by this objectionable provision. I hope that when the Government introduce a Bill in which they promise th;it forced labour shall not be carried onunder which slavery shall cease to exist - the y will give more tangible evidence of their sincerity than is contained in this measure, seeing that it provides that forced labour may be permitted for the carrying on of essential public services at an "" adequate remuneration."" I emphasize that clause 15 actually invites the application of the policy of enforced labour to 'these Territories, and imposes slavery in the very clause that prohibits it . To sum up: It is unfortunate that honourable members should be called upon even to consider and discuss such a Bill as this. I - am against the ambitious spirit of useless Imperialism which seeks to add to our responsibilities. I am against a policy which makes the acquisition of Territories a breach of that faith which was crystallized in the immortal fourteen points of President ""Wilson. ' And I am especially against certain clauses of this Bill which seek to make slavery possible and probable, and which would make the conscription of the natives of these Territories likely in the interests of defence, war or local disturbances of the kind in contemplation should ever take place.",32
95,Dr MALONEY,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Melbourne) [4.8] Unless the clause to which the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) has just taken emphatic exception is deleted, I shall have no hesitation in opposing the Bill, or in saying that the measure is one for the institution of slavery by camouflage. We have had some experience of slavery in this country: I allude to the Kanaka blot, which once defiled the fair face of Queensland. There has been another historic instance, namely, in Western Australia. When the Imperial Government removed permission to the Western Australian authorities to lash the aborigines of that colony, the first Administration of Western Australia reenacted the Ordinance. I recall that the then Attorney-General of Western Australia, Septimus Burt, gave expression to the incomprehensible opinion that "" these poor aborigines actually liked the lash."" And I remarked, during the lifetime of that gentleman, lhat I would have liked to try the lash on him, and to ask him if he liked it. However, as all honourable members know, while that blot was reinstated, the Queensland blot was removed. I believe that I was the only member of Parliament who saw the Kanakas being taken back to their homes in the New Hebrides. Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company did every whit of their duty by those natives and by the Gommonwealth Government, and they certainly left no scope for criticism in anything that I saw. An example may be cited concerning the company's thoroughness in repatriating the Kanakas. As our vessel was travelling from island to island, disembarking little groups of natives here and there, the weather was such as to preclude the landing of one Kanaka at his own home beach. Although the captain af the ship could have landed him at a - spot 1 mile from his village, the native objected. He said, "" No, if you land me there, I will be made ' Ka Ka.' "" So, three times that ship, in the course of its journeying? fi-om island to island, returned to put that individual native ashore on the exact spot where he desired to land; and only on the third attempt did the representative of Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company succeed. When we wiped out the infamy which disgraced Queensland if and Australia, I thought that that would be the end of slavery; but I look now with great trepidation to the operation of this objectionable clause - The coloured races everywhere have been utilized with a desire to secure cheap labour. Years ago I visited Queensland in company with Mr Findley-afterward s Senator. Findley-and we had a long conversation with a gentleman who was connected with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. After talking to us for more than an hour he remarked that he considered that he had proved to me that the employment of Kanakas was not cheaper than the utilization of white men; and that the Kanakas cost as much, while white men could not do the work. He was rather startled when I remarked, "" I will go on every platform in Queensland and advocate the retention of the Kanakas, rather than their removal, if you will undertake to do one thing by your native labour."" He said, "" What is that?"" I replied, ""Give them an eight hours day, and pay them a white man's wages."" That ended the discussion. In conversation with a man in the Bundaberg district, I asked him whether he would give up sugar growing if he were precluded from employing Kanaka labour. He said, "" No blanky fear""; and he continued, "" But I have no false opinions about the value of the Kanaka. You see that youngster over there ""-pointin g to a fine stripling of an Australian youth, who appeared to be about nineteen years of age, but was only fifteen-"" I will back that boy for any wager against any Kanaka in Queensland, to cut cane, to strip it , to load and to carry it. But you. cannot blame me for preferring to employ Kanaka labour when I can get a full grown man for 5s. a - week and less, who will do a good deal of work for me, although not as much as a white man would do."" We know that the ereatest output of sugar from Queensland has been during those years since the repatriation of Kanakas, when white men have performed the labour on the sugar cane plantations. If this objectionable clause remains, I shall insist that it is nothing but an effort to reinstitute slavedom by camouflage. What is forced labour other than slavery? Honourable members know that nearly the whole of Europe, 120 years ago, was in a state of serfdom. German peasant could not move away from his home without permission. Nearly the whole of Denmark was owned by about 100 landlords. We know of the condition of the Russian serfs. There is little good that I can say of the rule of the Czars. Yet it is to their credit that they freed more than 11,000,000 slaves from the grip of the nobles, and paid them Â£300,000,000. In those days the serfs were able to save a little; but, with respect to those who had nothing, it was provided that they could claim 10 acres from any noble in Russia without payment of one penny. Even although I can Dr Maloney. only speak of the rule of the Czars with anger, and, indeed} with horror, yet their emancipation of the Russian serfs compares wonderfully well with the freeing, of the 4,000,000 slaves in the United States of America. The removal of the shackles in .Russia stands out as something higher and greater than was the awful civil war in America, which entailed the killing and wounding of close upon 1,000,000 men. Not one Russian life was involved in the freeing of the serfs. I can imagine how Wilberforce would have spoken in the House of Commons had an Imperial Government dared to introduce into any piece of legislation such a clause as that which blots the Bill now before the House. In the course of the debate allusior? has been made to the Northern Territory. That portion of Australia has never had a chance. A designing man was sent it, there in consideration'of a large income, together with a very large amount for allowance. But what did that parasite do ? He came down and remained in this part of Australia for more than eight months, drawing the while two guineas a day extra expenses, because, forsooth, he had condescended to leave his post in the Territory! How could any man hope to make the Territory pay while he - stayed here, drawing his fat income and additional expenses daily? This individual was a doctor of veterinary science, holding the highest possible diploma in that branch of scientific attainment. But in mental ability he was a child in comparison with that other doctor- a doctor of science-whos e name has also been linked with the recent history of the TerThe ritory. I refer to Dr Jensen. It was not until I made a considerable disturbance that the doctor of veterinary science was sent back to his job. I remember once telling my beloved friend-althoug h my political opponent- Mr Glynn, that the Northern Territory was rotten through and through. And now we have had this business in which Judge Bevan has been involved-Judg e Bevan, whom I would not permit to try a Newfoundland dog of mine. He is down here, drawing good money, when he ought to be sacked. The whole gang ought to be sacked, and would be if they were working men. It was decided to send a magistrate to the Northern Territory to camouflage the deeds of these men, and to whitewash them; but when a man of the calibre of Mr Justice Ewing was appointed I knew full well that there would be no camouflage work. I said to Mr Justice Ewing, in fact, "" They expect you to camouflage the Territory."" However, I knew this man as I had known his brother when he was a member of the Federal Parliament, and I knew that he could be trusted. Still, some of the members of this gang are drawing their money down here, and I ask that the same justice be meted out to them as to any ordinary individual. The defence of this country depends upon our preparations beneath the surface of the sea, and in the air. The day of the super-Dreadnought has passed. Two of our greatest admirals of the recent past, namely, Admiral Sir Percy Scott and Admiral Lord Fisher, have made known that fact in no uncertain fashion. Any honourable member who cares to read Lord Fisher's memoirs must come to the same overwhelming conclusion. In my view, the great battleship has aj)peared, for many a day past, to be ahout as helpless as the armoured men of the middle ages, when, if one of these doughty individuals tumbled off his horse, two or three other men were required to lift him back into the saddle again. We know that in the days of old, on the plains of France, the men in armour sat on their horses all night long, and. when the grey dawn arrived, they could not lift their feet out of the mud. Then the English archers, with no armour, and no arms except the bow and arrow, but quick to move, attack, or retreat if need be, shot them down in their uselessness. As the honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan) truly said, population is our greatest defence: but, as a matter of fact, the Australian baby is regarded as almost a prohibited immigrant. Landlords and landladies, who go to church on Sunday and mouth their false-hearted prayers, always ask a prospective tenant if there are any children, and, if there are, they refuse to let their houses. agents, too, have to carry out the behests of these parasites. I have always been agaiust landlordism, and I am stronger against it today than I was thirty years ago when I first entered politics. In this connection I have always tried to set an example. At one time. I owned about thirty houses, but I have made all the tenants owners, and now I have but one house. Every honourable member will agree that the Australian babe is the best immigrant we can have; but in every city of Australia today we find the same abominations, the-same un-Christ-like attitude, on the part of landlords. There is one case to which I could refer, and in regard to which I have to thank you, sir, on behalf of many people outside, for the action you took. Could greater scope for a dictator be given than in a mandate government by regulation? During the war the Defence Department ground out laws like sausages. These were called regulations; but if, under a regulation, a man may be fined or imprisoned, that regulation is really a law. While we may look on this century as, perhaps, the century in which more seeds of human love are being planted than in any preceding century, I view with much trepidation that clause in the Bill which has to do with the forced labour of the natives; and I shall vote for an amendment, which I understand will be moved, and which I hope the Government will accept. I know that the majority of honourable members quite agree with what I am saying at the present moment, but actions speak louder than words, and have more weight than long, and sometimes unintelligent, prayers; and I ask all to vote for the elimination of the offensive words to which I refer.",33
96,Mr MAXWELL,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,They are not dealt with in the amendment before us.,35
97,Dr MALONEY,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"I hope they will be dealt with in another amendment, but if provision is made for adequate remuneration, based on white men's hours and white men's wages, the ground of much of my criticism will be removed.",35
98,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"West Sydney) [4.23] - I rise to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Tudor). The amendment is that the Bill The land shall be withdrawn for the purpose of having it redrafted, so as to provide for parliamentary government of these Pacific Islands under the terms of the mandate rather than government by the Executive of the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Yarra has made his point very clear. He wishes to have the government carried on by Parliament instead of by the Executive. As I understand the Bill , it is a kind of War Precautions measure; it is certainly on the same principle, because it gives complete power to the Governor General in Council. That means that the honourable gentlemen who occupy the f r o nt Treasury bench will have absolute power to legislate, by means of Ordinances, exactly as they think fit in the government of the Territories. We are told that Parliament has the right to approve or disapprove of any Ordinance that may be passed by the Governor General in Counc i l ; but we know from experience that it is almost impossible, though a m a j o r it y of the Parliament may be in favour of disallowing any particular Ordinance, to have it even discussed, if the Ministry are unwilling that it should be discussed. We have had an example of this in the. last six weeks. Nearly three months ago, I think, I gave notice that I proposed, on a certain regulation being tabled under the War Precautions Act. to move that it be disallowed. The regulation was laid on the table, but my motion has been put at the bottom of the business-paper, with no chance of being discussed. Y e t we are told that Parliament wil l have control over the regulations made under this Bill .",35
99,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Parliamen t tainly has control.,36
100,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,That is not so; we are not even given an opportunity to place before members reasons why any regulation of the sort should be disallowed.,36
101,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,You mean that ypu cannot control Parliament.,36
102,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"No , I do not mean that. If there is any foundation for the position taken up with regard to the government of these islands-if ttie control of Parliaiment still remains-wh y not make all laws in the same expeditious manner ? I have no doubt that the Treasurer would like to do that; at any rate, he has been governing Australia in that way for four years or more. It is one thing to have a proposal brought forward, initiated in Parliament, and discussed and approved by Parliament, and another thing to allow an Ordinance to be made by a Cabinet in secret conclave, with the proviso that Parliament may disallow the regulation or Ordinance under certain conditions, which, however, it is almost impossible to comply with .",36
103,Mr WEST,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"In ten years' experience of Parliament, I have never known a regulation disallowed.",36
104,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,We a ll know what happens. The Treasurer gave his case away when he admitted by interjection to me that the proposal in the Bill with regard to the issuing of Ordinances was of the same nature as the power to make regulations under the W a r Precautions Act . The Treasurer frankly admits that ; he makes no secret of it . I have no apology to make for supporting the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition.,36
105,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"The authority for issuing Ordinances is in this Bill , which Parliament is asked to approve of.",36
106,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"And the Leader of the Opposition, quite rightly, does not desire Parliament to approve; he does not wish to hand over to the Government absolute power to make laws for the government of these Territories, but to retain that right to Parliament. That is the proper attitude, and we should not delegate our authority in this respect to the Executive of the Government of the day.",36
107,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,We do it elsewhere.,36
108,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,It has been done during the war under the War Precautions Act.,36
109,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"No , s i r ; before the war. cer- Mr Ryan - And we know the great dissatisfaction that has arisen out of the exercise of the power. I shall do all I can to prevent the continuation of this form of government, which is a negation of parliamentary government.",36
110,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"I should not expect that from the honourable member, because he will find, if he looks back, that it was the Labour Government which began this for m of government.",36
111,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,We have heard all that.,36
112,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,I am not now talking about the W a r Precautions Act.,36
113,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Do you think it is a good principle of government?,36
114,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,There are other forms of government in which this principle of Ordinances has been applied.,36
115,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"I am not concerned with who initiated this principle. I am satisfied that if the right honourable gentleman will discuss the matter, I can show him that he is entirely wrong, and is - misrepresenting the position of Labour, as he often does. Whoever initiated such a system, it is one that Parliament should not approve of. Sir JosEP-ir COOK - It is in the measure that was quoted this afternoon; but that was quietly left out, of course.",36
116,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"If the right honourable gentleman will take an opportunity to speak on this proposed amendment we shall see exactly what his contentionis. . It is one thing to hand over the whole power of legislating, as proposed by the Bill, to the Executive, and another thing to give power to the Executive to make regulations to carry out the purposes of a particular measure. In the latter case Parliament lays down the general principle, and the only power left to the Executive is to make regulations for carrying out that principle.",37
117,Mr WEST,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,In accordance with the Act.,37
118,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,In accordance with the Act. .,37
119,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Is it suggested that the regulations under this Bill will be inconsistent with the Bill?',37
120,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,It is suggested that the Government have no restrictions placed on them with regard to the regulations they may make for the government of this Possession.,37
121,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,I think the honourable member will find that there are several important restrictions.,37
122,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"I have gone through the Bill very carefully, and I find it proposes to give to the Executive Government a power as wide as this Parliament has in many respects. That is not a usual - thing at all, and we should see to it that this Parliament does not give to the Government a continuation of the type of power they have possessed dtiring the last four or five years. We have had experience of their dealing with Nauru Island, for example; we know that they have made payments for this island without the authority of Parliament, and the Treasurer has never taken the trouble to explain why these payments were made. Then, the Executive have included Ocean Island in the agreement, and, furthermore, have paid for it, without the authority of Parliament.",37
123,Mr MAKIN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,On e million four hundred and seventy thousand pounds.,37
124,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Yes , and tens of thousands of pounds were paid by the owners of these places by way of bonuses to their directors. It must have been a very good - thing. I , for one, am not prepared to place in the hands of this or any other Government the power to make deals of that kind without reference to Parliament. Are we to hand over in this way the control of what we are told are very rich Possessions that can be made the exploiting ground of a few, rather than the happy home of many? That is probably what will happen. I do not want to enter upon a discussion of the whole policy with regard to the Pacific Islands, except to say that if the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) had had their way at the Peace Conference, we would not now' have been discussing mandates.",37
125,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,What is that?,37
126,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,The right honourable gentleman stood for complete annexation.,37
127,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,I did not.,37
128,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Did not the Prime Minister stand for complete annexation?,37
129,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,What did the Lahour party stand for?,37
130,Mr BATXET,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,You stood for peace at any price.,37
131,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,No . My honourable friends opposite do not wish to be reminded of the attitude taken up by the Government which they are supporting. Does the Treasurer deny that the Prime Minister at the Peace Conference stood for complete annexation?,37
132,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,The honourable member had better ask him.,37
133,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,He is not here. If we can go upon the press reports-and we have no reason to doubt them-the Prime Minister at the Peace Conference stood for the complete annexation of the islands north of the equator by Japan.,37
134,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Never .,37
135,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,And for complete annexation by Australia of the islands south of the equator.,37
136,Mr MCDONALD,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,They agreed to that.,37
137,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"And they pressed for it. If they had had their way Japan would have had complete possession and control of the Marshall and Caroline Islands, and could have done what it pleased with them. The Labour party stood for the international control of these Possessions on the lines of the League of Nations.",37
138,Mr HECTOB LAMOSD,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"The piece of treachery to a ""White Australia ever put forward in this country!",38
139,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"I can afford to ignore the interjection and the interjector, because it is well known that the Labour party stood always for the international control of these Possessions on the lines of the League of Nations.",38
140,Mr MASSYGREENE,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Firs t of all it stood for no annexations and no indemnities.,38
141,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"We stood for the international control of these Possessions. That is the position which obtains today, and Australia holds a'mandate in regard to them. I have heard a lot of talk as to "" no annexations and no indemnities,"" but no resolution to that effect was ever passed by a Labour Conference. indemnities"" is quite a different thing from ""no penal indemnities."" The Prime Minister and the Treasurer need to be reminded that at the Peace Conference they did not stand for what was in the best interests of Australia. No one will deny that our White Australia policy would have been seriously menaced if Japan had been given complete ownership and control of the Caroline and Marshall Islands.",38
142,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,I did not stand for that.,38
143,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,The Prime Minister did. I hear today for the first time that the Treasurer did not stand for it .,38
144,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,The member was not a member of this House when I spoke here and said quite the contrary.,38
145,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"I was much closer to the actual scene of operations, and I know that, in the reports which came from the Conference at the time, it was clearly stated-it was clearly reported in the press-that Australia was standing for complete annexation by Japan of the islands north of the equator, and by Australia of the islands south of the equator.",38
146,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,No .,38
147,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"It is not very difficult ascertain the truth of what I am saying. We have to take the position as it is. This. mandate has not yet been issued. We do not know what will be its terms; but we can at least stand for the maintenance of parliamentary control so fa r as the government of these Possessions is conbasest cerned. The Labour party, stands for that. The Treasurer says that we have not asked for that. It is not a question as to the manner in which the proposition of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Tudor) is submitted, but rather as to whether that proposition is right or wrong. In my opinion, it is right, and it is extraordinary that neither the Treasurer nor any other member of the Cabinet has seen fit to give the reasons why the Government will not accept the eminently reasonable proposal put forward by the honourable gentleman. We do not w sh, and I am sure the people ; of Australia do not, that the Executive Government of Australia should be handed over the complete power that it is proposed to give them under this Bill . The wish of the people is that it should "" No rest with their elected representatives. For my own part, I think it will be a very long time before the revenue from these islands will meet the cost of administration. While Germany held them, she was falling behind to the extent of Â£60,000 per year.",38
148,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Sixt y thousand pounds per year was, I think, the loss in respect of all the Pacific Islands held by Germany.",38
149,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Yes , including Samoa, which was the best revenue producer Germany had. We have no mandate over Samoa. New Zealand has that Possession, so that our position is all the worse, so far as the islands over which we have a honourable mandate is concerned.",38
150,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"But that was three or four years ago. I think th,Â© position has since improved.",38
151,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"I have mentioned the fact only to show that, so far as the cost of administering these islands is concerned, Australia will probably be out of pocket, and therefore it is ail the more necessary that the Parliament itself should have direct control over their government. We should not allow them to be made the exploiting ground of a few people, as they can be if Ordinances to are passed at the suggestion of certain individuals outside. It is 'possible that, i u such circumstances, they may become large revenue producers for private exploiters, and at the same time be great exploiters of the revenue of the Commonwealth. For the reasons which I have stated, as well as on the grounds which the Leader of the Opposition put before the House, I strongly support the amendment which has been so capably moved by him.",38
152,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"ParramattaTreasurer) [4.43] - The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) has criticised this Bill from several standpoints. Like his leader (Mr Tudor) , he thinks that it has not one good feature. He asks that it should be taken back and redrafted to suit some whim or purposes of his own.",39
153,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Where does the honourable member get that information?, It is not in the amendment.",39
154,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"It really is in the amendment. One might inquire in - the first place what complete form of government would satisfy the honourable member? He asks that we should take back the Bill , and redraft it to provide for the complete government of these Territories by the Australian Parliament.",39

156,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"What would be the honourable member's idea' as to the ""complete government"" islands? Fortunately for us, he has told us.",39
157,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Parliamentar y ment.,39
158,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"No ; the honourable member's idea is that this Parliament should not govern them at all. His view is that some international body should govern them. What does "" international c o n t r o l ' ' mean ?",39
159,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Is f i is not international government of the islands under a mandatory power?,39
160,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Certainl y not. When the honourable member insisted that 'these islands should be under international control did he mean this form of government by mandate? answer that question ?,39
161,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,G o on; misrepresent.,39
162,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"I put that question to the honourable member. I ask him what he means by "" international control"" ?",39
163,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,I have told the right honourable member.,39
164,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Does he mean control by mandate? Does he mean control by Australia? What does he mean by ""international control""? I venture to say that any form of direct international control over these islands would do away in one act with any chance of a White Australia. Does not the honourable member know what took place at the Peace Conference? Does he not know what took place in the League of Nations ? Does he not know that the policy of a White Australia has hot many friends up and down the world ? Does he not know that the other nations do not understand at all our point of view with regard to the question of a White Australia? And it is into the hands of these people, including those who are diametrically and deadly otmosed to a White Australia, that he would give the government of these islands.",39
165,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"No j that is the right honourable gentleman's misrepresentation. Sir JOSE PH COOK - It is not. There is no misrepresentation. International government of these islands, through the League of Nations, means that every signatory to the Peace Treaty and to the Covenant should have an equal voice in their government. It means that or nothing at all.",39
166,Mr LAZZARINI,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"How would that afof these fect the Australian mainland, so fa r as the White Australia policy is concerned?",39
167,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"If the governgovern- ment of these islands were put under international control the first thing that would happen is that we would have an open door for both men and goods. That is the first thing that would happen. And I say that this land is not safe when there are unrestricted opportunities to crowd the coloured races of the world into the back yard of Australia. That is all I have to say as to that matter. That is what I mean by a policy of a White Australia-that our policy shall not be menaced by the occupation of these surrounding; islands by people who have no sympathy with our ideals and objectives. Will he I hold, therefore, that any proposals coming from my honourable friend (Mr. Ryan), and those who believe in international control, must be looked at askance. To begin with, we doubt their bona fides.",39
168,Mr MCDONALD,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,You always did. Sir JOSE PH COOK - Yes ; any man who wants international control of these islands is no friend of a White Australia. There is no control by the League of Nations.,39
169,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,None ? W hy have we to report ?,40
170,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"No ; the control is given to Australia in the terms of the mandate. The Peace Treaty provides in effect that, so long as we take good care of the natives, eovern the islands first of all in the interests of the natives, see that they are not oppressed, and that the islands are not occupied by any armed force which will menace their in tegrity, or that of those immediately surrounding them, we may look after them just as we look after our other Territories. The Covenant on the face of it says, "" We do not want international control; we prefer to let you control the Territory since you know all about it , and we know nothing.""",40
171,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Does that also apply to Japan and the Caroline and Marshall Islands? Can we not enter those islands and inspect them in order to see what the Japanese are doing ?,40
172,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,The honourable member cannot go in today and inspect those islands.,40
173,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Why not?,40
174,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Because he is not allowed to do so. As regards this talk about the Caroline and Marshall Islands, all I have to say is that it was a matter of great regret to me when I learned that anything had happened to them, because I had the great honour and privilege of running up the Flag at the beginning of the war.",40
175,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,But did not your Government make the arrangement to allow Japan to have them? Sir JOSE PH COOK - Our Government made no such arrangement. I defy the honourable member to find at it t le of proof for that assertion.,40
176,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Did not the right honort able gentleman know of the Treaty that was made in reference to them ?,40
177,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,I took no part in it .,40
178,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Then who did? Sir JOSE PH COOK - Le t the honourable member ask some of his colleagues. They know a great deal more about it than I do. I was in Opposition at the time, and had no part or lot in the matter. I had nothing to do with the Government at that time.",40
179,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,I think it was the present Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) who made the arrangement.,40
180,Sir ROBERT BEST,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,At that time he was the colleague of the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor).,40
181,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Yes , but it was not done with my knowledge or consent. Sir - JOSEPH COOK - Revertin g to the amendment, the honourable member wishes to provide for completer government of the Territories by the Australian Parliament. First of all, he begins by saying that his party have always stood for no government of these islands by Australia.",40
182,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,That is not correct.,40
183,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Yes . The honourable member advocated international control.,40
184,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"I said nothing about international control. Sir JOSE PH COOK - I am not referring to the Leader of the Opposition; I am referring to the Campaign Director (Mr R y a n ) , who said all over Australia that the Labour party wanted international control of these islands. He has repeated it today. He says that the party has always stood for it . Does the Leader of the Opposition now say that he is opposed to the attitude of the party in regard to this matter ? Does he stand alone as - the one stalwart against his party?",40
185,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,The r i g h t honourable gentleman is misrepresenting the situation. I claim that control by the League of Nations is international control.,40
186,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"I rather think the honourable member for West Sydney is back-pedalling a little. When he uses words he either knows what he means, or does not. I think he does, and, therefore, when he tells the House that he does not think A u s t r i a ought to have a mandate-and he said that in the counr y over and over again-that he did not believe we ought to have a mandate .",40
187,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,I did not say that.,40
188,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,And that there should be a for m of international control over the islands,40
189,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,I did not say that.,40
190,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"I take it that, in these circumstances, he is not a pood critic of what is contained in this Bill . The postulate here is that there is to be a mandate, and Australian control by an Australian Government; and on that plane we ought to begin, leaving outside all irrelevant questions as to international control. From one extreme, honourable members opposite swing to the other. all some other nations, possibly unfriendly, are to guard our snores and see that our White Australia is not impugned ; and when that objection is overcome they say, "" Y o u must have a completer form of government than you are providing for here.""",40
191,Mr EYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Yes , government by Parliament.",41
192,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"If the honourable member would define what he meani, by government by Parliament, we should get to much closer grips.",41
193,Mr EYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Australi a certainly has not known it for the last few years.,41
194,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,The honourable .member means that Queensland has not.,41
195,Mr EYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Misrepresentin g again.,41
196,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"I believe that the honourable member's remark is absolutely correct as applying to the northern State; hence their troubles there. We are told that we must withdraw the Bill to provide for complete government by the Australian Parliament under the terms of the mandate. In other words, before the mandate is delivered, we must haye a complete form of government under it. Is not such a claim a little consistent ? Is it possible to have a plete form of government under a mandate before it has been delivered? honourable member for West Sydney must see how absurdly the amendment has been drawn. It is absurd enough for the honourable member himself to have drafted it. However, I want to say that, just viow, the position is rather delicate and difficult, and the honourable member and his leader would serve the best interests of Australia far better by not insisting on doing something which is impossible, and which would not be tolerated by the League of Nations; and which, moreover, if its effect had been known before, would have had the tendency to prevent the mandate from coming here.",41
197,Mr EYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,We have been accustomed to that sort of humbug for years now.,41
198,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"The honourable member is a good judge of humbug. The amendment asks us to provide that "" the laws of the Commonwealth shall apply to the Territory unless specifically exempted by the Parliament."" How are we to apply the laws of a White Australia to First of a black population?",41
199,Mr EYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"So you are going to allow the "" open door "" against which you have railed so much ?",41
200,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"A m I? All right! I stand for a White Australia, and will take all sorts of good care that we do not prevent the possibility of maintaining it here by any such foolish statements as those to which the honourable member has given utterance. As to the question of making laws, honourable members would imagine that we had done something quite unusual in providing for theadmin istration of this Territory; but let me remind the Leader of the Opposition that, if we are going wrong now, it is only through following the example set by his party when they were in office. Somehow or other, the one object in life of the honourable member for West Sydney seems ""to he ito denounce everything that his party has done. They may always have been wrong; but if the honourable member is right now, he has always been wrong in the past, because he was part of a great party which used almost identical language in legislation reinlating to other Territories we are now com- governing. For instance, the provision relating to Ordinances which applies in . The the Northern Territory is exactly the same as that in this Bill.",41
201,Mr EYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Are not specific Acts of Parliament applied in the Northern Territory measure?,41
202,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"If the honourable member will listen, he will learn something. iSection 13 of the Northern Territory (Administration) Act passed by the Labour party saysUntil the Parliament makes other provision for the government of the Territory This is white Territory, and the laws applying there and the laws which run there do not apply to bladesthe Governor General may make Ordinanceshaving the force of law in the Territory. Now the honourable member is blaming us because we propose to apply to black people the very language which his party applied to the government of white people. Could inconsistency go further?",41
203,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,It is a gross misrepresen-. tation of the situation. The Act which the honourable member is quoting applies specific Commonwealth measures to the Northern Territory.,42
204,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Agai n the honourable member is wrong. Section 13 proceeds(2) Every such Ordinance shall(a) be notified in the Gazette; (6) take effect from the date of notification, or from a later date, to fied in the Ordinance; (c) be laid before both Houses of the Parliament within fourteen days of the making thereof; or, if the Parliament is not then sitting, within fourteen days after the next meeting of the Parliament. (3) If either House of the Parliament passes a resolution, of which notice has been given at any time within fifteen sitting days after any such Ordinance has been laid before the House, disallowing the Ordinance, the Ordinance shall thereupon cease to have effect. This is the - provision which the honourable member's party put on the statute book for the government of white people, and it is followed exactly in the wording of the provisions relating to Ordinances in the Bill before ua today. Now let me refer the honourable member to the Papua Aot. I do not know who passed that measure.",42
205,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"It was ithe Deakin Government, in 1905. i Sir JOSEPH OOOK - Yes ; when the .Labour party supported them.",42
206,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,No ; the Deakin Government had a majority of their own at that time.,42
207,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Mr Deakin never had a majority. He governed by the good graces of Mr J. C. Watson and his noble band of followers, which included the honourable member for Yarra. Section 7 of the Papua Act saysExcept as provided in this or any Act, the Acts of the Parliament of the Commonwealth shall not be in force in the Territory unless expressed to extend thereto. In every Territorial measure exactly the same provision is found; but now it seems to he all wrong.",42
208,Mr WATKINS,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Then put it right.,42
209,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Does the honand withdraw the remark. orahle member think that so much nor'se ought to be made about our doing what we have done,- when we are evidently endeavouring to follow the footsteps of honourable members opposite? We are told they axe the only "" true blues,"" the only true Democrats, who stand for safe government, yet the moment we attempt to imitate them in a single clause they fulminate in this way, and say, "" Everything is wrong. Take it back, and bring in something else."" I suggest that, as we have to wait for this mandate, the Bill before us meets the situation very fairly.",42
210,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"The Treasurer might be speciread paragraph 10 of section 41 of the Papua Act of 1905, in which Parliament deliberately applied the White Australia policy to that Territory.",42
211,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,May I point to this difference-that under the Papua Act the Lieutenant-Governor himself makes the Ordinances. Under this Bill the Governor General will make them through the Executive Government and through this Parliament. In Papua the' Lieutenant-Governor makes the Ordinances without reference to this Parliament or any one else.,42
212,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,There is the Legislative Council.,42

215,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H, Order! ',42
216,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"The Treasurer might try to be fair. He said that the Lieutenant Governor made the Ordinances without consulting anybody. When I pointed out that he had to consult a Legislative Council, the Treasurer misrepresented me. These are gutter tactics.",42
217,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Order ! I ask the honourable member to withdraw that expression.,42
218,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,I withdraw and apologize to the gutter.,42
219,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"I hope the honourable member will recognise what he owes to his position in the House, Mr TrnoR - I apologize.",42
220,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"The honourable member need not get so angry. I was pointing out the fundamental distinction between the Act which his Government passed and the Bill now before the House. This measure represents a completer control by Parliament than did the Papua Act passed by a Labour Government. When the honourable member tells me that the Lieutenant-Governor could make Ordinances only with the consent of the Legislative Council, I say again that the Legislative Council was shaped, controlled,, and elected by the Lieutenant-Governor of the Territory himself. This Bill aims at the creation of some simple machinery, tentative in the very nature of things. When we receive our mandate, and the reports as to the possibilities of the Territory, there must be completer legislation than is provided for in this Bill. The consideration for the moment is to set up machinery .in the meantime, and to get the administration in operation as a going concern. Afterwards, when the mandate is delivered to us, and in the light of the full knowledge we shall have obtained as the result of the investigations which are being made, whatever is required for completer government and control by Parliament can be provided. The Prime Minister told the House yesterday that investigations are proceeding. Information is being obtained on which to base a completer form of government, but the Leader of the Opposition asks us to withdraw the Bill, and tells us that he will have nothing to do with it unless we at once bring down a measure for a complete form of government, even before the mandate is received. Nothing will tend more to cripple our mandate, or even jeopardize its receipt, than a proposal such as has been suggested by honourable members opposite. I beg of them not to press this amendment to a division, but to leave the situation to be cleared up after we have obtained our mandate.",42
221,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,I will have a division if even only one member will support me.,43
222,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"I am sure the honourable member will; he is very angry this afternoon. It is time to point out that there is a little inconsistency in asseverations by honourable members opposite, who have only discovered a democratic language in relation to these Terri-. tories since the whole position has been made comparatively secure. While the question was in the balance, and we on this side were putting up the fight of our lives in order to get control of the backyards of Australia, and so be able to shield our White Australia policy, honourable members opposite were ridiculing our every effort; they were saying that Australia did not desire to fight for those lands, which were miserable clods of earth not worth fighting for; they were insisting that the islands were no good to us, and that we should not shed our blood for them, but should leave them to some form of international control, to government by some other people. Had we done that, they could have brought forward these proposals to their heart's content ; they would have meant nothing.",43
223,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Why does not the Treasurer tell the truth?,43
224,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Order !,43
225,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Because the honourable member has a monopoly of it , I suppose.",43
226,Mr GABB,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,The Treasurer has Ananias's share of the truth.,43
227,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,The honourable member knows all about Ananias.,43

231,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,I suppose that remark will be allowed to pass.,43
232,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"If the Treasurer applied that remark to any honourable member it is out of order, of course.",43

237,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,The honthese of able member is not in order in continually interjecting.,43
238,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,I have no wish to quarrel with the honourable member. I ask the House not to agree to this amendment. Nothing would strike a greater blow at Australian interests than to do such a thing as is suggested in the proposal by the Leader of the Opposition.  [5.14] - The Treasurer would have the House believe that he and his party have always been strong advocates of the principle of a White Australia. Listening to him one would think that only he and his party have been the champions of that policy.,43

243,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"We have all read that. I hope you have something newer. so.  to put an extract into Hansard so that the public, too, may read it . As an indication of how anxious the Government were to preserve the White Australia policy, the honourable member for Perth tells usMr Hughes blundered very seriously in his handling of the Pacific Islands question. In characteristic fashion, and with an utter disregard of the delicacy and gravity of the situation, he put every consideration aside to pose as the champion of Australia against a menacing move.by a potential enemy. It was only a pose, but the temptation to strut before the world in pasteboard sword and armour could not be resisted by the gentleman who had, in an earlier stage of his career, tTod the boards of the theatre as a super. This time he was thu "" heavy lead,"" and could get well into the limelight. Japan had made a hostile move against Australia, said Mr Hughes, in effect, if not in as many words; but he would save the situation. He demanded that Australia should have absolute ownership of all the late possessions of Germany up to the Equator. Had the claim been allowed, then the same concession would have had to be made to Japan in respect of those islands she had captured north of the Equator. Given the ownership, it is a certainty that the Japanese would have proceeded to fortify the islands, which would have necessitated similar precautions on the part of Australia. Can any one say how and where this would have ended? Apart from the provocation to warfare embodied in such hostile preparations, it meant, for the small community of Australia, an effort she .could hardly afford, in providing warships and munitions for the setting up of an armed imperialism of our own in the Pacific. In: this matter the Peace Conference saved Australia-fro m Mr Hughes. When similar statements are made by honourable members on this side, Government supporters object to them as being partisan. I have quoted a statement of a friendly critic on the Government side.",44
244,Mr ATKINSON,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Ver y friendly!  critic who saves the Government whenever they are in a desperate position. On this question, at any rate, he expressed the Australian view-point. He spoke, at all events, as a friend of the White Australia policy.",44
245,Mr ATKINSON,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Does the honourable member say that the Prime Minister urged that Japan should have the Marshall Islands? ,44
246,Mr ATKINSON,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"That quotation dors not say so.  bract says that the Prime Minister advocated that Japan, should have all the islands north of the equator.",45
247,Mr ATKINSON,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"The Prime Minister probably desired, rather, the whole of the islands, but found that he could not get those above the equator.  Prime Minister stood for the policy or complete annexation, and when the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr . Ryan) stated, in effect, just what is contained in this extract, he was accused by the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) of having made a partisan statement. Side by side with it , however, is this statement by a supporter, if not a friend-a n effective supporter, if not a docile one-of the Prime Minister. As a matter of fact, what was done at the Peace Conference followed absolutely along the lines of the Australian Labour manifesto. The Treasurer knows that, but it was convenient for him to misrepresent the facts, as he usually does. I emphatically assert that what was done by the Peace Conference was based upon the principles asserted in the Australian Labour manifesto.",45
248,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Will the hon- Groom, L. E. orable member read the exact wording of those resolutions t  orable member is as familiar with them as I am, and he knows that what I have said is correct. When the Treasurer lectured this House - concerning the White Australia policy, one would naturally be led to believe that the policy of the Government was similar to the principles laid down at the Peace Conference; but such is not the fact. The policy agreed upon at the Peace Conference was the very^ opposite from that which the Prime Minister had advocated there. That is the crucial point, which, however, the Treasurer sought to cover up. He would have this country believe that the Government have been standing for the principle of a White Australia. But the Government are really opposed to that principle, so far , at any rate, as these Island Possessions are concerned. The advocacy of the Prime Minister at the Peace Conference was diametrically opposed to the policy of a White Australia. The key to the back door of Australia . was sought to be handed over to Japan by the Prime Minister of Australia, whose word, fortunately, was not accepted by the Peace Conference. W h at the Prime Minister said at the Conference was based on the policv of his Government, which policy is opposed to the principle of a White Australia.

What power is there to declare this territory under the authority of the Commonwealth? I do not know whether,- as in the case of New Zealand, the Government are proceeding under the authority of the Foreign Jurisdictions Act, or, as in the case of South Africa , under the authority of the League of Nations. The Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) was not clear on the point.",46
254,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"ParramattaTreasurer) [5.37] - The declaration cannot be under the authority of the League of Nations; all the authority we shall get from the League will be in the mandate. This clause is under the general authority of the Peace Treaty, which contains the terms of the mandate that we are to possess. The Peace Treaty denationalized the German form of government, or, shall I say, dispossessed the Germans of the sovereignty of the islands. The sovereignty, therefore, is at large, and somebody must assume it . We propose to do so under this Bill . Clause agreed to. Clause 5 agreed to. Clause 6 (Office of Administrator).",46

We have fixed the salary of the Lieutenant-Governor of Papua, and also the salary of the Administrator of the Northern Territory.

That has not - I been fixed, nor, so far as I am aware, has the appointment of any particular person been contemplated.

What kind of man we shall get, or what the salary will be, I do not now know, but I hope to make honourable members acquainted with the proposals of the Government in this respect later on. The whole position is tentative at present. As honourable members see, clause 8 sets out the nature of the A d ministrator's functions, the tenor of them, as well, I should say, as the tenure.",46

When the mandate arrives the whole position, of course, imay be reviewed, and we mav be given some clear understand-, ing of what the Administrator will have to do, and what are the difficulties in the way of bringing the whole under one official.",47
263,Mr BAMFORD,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Herbert) [ 5 . 4 4 ] hope that the Government will appoint as Administrator a man who is a sympathetic Australian.,47
264,Mr MCGRATH,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Not necessarily general ?,47
265,Mr BAMFORD,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Not necessarily any person. What is required is a man of considerable Australian experience and wide views. My reason for this suggestion is that Northern Queensland, principally Cooktown, has been mainly responsible for the opening of the mining fields of New Guinea, and those concerned in the work have been considerably embarrassed, not to say hampered, by some who were able to interfere with their progress. I am told by men who have been to G e New Guinea that in that Possession there are supposed to be areas which contain gold in payable quantities. The German Government were not sympathetic to prospecting, and were opposed to the Australian prospector, and they imposed such conditions as made it impossible for any Australian to do prospecting. I believe that the licence cost Â£ 1 0 , and a royalty was demanded of, I .should say, 10 per cent, on the gold recovered. This made prospecting so costly, in view of 'the further fact that carriers had to be employed to carry food, tools, and so forth, that practically no prospecting was done. The A d ministrator under the Australian Government ought to be one who will give Australian prospectors every possible support and help in developing what are supposed to be valuable gold-bearing areas. I understand that the waters that flow from the Stanley Ranges towards the north-east coast traverse regions in which quartz reefs are known to exist; and I hope the Government will bear my suggestion in mind.",47
266,Mr FENTON,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Maribyrnong) [5.47]. - I support the suggestion made by the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr . Hector Lamond). This is a tentative measure, and I presume that is the reason the Administrator is to hold office only "" during the pleasure of the Governor General."" At any rate, it is clear that any appointment made now may be terminated at the will of the Government, and some' new man appointed. During the initia l stages of the administration of the Territory I see no reason why the present Lieutenant-Governor of Papua should not preside over the destinies of - I both areas. It does not-seem to be quite realized by some that the Dutch hold about half of the New Guinea lands, and we do not know whether they will enter a sympathetically into an administration of an up-to-date, white-Australian character - However that may be, I think that in the meantime the present Lieutenant-Governor of Papua might suffice. If a permanent appointment is not now to be made, I think it would be wise to allow the Lieutenant-Governor of Papua to act in the meantime.",47
267,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"ParramattaTreasurer) [5.51] - I should not like to say that the man to be immediately appointed to this position will necessarily r m a n have to vacate it later on. I should think that if he does well in this sphere he will go up to the higher one. If he does good work, I think that his services will be retained.",47
268,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,The government of the Territory will be under the provisions of the mandate.,47
269,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Quite so, but the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) has been referring to the person to be appointed as Administrator of the Territory. There are several reasons why the government of Papua and that of the new Territory should be kept distinct. We shall be governing these particular islands in relation to the mandate of the League of Nations.",47
270,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,The League of Nations is an international body 1,48
271,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Yes . We must, therefore, keep the government of them quite distinct from the administration of our own Territory. The honourable member for Maribyrnong must recognise that we shall not have over these Islands quite the same control that we have over our own. Everything that we do in relation to them will be as trustee of the League of Nations, to which we shall have toaccount.",48
272,Mr FENTON,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Would not the Lieuten* ant-Governor of Papua be the best man to take uÂ£> the temporary administration of these Territories?,48
273,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"I think it would not be wise to mix up the two.

277,Mr GROOM,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,This will be an administrative appointment.,48
278,Mr TUDOR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Quite ) so. I presume that the position will be similar to that occupied by Mr Staniforth Simith as A d ministrator of the Northern Territory, and Judge Murray as Administrator of Papua. The use of the words "" until Parliament otherwise provides "" suggests that this legislation is of only a tentative character, and that when we have received a mandate from the League of Nations permanent legislation dealing with the administration of these islands will be introduced.",48

There cannot be anything else until we settle down in some sort of permanent relationship to the islands under the mandate.

The proposal, apparently, is ithat the appointment of all officers for their administration shall be a matter of Government patronage. The Bill does not make any provision to enable the country to test the merits of any particular officer, and there is no proposal for applying to these mandated Territories those safeguards which are enjoyed in the Commonwealth under the Public Service Act. I realise that the whole scheme is, as stated, of a .more *or less tentative character, but I do not wish to be taken as acquiescing in the proposal that Government patronage, which provides no test for the efficiency of the officers to be appointed for the staffing and administration of .these Territories, shall be permitted.",48

When we took over the Administration of Papua, I urged the then Minister for External Affairs to appoint to the administrative staff those men who had been acclimatized in North Queensland, and who were of ripe experience. We have in the northern part of Queensland men who are inured to all sorts of hardships, and are thoroughly acclimatized. In choosing officers for New Guinea the Government should make a selection from them. They are available, and competent for the work. not Nearly every man selected for duty in Papua came from Victoria, and the result was painful. In one case brought under my notice a man returned to Australia a mental wreck, owing to the climatic conditions, to which he was quite unaccustomed. Another man who returned committed suicide. They were both very - good men, well qualified to do the work they were called upon to perform, bu t they were not used to a tropical climate. When selections are being made to fill posts in the Territory, I hope the Admin istrator will be advised to take men from the north-west of Australia, northern Queensland, or the Northern Territory, men who are thoroughly accustomed to tropical conditions, and are quite as able to do the work required of them men in the southern States.",49

In regard to the White Australia policy, he saysTihe subject of a Wlhite Australia in connection with the Conference bas been dealt with by Mr Hughes in some detail. It may be interesting, in the first place, to explain how the matter arose. The Japanese delegates formulated a demand for the recognition of the principle of racial equality in the Covenant of the League of Nations. At the time when this question was 'first raised by the Japanese delegates in (Paris, the Covenant of the League of Nations was under discussion by the Commission on the League of Nations. President Wilson was chairman of this Commission, and the representatives of the British Empire were Lord Robert Cecil and General Smuts. Before bringing their amendment before the Commission, the Japanese representativeswho, as the result showed, were very skilful diplomats-endeavoure d to enlist support and to remove obstacles in as many quarters as possible. They interviewed all the representatives of other nations on the Commission of the League of Nations. When the amendment was put to the Commission of the League it was carriedby 11 votes to 7. (.This announcement has been made in the press.) President Wilson took the responsibility of ruling that it was not carried, declaring that any amendment of the draft of the Covenant then before the Commission could only be made by a unanimous vote. But there was still another stage. It was open to Japan to move the amendment at the Peace Conference itself. If this had been done, the position would have been very serious. It was not done. Baron Makino confined himself to a protest,, delivered in dignified and weighty language. How it came about that the Japanese representatives adopted bhis course, instead of moving the amendment in a Conference which they had reason to believe would have supported their claim, is one of the interesting stories of the Conference which higher authorities have not yet told, and upon which I cannot, therefore, speak. The terms of that protest should be read by every Australian, in order . that they may understand the point of view from which the Japanese public criticises our policy. The principle of White Australia is almost a religion in Australia. Upon it depends the possibility of the continuance of white Democracy-indeed , of any Democracy, in a real sense-in this continent. Any surrender of the policy is inconceivable-it rests upon the right of every self-governing community to determine the ingredients of its own population. If that right is surrendered, the essence of self-government disappears. But it must be remembered that there are various methods of expressing a policy, and various means of applying a principle. also s'hould not be forgotten that the principle underlying a policy ie frequently misunder- stood in foreign countries. It is vitally important for Australia to understand her White [190]- 2 Australia policy herself-to get at the root of it, and view it in all its aspects. When the policy is so considered, it will be found that it contains nothing that can justly be regarded as offensive by any foreign nation. For the reasons which Mr Latham has set out I am very anxious to incorporate in this Bill sub-section 10 of section 41 of the Papua A ct 1905, which prevents the Lieutenant-Governor from giving his assent to any Ordinance relating to the introduction or immigration of aboriginal inhabitants of Australia, A f r i c a , or Asia. I contend that what we did in 1905 we ought to be able to do in 1920, instead of taking a retrograde step and going back on the principles of a White Australia, which, as Mr Latham says, is a religion with the great bulk of the people of this country. If we have done anything that will permit of the nations of the earth coming into German New Guinea freely, we have taken a step that the people of Australia will ever regret. We should adopt a definite policy at the inception of our administration, otherwise we shall have to retrace our steps very soon. The responsibility is now upon the Government, and not upon Parliament, to see that the restriction contained in the Papua Bill is made to apply to New Guinea.",50
308,Mr GROOM,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Darling Downs-Minister of Works and Railways) [6.21] - The Leader of the Opposition (Mr T u d o r ) bases his argument upon section 41 of the Papua Act, and desires a similar provision in regard to Asiatic immigration incorporated in the Bill . It is, in effect, there. Certain Ordinances made by the Legislative Council under the Papua Act are reserved expressly for the assent of the Governor General, who, of course, acts on the advice of the Government of the day. The Ordinances under this Bill have to be made by the Governor General through the Government of the day^so that in reality the same author it y makes or gives assent to the Ordinances in both cases. Therefore, the honourable member is urging the inclusion of something that is, in effect, in the Bill .",51

We should bear in mind that in regard to the W h it e Australia policy we are not yet out of the wood. During the last Parliaiment I had reason to point out to some of the leaders of democratic thought in thTs country that the attitude they were adopting was one of considerable danger. venture to repeat that statement now. While the question of the mandates is still unsettled, it is the duty of every one who wishes to see this country preserved to the white race to uphold any Government in presenting Australia's case to the other nations of the world. Whatever view one may take in regard to the personnel of different delegations that are sent 'abroad, we are in a position in which we can criticise them only at the risk of the loss of that policy, which, in my judgment, is essential to the development of the Commonwealth as a white man's country. Therefore, I plead with honourable members opposite and their supporters outside that until this question of mandates isfinally settled, we should all speak with one voice, and that voice should be in support of the Government of the day in their attitude towards the White Australia policy at the Peace Conference.",51
310,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"ParramattaTreasurer) [6.25] - In the extract which the Leader of the Opposition quoted from the writings of Commander Latham, a gentleman with whom I was intimately associated at the Peace Conference, and who did excellent work, there is a phrase which does not quite represent the Japanese attitude as expressed at the Conference. The Japanese were particular in stressing their claim to racial equality. I think the phrase was "" the just rights of all nationals signatory to the Treaty "" , although there were several variants, all having the same meaning. But it is only fair to say that the Japanese delegation insisted time and again that in the rights which Japan wished to establish for herself and other Eastern nations under the Peace Treaty, she did not claim to take advantage of the open door, so far as immigration was concerned. Of course, now and again they were pressed to make that statement good and to declare that they excluded immigration from the term "" just rights of all nationals."" upon that question they would not yield. Altogether it was a piece of very skilful diplomatic work.",52

This mode of making laws is open to all those objections which apply to legislation by means of regulation.

It has heen our unfortunate experience, in a large number of cases, that review of statutory rules or regulations has proved quite impossible, for the reason that, although rules are formally laid before Parliament, the Government in power does not necessarily provide opportunity for their discussion. When the war was running its tragic course, the Government habitually enacted regulations in large numbers. Sometimes it was our unhappy privilege to notice these regulations included amongst our papers, and on more than one occasion a member of this House has given notice of his intention to move that a particular regulation be disallowed. Having given notice, that notice of motion has duly appeared upon the paper; but, partly by accident and mainly by design, its discussion has never - been reached. The Government have taken good care of that; and then, in due time-or , rather, in undue time-it has disappeared from the notice-paper.",52

351,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"West Sydney) [ 8 . 2 7 ] - I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Batman (Mr . Brennan). In view of the provisions of this measure it is an eminently able one, because the laws of the Commonwealth will not apply Territories. If the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) will say that certain laws will apply to the Territoriesi there might be some foundation for the arguments mitted in reply to the honourable for Batman. Under this Bill it is proposed to hand over absolute power to the Government of the day, not to Parliament, to do what they wish in connection with the government of the We have had experience under the War Precautions Act, and I am sure honourable member of this Chamber, if he expressed his real view, would say that that Act should be immediately pealed, because it places power in the hands of the Do we want that experience under this measure? I do not think we do. The only way to obviate it is to accept the amendment. If the Treasurer is not prepared to do that, will he indicate some of the proposals of the Government in regard to the government of these islands and Territories? they propose to apply ? The right honourable gentleman says that this is only a provisional measure. What does he mean by that? How long will it operate? am sure there will be little if the power is once given, to remove it from the hands of the What taxation provisions the incomes derived in these Are they to be subject to the same taxation as incomes derived in Australia? taxation to be imposed by means of an Ordinance? The Treasurer reply. I do not think the people of Australia are in favour of placing absolute power in the this Government, and I cannot cept the suggestion that this is only a provisional measure. a number of Acts on our book, and one in particular, indicate that certain provisions apply until Parliament vides. That Act has been in for twenty years, and this measure may remain in force in its present form so loug as this Government power. I desire to take the of disagreeing with the views by the Treasurer concerning the discussion in this House of matters of supreme importance to the Mr Ryan. reason- It is hinted that we must not talk about the Immigration Restriction Act , because to these that is going to be talked about by the League of Nations, and it is also said that we must not talk about the Tariff, because to do so may also interfere with he sub- the discussions of the League.

359,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"- A e I say, we are told that we should not talk about the Immigration Restriction Act or the Tariff.",57
360,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Who said anything about the Tariff ? I have never mentioned it.,57
361,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"The righ t honourable gentleman never mentioned it , but it was suggested"" that we should not discuss it or the Immigration Restriction Act, and I may say that I do not think there should be any power on the part of any outside body to interfere' with the policy of a White Australia or our right to impose a Tariff. If no outside body has a right to interfere in matters of this sort we may discuss them here, and see to it that the principles we stand for in Australia are applied to any Territories that have to be administered as an integral part of the Commonwealth. It is with that object in view that we have been advocating the vesting of the power in Parliament, as distinct from the Executive Government. We have not been able to have our views accepted that Parliament shall have the supreme power as against the Executive, and the next best thing is to secure that the Ordinances shall only be operative for a certain period, unless during that period Parliament has said they may continue. That is an eminently reasonable position to take up, and I hope the Committee will carry the amendment. - Sir ROBERT BEST (Kooyong) [8.34] - As I understand the amendment, it is that the Ordinances are to come into operation immediately on their publication in the Government Gazette, and that within fifteen days after Parliament meets it will be necessary for Parliament to deBnitely affirm that they shall continue in operation. That, I think, is the general effect of the proposal. In addition to the difficulties expressed by the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), the amendment is, to my mind, impracticable from a further stand-point. During recess Ordinances will be made, and some of them, no the doubt, will come into operation . within a few days after Parliament has prorogued, and others come into operation within a few days of Parliament meeting. Under these Ordinances various acts will be done in the Territory. The Ordinances will have the effect of law. with the result that all sorts of strangf and confusing conditions will arise, the as people never being definitely assured a? to their stability. If an Ordinance be of an enabling character, all sorts of vested interests may arise under them, only to be set aside immediately Parliament meets.",57
362,Mr BRENNAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Does not the honourable member see that the Bill , as it stands, provides for the possibility of an Ordinance being revoked by resolution of Parliament ?",57
363,Sir ROBERT BEST,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Of course, there is that possibility; but I venture to say on the honourable member's own showing that that is vastly different from a condi-' tion of affairs which makes it the duty of Parliament to confirm an Ordinance. P The clause, as. it stands, gives greater stability, as experience has shown, than would be given did it become necessary for the approval of Parliament to be given within fifteen days. Of course, there is the furtherpractical difficulty that Parliament is engaged in work of a more urgent character, and it would be truly difficult at times to bring in the necessary affirmative motions to make the Ordinances valid: That would certainly have to be done in many instances at the sacrifice of far more important work. Prom that stand-point, and dealing with this solely as a practical, and not as a technical, matter, I say that greater stability is given by the clause in its present form. Furthermore, as a time-wasting device, it leaves nothing to be desired. Then, in addition, the Trea-* surer pointed out that this Bill is really of a tentative character, or, as has been suggested, of a temporary nature. The mandate has not yet been issued, but is merely a provision in the Covenant of the League of Nations. That Covenant provides that the mandate shall issue; and when it is issued it will then be for us to enact the necessary legislation, having regard to the terms of the mandate. The present Bill is of a tentative character for the purpose of establishing civil government, which, surely, must be a preferable form of government as compared with the present military government. When we know the terms of the mandate under the Covenant it will be the duty and responsibility of the Government to introduce the necessary legislation of a more permanent character. Under the circumstances we are justified in the view that the greatest degree of stability, so far as that is necessary, should be given to the Ordinances during the period of the operation of the Bill itself. I am certain that the mandate, when it does issue, will call for a more permanent measure.",57

I understand from the statement of the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) that this is purely a tentative measure, having for its object the establishment of a tentative government for tentative purposes; and the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) has moved an amendment to this tentative measure for a tentative government, which amendment is objected to because it is said to be a permanent interference with a tentative measure.

388,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,What does the honourable member mean by that?,60
389,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"What does the Treasurer himself mean? - Sir JOSEPH COOK - I mean that we may ask a native to pay his contribution to the taxation of the Territory in the form of useful labour. I have nothing else in my mind. I am laying down the principle that these natives, for the good government which we hope to give them, should themselves make some eontribution towards the cost of governing the Territory. I am suggesting that, perhaps, the most convenient form in which they can make that contribution will be by doing a little labour for the Government in the development of the Territory. Is that forced labour? Is that using the lash? Is that slavery? To so characterize it is pure claptrap and humbug. ' Mr Charlton (Hunter) [9.0] Notwithstanding the statement of the Treasurer in regard to asking the natives to perform a certain amount of useful labour in the Territory in lieu of paying taxation, this clause provides for something more than that. Its terms are very definiteNo forced labour shall be permitted in the Territory except for essential public works services, and then only for adequate remuneration. That means, if it means anything at all, that the Administrator will have the Tight to compel the natives to work whenever he thinks fit.",60
390,Mr BRENNAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"And , if necessary, to use physical force to compel them to do . so.",60
391,Mr ICHARIJTON,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Quite so. The Administrator will be the sole judge of what is "" adequate remuneration."" It is evident, therefore, that there is something more in this Bill than the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) contemplates.",60
392,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"The natives have to be looked after. When we have a civilized Government - there we cannot allow them to starve. If a native says, "" You must look after me, but I will do no work,"" how are we to deal with such a man? is to Mr Charlton - We all know the Scriptural quotation, "" He that will not work, neither shall he eat."" The natives are able to provide for themselves. The aborigines of Australia, before a white man set foot in the country, were able to live. They had to work to secure their living, and they did not know what starvation was.",60
393,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"All this is an argument for leaving the natives to themselves, and for refusing to' take a mandate to try to train them to a higher degree of civilization.",60
394,Mr OHARLTON,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Not at all. If the claiise simply provided that natives could be employed on essential public works at a fair remuneration, without making any reference to forced labour, the position would be 'different. The natives, like every one else, if offered fair conditions, will accept employment. We must hold out to these natives the hand of friendship. We must let them see that we are kindly disposed to them, and desire to better their position. lif we do, they will quickly respond. The clause provides, however, that there shall be power to force natives to work on conditions laid down by the Administrator, and for what he considers to be adequate remuneration. What is the difference between forcing a man to work and absoand lute slavery? It is a distinction without a difference. The clause opens with the statement, "" The slave trade is prohibited in the Territory,-"" and in the very next sub-olause provision is made for forced labour on essential public works and services.",60
395,Mr MCGRATH,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"And the Government are to be the slave-owners. Mr Charlton"" - That is so. Men who were in South A f r i c a in the early days have told me that the natives were compelled to accept the conditions of employment offered. They received only triflin g pay, and there were white men who knocked them about whenever they thought fit to do so.",61
396,Mr MOGBATH,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"And declared that to be "" adequate remuneration.""",61
397,Mr CHARLTON,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,No doubt. I am not going to be a party to that sort of thing. What will the League of Nations think of a provision like this ? I believe that they will take exception to it .,61
398,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Nonsense !,61
399,Mr OHARLTON,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"The right honourable member may think it is nonsense; but my reading of the Conventions is that the League of Nations was created to secure improved conditions for mankind, to' do away with war; and it is only reasonable to assume that it will be opposed to forced laboxir or any forim of slavery. ""We cannot distinguish between forced labour and slavery.",61
400,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,We do; distinction is set out in black and white in the Bill .,61
401,Mr CHARLTON,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"I object to subclause 2. It is a blot on the Bill , and ought to be struck out. How can it be argued that the natives will be free to do what they like if the Administrator is given power to force them to labour on public works and services whenever he thinks fit? Practically, there will be only Government work to carry out. If that is so, and the Government offer the natives sufficient inducement, they will readily do that work. But it is altogether wrong to compel them to work under any conditions that may be imposed. The Treasurer would be well advised to accept the amendment. It will be possible to govern these Territories without any such provision as that which it is proposed to eliminate. The Administrator may be a humane man, but, on the other hand, he may be altogether too exacting.",61
402,Mr COBSEB,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,If he abused this power we could dispense with his services.,61
403,Mr CHARLTON,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Unfortunatel y it is very difficult for us to ascertain what is happening in these far away places. If I were appointed Administrator of these Territories, I might be guilty of some wrongful procedure, and, because the Parliament did not hear of it , might continue that wrongful procedure for some months. No individual should have power to do what he likes.",61

CHARLTON - B y subordinates who might be ""nigger drivers,"" and force men to do more than should fairl y be expected of .them. Sir. JOSEPH COOK - Will honourable members opposite please get it into their heads that there is a colony of white people out there.",61
405,Mr CHARLTON,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"That is all the more reason why sub-clause 2 should be left out. If we are prepared to pay reasonable wages, the white people will respond, even if the natives will not, to the applications for men to carry out public works.",61

408,Mr CHARLTON,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"I wish I could accept that view. On some of these islands white men employ natives, and exact all they can from them in order to make as much as possible. Very few white people in these islands do their own work. They depend upon native labour. In Papua all the work is done by natives, who leave their homes for months at a time.",61

412,Mr CHARLTON,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"This Bill is different from the Act relating to Papua, and the regulations cannot be inconsistent with the Bill . In order to obtain sustenance every man has to work, and if employment on these islands is made attractive the natives will accept it . To compel them to work, whether they desire to do so or not, will bring about absolute slavery. The statement in sub-clause 1 that "" The slave trade is prohibited in the T e r r it o r y "" is mere camouflage. The Administrator will be able to impose his own conditions, and to compel the natives to observe them. The acceptance of the amendment will not interfere with the government of the islands. The revenue may not be sufficient to pay for their administration, but we do not want to minimize the loss by doing anything detrimental to the best interests of the natives. Let ' us give them freedom to accept what they regard as a f a ir thing for the work they perform. Workmen, whether black or white, will respond to reasonable treatment, and give a fair return for their remuneration. Once people get into their heads the idea that they have to do what they are told* to do, and that their employers can pay them what they please, discontent arises. If that sort of thing is allowed, the time will come when it will be necessary to drive the natives to work, or practically to whip them.

They are really making a mountain out of a molehill. We all know that they opposed, by every means in their power, the taking over of these islands. It was not the wish of the Labour party that we should have aiiyhing to do with them. Everyone admits that when these islands were governed by the Germans the natives were badly treated. Honourable members opposite, however, were opposed to the British controlling the islands, and were prepared to leave them in the hands of Germans who treated the natives badly.

The point is that these islands are coming under our control, and the question we have to answer is, "" What are we going to do with them ?"" We see now the reason for the previous clause on which we took a division. It was devised for the purposes of this clause. We see now clearly and distinctly why the Government do not want the, Ordinances discussed by this Parliament. We see now that the rule is not tentative, but permanent, and that it is proposed to give to one individual in the new community, power to do things which are not done in any other part. The clause begins with the simple stipulation that no slave labour shall be permitted in the Territory. The Treasurer hammers his finger upon that phrase.",63
428,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"No . I hammer my finger on the other p a r t : "" No forced, labour shall be permitted in the Territory, except"".",63
429,Mr ANSTEY,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Then I understand the right honourable member to say, "" No forced labour shall be permitted, except."" That means, I presume, ""except where required.""",63
430,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,There are tions to every rule.,63
431,Mr ANSTEY,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Y o u shall not have a drink unless you need it . Y o u shall not have forced labour or slavery unless you desire it . The first provision is that tliere shall be no slave labour, but the next paragraph says that there shall be forced labour under certain circumstances. Argue about that as much as you like, but it is ther-i. There is no justification for it in history, or need for it on the ground of public interest. We can come to a divi put this sion upon, the question of whether we stand for forced labour, or slavery, or not, whenever the Government like. The Treasurer has only one argument for the proposal, whatever his real reasons may be, for in his heart of hearts he does not be-, lieve in this thing, and many others sitting behind the Government do not believei n slavery or forced labour. The Treasurer is going to support, at this juncture, a system of slave labour,, or forced labour., on the one ground that there is a right of taxation, and that the natives have the right to pay taxes as a contribution towards the upkeep of their country. I do not suppose they have any objection to paying taxation. As a matter of fact, they have in existence a perfect means of paying any contribution that is necessary for the upkeep of their country. A system of forced labour is not needed for the maintenance of their country, and this proposal is not meant to make them pay their dues or obligations in that direction. The real purpose of it is to compel them to labour for other men for whatever may be given to them. One honourable member opposite said that the natives would not be ill treated. Is that so? I direct the attention of the - Ministerial party to the book F i j i of To-day, written by Mr Burton, the Methodist minister. It demonstrates what the Colonial Sugar Refining Company would do in Australia, and what it does when it has unlimited power in a country which lies at a comparatively short distance from our shores. What is the history of F i j i ? When the Fijians would not labour for the Colonial Sugar Refining Company at the wages and under the conditions that were offered by them, the company went to the Hebrides, and in duced the inhabitants there to give their labour under an indenture system, because excep- they could be got cheaper than the native Fijians. When, finally, the company could not get the natives of the Hebrides, or the Solomon Islanders, to work for them, they went to the cities of India, and brought thousands of the most degraded and miserable of the Indi a n natives into F i j i , up to the period of the war. The conditions under which those people lived and worked in F i j i were odious, filthy, and obscene. Every sentiment of morality and decency was swept aside by men who belonged to their particular churches in Australia, and who prated of their love of humanity, yet who, when they got outside the radius of a white man's Government, treated these natives of India with the most horrible brutality. is no need to state these facts on the floor of Parliament. They are in the reports presented to the British Government by men who came from India. stated that a woman was not even allowed time for her confinement, and the last great reform which the company effected was to bring a few women from India, and parcel each of them out like a bitch amongst dogs-on e woman to seven men. Do honourable members know that fact? If they do not know it , they have only to study the reports. - Dr EAE LE PAGE - Is that suggested here?",63
432,Mr ANSTEY,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,No ; and the Government dare not suggest it . They dare not advocate what went on in F i j i u n t i l within the last three or four years.,64
433,Mr MARR,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,We do not control F i j i .,64
434,Mr ANSTEY,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Honourable members opposite put up an argument and then fly away from it . They ask on the one hand, "" Do you think any man of our race or creed would do these things?"" and when I prove that they are done, and that where the impetus of greed exists, it overrides all questions of religion, my honourable friends say, "" We are not talking about that ; we are talking of something else.""",64
435,Dr EARLE PAGE,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Do any 'British Governments do it?,64
436,Mr ANSTEY,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Of course they do. It is done with the consent of the British Government, and under the British flag. What was done in the Kanaka trade under the Australian flag, and under Australian Governments? It is on record that, in reports to the British Government, the Kanaka trade was described as one of "" murder, rapine, and b r u t a l it y . "" Where the instinct of gain and profit exists, men will do these things, if they have the opportunity. We need, therefore, to provide safeguards against it . principle and rule is laid down in other parts of Papua, and can be put into this Bill if the Government so desire. they have some ulterior motive, some sinister design, something which is not to be declared openly. There is in existence in New Guinea at the present time an indenture system of labour, which is not a forced labour system, but which is bad enough. In speaking of the natives, I refer to them as men, irrespective of their colour, Because there is only one sound There basis of ethics to follow in the treatment of others, whether they are blacks or Chinese, and that is to do to them as you would be done by. There is, as I say, in , It is New Guinea an indenture system which is not slavery, or forced labour, but which is-a n indenture system, which means the same thing.",64
437,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Wlier e is this going on?,64
438,Mr ANSTEY,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"In New Guinea. The natives will not work unless they are properly remunerated, and since the white man will not give them anywhere near an adequate amount to induce them to labour in their own villages where their homes are, another way is found. No native will leave his littl e yam patch or his little net and b it of fishing to give his labour to somebody else, unless some incentive is offered to him. He must see that he can - get something more than he could earn by tillin g the native soil Tyith his primitive implements, but the incentive of greed prompts those - who want his labour to offer him less than enough to induce him to work for them. So they get him to sign a little b it of paper, in which he agrees to give his labour for so many years, and when they have indentured him, as they call it , they take him away from his own locality. It. of our would not be so bad if he could work in his native village, where he could return to his littl e patch of ground. He is sent to some other part of New Guinea, and there he has to labour. They have him there as a slave to do as they like with , and when his indenture period expires, he comes back to his own village, only to find too often that the jungle has grown up where his patch was. He is cut off from his primitive means of earning an existence, and finds himself a bond slave, driven by necessity to work for others. Just as The very the British workmen, when isolated from the soil, were driven into the workshops and factories, so these natives, isolated But from their own villages by the indenture system, and deprived of their primitive mode of life, are driven into a condition which is no better than slavery. The Government say they are going to send white men up there, and this system of forced labour means that you can make them work for you as long as you like. If you offer the natives enough, they will work. Offer them the inoentive to sell their labour as free men,*and you will get their services. But why should they, any more than any one else, be compelled to give their labour? The Bill provides for forced labour, but no penalties are provided. Honourable members opposite say that, of course, the lash will not be used, and that it is outrageous to suggest such a thing. How, then, is the clause to be enforced ? The penalty is to be provided by Ordinainjce', and not i h the B There is to be forced labour for all public works and services, however extensive they may be, and the man in charge there can stretch the interpretation of i "" public works and services"" as far as he likes. He can prescribe how far their meaning shall extend, and what the nature of the work shall be. declare how long the men shall work, and what amount of rice shall be handed to each of them for their services. The Government dare not say in this Bill what the penalty is to be, because they and their supporters dare not vote on such a proposal. They, therefore, carefully cover it up, and leave it to the Administrator. They empower him to impose forced labour on the in habitants, and, since they dare not put it in an Act of Parliament, .they leave it to him to devise the penalty, whatever it may be, according to his mercy - or ferocity. If he has been brutalized by contact with other races he regards as inferior, no doubt the punishment he will inflict will reflect his odiousness. It ought not to be left to the individual himself to say what he proposes to do in this particular direction. I ask the Treasurer upon whom he proposes to enforce labour?",64
439,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,I shall tell the orable member when he sits down.,65
440,Mr ANSTEY,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"There should be no necessity for me to ask the question. Upon whom' is this forced labour to be imposed? Upon the natives, of course. But why is it not put in the Bill? As I do not know much about legal matters, I ask the honourable and learned member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) does he see anything in the Bill which specifies the persons to whom this forced labour will apply ?",65
441,Mr RYAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,There is no limitation.,65
442,Mr ANSTEY,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Of course there is not. What is a native? Is he a purebred,- or a half-caste, or an octoroon ? Where is the line of limitation to be drawn ?",65
443,Dr EARLE PAGE,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,Why should we d if ferentiate ?,65
444,Mr ANSTEY,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Now we have it from the honourable member. Here we see a probably budding Administrator of New Guinea, with its bubbling humanity, asking why we should distinguish between the pure black and the product of the white ill . man's contact, whether it be a trader or an officer who has seized a native g i r l , used her in his office, and produced something which is possibly worse than black or white, but is the shame of either race, despised alike by that which produced it and that which bore it . The honourable member says, "" Why should we distinH e can guish? That despised product shall also be a slave and entitled to be forced to labour."" But why stop at that which is a little black and a little white? Why stop as long as there is one single streak of colour? So long as there is one streak of the native race in man or woman the honourable member would claim the r i g ht to impose his odious forced service. There is no mention of it in the Bill , but the honourable member would draw no distinction between those who have some admixture of black blood in their veins and those who are pure natives.",65
445,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,No ; we are going to stand over all of them with a big whip !,65
446,Mr ANSTEY,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Q u it e so. Power given is always power abused. Of course, honourable members say that they would never do these things, that reference to v the past is useless, that it is a waste of words to talk about what has occurred here, there, or elsewhere, and that we, of our race and under our flag, are noble, hon- gentle creatures who would not be guilty of any cruel or unkind deed. But that is a lie. Under every flag, good men and bad, cruel men as well as generous, are born. In Leicester Square, in the heart of the great city of London, and in the centre of its most fashionable quarter, one could see from the portico of the theatre just across the gardens a little red light which, during the whole period of the war, never went out. One could walk acros' the gardens, look at the building, and see inscribed on it, "" Society for the Prevenand tion of Cruelty to Children,"" and that it has attended to 140,000 cases. walk into its chamber of horrors would enable one to see the instruments which men and women, of our race, in brutalized by their environment and conI ditions, had inflicted horrible tortures children.

What has the history of the white race told us has told us of the slave traffic on the Congo, of the treatment of the in the early days of Australia, and of our own Kanaka trade, reeking with odiousness; and today we have the case of Fiji, with its putrid sexual ditions. They form a complete to those who excuse themselves for morrow, and when we say, "" Do not leave the door open to brutality and degraded and beastly conditions,"" reply, "" Leave the door open to the imost brutal condiargument tions, but do not anticipate that anytions? thing brutal will be done."" But leave the door open? Is there sensible person who, speaking as man to XPan and apart from the limitations down by the respective diversities party opinion, would claim that there any sane reason why Australia should alter its traditional policy in this respect, why forced labour should be imposed upon the people in this particular We say that under the flag that flies over Australia forced labour shall not be mitted, either here or in Papua, but we would permit it in a Territory the same flag flies, and where similar inaway stitutions prevail. If we are to stand any principle in Australia, let us stand for it wherever the administration Australian Government extends, wherever the Australian flag flies. Is not a sound principle that forced labour shall never be applied to any particular colour? Is it not good enough to apply with Indians. in this Territory, so that no one can that forced labour has ever been imposed by any Australian Administration? is why, not for partisan tactics, but the interests of all those principles profess, those traditions we respect and this country itself, I claim that thing demands that we must not permit of any possibility of a departure Mr Anslei/. this - principle.

There is no doubt that the limitations are intended to remove many of the objections that have been associated with forced labour in any shape or form; but I point out to the Treasurer and to the Committee that forced labour, even as limited by this sub-clause, would, I think, be reprehended by ""the people of Australia with regard to these mandated Territories. Forced la'bour of natives has been practised in many countries. In Egypt, from time immemorial, the corvee has been a means by which urgent public works have been carried out on short notice; such works, for instance, as the repairing of damaged canal banks in order to preserve the country from an overwhelming calamity. Then, again, in South Africa, conditions similar to those allowed by this clause, have been permitted in regard to the natives there. But the utilization of this forced labour, even under safeguards like the protective provisions of this clause has caused a considerable amount of difficulty in dealing with the natives, especially in recent times.",68

475,Mr WATKINS,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"The reason why, hitherto, planters have not been able to get sufficient labour is that the remuneration has not been high enough to induce the Papuan natives to offer their services. When we realise that under the guidance of missionaries and the Government of Papua, some of the natives are engaged in such work as running saw-mill plants, manipulating oil engines, motor boats, and even building motor boats in a manner that would do credit, to the boat builders of Australia, we must realise that they are not all the kind of people to who should not be compelled to do work under that sub-clause to which objection",68

As one who knows something of the real position there, I think the Treasurer will be well advised to eliminate this proposal of compulsion from the Bill, because I am satisfied, from what I saw, that the Government will have no difficulty whatever in getting, by other means, all the labour that may be required from the native j>opulation.",68
478,Mr BAYLEY,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"Oxley) [9.58] - I am not in agreement with the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins). hope the Minister will retain the subclause. In fact, I congratulate the Government upon its inclusion, for unless the Government have this power, how will it be possible to bring about a ma- now. terial improvement in the condition of the islands? The honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) said it was only, right that the natives should pay their share of taxation. But how many of them could pay in coin of the realm? The only way in which they can pay their share of taxation is by labour. Taxation which is imposed upon us, and which we must pay, whether we like it or not, is only another form of forced labour. We are compelled to work in order to earn suflicient money to pay our taxes. It is not intended that the natives shall be driven into forced labour, but. the clause provides that, if it becomes necessary for certain works to be carried out and the labour is not forthcoming voluntarily, the natives may be forced to give their services in return for adequate remuneration. One honourable member stated that if sufficient money were offered, the labour would be forthcoming. That has not been the experience in Papua. The daily wants of the natives are easily supplied, and after they have worked for a day or two they take a rest, and will not work again until they feel the pinch of necessity. That has been the experience amongst native races all over the world. In Papua, very few developmental works have 'been carried on. Why? Because we cannot secure the necessary native labour. If we are to advance the natives of New Guinea, we must construct roads, drain the swamps in order to get rid of malaria, and open up the country generally. That can be done only by the utilization of native labour. Honourable members may ask why we should not pay for the' la'bour. But, if we cannot get natives to eome forward in sufficient numbers, it is only right that the Administrator should be vested with power to order men to work so many days on a certain task. If a man can pay his quota in money, well and good; if he cannot, let him pay with his labour. I hope the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) will allow this provision to remain in the Bill ; for, if it is struck I out, the time may come when it will be necessary for us to re-insert it, and it will be a more unpleasant task to bring about compulsory labour two or three years hence than to make provision for it",69

It seems to me that a wrong view has been placed before the Committee. In dealing with these islands, the Commonwealth has two alternatives-(1 ) Leave them in a savage state, or (2) attempt to civilize them. There is no middle course. The native, particularly the savage, is mentally and in many other ways a child. I take it that no member of the Opposition will say that there should be no compulsory education, that the child should be allowed to do nothing and learn nothing until he had reached manhood, when he might become a menace to society.",69

481,Dr EARLE PAGE,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"And there is no incentive for a paternal Government, which will have to pay out of its own coffers thousands of pounds per annum to maintain the Territory, as the report of the Commission indicates, to ill-treat its subjects. In fact, the whole purpose of British and Australian administration of natives races, as opposed to German administration, has been the betterment of the peoples controlled. Occupation has proved to be a civilizing influence in connection with savage races, and, indeed, the only influence that has helped them to maintain their v i r i l it y and health.

Because there is no work, the natives simply dying out through atrophy and disease. In regard to civilizing native, Mr MCMahon saidOne of the secrets, indeed it may be called jection. the main issue, of regeneration of native races is in civilizing them to find occupations.",69

483,Dr EARLE PAGE,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"That is not so. The natives of Tonga are continually likes to talk. improving in their condition under a system of rule which was possible only by reason of the fact that a system such as is suggested in the clause before the cerCommittee was adopted at the inception of white administration. Mr MCMahon - It is admitted by all who know anything of islands that natives fed, housed, doctored, worked are morally, physically, and mentally superior to the poor vagabonds who subsisting on Government doles or findl ing food as fortune favours ithem. It is quite a mistake to suppose that the savage native is an idler. He must be active in order to protect his life and hunt for his food. The quality of savagery is alertness, on account of the constant fear of a lurking enemy. The savage is a primitive man, and must fight to exist. This keeps him fit and Civilization demands that the native forsake his savagery, which means his alertness, keenness, and natural activity. He degenerates into vagabondage, and his numbers decrease, and this decrease becomes rapid if assisted by the vices of civias was the case of old. The commerprogress of the islands must be, and is, a tremendous factor in the regeneration of the natives. Teach the natives the benefit of the the white man's comanercial progress, give him occupation in helping the commercial progress, and instantly he shows a new spirit and That is the experience of men who have in the Pacific, and of every one the whom we can trust to give a true opinion of conditions in these Territories.

But if the Minister is not prepared to do that, and the question is going to a division, in If I which the whole of the members of the Government w i ll be arrayed against those in opposition, I shall exhaust all the forms of the 'Committee and the time at my disposal in resisting the sub-clause or the part of the sub-clause which I conceive to be most objectionable and iniquitous. Coming to the arguments advanced in good faith by the Treasurer, I fbi d it impossible for me to follow his line .of reasoning. He lays great stress upon the fact that the sub-clause is in the nature of prohibition, and chat it clearly states that no forced labour shall be permitted in the Territory except Sir JOSEPH Coox - That is very plain.",73
516,Mr BRENNAN,REPRESENTATIONS BY BRITIS H,"It is absolutely plain ; and up to that stage the sub-clause is prohibitive. In that prohibition there is something vetoed which is absolutely distasteful to the Australian sense of jus-, tice, and absolutely distasteful, I believe, to this Committee. There come the exceptions set out in the sub-clause, and it is the exceptions to that golden rule that members on this side are taking, in turn, very great exception. May I ask the Treasurer to consider for a moment how this sub-clause may be read affirmatively? It may be so read, and i m mediately one does that one drives out of it the virtue to which the right honourable gentleman has attached so much importance. It may be read in this wayThat forced labour shall be permitted in the Territory for essential public works and services, and adequate remuneration. There is no doubt at all that the mere prohibition does not alter the plain meaning that forced labour may he permitted under certain circumstances. I ask the Treasurer to remember that, whether this sub-clause is. intended to apply only to the coloured or white races, to the members of a recently conquered race, or to whomsoever it is to apply, these persons are deserving of the protection of the law. Let us ask ourselves how far they will be able to invoke the protection of the law, and by that means we shall be able to put this sub-clause to the test. Let us assume that a native is taken from his home, his hut, or his humpy, wherever it may be, and from his occupation. He is bound hand and foot, and is brought to the place where a particular class of work is to be performed. At that place he is told to enter upon a particular task, and he replies, "" I cannot do it . I will not do it , "" or "" I refuse to accept the remuneration offered."" When he takes that stand, there comes that crucial moment that honourable members opposite wish to evade. What measures are to be adopted to compel a man to work ? If the language means anything. it means what it says, and that, in the event of a refusal to obey orders, physical violence may be employed, including all kinds of torture. I suggest to the Committee that if the Administrator, or any superior or inferior officer who is in charge, adopts brutal measures to compel a man to work, he would be able successf u l l y to rejoin that he relies on the security of this Act of Parliament. He would be able to say, "" I required labour for a particular purpose; I offered this man what I considered to be adequate remuneration, and he refused to work. "" Because he refuses to work, and the work is deemed to be of essential public importance, he is compellable to do so in the way sanctioned by law. If the most brutal Administrator that one .could imagine were indicted for misusing any person in the Territory, under these circumstances he would have an irrefragable defence, according to the laws of this country, and he could not be convicted.",74
