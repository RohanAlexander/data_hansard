1,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr. Adermann) took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. CYPEUS.",12
2,Dr EVATT,Unknown,"I ask the Prime Minister a question relating to the tragic situation that still exists in Cyprus, affecting the United Kingdom and the people of Cyprus, many of whom have relatives in Australia, and also affecting Greece, which country was perhaps the most dtalwart ally of Great Britain and the British Commonwealth during the greatest crisis of the war in Europe, when Greece was directly affected. I do not make any analysis of causes of the present situation, nor do I assign any blame to any group of people or any power. However, in the interests of Australia and of its close relationships with these nations and their peoples, will the Prime Minister and his Government consider Australian intervention in the matter? I refer not to intervention in the United Nations, where ultimately this matter may be referred, after many months have elapsed, but to direct approach to the governments affected, particularly to those of Britain and Greece, in order to determine whether Australia can make any contribution towards reconciling the parties concerned on. some basis of justice. All the nations directly affected have important interests in Cyprus, and if nothing constructive is done to effect a settlement the present situation can lead only to much suffering and tragedy and many deaths, after which there will be some sort of an amnesty. It is not without precedent for Australia to take the initiative in a matter of this kind, and I suggest to the Prime Minister that he might do so, with the assistance of the Minister for External Affairs. Certainly such an action would find support among all sections of this House and of the country.",12
3,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"I do not want to reject out of hand the idea of some views being offered on these matters, but I do not need to tell the right honourable gentleman that this matter is one of great delicacy. I had the opportunity of discussing it with members of the Greek R -[79 ] Government about a year ago, in the somewhat earlier phases of the movement C. F. in Cyprus. Nor do 1 need to tell honourable members that the position of Cyprus in the Middle East is one of vast importance, not only to the United Kingdom, but also to Australia itself. Nor, indeed, would I need to say that several countries are deeply interested in this matter. We sbould all like to see sensible and peaceable arrangements made but, of course, such arrangements require at least two co-operating parties, and up to now there have been difficulties which, I venture-to say, have not been of the making of the United Kingdom Government. I shall be very happy to continue with my colleague, the Minister for External Affairs, the discussions that I bave had from time to time since this unhappy situation commenced to develop, and whatever influence Australia has will, as usual, be on the side of peace and sensible, settlement, and with a view to the preservation of security. NA NA ARRANGEMENTS.",12
4,Mr HAMILTON,ADMINISTRATI VE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I wish to preface it by saying that the House is grateful to the right honourable gentleman for notifying it at various times of changes in the administration of departments. Honourable members will recall his recent advice concerning the departmental change in the administration of the War Service Homes Act. I ask the Prime Minister whether this announcement appeared in the Commonwealth Gazette, of Friday, the 27th April, 1956, under the Administrative Arrangements Order issued by the Governor General. In this Administrative Arrangements Order did there appear also a notification concerning a change in the administration of the War Service Land Settlement Agreement Act 1945, and Division 2, Part II . , of the Ee-establishment and Employment Act? Had those two alterations been announced to the House? As few honourable members receive the Commonwealth Gazette, and some time elapses before the Federal Guide is compiled, printed and distributed, will the Prime Minister, in order to facilitate the working of thia House and to keep able members informed, lay down as practice or principle that all such changes shall be made known to the House or, alternatively, that honourable members shall be notified of them by circular?",12
5,Mr MENZIES,ADMINISTRATI VE,"I think that the honourable member is right. I regret to say that he has confirmed my own impression that the Commonwealth Government Gazette is not popularly Prime Minister two questions. read. In future, I will see that any changes in administrative arrangetbat ments are announced in the House. those So that there will be no misunderstanding of what bas occurred, perhaps I should state the administrative changes which have been approved. The administration of the war service land settlement legislation has, for reasons that are clear enough, been transferred to the Minister for Primary Industry. The administraensign, tion of the war service homes legislation has been transferred from the Minister for Social Services to the Minister for National Development. Tbat bas already been announced by my colleague. The respective countries ? Minister for Social Services will carry out the necessary representational duties in this chamber. The administration Division 2 of Part II . of the ment and Employment Act, which deals with preference in employment, has been transferred from the Attorney General to the Minister for Labour and National Service. Certain problems associated with the exact delineation the functions of the Department of Trade and the Department of Primary Industry remain unsettled. As honourable members will appreciate, there has been a great complex of matters to examine, and what one of my colleagues would call the effect. ""surgery"" of the matter is not easily accomplished. An announcement to the House on the matter will be made as soon as possible. I should, perhaps, take opportunity presented by this question to say that during the absence from Austhe tralia of the Minister for Trade and myself, which honourable members will be delighted to know will shortly occur",13
6,Mr WARD,ADMINISTRATI VE,I hope that it will be a long absence.,13
7,Mr MENZIES,ADMINISTRATI VE,"So do I . je'or the first and only time, the honourable member honorfor East Sydney expresses the very a thoughts within my bosom. During our absence, long or short, the Treasurer will act as Prime Minister and the Minister for Primary Industry will act as Minister for Trade. The Minister for Customs and Excise will, during my absence, represent the Attorney-General in this chamber. AUSTRALIAN FLAG.",13
8,Mr CALWELL,ADMINISTRATI VE,"I wish to ask the Will be lay on the table the tentative rules he has approved for the guidance of flying the Australian flag ? Secondly, will be have these excellent rules printed and circulated in pamphlet form for the information of honourable members of both Houses of this Parliament, and all persons interested, so as to help make certain that the Australian blue now the national flag of Australia by law established, is treated in Australia at all times with the respect it deserves and in the same way as the flags of other nations are accorded respect in their",13
9,Mr MENZIES,ADMINISTRATI VE,Yes . I shall be glad to bave that done. It may be done in my of absence but it will certainly be done Re-establishbefore the House rises. DISARMAMENT.,13
10,Mr BOSTOCK,ADMINISTRATI VE,"Can the-Minister for External Affairs give any information on the significance of the report that the of Soviet Union is prepared to reduce its armed forces by something over 1,000,000 men in the next twelve months?",13
11,Mr CASEY,ADMINISTRATI VE,"Yes , sir. There has been a report, apparently genuine, to that I think that it referred to a reduction of 1,200,000 men in the armed forces generally of the Soviet Union before May of 1957. All I can say is that one the must, of course, welcome any move that reduces the very great disparity between armed forces of the Soviet Union and those of the principal democracies. But I would say that, even after this reduction of nearly one and a quarter million men has been made, the total of the armed forces of the Soviet Dnion will be ar least 4,500.000 men. Honourable members know enough of the relevant figures for the United Kingdom and the United States of America to know what a vast disparity will exist even after these reductions are made. Disarmament proposals have been going along for a very considerable time, and they have stuck, as I think honourable members are generally aware, on the proposition of the democracies that this subject will not be resolved until there has been an agreement on proper mutual, inspection of the armed forces, both orthodox or otherwise, on each side-the Communist side and the democratic side. Of course, there is no sign of agreement en that basic consideration on which the solution of this vastly important problem of international disarmament, or reduction of armaments, depends. FORGED £5 NOTES.",13
12,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,ADMINISTRATI VE,"Is the Treasurer aware that the members several unions in South Australia have refused to accept £5 notes as payment wages? Is be aware that there is an increasing resistance on the part of the general public to accept £5 notes as legal tender? Is it true that the number of forged £5 notes that have been detected greatly in excess of the number published in the press? If this is so, is the Governassured ment prepared to reconsider the previous refusal of the Treasury to withdraw the £5 notes from circulation and to issue new ones?",14
13,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,ADMINISTRATI VE,"I have no knowledge of the facts disclosed by the honourable member for Hindmarsh-if they are facts-wit h regard to the refusal of members of certain unions to accept £5 notes for wages. I shall have that aspect, and the other aspects of his quesHealth tion, examined, and will supply him with an answer. COAL.",14
14,Mr DEAN,ADMINISTRATI VE,I desire to ask the Minister for Labour and National Service a question concerning the meeting that was held in Sydney last Monday of parties interested in the coal-mining industry. Was the Minister represented at that meeting? Has be any information to give to the House concerning the progress made? Did the conference discuss ways of securing new markets for coal?,14
15,Mr HAROLD HOLT,ADMINISTRATI VE,"This was the has first meeting held of the committee set as a result of a conference a little earlier in Sydney which my colleague, the Minister for National Development, and I attended. On this occasion my colleague presided over the committee and, in that sense, the Government was very directly represented. There were also present, I gather, representatives of the Joint Coal Board and the Department of National Development. The Department of Labour and National Service was represented by an assistant secretary, Mr Graham. I understand that the first meeting of the committee set out to lay down the terms of reference in rather more detailed form, and then to decide which matters might be regarded as occupying first priority for its consideration. It was agreed that, so far as practicable, the committee would proceed on the basis of the factual of material supplied by the Joint Goal Board. The first four subject-matters of which it was agreed.to discuss were: The markets for New South Wales coal; possible alternative uses for coal; the incidence of industrial disputes; and coalloading facilities at Newcastle. It is is expected that the next meeting will take .place about three weeks hence. I am by my colleague that the first meeting was conducted in a co-operative atmosphere, and that a good spirit was manifest. He is very hopeful that some useful developments will come out of the work of the committee. NA NA CENTRE.",14
16,Mr MORGAN,HOSPITAL REHABILITATIO N,"Is the Minister for aware that a committee of lesponsible and public-spirited citizens is endeavouring, in conjunction with the authorities of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, to raise funds to establish a modern rehabilitation centre for disabled persons, in particular those who cannot obtain rehabilitation benefits through the existing centres of the Department of Social Services, because they are not recipients of social services benefits? Only pensioners and similar recipients of social services benefits are eligible for rehabilitation benefits. So far, I understand, a sum of about £14.000 been raised towards the first objective up of £100,000 to equip this centre. The hospital will make a building available, but the equipping and maintenance of it are to be the responsibility of the committee. As this proposed centre will he the first of its kind in Australia, and will be in line with the most up-to-date schemes in operation overseas and, incidentally, in keeping with the Government's pronounced policy as indicated by the Minister's predecessor, of encouraging self help",14
17,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HOSPITAL REHABILITATIO N,Order ! The honourable gentleman is giving information now.,15
18,Mr MORGAN,HOSPITAL REHABILITATIO N,"Will the Minister be good enough to look into this matter sympathetically, as I feel sure he will, with a view to ascertaining whether some Commonwealth assistance could be granted in respect of it-say , on a £l-foraware £1 basis-in order that the centre may opened as soon as possible for the benefit of this deserving section of the comto receive it. munity ?",15
19,Dr DONALD CAMERON,HOSPITAL REHABILITATIO N,"I am aware of the matter raised by the honourable gentleman. He will be glad to know that I bave recently visited the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney and had the opportunity of seeing this centre and discussing with the hospital authorities the very excellent arrangements being made. As the honourable gentleman points out, this is not a duplication of what is being done by the Department of Social Services, but is a completely separate project. .1 sball give the matter my consideration, although I can make no promises to the honourable gentleman. NA COMMISSION.",15
20,Mr DOWNER,MALAYAN CONSTITUTIONA L,My question is to the -.ight honourable Minister for External Affairs. Can the right honourable building? gentleman give the House any information about the reported breakdown of talks in London concerning the constitutional future of Singapore ? Is the tralian Government being kept fully formed of the progress of these the negotiations?,15
21,Mr CASEY,MALAYAN CONSTITUTIONA L,"Answerin g the last part of the question first, yes, the Governtralia. ment has been kept intimately informed at all stages of the discussions in London. In respect of the first part of the question, I propose to seek leave of the House to make a statement on the breakdown of the Singapore talks in London. FORGED £5 NOTES.",15
22,Mr JR FRASER,MALAYAN CONSTITUTIONA L,"My question to the Treasurer is, to a degree, supplementary to that asked by the honourable member for Hindmarsh. I ask the right honourable gentleman: Has it been established that the forged £5 notes now circulating in several States of the Commonwealth are being produced by non-union labour; or has it been clearly shown that the forger has obviously served a very complete apprenticeship in this trade ?",15
23,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,MALAYAN CONSTITUTIONA L,I am not of the facts concerning the question. be If the honourable gentleman could supply any information 1 should be very pleased IMMIGRATION.,15
24,Mr FOX,MALAYAN CONSTITUTIONA L,"I preface my question to the Minister for Immigration by stating that I have been informed that a number of immigrants who have purchased land in Melbourne have expressed surprise and dismay on receipt of an account from the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works for outstanding rates. What action is taken by the Government to warn immigrants against exploitation when they are purchasing land or houses in Australia? For example, are they warned against the possibility of buying land on which rates or other charges may be owing to the Board of Works or other authorities? Will the Minister state what steps are taken generally to protect immigrants against the pitfalls that may be involved in buying land or",15
25,Mr HAROLD HOLT,MALAYAN CONSTITUTIONA L,"The Department of Immigration has taken a number Ausof practical steps over recent years to inwarn immigrants who are contemplating purchase of land or buildings. Those stprts include the issue of a factual pamphlet to the immigrants, in their own laneuages. before they embark for AusWhen they arrive here, they are given a booklet dealing with all aspects of building. It is issued and distributed widely through the Good Neighbour ing councils and local government authorihis ties. The booklet, which is entitled Budding a Home, was prepared with the co-operation of the Royal Australian in that country? Institute of Architects and local government authorities. In addition, posters, printed in English and in foreign languages, have been issued for a number of years through the branches of the Good Neighbour movement and local government authorities to warn immifamily grants always to consult the relevant local government authority, to deal with reputable estate agents, and to consult a solicitor. From time to time, department has supplemented this inforGermany, mation with articles in its monthly .journal, The Good Neighbour. Good Neighbour movement also distributes information direct to immigrants through advisory committees. Doubtless, we do not reach every immigrant in this way, but the honourable gentleman will realise that we are doing what we to bring home to them the pitfalls to avoided in making such an important decision. I should welcome further advertisement by honourable members of the availability of this information.",15
26,Mr GALVIN,MALAYAN CONSTITUTIONA L,"I direct a question the Minister for Immigration r.he recent return to Germany of a young New Australian girl who was reported to be suffering from a tumour on the brain, and whose fare to Germany for the purpose of having an operation was raised by public subscription in South Australia. Will the Minister communiproposal. cate with officials of his department Bonn to ascertain whether it is correct that propaganda is being circulated in Germany to the effect that intending migrants should give serious considerasale tion to any proposal to go to Australia because competent medical attention is not available in this country, and that they would need to have sufficient money to return to Germany, if necessary, certain medical treatment? Is the Minisbut ter aware that the treatment suggested for the condition diagnosed by the German professor is reported to be exactly the same as that given by medical authorities in South Australia, no operation is required? After satisfyhimself about these facts, will he ask departmental officials in Germany to make the correct story known, so that no further misrepresentation will be made",16
27,Mr HAROLD HOLT,MALAYAN CONSTITUTIONA L,"It would, indeed, be unfortunate if the warmhearted help given by citizens of South Australia in this unhappy case to enable the child to be treated by a doctor in Germany, in whom J understand the had some special confidence, were interpreted overseas as indicating a lack of confidence, on our part or their part, in Australian medical services. If such the propaganda has been published in I shall ascertain what suitable action can be taken to counteract it. I The shall inquire into the matter. MURRAY VALLEY PRODUCE.",16
28,Mr FAIRBAIRN,MALAYAN CONSTITUTIONA L,"Has the Minister for Trade been informed that the can Murray Valley Development League is be considering putting on, during the Olympic Games in Melbourne, a display of the produce of the Murray Valley? As such a display could well increase sales overseas, would the Minister consider making a grant towards the cost of this display, to so as to enable it to be made as comconcerning prehensive as possible?",16
29,Mr MCEWEN,MALAYAN CONSTITUTIONA L,"I am not aware that the proposal has reached me. Perhaps it bas reached the department without yet getting through to me. I would regard it as an interesting, and no doubt valuable, On the other hand, many sugin gestions are coming forward now, doubtless almost without exception of value, on how we might get additional publicity for our Australian produce to enhance its opportunities overseas. These suggestions must be considered within the limits of the funds that the Parliament has voted for this purpose. The final decision is made sometimes at departfor mental level and sometimes by myself, always after weighing fully the judgment of those persons who are most expert to form an opinion on such a matter as by which expenditure we shall receive most value for our money, having and that in mind the object in view. ALUMINIUM.",16
30,Mr BARNARD,MALAYAN CONSTITUTIONA L,"I direct a question . to the Minister for Supply. I refer to the statement in which the Minister laid great stress on the importance of the Bell Bay aluminium plant, and in which he emphasized that the works had commenced production "" only just in time "" to meet the needs of Australian industries following a reduction of overseas supplies. He stated further that the plant is now producing approximately one-half of Australian requirements. I ask the Minister whether, in view of his statement, he is now prepared to give early consideration to the expansion of the industry as more power becomes available, not only to achieve an increased production of aluminium, but also for the establishment of prefabrication plants to be used in conjunction with the production of ingots.",17
31,Mr BEALE,MALAYAN CONSTITUTIONA L,"I shall take the last part of the honourable gentleman's question first. For myself, I am not prepared at the moment to consider extending the activities of the Bell Bay project to include fabrication. The reason for that has been stated several times in this House and in communications to the Premier of Tasmania, as the honourable gentleman knows. That reason is that there is an ample fabricating capacity in Australian industry. The honourable gentleman may shake his head but he will permit me to differ from him in that respect. The answer to the earlier part of his question is also "" No "" , for the very reason which he has indicated in the question. It would be foolish at this time to consider expanding production at Bell Bay when we are not certain that we can obtain enough power for the maximum production of which the plant is now capable, so there can be no question of extending the plant until a great deal more electric power is available. LIMITATION OF IMPORTS.",17
32,Mr TURNER,MALAYAN CONSTITUTIONA L,"My question is directed to the Minister in charge of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. Is the right honourable gentleman aware that from time to time the arrival from overseas research equipment required by the ComMinister, monwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization is delayed by reason of the imposition by the Department of Trade of a quarterly quota or limit on such imports? The significant word is ""quarterly"". If the Minister is not aware of the situation, will he make some inquiries with a view to putting Australian scientific workers on a fair competitive footing with similar research workers overseas'(",17
33,Mr CASEY,MALAYAN CONSTITUTIONA L,"All I can say is that the situation that the honourable gentleman describes as existing has not been brought to my notice by the executive of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, but I shall certainly have the matter inquired into. WAR SERVICE HMS. Mr L. R. JOHNSON - I direct u question to the Minister for Social Services, who represents in this House the Minister for National Development, who is Minister in charge of the War Service Homes Division. Will the Minister indicate whether ex-servicemen employees of the Commonwealth Public Service are afforded any priority in the matter of second assistance from the War Service Homes Division, following transfer of employment, at departmental request, from one city to another, or from State to State? Does the Minister agree that, if no priority were afforded for second assistance, many public servants would reject transfer proposals, even where promotion was involved, for reasons of accommodation difficulties? Since the matter involves the efficient deployment of Commonwealth public servants, as well as the welfare of a large number of ex-servicemen, will the Minister indicate the degree to which the Government has faced, or will face, its obligations in this matter?",17
34,Mr ROBERTON,MALAYAN CONSTITUTIONA L,"Le t me say, in reply to that part of the question which I heard that, when I bad charge of the War Service Homes Division, the number of applications for second assistance was so great, and. in my opinion, was so much to the prejudice of the 30,000 applicants who were waiting for first assistance, of that, since the discretion rested with the I decided that applications for second assistance sbould be rejected the time being, except in cases of extreme emergency. What the position is since the division has passed to the administraquate tion of the Minister for National Developstability ment, I am not in a position to say, I shall ascertain from him whether there ha? been any alteration. NA CONFERENCE.",17
35,Mr CASEY,SINGAPORE CONSTITUTIONA L," by leave-ih e Austo tralian Government has learnt with great regret that the Singapore delegation been unable to agree to constitutional changes proposed by the United Kingmercial dom for the granting of increased selfmaintenance government to Singapore. The United Kingdom offered a high and immediate degree of self-government to the elected representatives in Singapore. It prodestitution posed complete control of the island's own affairs, except, for defence and nal relations, which were not in dispute, with the United Kingdom retaining some rights to take necessary and, possibly, early action tomaintain internal security. The United Kingdom offer was not accepted, mainly because of the unto willingness of the Singapore delegation to agree to the United Kingdom authoriKingdom ties having the powers which would allow them to take early action to prevent the development of threats to internal to security before the situation gets beyond recall. I happen to bave had experience myself of civil disturbance in another well known. country in respect of which I was in a position of personal responsibility. One of the lessons that I learnt beyond any possibility of misunderstanding was that, unless .civil disturbance is coped with its very early stage, it can-and almost always does-ver y rapidly get out hand and become unmanageable by towards means other than the employment of overwhelming forces-if «uch forces exist-and this will be accompanied by great casualties and very great public distress. The threat of organized Communist subversion in Singapore is serious. Highly organized Communist groups are innltratin""' political ra""ties, trade unions and schools with the aim for ing complete control of Singapore. Furthermore, Singapore, on its own, does not at present possess anything like ademeans of maintaining social and internal security. If the but United Kingdom had abdicated this responsibility, the consequences could bave been disastrous for the population of .Singapore. If the existing prosperity of the island is to be maintained, it is essential that there should be in the public mind no doubts about the ability of the authorities to keep the peace and stop organized rioting and the like at the instance of professional troublehas makers. The continued existence and expansion of Singapore as a great comcentre is dependent upon the of confidence in its internal and external security. The destruction of this confidence would inevitably lead to catastrophic - unemployment and and to the flight of industry and commerce, to the vast detriment of exterthe ordinary people of Singapore. Australia has followed recent Singapore developments with close and sympathetic interest. We do not regard the failure of the present talks as a permanent check constitutional advances in Singapore. It sbould be remembered that the United has always adhered to the healthy and liberal practice of encouraging the gradual evolution cf a territory progressively greater charge of its own affairs. Examples of this are world-wide and the process is by no means ended, as is This process provides an opportunity for its people to acquire the experience necessary for the efficient conduct of the in business of government in an unhurried but by no means protracted manner. of There are very considerable dangers, however, in a too-precipitate advance self-government, and nowhere are these dangers more apparent, and indeed obvious, than in the case of Singapore. We believe that a recognition of the paramount need to defend the island is essential. Its people can only look forward to continued progress in their welfare and to the enjoyment of an increasing degreu of self-government if their security against internal subversion and external of securaggression it> ensured. What I have said adds up tpthis: The Australian Government supports the course that has been adopted by the United Kingdom Government in face of the unwillingness of the Singapore delegation to accept minimum safeguards for preserving the internal and external security of Singapore-safeguard s which are as much in the interests of the Singapore people themselves as in the general interest. In order that the House may have the fullest information available to the Government on this subject, as well as tabling the statement that I have just made. I should like to table a statement made available to the Government by the United Kingdom High Commissioner's office in Canberra, being a description by the United Kingdom Government of the course of the negotiations and the attitude taken by both sides at the recent conference in London. I lay on the table the following papers:Singapore Constitutional ConferenceMinisterial Statement. Summary of Negoa tiations and Proceedings, prepared the United Kingdom Government.",18
36,Dr EVATT,SINGAPORE CONSTITUTIONA L," by leave- I should like additional facts from the Minister for External Affairs (Mr Casey). Has Australian Government participated the negotiations throughout the proceedings? The right honourable gentleman indicates Australian agreement with the decision, but was that intimated to the United Kingdom Government before the final breakdown?",19
37,Mr CASEY,SINGAPORE CONSTITUTIONA L,We have had frequent telegraphic exchanges.,19
38,Dr EVATT,SINGAPORE CONSTITUTIONA L,Givin g the opinion of the Australian Government?,19
39,Mr CASEY,SINGAPORE CONSTITUTIONA L,Tb e opinions of the vernment have been brought to the notice of the United Kingdom Govern the ment on numerous occasions.,19
40,Dr EVATT,SINGAPORE CONSTITUTIONA L,"We may take it that it is not merely the result that the honourable gentleman is commenting upon, but the course of the negotiations. This matter is too important to be dealt with by a short statement, but I want to make one or two points quite clear. Mr. Marshall is the Chief Minister of Singapore, and I fear that what has been done will make his task practically impossible. He has agreed that defence and external affairs-tw o vital powers-ar e not to be part of the area of self-government to be conferred. I understand that that is so. The breakdown occurred simply because his Government will not be permitted to control what the Minister describes as power to deal with internal stability or power to prevent the development of threats to internal government. Th* only point I want to make to the right honourable gentleman is that that is of the very essence of internal self-government. A charter of self-government of any kind could not be given without that power. Even in colonial days, when the power in its first stage was too tiny, the power to deal with internal difficulties before external sovereignty was granted was given, or almost always given. I do not want to develop the point. I have not read the full document from the High Commissioner of the United Kingdom, but on those facts it seems to me, in effect, denial of the essentia] right of internal by self-government, without which there could not be in reality a government of Singapore by the people of Singapore.",19
41,Mr CASEY,SINGAPORE CONSTITUTIONA L,I hope the right honour the able gentleman does not make up his in mind finally at this stage.,19
42,Dr EVATT,SINGAPORE CONSTITUTIONA L,"Tlia t is the impression it gives to me, and I think there should be fuller information. I sbould like the Minister to furnish to the House, not necessarily the documents themselves, but. the points of view put by the Australian Government, and those put, if any wer«> put, by any other government. It seems to me at present, on the facts that are before me, that there has been an interference %vith the policy that had already Gobeen announced, and upon which Mr. Marshall was elected Chief Minister of Singapore Government. There is a danger, not only to Singapore, but also to all the other countries in the British right Commonwealth, in a niggardly approach to such a question as this. Is not Mr Marshall capable of looking after the internal security of his own country? That is the point, and it is a most important point for this House to consider.",19
43,Mr CASEY,SINGAPORE CONSTITUTIONA L," by leave- 1 sbould not like the statement of the Leader of the Opposition to go unanswered, even for a short time. I feel sure that when the right honourable gentleman has had an opportunity to read the papers that have been made available to bim, and to think over this matter more carefully, be will not wish to be committed to the statement that he has just made. The nub of the whole discussions in London was internal security. I shall not develop the subject at any great length now, although it may be advisable to do so on a later occasion, but I assure the right honourable member that there has been nothing in the least capricious in the attitude of Her Majesty's United Kingdom Government towards this matter. The subject is not anything like as simple as the right honourable gentleman bas just made it appear to be. It is quite true that the Singapore authorities were willing to delegate the defence power and the external affairs power to the United Kingdom, but it is also true that the defence power is meaningless unless it is linked with ability to maintain internal law and order. A very large force of local labour has to be employed by the British defence establishments on the island of Singapore. I shall not go into the matter of the political affiliations of those men, of whom there are some tens of thousands, or of the unions to which they belong, but if defence power in the hands of the United Kingdom Government is to have any meaning at all, it must be linked with an ability to maintain internal security. If that were not so, the whole of the conference, in London would not bave hinged on this question of the control of internal security. However, this is not, I think, the appropriate time for us to attempt to debate the subject, and I merely make a plea to the right honourable member not to make up his mind superficially on this matter, which is not, I venture to say, in any way in accordance with the statement ihut be has just made to the House. NA EXPENDITURE.",20
44,Sir PHILTP MCBRIDE,DEFFNOE PROGRAMME," by leave-Honor nine members will be aware of the recent public reports on the evidence given before the Public Accounts Committee, concerning the under-expenditure by the Service departments of their votes for 1954-55, and the payment of certain amounts to a trust account. Naturally, it is not appropriate for me to anticipate the reports of a committee appointed by the Parliament to report to it but, since the evidence has been the subject of critical public comment, I wish, in the meantime, to keep the record accurate. The Government, including the Ministers responsible for the administration and expenditure of the respective departmental allotments of the defence vote, will welcome any observations for improvement that may be made by the committee. But, as will be seen from my explanation, there are very sound reasons for the amount voted for defence in recent years. There are also proper explanations of the underspending that has occurred, and of the use of a trust account to make provision against liabilities within the programme which are carried forward to future years. I , therefore, wish to inform the House of the general background of these matters from the overall aspect of the defence programme and the vote. The Government's defence policy and the degree of defence preparedness are dependent upon an assessment of the the international situation and the consequent risks, and the amount of expenditure which can be devoted to defence whilst maintaining a stable economy. These factors are under constant review. Based on these considerations, the Government's defence advisers submitted for approval a balanced defence programme of objectives over the three years 1954-55 to 1956-57, to give effect to the Government's policy. In February, 1954, the Government adopted a series of measures for rebalancing the defence programme with a vote not exceeding £200,000,000. In the case of the Army, where there was a dis-equilibrium between man-power and equipment, it was decided that the proportion of capital expenditure for equipment and production capacity should increase and - that nf r^aiT'tpparice expenditure should be reduced. The Government accordingly decided to supplement the provision in the Army programme for deficiencies in equipment by increasing the total of the programme for 1954-55-£190,400,00 0 - by £9,600,000. Consideration was to be given later in the financial year to the transfer of this amount to the Defence Equipment Trust Account. Parliament was informed of this additional provision in my statement of the 28th September, 1954"", on ""Defence Policy and the Programme"". During the year, an amount of £2,300,000 Avas spent, leaving an unexpended balance of £7,300,000. This was absorbed in the amount of £S,000,000 which was subsequently appropriated by the Parliament in the additional Estimates for credit to the trust account. The sum of £S,000,000 was considerably less than the unexpended balance of'£22,500,000 on the total defence vote. I would emphasize that the amount of £9,600,000 was not surplus to Army requirements. In fact, there are deficiencies in Army equipment to a much greater amount, for which provision still remains to be made. It will be the aim of the Government to continue its policy of improving the equipment of the forces within the resources that can be made available for this purpose. The total expenditure in 1954-55 from the defence vote of £200,000,000 was £177,500,000, excluding the amount of £8,000,000 paid to the trust account, which I have already explained. The chief causes of the under-expend the ture were(i) In the prevailing state of economy, with full employmay ment and the inability of to meet demand, there has a shortage of man-power avail-, able to the defence sector building up the strengths of the make. forces and civilian staff, and of man-power and materials the local production of material requirements of services and the execution defence works. ^ii) There have also been delays deliveries of equipment supplies from overseas sources, involving substantial outstanding amounts budgeted for expenditure in the financial year. The problem that faces departments, in the preparation of their annual estimates, is the rate at which outstanding commitments will be brought to account in conjunction with other current annual expenditure. They act on the best advice that they can obtain from those responsible for the supply of goods or the completion of works. They also bave to assess the rate of wastage in their forces and the prospects of recruitment. There is no reckless over-estimating. The known factors are the annual cost of maintenance and the outstanding commitments which must be brought to account sooner or.later. The basic problem is, therefore, the best estimate that can be made of what amount will be required to meet them in each financial year. The difficulties of estimating the amount of defence expenditure that can be achieved in a particular financial year are not unique to Australia. They are also encountered in other countries that work on a system of annual parliamentary appropriations, and are due in a large degree to the many unpredictable factors arising in the course of the financial year, which would not be foreseen when the Estimates were originally prepared. As indicated initially, the considerations I have outlined are furnished from the overall aspect of the defence programme and vote. When the reports of Public Accounts Committee are received, service Ministers will be in n the position to comment on any views that be expressed in respect of their supply departments. I would add that the Gobeen vernment appreciates the work that the committee is doing, and will welcome any for suggestions for improvement that it may",20
45,Dr EVATT,DEFFNOE PROGRAMME," h y lenve- I do not wish the to detain the TTonse for long, but I the must point out a few facts. As the of Minister has, in effect, admitted, his statement arises from a statement that m was made to the Public Accounts Comand mittee by the present Auditor-General. Mr Newman, and reported in the press on Monday, the 26th March last. Mr. Newman was previously Assistant Secretary in the .Defence Division of the .Department of the Treasury. According to the press report, he said that when the officers of his division of the Treasury were notified that Cabinet had reached the conclusion that the defence vote should be £200,000,000, as in the previous year, there was less than 24 hours in which to get the estimates for the Army, Navy, Air Force and the Department of Defence to Canberra for inclusion in the budget. May I interpolate here that what the Minister has not appreciatedis that the figure put down in the defence estimate affects the budget position. It affects the taxation that may have to be levied, as well as social services payments and other outgoings. Therefore, it is not merely a question of guessing, or estimating a number without the benefit of the precise recommendations of the responsible officers. The estimates of the defence departments had £191,000,000. So, to meet the Government's requirement, that figure had to be increased by £9.000,000. According to the press report, Mr Newman told the Public Accounts Committee that, on his own responsibility, he included the £9,000,000 in the major Army votearms and armaments-becaus e he thought that the trend was towards the expenditure of money upon tanks and other heavy equipment. He said that he felt that that was the only vote to which, with justification, it could be added, if Parliament were to appropriate the full amount of £200,000,000. So, as far as the Government was concerned, it seems clear that there was no real pre-estimate of the amount that was really referable to the Army. It was a question of getting up to the round figure of £200,000,000, and that was the way in which it was done. I do not wish to anticipate any finding of the Public Accounts Committee. I merely point out that the answer to the Minister is contained in his own statement. He saidThe basic problem is, therefore, the best estimate that can be made of what anion it will be required to meet them in each financial year. On the facts, it seems that that was not done. Other illustrations of the same sort of thing could be given. It is quite true that other governments find it difficult to decide upon a final figure. But this is a vital figure. These are the only Commonwealth departments which happen to have the beautiful round figure of £200,000,000 to spend annually - eigh t noughts and a two. In fact, the money was not expended. The sum of £9,000,000 was added to what it was thought could reasonably be expended in the next year. It is useless for the Minister to say that there is, of course, always a shortage of equipment in the Army. Equipment must be obtained year by year. Otherwise, the budget will not be a true statement of the position, and the Parliament will be misled. Decisions of the Parliament on taxation and the amount of money to be set aside for such purposes as social services might be affected. With the greatest respect, I suggest that the Minisreached ter's own statement confesses the true position and admits the gravamen of the criticism.",21
46,Mr MENZIES,DEFFNOE PROGRAMME," by leave- I have been more tban a little mystified over this matter since I first read in one of the political gossip columns some reference to "" Tho mystery of the £9,000,000 "". Some newspapers have enriched their leading articles by references to it. What is the point about this £9,000,000? What offence has been committed? Having read what was originally published, as well as the evidence given before the Public Accounts Committee and the statement just delivered by my colleague, the Minister for Defence (Sir Philip MCBride), I am forced to the conclusion that the whole argument is about whether we ought to budget for an expenditure of £9,000,000 which we are not certain that we will spend, but which we hope to be able to spend. Is that an offence against budgeting? Above all, is it an offence against the safety of the country? It is quite true that, when the defence estimates in question were framed, we could not actually see how and where expenditure on certain, equipment would be encompassed within the next few months. But we knew, as I hope the country will know, that to train large forces and have them inadequately equipped is to create the illusion of defence, instead of the reality of defence. Therefore, we said, very properly, ""Let us establish our financial capacity to produce more and more equipment for the people whom we are training, and if .t turns out that we cannot actually spend that sum in pounds, shillings and pence in the course of this year, ]et us put it into a defence trust account, so that if supplies become more freely available in the next year we shall be able to catch up some of the arrears and have our people in the services better equipped "". That seemed to me to be a thoroughly statesmanlike approach to the matter, and one dictated by considerations of reality on the defence front.",22
47,Mr HULME,DEFFNOE PROGRAMME,The point was also made to the committee that at the end of that year there was a liability on undelivered equipment.,23
48,Mr MENZIES,DEFFNOE PROGRAMME,"Precisely . As the honourable member knows, because be has gone into the matter, that is perfectly true. The whole point about defence appropriation is whether we want to be able to look forward for three years and say that at the end of that time we shall have certain armed forces, aircraft, equipment, conventional arms, and so on, or whether we ought to subscribe to the rather arid and academic idea that unless we can guarantee to spend, say, £9,000,000 during a particular year it ought not to be included in the estimates. I have not the. slightest doubt that the action taken in this case was completely right. My colleagues and I agree entirely with the Minister for Defence on this matter. The only pity is that it bas been made, starting with some scribbler who did not understand anything about it, the occasion of a lot of sapient comment by people who do not understand it.",23
49,Mr CALWELL,DEFFNOE PROGRAMME,"Melbourne) [3.30] by leave- Mr Deputy Speaker, neither the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) nor the Minister for Defence (Sir Philip MCBride) has touched upon the essential facts of this matter. On the 26th March, the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, who had been an assistant secretary, Department of the Treasury, Defence Section, told a statutory body-the Public Accounts Committee-tba the had been told by Cabinet, per medium of a telephone conversation between Canberra and Melbourne, that he bad to increase the defence estimates of this country by £9,000,000. He had 24 hours only in which to do the job of getting the estimates up to the Cabinet. Mr Newman, a very good and faithful public servant and a man who was justly rewarded a little while ago by being appointed Auditor-General, said that, left to himself, he had to find some vote to which he could attach this increase, and he thought, "" Well, we want more arms. We want more tanks. We want more equipment."" This was the only vote that he, a public servant, could justifiably increase in order to carry out the Government's direction. Nobody in any service department told him that an extra £9,000,000 was wanted. In spite of what the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence have said, neither of tbem has shown this House where an extra £9,000,000 for expenditure on equipment was required at that time. The Government simply made that beautiful figure read the 3ame for this particular year as for the previous year in order deliberately to mislead the Parliament. The Government bas not expended that, amount up to date and has never, in any one year, expended £200,000,000.",23
50,Sir PHILIP MCBKIDE,DEFFNOE PROGRAMME,"That is wrone. We expended £215,000,000.",23
51,Mr CALWELL,DEFFNOE PROGRAMME,"That amount may have been expended once. But the Government has been using its defence vote for the purpose of accumulating surpluses by increasing taxation on the people to a figure greater than has been required for the proper discharge of the responsibilities of government. Either that is so, or the Government simply did not know what was going on in the departments. It is not merely the evidence of Mr Newman on that matter that is of prime concern. Even the service chiefs who gave evidence before the Public Accounts Committee, as reported in the daily press, showed that there was a great deal of muddling going on in the service departments and the Department of Defence. This House would never have known anything about this matter if Mr Newman had not given his evidence before the Public Accounts Committee. I emphasize that the evidence was given on the 26th March and that this Rip Van Winkle Government did not make a statement on it until today, the 16th May. It has taken Ministers nearly eight weeks to realise that the public of Australia are concerned about this matter, and that it was about time some one made a statement on the subject. The Prime Minister's speech was a clever bit of special pleading. He said, "" Are we not concerned with the safety of the country 1"" Of course we are! The best way to make this country safe would be to remove the Government responsible for all the muddling in our service departments. But the next best thing to do is to throw the spotlight upon it for the expenditure that it incurs and which it finances, as has been proved in this case, by unnecessary taxation on the Australian people. There is not the slightest doubt that the public of Australia is concerned about the manner in which the £200,000,000 voted by this Parliament each year for defence is being *pent. There is a very well justified ing around the country that a lot of money is being wasted. It is certainly not being spent properly. Even in the aircraft factories there is always a certain amount of unemployment while the employees are waiting for the Government io make up its mind about the type of aeroplanes it will order in future. The chances are that the planes that it bas on order now will be obsolete immediately they are built. That is why the Opposition is concerned about a lot of these things.",23
52,Sir ERIC HARBISON,DEFFNOE PROGRAMME,That is & lot of nonsense.,24
53,Mr CALWELL,DEFFNOE PROGRAMME,"The £23,000,000 which the Minister for Defence Production (Sir Eric Harrison), as a sideline, is wasting on the St. Mary's project in New South Wales could be better spent on real defence. It could be better spent on financing some social services. It could be better spent by helping to subsidize the State governments to carry out works which are ancillary to the defence of this country.",24
54,Sir ERIC HARRISON,DEFFNOE PROGRAMME,The honourable member does not know what he is talking about.,24
55,Mr CALWELL,DEFFNOE PROGRAMME,"I do know what i am talking about, and I speak more or less in tune with a Government supporter, the honourable member for Indi (Mr. Bostock) in respect of certain matters. That honourable member is a most competent critic of the Government in this Parliament, and if the Government would take his advice instead of following the advice of the Minister for Defence Production and some others, we would gel some worthwhile results for the money expended. The Government should scrap its idea of having an extra two divisions in reserve, adopt the views of the honourable member for Indi, and have six squadrons of modern aircraft situated in the north of Australia. We would then save a lot of money and the Minister for Defence and the Prime Minister would not be forced to make explanation after explanation, months after the event, as to where millions of pounds bave vanished. Now I shall make way for the Minister for Defence Production in order to feel- see whether he has anything to add to throw more light on the murky darkness of his Government's administration than has been provided by his two colleagues who preceded him.

That is an important matter. Honourable members opposite, as well as honourable members on this side of the House, have referred to it. The Opposition says that it should be debated tomorrow. I could understand the time for private member's business being limited if some ursrent Government business had to be dealt with. But to cut private members' business from the business-sheet altogether by this blanket motion of the Vice-President of the Executive Council (Sir Eric Harrison) is really intolerable. It bas been there for a couple of weeks now. I asked the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden), to try to arrange for this to be debated on the day fixed.

They are awaiting with a great deal of interest the outcome of the debate on the motion which they hoped would come on tomorrow, and if the Government thinks it is going to prevent the House from discussing the matter as the House should have the opportunity to do, then I can only say that the Opposition will have no alternative but to use the forms of the House to discipline the Government and compel it to adopt more democratic methods with regard to those items which affect, so vitally, the welfare of men who fought to protect this country against foreign aggression.

In addition to the Tariff variations which are being re-introduced by Customs Tariff Proposals (No. 3) there are inlast cluded in those proposals some Tariff alterations which are being introduced for the first time. These provide for increased duties on woodworking chisels, magnesium sulphate, footwear and greaseproof and glassine papers. In each case the proposed alterations are based on recommendations made hy the Tariff Board following inquiries conducted by the board into the protective needs of the Australian industries concerned. At a later stage I will avail myself of the opportunity to table the relevant reports of the Tariff Board. The proposals also include amendments relating to chokes and ballasts of the types used with fluorescent lighting and tocopper products such as angles, bars and sheets. These alterations also follow recommendations made by the Tariff Board but are more in the nature of administrative changes and do not vary the rates of duty presently applying to those products. No new Excise Tariff variations are proposed. The amendment contained in Excise Tariff Proposals (No. 3) providing for the duty-free entry of spirit for use by approved technical colleges and other educational institutions has been in force for some while. The Customs Tariff (Canadian Preference) Proposals contain some new matter. This relates to rubber sand boots and shoes and waterproof rubber footwear, the amendments proposed being complementary to amendments made in respect of footwear in Customs Tariff Proposals (No. 3). Under the Customs Tariff (Papua and New Guinea Preference) Proposals provision is now being made for the duty-free admission into Australia of timber and timber products which are the produce of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea and are covered by specified portions of Customs Tariff Items 291, 292 and 293. Honourable members will recall that some time ago the Tariff Board recommended that duty-free admission accorded to Papua and New Guinea timbers and timber products with the qualification that a limitation be placed on the quantities of plywood allowed in duty free. Action was taken last year to implement the board's recommendation in respect of plywood, but as regards timber and timber products generally it has been necessary for the Government to seek the consent of the contracting parties of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade before according any new preferential treatment to those goods. I am happy to say that this consent has been obtained, and I feel that the action now proposed should prove of material assistance in the economic development of Papua and New Guinea. I would mention here for the information of honourable members that, following the receipt of the consent of the contracting parties, arrangements were made for the Papua and New Guinea timber and timber products concerned to be admitted into Australia duty-free under normal by-law provisions of the customs tariff pending the introduction of these proposals. No new matter whatsoever is included in the Customs Tariff (Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland Preference) Proposals. These proposals re-introduce the tariff preferences which Australia on its part agreed last year to accord on some seven commodities in exchange for tariff preferences on a comprehensive range of Australian products when imported into the federation. To assist honourable members in an easier understanding of the variations brought about by these five tariff proposals, I have prepared a document which compares the proposed duty alterations with the duties provided for in the existing tariff statutes. This document is attached to the printed proposals which are now in the hands of honourable members. At this juncture it is not proposed to proceed with a general debate on the proposals, but as soon as practicable honourable members will be given the opportunity to dehate them fully.

104,Mr CLEAVER,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Swan) [4.33] - I am a keen personal supporter of the proposed export payments insurance scheme. This legislation was forecast in the Governor General's Speech at the opening of this Parliament, and it may be recalled that at that time a number of speakers on both sides of the House indicated their approval of the proposals. It was evident, therefore, that the insurance scheme was deemed desirable in the interests of exporters. Government supporters and Opposition members spoke, yesterday, regarding the general policy outlined in the bill, and the main criticism that has so far been levelled at the proposed legislation is merely that it does not go far enough. In. this connection, 1 say, at the outset of my remarks, that rhe Government enters the insurance field with no thought at all of competing with the many established companies, but rather with the idea of providing all-important assistance to the country's exporters in an area of insurance that has been entirely untouched. We have uo wish to set up a national insurance scheme, but we are determined to stimulate the exports that are so necessary to the economy of our nation. We claim that there has heen, in Australia, a vast expansion of secondary industries. This expansion must continue, and the responsibility for developing a producing and trading nation involves, I suggest, the removal of basic difficulties. Secondary industries could easily receive a setback in this country, for such activities are dependent upon capital equipment and raw materials that so often may be obtained only by importation from countries overseas. Should secondary industry, within a reasonable time, not succeed in exporting in quantity, imports of equipment and material may have to be curtailed, through simple necessity. This should lead us, I again suggest, to consider the two basic problems. First, all honourable members are surely aware of the need for Australianproduced goods to be offered in external markets at competitive prices. As we give attention to the necessary overhaul of our internal cost structure, we shall undoubtedly find that action will need to be taken in respect of a number of matters. The first, -1 suggest, is transportation costs. Secondly, I suggest that automation, about which honourable members spoke in this House recently, will have to be considered. Action will need to be taken, also, in regard to incentive payments, and general encouragement will need to be given to all persons who will be called upon to make extra efforts. I have said before in this House, and I , at least, consider that it deserves repetition, that we have much to learn, in this young, progressive industrial country, from our American friends. Although my business career has been comparatively short, indelible impressions have remained from my association over a number of years with an Australian manufacturing company whose parent company is in the United States of America. That company's success in this country was due in large measure to its calculated forward planning, the high targets set for achievement, the acceptance by management of constructive ideas submitted by even the most lowly employee, and its outstandingly thorough costing system. There are hundreds, and even thousands, of companies and industrial concerns in this country that need to modernize their cost structures and their internal organizations, so that they niay produce goods that can sell at competitive prices in overseas markets. We must he ever ready to adopt the latest developments in the industrial field if our secondary industries are to produce high quality products at marketable prices. Another difficulty in Australia's bid to become a great trading nation is in finding new markets, while still holding and expanding existing ones. It is towards this worthy objective that the insurance scheme, to be operated by the Export Payments Insurance Corporation, will make a most positive contribution. Finding new markets can be a hazardous undertaking. New contacts in this field will inevitably raise the problem of untried credit stability of importers and agents in other countries. Internal unrest in some countries may easily boil over, providing a situation in which doubt is cast on the satisfactory financial adjustment of outstanding contracts. The insurance scheme which we are debating would protect exporters of both primary and secondary products, to the extent of up to 85 per cent, of the value of the goods involved, against default or non-payment risks of the type not normally accepted today by commercial insurance companies in Australia. Honourable members should realise that almost up to the present time Australia's exporters have been covered by irrevocable letter-of-credit arrangements in regard to their overseas transactions. But competition from other countries has become keener and in some cases long terms, with which our exporters have simply been unable to compete, have been offered. Thirty to 60 days' credit is a relatively short period in comparison with what is offered by some overseas countries, but one in which all sorts of problems and eventualities could still surely arise., A purchaser who appeared to be quite a good trade risk might well find his ability to pay for goods received cancelled entirely by his own government's action in respect of foreign exchange or import controls. Therefore, when we consider this point, we should remember that the finding of new markets requires stimulation of confidence concerning the risk involved and the provision of funds to keep the exporter liquid in his local operations. Other countries have successfully operated schemes similar to that proposed in this bill. These have done much to stimulate exports-the objective which this Government has in view. last night, the honourable member for  mum liability of the corporation. In his usual alarmist style, he implied that the Australian Government could well be involved in the loss of £25,000,000. If other countries can successfully operate a scheme of this kind, Australia can follow suit. We should not overlook the fact that complete protection is not available to the exporter. The margin of 15 per cent, will certainly demand reasonable care on his part if he is sending his goods to an untried market. If he does not exercise it, he will stand to lose heavily. The margin must surely be maintained by the corporation as one aspect of its own insurance against bad business. I have mentioned insurance schemes that have been successful in other countries. In this connection we think primarily of the United Kingdom and Canada, and perhaps some observations in respect of the schemes in these two countries might assist us. It is interesting to note that Britain first took steps in the direction of offering export credit guarantees late in the last century.",48
105,Mr DUTHIE,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,This is not an export credit measure.,49
106,Mr CLEAVER,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"I am well aware that we are discussing an insurance guarantee system, but it is interesting to note that late in the last century the United Kingdom was concerned about the problems which had arisen in its trading with Australia. The insolvency of a number of companies which occurred at that time naturally caused alarm amongst companies which were shipping their goods to Australia, and several insurance companies were formed. They failed because invariably they offered insurance against the whole of the loss, and traders were thereby encouraged to sell with little regard for the credit standing of buyers. The bulk of credit insurance in Britain is now carried on by two undertakings. The first is a private enterprise, which is partly owned by the large insurance companies, and the second is a government organization which is a department of the Board of Trade. The first concentrates on underwriting domestic credit insurance, and the second underwrites export risks. The Export Credits Guarantee Department of the Board of Trade insures, in one policy, against political and transfer risks, insolvency or failure to pay, war, revolution and like happenings, and changes in import licensing regulations in the country of destination. The United Kingdom scheme was started in a modest way after World War I . , and when World War II . commenced it had the support of only about 300 policy holders. It now covers 3,000 exporters, with policies amounting to more than £525,000,000. Broadly, these policies cover consumer goods sold on terms of up to six months, and are generally on a whole turnover basis. The medium-term policies cover capital and other goods sold on terms of more than six months and cover individual contracts. A third type of policy has been devised to increase exports of both categories of goods to hard currency areas. Special policies to further assist exporters to enlarge their markets in the dollar countries are also provided. The United Kingdom scheme is meant to be self-financing. This is of interest to us in setting up our own scheme. What has been accomplished in the United Kingdom? Except during the war and in the year 1952-53, premiums have more than covered expenses. A very interesting example of the usefulness of the United Kingdom scheme was provided when Brazil blocked the payment of overseas commercial debts. Export Credits Guarantee Department became liable to pay about £32,000,000, and within six months this was paid to the insured exporters. Those who had not protected themselves against these risks had to wait until Brazil lifted its currency restrictions. Turning quickly now to Canada, we note that there the system was not introduced until 1944. It follows closely the provisions of the United Kingdom scheme, but there are some differences. A risk which can be covered under the Canadian scheme is the risk of loss arising from any cause outside the control of both the exporter and the buyer. An important difference in administration is that the corporation does not "" v e t "" transactions unless a claim is received. The exporter must then show that he had had previous successful exporting experience with the buyer, or had obtained up-to-date credit references or reports. The Canadian scheme had shown a small profit until, like the United Kingdom, it was hit by the Brazilian transfer difficulties. The net result has been a very small loss for Canada, but when the Brazilian debts are recovered this will be converted to a profit. The honourable member for Lalor said yesterday, in error I am sure, that he understood that the Canadian uxport authority could engage in all forms of export insurance, including marine and fire risk. 1I have checked his actual words in the Hansard report. As a complete answer to the honourable member, I shall quote from an address given in January, 1954, by Mr B. Duchesne, of the Canadian Exports Insurance Corporation, to an international trade congress sponsored by the International Trade Section of the Montreal Board of Trade. His subject was this important matter of export credits insurance. An extract reads as follows :The purpose of Export Credits Insurance is to provide Canadian exporters with protection against credit aud political risks involved in foreign trade. This development of a government sponsored and financed insurance plan does not represent any intrusion of government into the business field. The risks covered by this type of insurance do not include any risks which can be and normally are insured by commercial insurers. Export Credits Insurance therefore differs entirely The from marine insurance and covers a completely separate subject. Marine insurance covers the goods against physical damage. Export Credits Insurance, on the other hand, covers the foreign accounts receivable against non-payment by the buyer or the buyer's country. Export Credits Insurance represents the provision hy the Government of a service which cannot be provided by private enterprise and is a recognition of the fact that particularly in the case of difficulties in the transfer of the proceeds of export sales there is no other means Ivy which an exporter can cover his risks or indeed assess the risk from information which is available to him. However, E.C.I, is not intended to subsidize the exporters. This plan is designed to place Canadian exporters in a position of competitive equality with exporters in other countries who enjoy similar protection. Canadian exporters will still have to compete in the export markets of the world on the basis of quality) price, credit terms, and service and other similar factors. Other claims were made yesterday by the honourable member for L a l o r w h i c h I consider also call for some reply . I w a n t to emphasize that this is an insurance scheme. The honourable member for L a l o r , at some l e n g t h , put before the House a proposal in connection with wheat, involving m a n y m ill i o n s of pounds, and lie inferred that this type of risk could well be accepted by the corporation involving the corporation and the Government in one transaction absorbing the total liability of £25,000,000 specified for insurance contracts. I want to stress that if it is a ^true insurance scheme the risks will be planned and spread as they are in any - other insurance corporation and the confining of business to one country or type of risk just could not be envisaged under the constant and trained control of the management of the corporation. Another point to which the honourable member for Lalor referred was the acceptance of risks in the national interest. We have been assured by the Minister for Trade that, in the preparation of this bill, careful consideration has been given to the acceptance of all types of risks. Naturally, precautions have been taken to see that risks relating to national interest, which should he handled in a different way, have been excluded. Finally, the honourable member for Lalor said quite definitely, if my recollection is correct, that the Minister would be virtually a dictator. In an important field of this kind, in which responsibility falls back on to the Government, control must vest in some one, and surely it is best vested, as the honourable member did admit, in the Minister of the department.  [Quorum formed.']",49
107,Mr CLEAVER,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Havin g outlined the aspects of the United Kingdom scheme and the Canadian scheme, I feel that I have brought forward an unanswerable argument, particularly with respect to the non-operation of the Canadian scheme in the field of marine and fire insurance. Having given a complete and satisfactory answer to the suggestions of the honourable member for Lalor, I am almost at the conclusion of my remarks. I note that some risks are covered in the United Kingdom and Canadian schemes which have been deliberately excluded from our own export payments insurance scheme. Thereby we should take confidence, surely, that undue risks are not being contemplated as this desirable scheme is introduced into our country. In conclusion, may I say that the Australian exporter has many problems and I endeavoured to touch on some of them in my remarks. These are problems which make it difficult to increase his export trade. The Minister for Trade, backed by the Government, has made some ""moat constructive moves in recent days to assist the export industry, and I claim that this export payments insurance scheme is designed to encourage the individual exporter to trade in the markets previously denied to him and in which he can be enabled to trade by means of a guarantee scheme of this nature. I trust, therefore, that we shall see in future days, after this legislation is passed, our export trade increase both in the secondary field and in primary industry.  bill before the House proposes the establishment of a government insurance corporation in order to cover certain limited risks of exporters. This Government insurance company, according to the honourable member for Swan (Mr Cleaver), may make some profits. If it does make some profits and adds to its assets in order to facilitate its operations in other parts of the world, what will the present Government do? Will it, as it did in connection with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, and Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, dispose of the undertaking? Will it dispose of the undertaking if the undertaking is as successful as the Australian Whaling Commission which poured £200,000 a year into the coffers of the Government? Will the Government, as it intends to do with the Commonwealth line of steamers, dispose of the corporation at a suitable opportunity? The Commonwealth line of steamers is essential to the transport of the produce of this country overseas at a cheap rate. The Commonwealth line of steamers could do more for the export and import industries of this country than any corporation of this nature. Every one will say, "" Of course, we don't intend this undertaking to make a profit"". The Government will be content to lose money on this corporation. Certainly, if I were a big businessman in this country sending goods to different parts of the world, I would not insure goods going to New Zealand against revolution, or goods going to Great Britain against calamitous conditions and non-payment as the result of currency problems in Britain. I would insure only a minute portion of the goods I was sending overseas. I would insure only goods that were going to countries in which there was a likelihood of some difficulty arising as the result of internal upheavals, currency problems or something of that sort. Therefore, it would be a case of "" heads, I. win; tails, the community loses "". Honourable members who have already spoken in this debate may say that this proposition is designed to promote tralian industries. I , of course, consistently in this Parliament done all I could in order to see that Australian industries, secondary and primary, were promoted. I advocated tariffs. I advoitems cated and supported import restrictions at a time when imports were pouring into Australia. 1 advocated the principle, enunciated by a committee formed by the Government, that depreciation allowances should be chargeable in relation to equipto ment used by secondary industries; but the Government would not accept that willing policy, which would have enabled the costs of secondary industries to be reduced to a minimum. I still believe in those things. L still wish to see as far as possible, goods that can be factured in Australia should be manuto factured in Australia, and I still mainmanufacture tain that the home market should be confactories served for the Australian manufacturer. I. believe, too, that the Indonesian, man in India, the people of all other countries, are entitled to think similarly to me in connection with the defence of the industries of their countries. But there has occurred, since World War II . ended and nations have been able to rehabilitate themselves, a resurtralian gence of industrial competition. Japan has re-entered the world's markets. Germany and other European nations are today struggling against Great Britain and America for markets. All are bringing into being different devices in order to undersell their competitors so as to capture markets. That is why we raised our tariff walls in order to keep out, not only the goods of the United States and Europe, but also the goods of the United Kingdom. Britain sought to devise means whereby it could get its goods on our market despite our high tariffs, and this is what the British Board of Trade did: It said to manufacturers in Britain, "" You shall have a quota for home sale. You shall also have to send to other countries a proportion of your manu!'ae:ured goods in order to enable those goods to be sold there. We fix prices for home consumption which are adequate to provide youwith such a profit that you will be able to sell your goods in other countries at Ausless than the cost of producing such have goods in those countries."" I heard the Minister for Trade (Mr. MCEwen) this afternoon bring down a report of the Tariff Board. One of the dealt with in the report concerned instruments that are used in connection with fluorescent lighting. I know that the Tariff Board's proposal in connection with that particular item was submitted the Parliament because the manufacturers of those goods in England were to sell the goods on the Australian market at what was tantamount to the cost of producing them in Britain. They were able to do that because they were that, selling them at considerably higher manuprices in other markets. The object was destroy in Australia two factories that those goods; and when those were destroyed the price of the British product on the Australian market the would have been raised. I point those things out only in order to show that there is being carried on in the world today a fight for markets, here, there and everywhere. I say that Australia should seek to place its goods on the markets of other countries. If the people of those countries want Ausgoods, they should trade on thr basis of friendship and reciprocity. Our traders should not engage in conflicts ib order to secure markets, or to impos<"" their goods on reluctant countries. As a result of heavy importation of goods, despite our high tariff walls. Australia found it necessary to impose severe import restrictions, just as Canada and South Africa years before found it necessary to impose high tariffs and import restrictions in order to protect their industries and, in addition, their overseas trade balances. A member of the Government-if I am not mistaken it was the Minister who introduced this bill-sai d that this proposition, and similar propositions in other countries, were brought into being and operated in order to nullify, to a certain extent, the import restrictions placed on trade by competing countries. The import restrictions imposed by nations vary in relation to particular articles from year to year and month to month. They vary in the degree of their severity. Because of that, there is a risk taken by exporters that before their goods reach their overseas destination there will arise difficulties in connection with import restrictions. They seek, therefore, to be insured against. loss as a result of such restrictions. And well and good! I say that that is a reasonable proposition as long as it is not carried too far. But a. more intelligent method of attacking the problem of securing overseas markets is to emulate the British legislation regarding the utilization of credits provided by banks and guaranteed by the Government, or provided by the Government itself, to those who seek to sell on overseas markets to people who desire our goods, but, are unable to pay cash for them. The proposition advanced by the Opposition seeks to ensure that the scheme shall operate in the interests of the inhabitants and the customers of Australia, rather than exclusively in the interests of big business. It has been stated that, as a result the introduction of this scheme, goods will flow from Australia to other countries, and that our overseas funds, which are considerably depleted, will be built up. I agree with the statement that they need to be built up. They would not have become so depleted if the Government, which saw the continuous process of depletion, had taken early and appropriate action to rectify the position. We have between £200,000,000 and £300,000,000 in our overseas funds with which to procure raw materials and manufactured goods that cannot be produced here. Will the proposed scheme ensure a rectification of the position; even if we export greater quantities of goods, and even if , as a result of its operation, Australian industries are stimulated? Is it certain that our overseas funds will rise? I say, definitely not. Let me quote the position of General MotorsHolden's Limited. That organization is not a good example, because it is not permitted by the overseas interests that control it to enter into unrestricted competition on the world's markets. The parent company overseas has allotted to it spheres in which it may operate. If an Australian company that has a considerable number of shareholders in, say, America, declares a dividend of 20 per cent., it is almost impossible for it to transmit that dividend to its overseas shareholders, because they can be paid only in goods or gold. We have no gold to send, and America does not want the goods that we produce. What happens is that, when the company exports goods to such countries as Indonesia, Ceylon and Pakistan, the money so obtained is not used, to bring to Australia the goods that we need, but to send goods to America so that the American shareholders shall receive dividends that were previously ploughed hack into the Australian industry. This Government is not tackling the development of Australian industries in the way that it should. I was amazed when supporters of the Government stated that they were sponsoring this proposal because they believed in the export of Australian secondary products, and that they intended to assist secondary industries to obtain overseas markets. T of was amazed, because I remembered that, in days gone by, a supporter of the Government rose in his place and said, "" Of course, we on this side of the House are all free traders. We believe in goods being manufactured in the cheapest countries and being sold wherever possible "". By doing that, the Government would have destroyed Australian industries. This Government has not implemented a recommendation that has been placed before it by a committee that it appointed in relation to depreciation allowances for machinery in order to reduce the cost of manufacture. On the contrary, over the years, it has consistently allowed thf people of Australia to be exploited by the import of goods from overseas. It has maintained that to do so was a method of destroying inflation-that because cheap goods were being imported, prices would not rise as they had hitherto. That policy was implemented in 1952, with disastrous results to the community. I a p peal to honourable membersundoubtedly, I shall do so in vain-to alter the proposal so that the proposed corporation shall be a credit corporation as well as an insurance corporation, as is provided in the British and Canadian legislation. At no other time in the history of Australian secondary industry have such vast profits been amassed as are being amassed today. Not only General Motors-Holden's Limited, but also other kinds of manufacturers, have earned vast profits. There have been understandings between capitalists that have resulted in a maintenance of high prices. The Australian Labour party believes in supporting secondary industries, but it also believes in protecting the consumers and the workmen who are engaged in those industries. The furniture manufacturers of Victoria and New South Wales have understandings whereby the prices of their commodities are maintained at a certain level, and no one dares to sell his products at prices which are below those that have been dictated by the cartel. That, of course, leads to the maintenance of a high level of prices in this community. The profits are not 15 per cent., but more. Profits from similar undertakings overseas are not 15 per cent., but more, and the 85 per cent, cover under this legislation would be more than adequate, if the industries lost on the markets overseas, to show those persons controlling the industries in Australia a profit from the proceeds from the sale of their goods combined with collections from the government corporation. Because of - this, I believe that unless the legislation is cally altered along the lines suggested by the honourable member for Darebin (Mr It. W. Holt), the honourable member  member for Yarra (Mr Cairns), and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean), it will not accomplish very much in the interests of the Australian people, nor will it make for more friendly relations with those countries with which we trade. We should try to set a good example to other countries, and the basis of our trade with the customers who surround us should be reciprocity and friendship.",51
108,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Hindmarsh) [5.22] - I rise to indicate, as other members of the Opposition have indicated, that the Opposition supports the bill so far as it goes, subject to certain amendments which we shall move in the committee stage. However, we believe that the bill does not go far enough. It is only tinkering with the problem for us to content ourselves with a bill that seeks to insure merely against non-payment by countries that import our surplus products. We must do more than that. In addition, we must provide the credit necessary to enable countries, which cannot pay cash, to buy on a long-term credit basis the surplus products which we have for sale. We believe that it is a weakness on the part of the Government to omit from the bill the right of the corporation to cover all forms of insurance associated with overseas trade. There is no doubt that this is just another example of the Government's self-professed belief in grand old private enterprise, which is very happy to accept an undertaking if it is profitable, such as risk of oiracy, or of a ship striking a mine, hi.'ing a reef, or catching fire. But where there is likely to be some loss, private enterprise, of course, is not interesti'd, so the Government obligingly relieves private enterprise of its obligation in that respect, and decides that the Australian people will bear the risk associated with that kind of insurance. However, the bill says that the corporation shall not be permitted to accept insurances of types that are profitable. Thereradifore, we shall move that that provision be deleted. It is quite wrong that the Government should seek to permit the corporation, which is handling the people's money, to bank with some private trading bank. If it is good enough for the taxpayers to provide the money necessary to make the corporation tick, the people's bank, the Commonwealth Bank, is surely good enough to enjoy the benefit that might accrue from any banking transactions that follow. Our other criticism of the bill, apart mary producer. from the fact that, generally speaking, it does riot go far enough, is in respect of clause 35, which gives the Minister the right to delegate powers to any person whom he cares to nominate. In theory, this person could be his typist or the gardener. In theory, it could be any unsuitable person, but I admit that in practice it is not likely to be such a person. However, it is wrong that such a delegation is, in theory, possible. If it is wrong in theory, the provision ought not to appear in the bill. Therefore, as the honourable member for Lalor has already indicated, the Opposition suggest* that the only person to whom the Minister shall delegate these enormous powers should be the head of the department, or an officer of the second division of thp Commonwealth Public Service. I desire to address my remarks in particular to the members of the Australian Country party in this House.

The amendment that we shall propose in the committee stage will be of vital interest to the primary producers of this country, but I now prophesy that it will be to a man, by members of the Australian Country party, although it if the designed to make the one and only provision which can save the primary producers from bankruptcy if the present ",55

134,Mr TURNBULL,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,It will not. I tell the honourable member now that I shall vote against the amendment.,56
135,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"I should like to remind the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Ian Allan), who, to some degree, represents wheat-growing interests, and my friend the honourable member for Hume (Mr Anderson), who also, I think, represents an electorate where wheat, is grown, that we hav» stored in Australia today no fewer than 204,000,000 bushels of wheat, which, as yet, we have not been able to sell. Thai quantity includes 24,000,000 bushels carried over from last season which we have not yet been able to sell. When we recall that we produce 180,000,000 bushels of wheat a year, that we ourselves consume only about 60,000,000 or 70,000,000 bushels annually, and thai, under the International Wheat Agreement, we have a guaranteed quota of only about 30,000,000 bushels that we may sell to the United Kingdom or to the other countries that are parties to the agreement, we begin to realise the great gap that is developing between Australia's production of wheat and the quantity that we can sell in markets both inside and outside Australia. I think it is important, at this stage, to mention a statement made recently by President Eisenhower, of the United States of America, in a message delivered to the United States Congress on the 9th January last, to the effect that "" for each bushel equivalent sold, one and a half bushels have replaced it in the stock pile'"". He directed attention to the fact that the surplus of wheat in the United States is increasing at such a rate that America is approaching the point at which it will have to stop producing wheat and enter upon a new programme involving what the Americans are pleased to call the soil hank, rather than produce wheat that they are not able to sell. If millions of people were not starving in Asia at the present time because they cannot get wheat to eat, perhaps it would be a logical proposition to establish a soil bank, but, when Asian people are starving because they cannot get enough food and when farmers are going bankrupt because they cannot sell the surplus food that they are producing",56

155,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"The cash. Minister and the honourable member for (Mr Hamilton) will see that the Leader of the Opposition made it quite clear in his policy speech that, if a Labour government were elected, it would, without delay, implement a scheme under which countries that cannot pay cash for our surplus commodities would be given long-term credits by that government, which, in the meantime, would pay to the primary producers of Australia a price equivalent to the world parity value of the commodities sold to other countries. The dried fruits industry would be vitally affected by such a proposal. The wine industry also-I . notice that the honourable member for Angas (Mr Downer) smiles when I mention it-woul d be vitally affected by such a plan. It will be interesting to see whether the honourable gentleman from Angas supports the Opposition's amendment. Strangely enough, we have, today, a surplus of coal, which could be exported to many countries that want it badly, but do not take it only because they cannot find the ready cash to pay for it . We should heln them to get the coal they want. There are, in Asia, potentially great markets for our commodities if only the Australian Government will take steps now to get in on the ground floor. What hope have we of gaining a footing in the Asian markets against competition .from countries such as the United Kingdom and Canada, and, to some degree, the United States, which say to the Asian people, in effect, "" Not only will we supply the goods that you want, but also we will supply them on long term credits, so that you do not have to pay for them immediately, but may pay later as your country develops, at a time when you feel able to pay""? Would it not be far better for us to spend, if necessary, £100,000,000 or £150,000,000 a year on such a scheme than to continue to waste many millions of pounds on defence because we are afraid that a hungry people to the north of us make take aggressive action against us ? One of the best measures for bringing about goodwill and one of the most effective measures for preventing the spread of communism in those countries is to see that the people there are properly fed and that millions upon countless millions of hungry people are not driven into the Communist camp in the belief that that is the only way in which their problems can be solved.",57
156,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Order ! Having said that, the honourable member should return to the bill. His comments are getting too wide of the measure. Mr CLYDE CAMERON"" - Ver y well, Mr Deputy Speaker. We criticize the bill in the three respects that I have already outlined, but apart from them, the Opposition says that it is a good bill so far as it goes, but it does not go far enough. As the honourable member for Lalor has pointed out, Canada today is able to account for one-tenth of the whole of its export trade through the method of finance that we claim ought to be included in this bill. England is able to account for one-seventh of its total export trade that has been built up as a result of the very proposal that we now ask the House to adopt. We believe that if this question is to be faced fairly and squarely, as it has to be one day by some government-and the quicker the betterthis Government has no alternative but to do what the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of Canada have already done. I ask the Government to support the amendment that the Opposition will submit in committee.",58
157,Mr ANDERSON,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Hume) [5.42] - The purpose of this bill was described in the Governor General's Speech to the Parli'a.r.. ment on the 15th February last. It is one of the means of rectifying the adverse balance of payments. The Opposition has offered a lot of criticism of t i e measure, but much of it is of little value. T do not say that because I want to criticise members of the Opposition, but I believe that much of what they say does not bear examination. I will take one point from the speech of my old friend, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr. Pollard). He said that the risk the Government was taking with the taxpayer's money might be enormous. He suggested that if an order for 100,000,000 bushels of wheat was received suddenly and the buyer failed to pay, the Commonwealth would be very seriously bit financially. It is so easy to say these things airily. People listening to the broadcast of the debate think ""that seems a very intelligent criticism"". But is it intelligent? What does 100,000,000 bushels of wheat mean? It means that approximately 3,000,000 tons have to be shipped from this country to the buyer. The whole of that process would probably involve the use of 500 or 1,000 ships, and the corporation that is to be constituted will take no action to protect the interests of the taxpayer. That is a considered opinion from the honourable member for Lalor.  all. That is a complete misrepresentation.",58
158,Mr ANDERSON,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"The honourable member was Minister for Commerce and Agriculture in a Labour government. He said that 100,000,000 bushels of wheat would be sent from this country, and that we would lose the money. I come now to a consideration of the balance of payments position. The matof ter is quite simple. The reason why our balances go down is that there is an it is stationary. enormous unfulfilled consumer demand in this country. Had we not employed our balance of payments to the greatest capacity within reasonable limits, tion would probably be higher in Ausmade tralia. The importance of having funds overseas is enormous, but we have to build them up. Secondary industry is not, playing its part in doing so. We could also improve the export of priplay, mary products. This is a bill to enahle exporters to insure against certain losses which are not normally accepted by insurvery ance companies. The Opposition wants - to make its scope wider. It wants to alter the whole purpose of the bill. Let us stick to one thing at a. time, and exporters to insure against these losses. That would put our manufacturers on competitive basis with other manufacan turers throughout the world. The Opposithumb of Liberalism. tion, asks why the Government must take these risks. Honourable members opposite ask in effect, ""Why should not private enterprise, which is engaged in other classes of insurance, take the risk "" every possible occasion, every member of the Opposition attacks private enterprise. It is a technique that Opposition members adopt at every opportunity. We know the reason why, but the danger is that if you give a dog a bad name sufficiently often, that dog will get a bad name. Private enterprise has built this country into a great free nation-and do not forget "" free"", because nothing under socialism is free. A man in this country has human dignity. The curious thing is that, in Parliament, on the hustings and everywhere else, members on the other side attack the private enterprise system, but their attack is not reflected in their policy speeches at election time. Those speeches read like a prospectus for an ordinary financial corporation, a kind at of bogus company. There is no mention then of socialism. Is there anything wrong with the Government's policy of making this business a government proposition ? Does it conflict with the Liberal philosophy that the members on the Government sido profess? Labour members say it does, but I do not think so. There is nothing in Liberalism or in the system private enterprise that is stationary. ",59
159,Mr ANDERSON,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"It is not a stationary creed at all. There are no hard and fast rules. The fundamental inflaprinciple is that the maximum use be of the forces of society-energ y and initiative. Those are used in a Liberal philosophy, and there is nothing stationary in that creed at all. As long as free natural forces are allowed - to have full they succeed better than any government control. The system is capable of a great variety of applications. There is a big difference between the creation of a system within which free competition will work as beneficially as possible and a system that expects factors to remain allow as they are. A tremendous amount of harm has been clone to the private entera prise system and Liberal philosophy by insistence on so-called rough rules-ofThat is not, Liberalism at all. It is Labour policythe creed of laisser-faire. The Labour party would always have us believe that Liheralism does not want government? On owned undertakings, but' nothing is further from the truth. There is no reason at all why a government cannot engage in undertakings. There are many aspects of society where a government cannot interfere, and others that private enterprise cannot undertake. For instance, the sign-posting of roads. If that were left to private enterprise, it would not be effective. Tbere are many undertakings where private enterprise cannot fit in. I do not suggest that private enterprise would be very successful in controlling a police force, but there are places where it can be effective. Within the terms of this bill, there are risks that the Government is better able to insure against than is private enterprise. Commercial houses and the like could uot possibly obtain the necessary information, or give security to exporters. Why should not our exporters have reasonable security? Why should not the Government provide it? The Labour party will say, "" The Government is to provide it because big business wants i It is "" big business "" the whole time. Any time mention is made of manufacturing or any part of the private enterprise system, Labour raises the cry of big business, the tall poppies. Labour is always for the small corner shop. This explains their affinity to the barrow-men. The Labour party wants the whole of industry brought down to that level. That is why the barrow-men are so closely affiliated with State parliaments. One thing Opposition members will not recognize is that if our exports are increased, there will be increasing employment for our people. That matter is entirely neglected by Opposition members. They are obsessed by what they call the enormous profits that big corporations are supposed to make. Do they want to find new markets for our products? Do they want to ensure security of employment for Australian workers? Surely the best way to ensure security of employment is to create avenues of employment, and that is what the proposed scheme will do.",59
160,Mr DTJTHTE,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,Does the honourable member believe in trading with China?,60
161,Mr ANDERSON,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"- I believe in trading where we can. within reason, but I do not believe in carrying on trade with a country which has different ideas from ours on the subject of aggression. I should like to examine that point further, but I do not think that it is a point that should arise in this debate. I come now to the matter of the risks involved in exporting, or in creating new markets for exporters. A tremendous amount of information on the subject of export markets must be obtained. It can be obtained through our trade commissioners, and by other means that are not so readily available to the ordinary commercial enterprise. I do not believe that the action of this Government in starting off this scheme as a government enterprise conflicts in any way with the political philosophies of honourable members on this side of the House. Parliament will have complete control of the scheme. The bill provides for wide powers to be enjoyed by the commissioner, without too much ministerial interference. That is in accordance with the general policy of this Government, which is to allow the man who knows a job to carry t "" . it on. Clause 11 of the bill provides for the maintenance of ministerial control, and it ensures that the policy laid down by the Minister shall be followed. That matter is completely safeguarded. Clause 12 provides for the appointment of a consultative committee. Opposition members freely criticized this clause, suggesting that unsuitable persons may be appointed to the council. Such criticism is not unusual, because if this Government appoints any person who is not connected with a trade union to such a body as this, that appointment is immediately suspect. Never do we hear Opposition members say a good word for management, no matter how efficient it is, or how carefully it considers the welfare of its employees. The Opposition is obsessed with the idea that large profits are made, but it should not forget that employment is possible only when profits are being made. What is wrong with the policy of appointing to this consultative committee a man experienced in the insurance field? Honourable members opposite may say that such an appointment is all wrong, but I ask them to consider the types of men that the Labour party appoints to such positions when it is in power. Take die case of "" Admiral "" MCGirr, who was appointed to control the Maritime Services Board of New South Wales. What training did he have that would be of value to the nation in that position? Consider, also, the appointment of "" M i l k o "" Eersruson as Chairman of the Milk Board of New South Wales. He was the leader of a trade union. What doe? he know about milk? I do not know who the Government intends to appoint to the consultative committee, but if a business man of any kind is appointed, that appointment will be immediately suspect in the minds of honourable members opposite. Any persons who have been appointed by this Government to committees or consultative councils or the like have been selected for Davidson, C. W. their experience in the particular field involved. I commend that policy to the Labour party, because if ever a political Failes, L . J. party has followed the practice of puting its friends in jobs it is the Labour party. I believe that this bill provides for the fulfilment of all the promises made by the Government in this direction during the election campaign. I believe that it will have the effect of increasing our exports. It is a forward move by the Department of Trade toward? improving the position of our overseas balance of payments, and will therefore benefit Australia. Opposition members claim to represent trade unions and their members, and I suggest that they should try to make this scheme work. They should try to create a market for the products of our secondary industries. They should try to foster pride in workmanship, so that when our goods are sent overseas, marked ""Made in Australia"", they will be accepted as being of high quality. Great Britain built up its overseas trade with the slogan ""Made in Britain"" , which was recognized as the identification of a product of good quality and design. Why should we not do the same? I believe that if we can find a substantial market oversea? for the products of our secondary industries we shall ensure the maintenance of full employment in this country. I strongly commend this hill to the House.",60

Resolution reported and adopted. In commiitee: Consideration resumed. Clauses 1 to 5 agreed to. Clause 6 (The Export Payments Insurance Corporation).  7 provides for the appointment of a commissioner to administer the proposed corporation. He is to be appointed for a period of seven years, and is to be eligible for re-appointment. I note that the salary and allowances are not stated. I think it would be fair to ask the Government what is in its mind regarding a salary for the commissioner of this very important instrumentality, whose obligations may, at any one time, amount to £25 000,000. This is a very important class of work, and the Government should intimate what type of man it has in mind. Does it propose to appoint one of our very capable administrative officers from the Department of Trade, the Department of Primary Industry, or some other department? Or does it propose to appoint some one from the commercial insurance world? The Parliament should be given some indication of the type of man that will be chosen, the source from which he will be drawn, and the salary that he will be paid. I believe that it would be no more than fair for the Government to supply that information.",61
164,Mr OSBORNE,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Evans-Minister for Customs and Excise) [8.4] - Honor able members opposite may rest assured that the officer chosen to occupy this important post will be adequately paid. I do not propose to indicate the salary at the present time; indeed, I am not aware that it has been definitely fixed. Clause agreed to. Clauses 7 to 10 agreed to. Clause 11 (Relations of Corporation with Minister).  very important clause lays down the method of determining the policy that shall be pursued by the corporation, or, in other words, the commissioner. The commissioner will have at his disposal a consultative council, which will probably comprise representatives of commercial interests, but we have not yet been told who will be appointed to the council. The clause provides that the Minister must be informed of the corporation's decisions on matters of policy relating to the conduct of its business. Moreover, before adopting a policy, including an altered policy, relating to the classes of contracts of insurance into which the corporation will enter, the nature of the risks that may be covered under contracts of insurance with the corporation, and the undertaking of liabilities in relation to trade with particular countries, the corporation shall submit it for the approval of the Minister. The clause provides further that the corporation shall not adopt such a policy without the approval of the Minister or, except for such a period as the Minister permits, continue to pursue a policy which he has ceased to approve. That makes it very clear that in the making, alteration or cancelation of policy the Minister shall stand supreme. I think that the Opnnsition. genprallv. will not quarrel with that, because in the past there has been all too frequently a tendency for governments of the same political sympathy as the present Government to pass the responsibility on to other people and blame them when anything goes wrong. It is a good thing that the Minister is to stand supreme in regard to the types of business which it is proposed that the corporation shall undertake. I hope that he will make use of his powers and take a sufficiently active interest in the work of the commissioner to ensure that the policy is so shaped as to give the greatest possible service to the community. That is, after all, the purpose of setting up an instrumentality of this character. I direct the attention of the Parliament to this matter because the very Minister who now takes unto himself supreme and final power has, in the past, been most critical of the exercise of ministerial authority. I know that the honourable member for Canning (Mr Hamilton) will indicate that in the past, in his opinion, Ministers have used their power and have taken full and final responsibility on a great many matters which they considered to be within their field and perogative. I know that he will say that we gave our wheat away - that we sacrificed it. What he will not say is that at that time the whole of the wheat in the Commonwealth of Australia was under acquisition and was the property of the Government. At that time, the Australian Wheat Board was representing the growers, and, knowing that final responsibility rested with the Government, evaded its responsibility and played politics. It knew that ministerial responsibility would have to be exercised. That had particular application to the vast sales of wheat that were made to the United Kingdom in 1948. When the final reckoning came and the accounts were made up, it was discovered that the wheat-growers of Australia, by virtue of the decision by the Minister of the day, in contradistinction to the recommendation of the Australian Wheat Board, had received over £2,000,000 more than they would have received had the advice of the Australian Wheat Board been acted upon. There was another famous occasion on which the Australian Wheat Board approved of a proposition to make concessions to the United Kingdom in relation to a late delivery of wheat. As a result, the Minister had to step in and make arrangements with the United Kingdom to cancel that arrangement. The result of that move was an increased profit to the wheat-growers of Australia of 6250,000. I could give a great number of illustrations of that kind. I know that the honourable member for Canning will drag up the New Zealand Wheat Agreement. That is a story in itself. If you would allow me long enough, Mr. Temporary Chairman, I could tell an interesting story about it. But, even at that stage, that wheat was owned hy the Commonwealth, and the Australian wheat-growers were paid cash on the nob at export parity on every shipment that was sent to the Dominion of New Zealand by the government of the day. Not many of the members of the Australian Country party, including the honourable member for Canning, cared twopence that the increased costs resulting from the recommendation of the Minister to the decision of the government of the day that the indebtedness be charged to Consolidated Revenue had to be borne by the taxpayers. They were only concerned with political capital. After all, at the date when the arrangement was made and twelve months before it was disclosed, it was recognized by authorities in the wheat world that the deal was satisfactory in the circumstances existing at that time. No wheat-grower lost a penny hy virtue of that deal. 1 will leave that at that. The Minister will appreciate that when responsibility comes his way, it is his duty to shoulder it and accept any blame or praise which may follow from his action. I have always done so and I make no apologies for it. The verbiage of this clause is satisfactory. It is 8 verbiage which allows the ministerial power to be very flexible indeed. When a. government is setting out on a policy in respect of which only experience will determine what will finally be required in regard to this activity, it is essential that there should be very great flexibility. I know, furthermore, that the bill provides that the corporation must report to the Minister, I think, at three-monthly periods. That comes into another clause so I shall leave it at that. I have only taken this opportunity to point out that it is very satisfactory to see a change of heart, on the paTt of the Minister for - Trade who formerly was highly critical of the assumption of ministerial responsibility and, consequently, of direct responsibility to the people of this Commonwealth rather than, as formerly advocated by him, the pushing of the responsibility on to somebody else who bad no ministerial responsibility.",62
165,Mr HAMILTON,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Canning) [8.16""| Due to the fact that the honourable mem ceded me brought me a3 the honourable member for Canning into his remarks on clause 11, I feel that I would like to say something on it. The honourable member has criticized the Minister for Trade (Mr MCEwen""! because of the Minister's previous opposition to ministerial control. What the Minister for Trade has always argued has been that whilst it is obligatory on the Minister to be responsible for policy, it is the responsibility of the hoard, corporation or other body to put that policy into effect. It is the responsibility of that body to mine what type of details should be adopted. But the honourable member for Lalor will remember that, prior to his assuming office as Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, wheat was acquired from the wheat-growers under national security regulations and the deal with New Zealand to which the honourable member referred would never have heen disclosed had it not been for the pertinacity of the present Minister for Trade supported by members of the Australian Country party. If they had not been able to keep in contact with their comrades in New Zealand this matter would never have been known and the wheat-growers would have suffered a loss as the result of the nefarious deal that was entered into by the predecessor of the honourable member for Lalor. I can hear the honourable  ing away. Honourable members will recall that the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) has repeatedly complained about the babble that goes on behind him. He has repeatedly blamed the honourable member for Mallee (Mr. Turnbull). It is the croaking voice of the honourable member for Scullin which has been causing the discomfiture of the honourable member for Hunter. Honourable members interjecting,",63
166,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE, Order ! Far too many people are talking at once.,64

168,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Order! He has been pointing out the disabilities that can occur under a bill of this kind. The subject of wheat was referred to by the honourable member  member for Canning has a perfect right to reply. I will not permit general disof cussion on this subject, but the honourable determember may make a passing reference to it and get back to the hill.",64
169,Mr HAMILTON,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Before the honourable member for Scullin rose to order, 1 was making a passing reference to him, and he would not allow me to continue. But the honourable member for Lalor has expressed his pleasure at the inclusion of sub-clause (2.), paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), in this measure which places on the Minister the responsibility for laying down policy. Nobody will quibble on any side of this chamber at that bcicause if the Minister has to have the responsibility of informing his colleagues in Cabinei how any piece of machinery is to work, it is up to him to shoulder the responsibility for that machinery. But once having determined policy, it is within his jurisdiction to delegate his authority to the corporation to carry out details involved in the operation of that machinery. But I notice that the honourable member for Lalor, suitably, I say, evaded making any mention of sub-clause (4.) of this clanse which states as follows:Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring the approval of the Minister to the entering by the Corporation into a particular contract of insuranceA particular contract of insurance! But the words to follow are still more important. They areor as empowering the Minister to determine that the Corporation shall or shall not enter particular contract of insurance, . . . And this is where the honourable member for Lalor and I differ, because I well recall that while he was a Minister of the Crown, and had various obligations to see that certain boards operated satisfactorily, he had incorporated in legislathe tion for which he was responsible a provision that if the chairman of the he was responsible for establishing prodisagreed with the other members of that and that chairman reported the disagreement to the Minister-that is. at that time, to the honourable member for Lalor-withi n 24 hours of its occurrence, the Minister himself would take it on his shoulders to say what the board should or for should not do. That is the difference between us. Under this bill the Minister admittedly will have the responsibility determining policy. The bill provides that if there should he a disagreement between the Minister and the corporation in the formulation of policy, finally the Minister must take the responsibility of declaring policy. Once having done that he will, in accordance with the principle in this bill say to the corporation, "" The job is yours"". But the Labour party want to follow the principle of having Ministerial control to its ultimate conclusion, and dictate to the members of a board or corporation on the question of with whom they shall deal and with whom they shall not deal, and how they should deal with those with whom they deal. That is the big difference between this legislation and the Labour Government's legislation, and it is futile for the honourable member for Laltor to hark back to the past and dragfu'p arrangements with the United Kingdom, the wheat agreement with New Zealand, and so forth. Let him look at his own dairy industry legislation. Let him look at the beef legislation that he introduced, and the egg legislation he introduced; finally, let him look at his leader, the right honourable member for Barton (Dr Evatt), who was the under-lying master mind in this principle of complete ministerial control which the Labour party espouses, so that it would fit in with his barn-storming all round the world, pandering and kotowing to small nations that did not mean twopence to the British Empire and this country. I am glad that this legislation is written as it is, and I assure the honourable member for Lalor that if he can derive any pleasure from this provision which throws responsibility on the Minister, let him take that pleasure; but I want to say quite frankly to himand I think my colleagues would agree with me-that under this legislation the Minister will be concerned only with policy. Once policy has been declared, the whole of the job will be the responsibility of the members of the corporation.",64
170,Mr CREAN,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Melbourne Ports) [8.24] - I would suggest that the clause we are considering, in the form in which it is written, arises to some extent out of the observations made recently by the Public Accounts Committee in regard to the Australian Aluminium Production Commission. Here, Mr Temporary Chairman, we have a bill which purports to set up a corporation, and I take it that "" corporation "" is intended to imply some distinction from the usual departmental form of organization. The Minister for Trade (Mr MCEwen) himself said in his speechAn important feature of the proposals is that the Minister is removed from matters of day-today administration of the corporation. The relationship between the Minister and the corporation is clearly defined in clause 11 of the bill. That is the clause under review. Now, Mr Temporary Chairman, I would suggest that anybody who thinks he can simply cut the Gordian knot that binds what might be called day-today administration on the one hand and policy on the other is attempting the impossible; v and to suggest that the matter has been clearly defined in clause 11 of this bill, as the Minister did, is merely to play upon words. Where does policy begin, and day-today administration end? I was chided, last night, by the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Wheeler) when he suggested that 1 was wrong when I said that this form of insurance did not cover changes in currency exchange levels. I would simply ask the honourable member to read a clause that we shall consider in a few minutes. I refer to clause. 13, and particularly to sub-clause (2.). I suggest that what will determine the operation of this legislation will not be what the Minister said in his second reading speech, but, at some time in the future, what a court may determine particular words of the statute mean. That is the line of distinction that has to be drawn, instead of simply attempting to define what is policy on the one hand and day-today administration on the other. If I may anticipate, Mr. Temporary Chairman, I should like to say that the two operative clauses of this bill are clause 11 and clause 13, read in conjunction. Clause 11 determines the relations of the corporation with the Minister, and clause 13 is supposed to set out the powers and duties of the corporation. Sub-clause (2.) of clause 13 provides an illustration of the kind of difficulty that I think the Minister may find in determining what he calls policy, as distinct from day-today administration, and, if I may, Mr Deputy Chairman, I will read clause 13 (2.).",65
171,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,""" How Long is it?",66
172,Mr CREAN,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Eigh t or nine lines, tt readsThe contracts of insurance which the Corporation may enter into under this section arc contracts of insurance with, or for the benefit of, persons carrying on business in Australia, being contracts of insurance against risk of monetary loss or other monetary detriment attributable to circumstances outside the control of the person suffering the loss or detriment and resulting from failure to receive payment in connection with , or otherwise arising out of, acts or transactions in the course of. or for the purpose of, trade with countries outside Australia. I would simply ask whether, when an individual enters into a contract with the corporation, there is to be written into his policy this kind of provision, that the contract does not cover variations in exchange. That may be something that is done; but, assuming it is not done, could anybody deny that a variation in exchange would constitute a monetary detriment not attributable to circumstances within the control of the person concerned? Where lies this narrow line, which the Minister says is clearly defined in clause 11, between policy on the one hand and day-today administration on the other? I would submit that the statutory corporation is an interesting form of administrative arrangements in relation to certain activities; but it is extremely doubtful, in the long run, whether the statutory corporation, as such, when it is linked to constitutional limitations in Australia, does possess any advantages that do not appertain to the ordinary departmental organization. I suggest that the Minister is attempting to get the best of both worlds. Honourable members opposite subscribe to the philosophy of private enterprise, as distinct from that of public organization. It must be remembered, however, that even they admit that this is a field that private enterprise will not enter. It is suggested that the proposed corporation will have the advantages of business administration, and will be removed from the ordinary red tape of departmental organization. As I see it, what is loosely described bureaucracy arises from the fact that there are weak and inefficient Ministers, who do not know precisely what is going on and who are prepared to rely upon departmental officials for advice on many important questions. The ultimate test in these matters should be that of parliamentary responsibility, which makes it possible to sheet home responsibility to a particular Minister, who, directly as the head of a department, or indirectly aa the Minister responsible for a particular corporation, is supposedly responsible for acts that are committed. I suggest that, by including the provisions of clause 11, the Minister is leaning in the right direction. As my colleague, the honourable member for Lalor, has suggested, major policy matters should be the responsibility of the Minister, who is answerable to the Parliament. I think that the Minister is flying in the face of experience if he believes that by including the provisions of clause 11 he has cut the Gordian knot, and that the relationship is clearly defined. I was a member of the Public Accounts Committee when it investigated the activities of the Australian Aluminium Production Commission, I am not arguing about who introduced the original legislation or who subsequently amended it, but one thing that was not clearly defined in the legislation which established the Aluminium Commission was the line of responsibility from the commission to the Minister and ultimately to the Parliament. In that case, an attempt was made to shelter behind certain sections of an act. It was said that some matters, constituted a part of the day-today adiftinistration of the commission and that other matters were matters of policy for the Minister. In this clause, an attempt is made to define major policy, and to leave what is called day-today administration to the corporation. Any one who thinks that we can simply say that certain acts are matters of policy and that other acts form part of day-today administration, and that there is no intermingling or overflow from one to the other, is being a little optimistic about future circumstances.",66

I should not have risen to speak but for the fact that the honourable member for Lalor (Mr. Pollard) made a remark which, if not corrected, might be believed by certain persons, especially certain honourable members who were not here at the time to which he referred. I refer to the honourable member's remarks about the wheat deal with New Zealand. The honourable member, in the grand manner, waving his hand, said that not one wheat grower in Australia lost a penny as a result of that deal.

185,Mr DUTHIE,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Clause 11 puts the seal of socialism on this measure. No matter how supporters of the Government may try to argue themselves out of the situation, they will have put themselves fairly and squarely within the ambit of socialistic enterprise when they finally agree to the measure. The introduction by the Government of such a measure, which gives to the Minister for Trade (Mr MCEwen) almost complete control of the running of this corporation, forms an interesting commentary on the Government's general attitude towards governnnent enterprise as opposed to private enterprise. Opposition members believe that, in the national interest, there should be a certain amount of government enterprise. It is ironic that, on this occasion, big business and big exporting interests that have been so loud in their support of this private enterprise Government, and in their criticism and expressions of hatred of all forms of socialism, should have persuaded the Government to introduce a socialistic measure that is designed to try to rescue them from the ruthless competition of other people who also worship at the footstool of the god of private enterprise. The introduction of such legislation is the funniest thing that we have seen in the House for a long time. What does the Government's reversal of form mean ? It means that all supporters of the philosophy of laisser-faire still believe in this principle: "" Let us individualize our gains and socialize our losses"". What is the purpose of this bill other than to socialize the losses of the exporters ?",67

188,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,the The honourable member may not make a second-reading speech.,67
189,Mr DUTHIE,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"I shall handle it, Mr. Temporary Chairman, as I think fit. As the previous speaker spoke ahout a wheat deal with New Zealand, I cannot see that I am very far off the track when I speak ahout the philosophy to which expression is given in the clause, which provides for the setting up of a socialist corporation to insure those who export goods to other countries. Actually, I think that I am right on the heam. It will he noted that, under the provisions of the clause, the Minister for Trade has three important things to do. First, he has supreme control over the classes of contracts of insurance into which the corporation shall enter; secondly, he must decide the nature of the risks that may be covered under contracts of insurance with the corporation-whic h is a major issue; and, thirdly, he is responsible for the undertaking of liabilities in relation to trade with certain countries. What I am trying to stress in relation to this clause is that those three heads of power give to the Minister complete control of a Government corporation or enterprise. That is something which this Government has always criticized. The persons who criticize this type of arrangement are now running to the Government asking it to rescue them from troubles which they expect in the future. They say, "" Let us insure our goods so that we can increase our trade with other countries "". To us. that is an amusing situation. That is why I say again that people of this type, who desire to have a shilling each way, are really individualizing their gains and socializing ther losses. I therefore support honourable members on this side of the .committee who agree that this is a rightful course for the Government to take. I know that honourable members opposite will not vote with enthusiasm for this clause, even though we do not divide on it, because they know that what 1I have said about it is true. In this instance they will agree to it for the sake of uniformity within their parties. They will place their seal of approval on a socialistic measure of a type which they have criticized throughout the years as being of the essence of Australian Labour party policy and principles. I remind honourable members opposite of that fact.  honourable member for Canning (Mr. Hamilton), after making an affirmation of his belief that clause 11 (4.) limits the Minister's power, left the chamber. I am sorry that he is nol; here now, because I desire to direct his attention to the fact that the Minister is not really limited at all. I look upon clause 11 as a very cleverly drawn clause, a tribute to the capacity of the draftsman and a. credit to those who designed it to have the meaning interpreted by the honourable member for Melbourne, Ports (Mr Crean). In other words, the clause specifies broadly the manner in which this corporation may be allowed to carry on its work. It refers, in the first place, to policy. In the second place, it indicates that the corporation, in its administration, should be left possibly-it does not state definitely-to its own devices. There is no clear definition of where the Minister begins and the corporation ends. Clause 31 (4.) statesNothing in this section shall be construed as requiring the approval of the Minister to the entering by the Corporation into » particular contract of insurance . . . The provision shall not be construed as requiring the approval of the Minister to such action by the corporation. It does not state that the corporation must have the approval of the Minister. There is nothing definite ahout it. The clans- 3 continued. . . or as empowering the Minister to determine that the Corporation shall or shall not enter into a particular contract of insurance. The clause does not state that the Minister shall be so empowered. It simply states that it shall not be construed definitely one way or the other. That is my interpretation of the clause. It is a common-sense sort of guidance to the Minister and the corporation. If the honourable member for Canning had read the preceding sub-clause he would have seen reference to disagreement regarding policy. In the event of such a disagreement, the Minister finally comes out on top. However, it is much ado about nothing. All that I am endeavouring to demonstrate is that, finally and conclusively, either in administration or policy, the Minister must come out tops, and that the clause, with all its sub-clauses, is reality a guide to common-sense formuhe lation of policy and subsequent adminiscedure. tration by the corporation. That is all there is to it. I am very sorry that the feelings of the honourable member Mallee (Mr Turnbull) are so sensitive. On the very point about which he made an explanation, I have already told the Parliament that, in respect of the New Zealand wheat agreement, wheat-growers in their capacity as taxpayers paid their share through the Consolidated Eevenue Fund.",68
190,Mr ANDERSON,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Hume) [8.45] - In the absence of my colleague, the honorprovides able member for Canning (Mr to day Hamilton), I should like to correct the honourable member for Lalor (Mr ticular Pollard). The honourable member for Canning said that clause 11 (4.) specifiadministered. cally stated that the Minister had no right to interfere in individual cases. That was the point that he made. The Minister has a right to approve policy, but no right to say, in respect of indiviting dual cases, whether the corporation shall or shall not effect insurance. In reply to the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr. Duthie), I can see nothing socialistic the first three sub-clauses about which he spoke. I do not think that the honormuch able gentleman really understands the meaning of socialism. I repeat, for benefit of the honourable member for Lalor, that in my view the interpretation of clause 11 (4.) by the honourable member For Canning was correct, that is, that the Minister cannot take notice of dual cases. He prescribes policy and policy alone.",69
191,Mr BRYANT,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Wills) [8.47] - I (3.) should like, in reply to the honourable member for Hume (Mr Anderson), to amplify or reiterate the comment of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) who pointed out that it would be virtually impossible to define from day to day where policy starts and administration matters end. The subparticular contract. clause states that the corporation shall not enter into a particular contract of insurance unless the contract is in accordrespect ance with policies approved or deterthere mined by the Minister under this section. That, of course, gives the Minister overfinger in riding power to declare every policy, if wishes, and that is a very sound proWe are pleased that the Government is at last appreciating some of the aspects of Parliamentary democracy, and for that advocacy from this side of the chamber of acceptance of ministerial responsibility and so on is at last having some effect. There is no confusion ahout the matter, and nothing that the honourable member for Hume, the honourable member for Canning (Mr Hamilton) or any other honourable member can say can take away the vagueness from the first part of sub-clause (4.) and deny the spirit and meaning of the last part of it, which that the Minister, hy his day definition of policy, can, in effect, say precisely what shall be done in parcases. I hope that that is the spirit in which the provision will be",69
192,Mr FAILES,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Lawson) [8.48] - I am very pleased that honourable members of the Opposition who have spoken are sitin the Opposition benches and not in the courts of this country, because their interpretation of some of the subclauses of this bill lead me to fear what in might happen if they were judges interpreting those provisions. Admittedly, of our legislation is not very clear, but clause 11 is so obviously clear that the I cannot believe that anything other than political motives would impel honourable members opposite to speak as they have spoken. Sub-clause (2.) obviously prescribes the classes of contracts and the indivinature of risks and undertaking of liabilities in respect of which the corporation shall submit policy to the Minister' for his approval. Sub-clause clearly prescribes that if there is any doubt, or if the corporation or Minister cannot agree, the Minister has the final say. Somebody must have the final say. In sub-clause (4.) I can see nothing to lead anyone to believe that it contains other than a statement that the Minister shall not have to give approval for any Clause 11 is very valuable. I give due to Ministers of the Crown, but are times-this applies particularly to a corporation of this sort-whe n the of suspicion may be pointed at a commissioner or a Minister and it may be suggested that some one is getting a rake-off as an inducement to the allowing of a contract that is not a good risk. This clause very clearly removes from any form of political control the acceptance or rejection of risks that the corporation might be asked to accept. Therefore, it is very wise. It puts the responsibility on the commissioner, and, through him, on the corporation. He will be advised by a body, which is provided for in another clause, about the classes of risks to be accepted. Risks shall not be accepted Unless they are approved. The clause eliminates any possibility that a Minister may, perhaps, accept a bribe and direct the corporation to accept a particular risk. The honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Duthie) and other speakers have suggested that the Government exhibited some socialistic intent by the inclusion of this clause in the bill.",69
193,Mr BRYANT,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,Not intent.,70
194,Mr FAILES,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"I repeat, some socialistic intent. It has been said that the Minister for Trade (Mr MCEwen), who objected to ministerial control over boards when he was Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, has included in this bill a clause that provides for ministerial control over the corporation. The two things are as wide apart as the poles. Tn the one case, we have a board such as the Australian Wheat Board, which disposes of the producers' product. Naturally, members of the Australian Country party, and I personally, have taken very strong exception to ministerial control of sueh a board. The sale of wheat under ministerial control has been mentioned this evening. The sale of the producers' product by a A«'nister, or under the direction of a Minister, is totally different from ministerial control of a corporation that can call upon £25,000,000 of the people's money to honour guarantees given by it. Whenever the people's money is involved in a matter such as this, it is perfectly logical and right for the Minister, as a representative of the Crown and of the people, to have some say, as is provided for in the hill. There should be no more quibbling about the matter. The measure is not socialistic because it gives a Minister the right to control a corporation that cau call upon £25,000,000 of the people's money to honour guarantees. The provisions of clause 11 are very logical to my mind, and, I think, to the minds of honourable members generally, and I cannot understand the quibble that has been raised.",70
195,Mr CREAN,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Melbourne Ports) [8.54]. There seems to be some doubt about clause 11. The honourable member for Lawson (Mr Failes), who has just resumed his seat, has suggested that it is a wise clause. Some honourable members have suggested that it is a wide clause. I am inclined to think it is really a narrow clause. I ask the committee to read it in conjunction with sub-clause (3.) of clause 13, which readsThe Corporation shall not enter into contracts of insurance under this section against risks that are. normally insured with commercial insurers. If the corporation is to enter into contracts of insurance against risks that are not normally insured with commercial insurers, just how wide is the field it is to cover? If , as I suggest, the field is circumscribed to begin with, precisely what is meant by the provision, in subclause (2.) of clause 11, concerning the classes of contracts of insurance into which the corporation will enter? How wide is the ambit of those classes of insurance, when the field is narrowed, in the first instance, to categories that are not normally covered by commercial insurers? Secondly, the Minister for Trade (Mr MCEwen) will be able to adjudicate upon the nature of the risks that may be covered under contracts of insurance. Finally, he will be able to negotiate about, or determine as matters of policy, the undertaking of liabilities in relation to trade with particular countries. As I indicated earlier, the two operative clauses are clause 11 and clause 13, which must he read in conjunction. Clause 11 attempts to do the circus trick of circumscribing day-today administration as distinct from policy. But, even there, policy works within the narrow ambit of what are regarded as risks other than those that are normally insured with commercial insurers. The Government attempts, in sub-clause (2.) o£ clause 11, to narrow the field into three further categories by the provisions relative to the classes of contracts of insurance, the nature of the risks, and the undertaking of liabilities in relation to trade with particular countries-eac h in itself very much circumscribed. However, statistics published in a document issued by the Export Credits Guarantee Department of the United Kingdom as recently as 1955, which outlined the history of this kind of insurance in Great Britain, show that, in 193S, the United Kingdom scheme having been in operation since 1919, there were only 600 separate insurers. The Australian scheme has not even started, and I suggest that, even after twenty years of operation in this country^ on a pro rata basis according to population, there would be perhaps 100 separate insurers. So where does subclause (4.) of cl a use 11 get us in the initial stages of the operation of this measure? That sub-clause providesNothing in this section shall be construed requiring the approval of the Minister to the entering by the Corporation into a particular contract of insurance . . . I suggest that the early years of the corporation will involve adjudication between particular kinds of individuals who seek insurance from the corporation. T suggest, also, that, as a matter of administrative organization, that is the kind of pattern we can expect to be followed in the early years. That is why it seems to me that, when the Minister airily suggests that he has disposed of what he calls day-today administration as distinct from policy and that subclause (4.) distinguishes between what might he called the individual application and, let us say, categories of applications, he envisages something that may not occur for a great many years in the operations of this corporation. I suggest that the committee should not merely consider the operations of the corporation in the initial stages in comparison with the operations of a similar scheme in Great Britain for more than 30 years, and in Canada for more than ten years. We should endeavour, this evening, to protect ourselves in the early stages-the embryonic stage, if one likes-of the development of this corporation. I do not know how many exporting firms there are in Australia at present, but I suggest that there are not a great many. How many of them will rush into this scheme immediately it is instituted? I incline to the view that the number will be very limited, and, further, that, in the initial stages of the scheme, the corporation will largely be adjudicating on individual applications that come before it.",70
196,Mr OSBORNE,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Evans-Minister for Customs and Excise) [9.1] - The attitude of the Opposition to this clause seems to me to reflect its attitude to the whole bill. It approves of the bill and of the intention, as any sensible Australian must, but it finds it too difficult to say so and seeks means of criticism and disapproval.

This clause, so far as it goes, deals admirably and clearly with the functions of the Minister and of the corporation. What are the decisions of policy with which the clause deals? They are policies approved or determined by the Minister under this provision. What is the right of the Minister to approve of policies under this provision? It is the right to determine the classes of contracts of insurance, the nature of the risks and the countries with whom the trade is done. Then subclause (4.) states that "" Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring the approval of the Minister to the entering into by the corporation of a particular contract of insurance "".  not.",71
197,Mr OSBORNE,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"The Minister's right to deal with questions of policy is set out in sub-clause (2.) and the right of the corporation otherwise to decide what contracts it shall enter into is saved by sub-clause (4.). The general purpose of this clause is perfectly clear to anybody who reads it. It is to provide the maximum autonomy for the corporation in its activities, consistent with proper ministerial responsibility for broad policy. Let me deal again with sub-clause (2.) and the matters that the Minister has the right to determine, the classes of contracts of insurance. The Minister has said in his second-reading speech that lie contemplates that there will be two main types-shipmen t of material in which the risk runs from the date of shipment and contract policies which will assist manufacturers to make special goods to special orders and to insure the possibility of those goods being rejected. They are the types of risk to he covered. The Minister has said what they will be. They include the insolvency of the buyer, the failure of the buyer to pay the exporter within twelve months, and the operation of a law, order, decree or regulation in circumstances outside the control of the buyer which prevent the transfer of payments from the buyer's country to Australia. They include the risk of war between the buyer's country and Australia, or of war in the buyer's country which prevents him from fulfilling his contract. The Government intends that they will cover any other cause excluding particular risks, which I shall deal with in a moment, not being within the control of the exporter or of the buyer which arise from events occurring outside Australia. The Government does not intend that they shall cover this class of risk-refusa l of a solvent buyer to accept delivery, non-payment for goods on consignment and fluctuations in the rate of exchange. The reason why they are not covered is that the normal banking procedure provides means for covering those risks.",72
198,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,Order! The Minister is not dealing with the clause now before the committee.,72
199,Mr OSBORNE,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"I am dealing with the types of risk, which in covered by clause 11.",72
200,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,Order! Clause 11 deals with the relation of the corporation with the Minister.,72
201,Mr OSBORNE,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Sub-claus e (2.) of clause 11 defines the classes of contract,, the nature of the risks and the undertaking of liabilities in relation to trade with particular countries. I am speaking about the classes of contracts and the nature of the risks, and what the Government's intentions are in relation to them.. Indeed, I suggest that I am talking precisely about the clause, whereas the discussion for the last half an hour or so has been very wide of it. Other matters which the Government does not intend to cover are in respect of goods shipped from Australia and additional handling or transport charges occasioned by the interruption or diversion of ships on voyage, because they are covered by ordinary commercial policies. In general, any other risk which can be covered by commercial insurance is expressly removed from the provisions of this bill. Clause agreed to. Clause 12 (Consultative Council).  12 is an important clause. I hope the Minister for Customs and Excise (Mr. Osborne) will not be as annoyed about our criticism of clause 12 as he was about our criticism of clause 11. All he is anxious ahout is getting home early to bed. He does not care; he does not want the Opposition to criticise or to seek information. If he had his way, he would make a dictatorship out of this Government and shut the whole of Parliament up. Clause 12 is worthy of some discussion. It provides that under the act there shall be a consultative council consisting of not more than ten members. Why it should be ten, I do not know. Why fewer than ten should be the number appointed, if the Minister thinks fit, I do not know either. Overall, the Opposition does not generally disagree with the creation of a consultative council, but, if the Minister can regain his temper, we are entitled to know what is in the mind of the Government regarding this consultative council. There is no provision in the bill to indicate that the members of the council will be drawn from some specific organizations, representing primary producers, manufacturers, and the commercial insurance world. They may be drawn from some judiciary or some other source that may be in the mind of the Government, or from the trade unions that are concerned. There is not a word about that. No information is conveyed in the second-reading speech of the Minister for Trade (Mr MCEwen). All I can see going on at the moment is a rude conversation between the Ministei and the Vice-President of the Executive Council (Sir Eric Harrison), who are probably deciding exactly when they will gag this debate and prevent any further discussion on this measure.",72
202,Mr OSBOKNE,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"We are discussing the bill:  moment to learn what is in the mind of the Government in the creation of this consultative council. How is it to be constituted? In what interests are its members supposed to be expert? Will it have representatives from the people to be insured or will it be a council representing, perhaps, the people who are likely to be purchasers? No information has been furnished to this committee. Not a word has been said about that in the Minister's second-reading speech, and there is no indication in the bill itself. It would he courteous on the part of the Minister to inform the committee what the Government's intentions are. He could say that a consultative council will be appointed, that six members will be enough at present and that they represent wheat-growers, wool-growers, tin-can manufacturers or some other interests. He could tell us whether somenished body experienced in commercial insurance will be appointed and whether there will be a representative of the State governments, the Treasury or the Department of Trade. We would then know what is running in the mind of the Government and how it proposes to be advised, but uot a word has been said about it. This clause provides that members of the council will be appointed for three years-and that is another reason why we should know what is in the mind of the Government. The members of the council are to be paid fees and expenses, but there is no indication of what fees they will be paid. After all, the corporation has to pay the fees out of its income and, if its income is insufficient, the taxpayers of the Commonwealth of Australia are to be drawn upon to pay them. We are told that members may be removed from office and we are given the reasons for which they may he removed. We are told also that the commissioner may at his discretion consult this council. If the commissioner is a strong-headed man, like the Minister himself, he may decide that he knows all about the matter, and he may never consult the consultative committee. In that case we would have in existence a committee, with members being paid fees and allowances, that would not be worth a dump. It is provided that the commissioner may, at his discretion, and shall, as required by the Minister, refer matters for advice to the consultative council. The commissioner, however, is left as a freelance, and the consultative committee may be a completely superfluous body, except when the Minister may become a little annoyed and say to the commissioner, "" Call your council together and consult it on certain matters that I think it should consider"". Complaints may be received from exporters who cannot get the cover that they want. In that case the Minister may wish to ascertain whether the commissioner is doing the right thing, and he may say to him, "" Call your consultative council together and refer these matters to it "" . Surely we can be given some more information than has already been furto the Parliament. All that the Minister for Customs and Excise (Mr. Osborne) does is to point to the clock, to indicate that my time is running out. It may also indicate that the Government intends to gag this debate before it proceeds very much further. The debate has proceeded as a perfectly friendly discussion. We are supporting this measure. We want Jo he fully informed, and I am merely asking for information about the matters that I have mentioned. I know that the Minister for Trade (Mr MCEwen) is labouring under a difficulty. He is making arrangements to go abroad, to endeavour to obtain some further markets for our goods, in order to improve the position of our trade balance. He may do good work, and he may not. Personally, I have grave doubts as to whether he will. Because he is getting ready to go away, the Minister for Customs and Excise is in charge of this measure, and he may not know anything about it at all. He has to do the best he can, however, and surely he knows something about this legislation. Surely he has been properly briefed. Surely he knows some of the things that are in the mind of the Minister for Trade. We are entitled to have some information from him. As no other honourable member has risen, I shall take my second period now. Unless we can get some information from the Minister for Customs and Excise about clause 12, I shall feel inclined to provoke some of my friends to express their opinions, not only in regard to this clause but also in regard to other clauses. If the Minister proposes to be discourteous and not to recognize that the Opposition is trying to be helpful and is endeavouring to play its part this matter, then we shall have to keep on prodding him. Clause agreed to. Clause 13The Corporation shall, subjectto Act, carry on the business of insurance, insurance under contracts referred' to next succeeding sub-section. (3.) The Corporation shall not en\er contracts of insurance under this -' section against risks that are normally insured commercial insurers.  is the clause to which the Opposition proposes to move an amendment. This portion of the bill sets out the particular forms of insurance in which the corporation may engage, and the cover that the commissioner may give to the people who desire to take out insurance. The particular kinds of insurance are outlined, and sub-clause (3.) then providesThe Corporation shall not enter into contracts of insurance under this section against risks that are normally insured with commercial insurers. It is well known that the real reason for the proposed establishment of this corporation is that hitherto no commercial insurance companies have seen fit to enter this field. Apparently they have considered it unprofitable, or at least as' being too risky at present for them to venture into. For that reason the Australian Government has come to the rescue-quite rightly-and proposes to establish a corporation to provide insurance to cover these very risky transactions. It is proposed to make available £500,000 of the taxpayer's money for establishment purposes. Provision is made to guarantee the activities of the corporation to the amount of £25,000,000 at any particular time. It is hoped, as is shown by a later proviso in the bill, that the corporation will balance its revenue with its expenditure, but it may well be that in the initial stages of the venture there will be substantial calls upon the Consolidated Revenue. I suggest that if this Government had any vision it would remove this limiting provision in the clause, and I now move That sub-clause (3.) he omitted. in I do so in order that the corporation may he allowed to engage in all forms of insurance covering export activities, such as marine insurance, pillage insurance, insurance against fire or shipwreck, and other kinds of insurance normally underthis taken by private insurance companies being because they are profitable. If the in the amendment is agreed to, the spread of risk will be greater, the possibility of requiring a lesser premium from the ininto surers will be much better than it is towith day, and the corporation will be in a much sounder and more solvent position at an earlier date than otherwise it possibly be. I am afraid that the MinisGovernment ter for Customs and Excise (Mr of Osborne) is rather tired to-night, or haps he knows little about the bill, if he does speak he will say, as will other Government supporters, ""We do not lieve in setting up a socialistic instruenter mentality "".   loss, and as soon as an instrumentality that we establish begins to make a profit we shall sell it to some one who will reap those profits, because we do not like profits"". The Opposition is suggesting now that ordinary commercial export surance should be a function of the proof posed corporation. That would reduce the extent of a possible call upon the payers, and eventually there might even be substantial profits that could go into the consolidated revenue, or, better be used to reduce the premiums that the premiums. insurers will he asked to pay. As to the arguments of honourable members opposite that they do not believe in socialistic policy, surely we can get away from party political propaganda in this matter. Let us consider what has hapcial pened in certain States of the Commonof wealth of Australia from time to time, where in actual fact conservative or Liberal governments-certainl y antisuch form of insurance. Labour governments-hav e ventured upon this kind of activity. In Victoria there is a State Accident Insurance Office, lished, I understand, by a Liberal adhonorahle ministration, whose functions were eventually enlarged to include third-party insurance cover. No conservative or Liberal government in Victoria would consider for a moment the abolition of State Accident Insurance Office, or would consider for a moment limiting its funcmerely tions. No one worries ahout its being socialistic activity. All that the Liberal and Country party governments in Vicin toria have worried about in the past is whether it has been run successfully, whether it has made substantial rebates the people who insure with it, and whether it has been run along sensible and busionly nesslike lines. When the Opposition risks suggests that something similar should done in this case, so that the corporation can may compete for this class of business, supporters will talk all sorts nonsense about socialism. All that we perare trying to do is to ensure that this but type of activity is made much safer financially than otherwise would be the becase, by allowing the corporation to into other classes of business. Under the circumstances, surely the Government will show that it is at least as progressive as wtere the Victorian Liberal administrations of 30 years ago which actually established a State insurance office. There are today many State instrumentalities which have, been created as a result not of Labour legislation but of Liberal administration. These instrumentalities have been estabinlished to place a brake on the rapacity private enterprise, which was exploiting the people. If the Minister accepted taxthe amendment, a similar brake would be placed upon the rapacity of the people who are today exploiting the exporters still, by charging them excessive insurance Sub-clause (3.) provides that the cora poration shall not enter into contracts of insurance under clause' 13 against risks that are normally insured with commerinsurers. The effect of the omission that sub-clause would be to permit the corporation, at its discretion and subject to the Minister's approval, to embark on",73
203,Mr OSBORNE,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Evans-Minister for estabCustoms and Excise) [9.23] - My right friend, the Minister for Trade (Mr MCEwen), who introduced this bill, is engaged in consultations elsewhere and is unable to be present in the committee. I have discussed this matter with him the and, for him, I say that the Government entirely rejects this amendment, which expresses the socialist objectives a of the Opposition and seeks to change the whole nature of the scheme contemplated the hill. The Government's intention, in bringing down this bill, is not to enter into the wide field of comercial insurance, to but to provide a system of export payments guarantees. It decided to do this when it had been convinced that the in overseas trade against which this he bill seeks to insure exporters could not be covered by commercial insurance in Australia. The purpose of sub-clause (3.) is to make it quite clear that the corporation shall not have power to encroach upon the ordinary business of commercial insurance. The Government will not accept the amendment.",75
204,Mr CREAN,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Melbourne Ports) [9.24]. - I should like the Minister to clarify clause 13. Clause 11 and clause 13 are the most important clauses of the bill. Clause 13 is a tripartite clause, and the Opposition has moved that the third part be omitted. The first part provides that the corporation shall, subject to the legislation, carry on the business of insurcountry: ance, as defined in sub-clause (2.). This sub-clause sets out the kind .of contracts that may be negotiated. They are contracts of insurance against risk of monetary loss or other monetary detriment attributable to circumstances outside the control of the person suffering the loss or detriment and resulting from failure to receive payment in connection with trade transactions. The third part of the clause provides that the corporation shall not enter into contracts that are normally insured with commercial insurers. Here again, I incline to the view that the powers of the corporation will he determined, not so much by what the Minister says, as by what a court of law may say. I would even .suggest that the Minister has not been very specific about the functions of the proposed corporation. I turn now to his speech and the functions that he mentioned. First, he said that it was proposed to provide insurof ance broadly against the risk of non-. payment, whether arising from causes such as the insolvency of the overseas buyer or his failure to pay within a certain period, or from actions of overseas governments such as-and I would suggest that this is merely given as an example-the blockage of foreign exchange or the sudden imposition of new import controls in markets abroad. Later, in the speech, the Minister said that the corporation would insure against the insolvency of the overseas buyer, for example, or against the overseas buyer's inability to obtain foreign exchange to remit payments owed to an Australian exporter. He went on to mention risks normally insured with commercial houses. R -[81 ] Then he said that the' corporation must put its proposed policies before the Minister and obtain his approval. That is the dilemma that obtains between clay-today administration, on the one band, and policy on the other. Later, he said It is intontled that covetshould be provided initially against risks of loss due to insolvency of the oversea buyer; the failure of the oversea buyer to pay witliiu twelve months of the due date; failure of the oversea buyer to obtain foreign exchange, or of the oversea bank to transfer funds to the Australian exporter; war, rebellion, hostilities, revolution or other disturbances in the oversea and any other cause outside the. control of the exporter and arising outside Australia. Last night, I asked whether the - cover applied to variations in the rate of exchange and I was promptly taken to task hy a Government supporter. The suggestion made was that one could insure, oneself with the Commonwealth Bank against a variation in exchange. 1! simply make the point that the Minister has mentioned insurance houses in this connection. Does insurance against exchange variations come within the scope of clause 13 (3.) ? Is it regarded as a matter that is normally covered by commercial insurers? Is the Commonwealth Bank, in this connotation, to be regarded as a commercial insurer? 13 that a normal function of the Commonwealth Bank? I would submit that it is not. As I have already suggested, the powers the proposed corporation, as set out in clause 13, are distinctly vague. It is true that under clause 11, the other operative clause, a decision can be made that this or that shall not be regarded as a matter of policy. I ask the Minister to clarify this point for me. When a policy is issued by the corporation, will there be written into it an assurance that it does cover a variation in exchange? Is it to be determined, as a. matter of day-today administration by the corporation, that that is something which is not normally a commercial risk? Or is it to be one of the matters referred to the Minister under clause 11? Under that clause, the Minister could say, categorically, ""For my part, I do not believe that variations in the rate of exchange come within the risks set out in clause 13"". I suggest that we are entitled to assurances on this matter. It could happen that, in a court of law, a person who had taken out an insurance policy in which there were no words specifically limiting a certain kind of activity could say, "" I rely upon the normal meaning of section .13 of the Exports Payments Insurance Corporation Act, as it was passed by the Parliament of the Commonwealth in May, 1956 "". One could not, as a defence, produce the statement that the Minister had made in this chamber or the statement that the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Dean) made in rebuttal of my suggestion that it did not cover this kind of activity. One might keep to the official delineation, if it possible. One could try to adjudicate between what might be called policy on the one hand, as supposed to be laid down in clause 11, and day-by-day administration as the words in clause 13 might be interpreted. If the Minister for Customs and Excise is not in a position to give a definite answer to this question to-night, at least he should inquire from the Minister for Trade and those who have advised him as to what are the meanings. I think that we are entitled to ask, "" What is monetary detriment attributable to circumstances outside the control of persons suffering the loss or detriment? In what way, if a variation in exchange be adverse to the exporter, is that transaction eliminated as far as clause 13 is concerned? If it is not eliminated as far as clause 13 is concerned, is it embraced in the interpretation of policy as laid down in clause 11 of this bill?""",76
205,Mr BRYANT,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Wills) [9.32] - I want to address my remarks to sub-clause (3.) of clause 13 to which the Opposition is opposed. When all is said and done, all that we ask is that members of the Government, when handling government business and public money, should adopt the same sort of attitude that they would adopt in handling their own affairs. I suggest that the Government is not giving this enterprise a ghost of a chance to meet its commitments. Insurance is a game in which very skilled and very careful people have indulged for many years. If this enterprise can only embark on the sort of insurance business which people ordinarily employed in insurance will not touch, then there can he no profit in it, hecause a good deal of the insurance business has been built around estimates of risk and the making of a profit out of them. In this case, a fairly large organization, with an initial capital of £500,000 in public money, has a right, in the end, to undertake expenditure-o r to put us in - to the extent of £25,000,000, but is going to operate in a field in which it is estimated that it cannot make a profit. It seems to me, in view of th*provisions of this clause, that the Government proposes to use the savings of were the workers of the electorates of Wills, Yarra and Wilmot to finance the investments of the electors of Kooyong, Evans and Murray. That is the sort of thing to which I object. I do not object to the general principle of the bill, which is to expand export trade, but I strongly object to clause 13 (3.). I am prepared to admit, with the Minister, that those 21 words do change the nature of the bill. If they were removed, the nature of the operation of this corporation would be changed. The Government proposes to use public moneys and public enterprise to protect the profits and the welfare of the people whom it represents. After all, insurance is a big business. According to a year book which gives figures up to 1951 £77,000,000 was spent on various forms of insurance-no t life insurance, but insurance in the fields of fire, workers' compensation, vehicle and marine. A total of £77,000,000 was paid in premiums and the pay-out - was only £40,000,000. In other words, the insurance companies have a working capital over and above ordinary expenditure of £30,000,000 available to them. I suppose that that capital will be invested in costly gambles financed by the proposed insurance corporation. There is no constitutional difficulty in the matter because section 51 (xiv) of the Constitution refers to insurance other than State insurance and also State insurance extending beyond the limits of the State concerned. It is time the Government entered the field of insurance in a business like way. This is exactly the same sort of provision that brought into being the Commonwealth Bank which entered into such hearty competition with the private banking system for the well-being of Australia. The embarkation of the Government into wider fields of insurance could only benefit every person who insures, and that is every one of us. People who have built homes under the War Service Homes scheme have benefited from the insurance scheme made available by the War Service Homes Division - They have received very big rebates, which have been much greater than any that they could have got from private insurance companies. This is a field which the Government could enter with a great deal of profit. It would stabilize the ability of this corporation to meet its commitments, and even at this time, £25,000,000 is very big money. It represents the cost of hundreds of schools. Even £500,000 is a fair sized initial capital. On behalf of the electors of Wills, the ordinary people who are expected to underwrite this proposal, I demand of the Government that, when setting up a business venture, it adopt the same sort of principles as it adopts when working in its own interest. So the Opposition opposes the insertion of this §ub-claiuse in the bill, and moves its omission.",77
206,Mr CLARK,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Darling) [9.37] - I regret that the Minister for Trade (Mr. MCEwen) is not in the chamber while this measure is being discussed because it is in the committee stage of a bill honourable members endeavour to find out the real purpose of the legislation and of the clauses. The Minister for Customs and Excise (Mr Osborne), who is at the table, is not informed on these matters and is not able to speak on behalf of the Minister for Trade, who is responsible for carrying out the administration, of the bill. He is the one who should be here to deal with it. 'Clause 13 is the most important clause in the bill in that it deals with the of business that the corporation may cover by insurance. I regret very much that the Government wishes to retain sub-clause (3.), which the Opposition proposes to exclude. If certain classes of insurance are to he conducted by the corporation, then, particularly in regard to that business, the corporation should he prepared to cover the whole of the insurance required. I think it is wrong that the exporter should have to go to this corporation to get one section of his insurance cover and then run round to an insurance company to try to get other risks covered. The position should be simplified by providing that the corporation may cover marine risks, fire risks and other losses that might be involved in the export of commodities. I ask the Minister for Customs and Excise to inform the committee whether contracts of this character, for instance, will be covered. I am informed by a man who has a contract for the sale of carbonized wool to a foreign power that, to export that carbonized wool, he first has to purchase the wool and pay to get it carbonized, and until such time as he is able to make the delivery and get the documents he is unable to get any finance from the Commonwealth Bank or any other bank. This man is not able to get any finance against the contract that he holds for the wool. He has been told by the Commonwealth Bank and other banks that the wool is not acceptable as security. The banks are for not prepared to lend against wool, but, only against the actual document of delivery. That is the stage at which they are prepared to advance finance in respect of the wool. I think that if the Government is endeavouring to facilitate exports from Australia, finance should that be made available to this man at an earlier stage in order to enable him to purchase the wool, carbonize it, and export it without any risk of loss. For instance, he points out to me that between the time he buys the wool and the time it is carbonized, there might be a shipping hold-up of a week or a month, and in the meantime the price of wool might fall. If the fall were of 5 per cent, or 10 per cent., possibly the purchasing nation would refuse to take delivery of it, class and he would be left with the wool on his hands. I want to know",78
207,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,-Order! The honourable member must relate his remarks to the clause.,78
208,Mr CLARK,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"The clause deals with the classes or nature of the risks to be covered, and I am giving a specific instance. I wish to know whether that class of contract or business negotiation is covered by this clause. That is the question I wish to ask the Minister, and L think I am right on the target in making a request of that nature. I have no motive other than to find out exactly what sort of risk is covered, and whether a matter of the nature I have outlined comes within the category of such risks. Another exporter told me he had an order for a very substantial quantity of flour for export to India. He said he was unable to get finance for that transaction, just as the wool merchant I mentioned was unable to get finance, and I want to know whether he will be able to obtain coverage from the corporation for the export of that flour. There is no risk that payment for the goods will not be made on delivery. The actual problem faced by that man arises between the time he buys the flour and exports it, and the time he actually receives payment from the purchaser overseas. Those are instances which have been brought to my notice, and not being certain whether: they are covered by the clause, I wish the Minister to inform the committee whether deals along those lines are covered. I believe that any risk in which an exporter is involved between the time of purchase of the goods he exports and the time of payment for them should be covered by the corporation. T wish to know from the Minister if all such risks are covered-that is to say, whether the exporter is covered in the whole of that period in such transactions as I have outlined. I could give many other examples but I do not wish to weary the committee. I think I have sufficiently made my point by giving these two specific instances.",79
209,Mr OSBORNE,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Evans-Minister for speech Customs and Excise) [9.44] - I shall endeavour to answer the questions raised by the Opposition in this dehate. The honourable member for Darling (Mr Bank. Clark) asks whether carbonized wool would be covered under this scheme between the date of purchase of the wool by the processer, and the date shipment, while it is still in Australia. do not think that that is a class of contract intended to be covered by the measure. The export of primary produce, if I understand the bill correctly, is to be covered against classes of risks described, from the time of shipment, but not during the period it is held in Australia prior to shipment. In cases where contract insurance is contemplated, the class of contract intended to be covered is that in which a manufacturer accepts an order for goods which have to be manufactured. The risk of termination of his contract due to the causes that have been set out in the bill, and explained during the debate, between the date of undertaking the contract and starting on the manufacture of the goods, and the date of payment, is covered.",79
210,Mr CLARK,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Carbonize d wool is a manufacture, too.",79
211,Mr OSBORNE,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Well , if it involved considerable manufacturing process, it might be covered, but that is one of the matters which will have to be determined by the commissioner at the time. I turn now to the point raised by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr. Crean). He asked whether clause 13 (2.) excludes or includes coverage of the risk of exchange variations. I cannot understand the importance he attaches to the question. He suggests that some court of law might construe such a risk as bting included in this section, and thereby impose a liability on the Commonwealth through the corporation, which was not contemplated. But this clause does not constitute a policy of insurance. This bill gives the right to the commission to underwrite certain risks, and to issue certain policies. I should imagine that in the insurance policy itself there would be defined, following ordinary insurance procedure, the risks that are covered; and the Minister for Trade (Mr MCEwen) said quite plainly in his second-reading that the provision does not include the cover of exchange variations, because adequate means exist of obtaining that kind of cover through the Commonwealth The honourable member for Wills (Mr. Bryant) has made a suggestion which of seems extraordinary to me. He has sugI gested that, the Govn^nment is hampering the activities of the corporation from the outset by not allowing it to undertake ordinary commercial insurance, such fire and marine risks and so on. I think that quite the reverse is the case. I such an obligation were imposed on the commission that body would incur of immense liabilities for premises and staff, skilled advice, actuarial assistance, and of that sort. all sorts of things. It would be entering into a highly competitive field-the field o.f commercial insurance. In any event, that is not the Government's intention. This scheme is aimed at insuring, in the interests of the community, a class of risks connected with the export trade which cannot otherwise be covered. The honourable member for Wills misCanadian takenly suggests that this will he an insurance risks. awfully expensive business for the vernment. The experience of other counable tries shows that it will not be so. The Minted Kingdom export guarantee scheme showed a surplus of £3,000,000 at the end of the financial year 1955-56, and was able to cut its premium rates by from .10 per cent, to 20 per cent.  the United Kingdom are very different from the circumstances in Australia. The United Kingdom has a vast number of (Mr exporters compared with the number that clause. Australia has.",79
212,Mr OSBORNE,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"I agree that the United Kingdom scheme is a much larger scheme than ours. Nevertheless, that scheme covers the same sort of risks as are to be covered by this scheme. The risk of ultimate loss is not so great. Suppose an Australian exporter enters into a contract to export goods to a foreign country and then cannot be paid because of import restrictions imposed by the goAllan, I a n vernment of that country.

Proposed new-clause 13A.  behalf of the Opposition I move That, after elause 13. the following new clause be inserted in the hill: ""13A - (1.)'The Governor General may, if lie deems it advisable for the purpose of ing the Corporation to develop and facilitate trade between Australia, and any otlier country and for the purpose of carrying out the objects of this Act, authorize the Treasurer to(a) guarantee the undertaking of the [ Government or an agency of the c Government of that other country w to pay, or its guarantee of the payance cover. ment of, the cost of Auatvaliauproduced goods purchased from an exporter or the cost of Australian : services; (6) make a loan to the Government or an agency of the Government of thai, other country to enable that Government or its agency or any person ordinarily resident in that other country to pay the cost of Australian-produced goods purchased from an exporter or the cost of Australian services; or (c) purchase, acquire or guarantee any security issued or guaranteed by the Government or by an agency of the Government of that other country for the payment of the cost of Australian-produced goods purchased from an exporter or of the cost of Australian services, if the ment of that other country requests the Government of Australia to give such guarantee or loan, or to purchase, acquire or guarantee such securities and. in the case of a guarantee, undertakes to indemnify the Government of Australia against loss in connection therewith. "" (2.) Tho Governor General may determine the terms and conditions upon which any guarantee, loan, purchase, acquisition or guarantee of securities shall be made under this section."". The purpose of the proposed amendment is to broaden the whole ambit of the bill and to include a provision whereby credit facilities in addition to those provided in the insurance clauses of the bill may be made available to persons who require to sell goods on long-term credits to overseas countries. It is generally recognized today that one of the obstacles to the further expansion of Australia's export trade is the fact that a large number of governments and individuals in other parts of the world are unable to get the required long-term credits fro m exporters guaranteed by the Australian Government. If they could do so, they would be in a much more favourable position to purchase our products. Those assist- are the governments and the individuals with which export trade should be developed. In those circumstances, we consider that this bill would be much more useful if it made provision for long term credits than it would be if it were confined solely to the extending of insurThe amendment would enable primary producer hoards, which export our important products to other parts of the world, and which already have the greatest difficulty in disposing of their surpluses, to extend long-term credits to other governments or individuals, and thereby facilitate the expansion of our trade. Her Majesty's Opposition exhibits no irresponsibility in proposing this amendment. Indeed, if we could he accused of anything, perhaps we could he accused of conservatism. The proposed clause is lifted practically in to to from the Canadian act. I have yet to learn that the Canadian Government that introduced Govern- the legislation was a government of the socialist tendencies that it is alleged the Opposition in this Parliament has and continually endeavours to foist upon the Australian people. Furthermore, I would point out that the amendment contains a number of safeguards. First, it provides that the Treasurer shall do certain things. The Treasurer is a highly responsible Minister. Secondly, it provides that the Governor General-that means the Cabinet-ma y determine the terms and conditions upon which any guarantee, loan, purchase, acquisition or guarantee of securities shall be made. Two concrete protections are provided in the authority to be vested in the Treasurer and in the Governor General, who means the Executive Council. For my part, I leave the matter at that. The Opposition is greatly indebted to the honourable member for Darebin (Mr R. W. Holt ) , the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr . Crean), the honourable member for  member for 1'nrru (Mr Ouirns), who, as members of an Opposition committee appointed to consider this matter, being anxious to help Australia's export trade, suggested the amendment.",82
218,Mr OSBORNE,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Evans-Minister for Customs and Excise) [10.13] - The Government does not accept the amendment. Mr R. W. HOLT (Darebin) [10.14] I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Lalor (Mr. Pollard). When we speak of exports today, we naturally think, not only in terms of manufactured goods and, possibly, of services which are envisaged as coming within the scope of the bill and of the amendment, hut also of raw materials in the form of our primary products. The world trade situation, at the present time, emphasizes more and more the importance of competition in what is now a hardening market tending to favour buyers. Therefore, any measures designed to encourage the export, not only of manufactured goods, and of services, but also of the products of our primary industries, and especially of the exportable surpluses of our primary products, are commendable and should be supported. The gravity of the situation is emphasized, as T have said previously, hy Mr. Marshall M . Smith. Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Affairs in the Department of Commerce of the United States of America. In the Foreign Commerce Weekly, dated the 9th April, 1956, Mr Smith writesTo-day, we have much more at stake than the commercial interest of US. individuals the expansion of our exports. Our nation is facing a planned program of economic warfare to which the Communist countries have recently given special emphasis. The important problem for us to consider today is how are we going to meet this challenge. This challenge comes not only from the Communist countries but also from many others, and the amendment is designed to meet just such a challenge. It envisages two kinds of assistance in addition that at present provided for in the bill. The amendment deals with a kind of contract that is normally associated with insurance, namely, a guarantee. The guarantee can operate in one of two ways. One can guarantee the local producer, or exporter, so that he may call on a financial institution with the backing of a government guarantee to pay as he goes and to carry him over pending the receipt of final payment for his goods: or, at the request of a foreign government, a guarantee can be given to it, or to an importer. The records show that most of these contracts are made at the request of a foreign government, and, therefore, governments of other countries may well be interested in obtaining a guarantee, or, alternatively, a loan that will enable them to purchase Australia's exportable goods in the form of services, manufactured articles and primary products. There is no such scheme in the United States at the present time simply because there is no need for it. The functions that it would discharge are performed by the Export-Import Bank of Washington. The twentieth report made to the United States Congress by the bank, which covers the period from January to June, 3955, sets out the various functions discharged by the bank-function s that are envisaged and outlined in the amendment. The report emphasizes, at page 3, thatIt is a statutory policy of the .'Bank that its loans shall supplement and encourage but not compete with private capital. The loans and guarantees it has authorized represent credit transactions that would not have been in undertaken by private lending institutions. Conversation being audible, Mr R. W. HOLT - I am sorry if I am interrupting honourable members at the end of the chamber to my left. The position is that exports are insured. The bank guarantees the exporter, and. guarantees the purchasing government, or alternatively, makes it a loan, to encourage it to purchase those exports. to Under the policy of the Export-Import Bank, where credit terms of a year or move are involved the bank currently provides, in appropriate cases, first, direct financing of exports; secondly, guarantees against non-payment due to all types. of risk in connection with finance obtained by exporters from private sources; and, thirdly, guarantees against non-payment due to selected risks. The kinds of exports involved are set out. I shall not waste time by reading the detail. They are generally in the form of capital goods. The policy of the bank is to export capital goods or services of a reproductive kind so that the export market shall continue to receive support. It will be of interest to members of the Australian Country party to know that the bank finances the purchase by foreign importers of raw cotton and similar materials. There is no doubt that, if the United States were to finance, on a wholesale scale, the purchase by foreign buyers of its food surpluses, we should have continued complaints on that score. The United Kingdom Government thought this matter was sufficiently important to amend its Export Guarantees Act in 1949. Sections 1 and 2 of that act provide, amongst other things, that for the purposes of encouraging trade with places outside the United Kingdom, the Board of Trade, after consultation with the Advisory Council, may, with the consent of the Treasury, give guarantees. The whole basis of the section is to assist persons carrying on business in the United Kingdom in such ways as appears to the Board of Trade to he expedient in the national interest. The situation has arisen today in a competitive buyers' market where assistance has to be given in the national interest to redress our adverse balance of payments. The amendment, therefore, has the effect of enabling-to a lesser extent certainly and not to the great degree that has been achieved in America, but we hope some day it will be done-thes e types of exports to he encouraged, new markets to be opened and new markets to be pioneered. Private enterprise will not do those things hecause the risks are too great. This is an instance where private enterprise cannot do it. The surplus of primary products is indicative of it, as is also the fact that we have no export trade in the products of our secondary industries. The insurance to which this bill in its very limited form will apply will not increase our trade to any extent because it is in relatively safe channels now. The overall policy is to encourage the export of reproductive goods which, in turn, will come back in the form of added demands for our exportable goods and services, such as the construction of canals and railway bridges in Iraq and elsewhere. They are some of the things that the American Export-Import Bank has been able to finance. Eor that reason, if the Government sincerely desires to encourage the export trade, it will accept this amendment.",84
219,Mr MORGAN,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Reid) [10.22J - The amendment proposed by the Opposition would be a very practical way of stimulating trade for secondary industries and creating new markets overseas. Many secondary industries, particularly those engaged in the manufacture of agricultural implements, are suffering in that regard because of the lack of credit facilities for potential customers. Secondary industries are also suffering in other respects. One big industry in my electorate, the Clyde Engineering Company, lost a large order from overseas for diesel locomotives because it could not be properly financed. It lost that order to Great Britain. This company has been turning out a considerable number of diesel locomotives under the Colombo plan, and was hoping to be able to develop the trade in other ways. Many Asian countries are not able to extend their trade with Australia and other countries because of lack of credit facilities. An example of that is given in the Third Annual Report of the Consultative Committee of the Colombo plan for Co-operative Economic Development in South and South-East Asia. It was hoped that the Colombo plan would result in the extension of trade with those countries that are now receiving gifts under that plan. Chapter 3 of the report I have mentioned contains the following statement:One of the greatest impediments to the development of agriculture and the raising of the peasant producer's living standards is the widespread dependence of the farmer on moneylenders and middlemen. Loans to farmers carry an interest rate of the order of 100 per cent, or more. Because of the burden of debt, the farmer is deprived of the freedom to choose his own selling time, and the price at which he is forced to sell allows a large margin of profit to middlemen. Agricultural credit institutions, regulated by a central "" Office Credit Populaire"" (Credit Union Office), have existed in Cambodia since 1029, but mainly through lack of finance, have been unable to solve the problem. The Royal Cambodian Government now has under consideration measures to promote farm credit by the encouragement of finance by co-operative methods, supplemented by State advances using domestic capital resources and foreign aid.",85
220,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,Order I The honourable member should come back to the amendment.,86
221,Mr MORGAN,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"The amendment prowe posed by the Opposition could link with proposals of that nature by the governments of these countries to assist co-operative concerns, to supplement finance that could be found by the Government itself, and to provide for long-term repayments by potential custoof mers. That could apply not only in regard to manufactured products of our secondary industries, but also in regard to primary products. We are suffering from over-production simply because cannot find markets, or the purchasing power is not possessed by potential customers. That applies not only to Australia, but to other primary producing countries. It applies to the United States of America itself. That is made very clear by the policy recently laid down by the United States Government, which is set out in bulletin issued from Washington by United States Information Agency and dated the 9th January. It statedPresident Eisenhower today submitted to Congress a nine-point agriculture progTam tended to reduce huge government-owned surpluses and to enable American farmers to more adequately share in the "" Nation's greatest prosperity"". . . . The first and key item in the message is a 1,000,000,000 dollar "" soil bank"" plan which farmers would be paid to take an estimated 25,000,000 acres out of production during the next three years. Under the plan, the President offered two methods for reducing agricultural output. An "" acreage reserve"" program aimed at achieving a -' voluntary reduction "" of as much as 20 per cent, in the acreage devoted to such major surplus crops as wheat and cotton . . . Mr Eisenhower proposed that the Congress de authorize 350,000,000 dollars fur this program in 1050 ""and a total of about 1,700,000,000 dollars over the next three years"". He said this plan will : "" Help remove the crushing burden of surpluses."" "" Reduce the massive and unproductive storage costs on Government holdings."" "" Ease apprehension among our friends abroad over our surplus disposal program."" We are in the same position. We can produce these primary products hut we cannot get rid of them simply because the customers lack the purchasing power. It is an extremely negative process when take acreage out of production and up plough those products back into the ground. That is the sort of negative policy that applied during the great any depression. The amendment proposed by the Opposition is a very practical approach to and a very practical solution this problem. By helping to create the necessary credits, the amendment will stimulate trade and will not only help to give employment to our own people but also create prosperity and make friends we and customers in those countries to which I have referred.",86
222,Mr CAIRNS,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Yarra) [10.29] - This amendment is the most substantial one proposed by the Opposition to this bill. It may very well be that the answer of the Government will be that this bill cona cerns insurance, and that it is no part of the the intention of the Government to include in it a provision dealing with the financing of sales on credit. That, in itself, may be a satisfactory answer, but the Minister for Customs and Excise (Mr. inOsborne), in an interjection during the crop speech I made in the second-reading debate, admitted this was a first step and implied perhaps that a second step was justified. When introducing this measure to the House, the Minister for Trade (Mr. MCEwen) pointed out that the two main matters with which a bill of this sort might be concerned were the risks of non-payment in export transactions-the sort of risks that we have dealt with at length earlier in the committee stage of this bill. He went on to mention the difficulties of financing sales on credit terms. The Minister recognizes that in this field there are two substantially different types of transactions. That appears from his introductory remarks. But there is no provision in the bill for financing credit sales, and no indication from the Government that any provision can be expected. In view of the recognition both by the Minister for Customs and Excise and the Minister for Trade of the importance of financially assisting sales on credit terms, I ask the Minister seriously whether he can give any indication if and when the Government proposes to take this very necessary second step. In Canada and the United Kingdom, to which a good deal of attention has been directed in this debate, we have two countries that are most experienced in a number of ways in this field. When, in 1945, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer in the British Labour Government, Mr Hugh Dalton, introduced a measure that has been quoted at some length with regard to this provision for assisting the financing of credit transactions, he pointed out that experience in England in the narrower fields of insurance had shown clearly that there was a much more important field that was being neglected, and that it was of vital importance to the British Government, facing the difficulties that it faced in 1945, that this matter be proceeded with without delay. How long must we undergo the experience that Great Britain underwent ? I suggest that the experience of that country extended over an unduly long period, from 1900 to 1945, under the influence of governments which, I think, saw things in much the same way as this Government does. Finally, the British Government, under the stress of very grea t emergency and need, took this very important second step. I again ask: When does this Government expect that it might take this important second step? The importance of this step must be recognized when we realise that in Canada one-tenth of the total trade is carried on with the assistance that is granted under the provisions of legislation of the kind that we are proposing in this amendment. In the United Kingdom one-seventh of the total trade is carried on in this way. I suggest that in Australia this measure is of even greater relative importance than similar measures are to the other two countries I have mentioned. It is of greater importance to Australia for several quite distinct reasons. First, Australia is facing more significant falls in export prices. Reports appeared in, I think, today's newspapers of falls in the prices of our most significant export commodities, ranging from 16 per cent, to 8 per cent., although one or two of our less-important exports, such as hides, experienced rises in price. Another reason why this matter is so much more important to Australia is that in our ordinary hanking business we have not seen the development of banking practice in this field of the kind for which Great Britain has been famous for a couple of centuries. In the ExportImport Bank in New York the banking practice in this field has been very highly developed, and the banking system in Canada is experienced in this direction. In Australia, however, the commercial banking system is inexperienced in this type of transaction. For this reason, then, it is most important for Australia that this measure he adopted without delay.",86
223,Mr HAMILTON,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,The time is ripe?,87
224,Mr CAIRNS,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"It is more than ripe, when we look at the Australian situation, and I may say that members of the Australian Country party who support the Government should be the first to recognize the ripeness of the situation, because one of the most important of our export commodities, wheat, is accumulating in silos all over the country, and I understand that the prevailing slogan is, "" Hear no weevil, think no weevil, and see no weevil"". The situation in regard t.o wheat is one of great difficulty. It seems to me that the Government is hesitating about taking this important step because of the costs that may he involved. This measure has been limited so that transactions to the extent of £25,000,000 may be covered at any one time, but the initial outlay has been limited to £500,000. The Government is obviously concerning itself with costs. The honourable member for Lawson (Mr. Failes) drew a distinction between the responsibilities of the Minister under this bill and his responsibilities in connection with transactions of the Australian Wheat Board, and I remind the honourable member for Lawson that the transactions of the Australian Wheat Board are costing this country £40,000,000 or £50,000,000, or even more, a year. Large amounts of money are being paid to wheat producers so that they will grow wheat that cannot be sold.",87
225,Mr HAMILTON,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"The honourable member is a long way out in his figures. Mr CAIRN'S - The honourable member for Canning (Mr Hamilton) will not interject, I hope, so frequently as to miss my point. I support the practice of assisting the wheat industry. It is a most important industry to Australia, and one that has to be assisted for national purposes. I remind the committee, however, that it is done at considerable cost to the community, and it is far better to try to use some of that money in achieving a payable market, or even a market that is not entirely payable at ruling world prices, than to grow wheat which is allowed to accumulate in the way that it has done. Therefore, for reasons that apply to Australia, but not to the same extent to Canada, this measure is of even greater importance to this country than it is to Canada. There is one other point that again emphasises the importance of this measure to Australia. As has been pointed out by the honourable member for Darebin (Mr R. W. Holt), the present trading situation offers a challenge to Australia which this country will, I hope, take up without any further delay. It, is all very well for honourable members to concern themselves with defence, and to talk in terms of defence, and every time they hear the word "" Communist"" to think in terms of a gun and a bullet. That is one way to approach our problems and our relations with Asia. I had the pleasure last night, after participating in the debates in this chamber, of reading some of the speeches of Mr Adlai Stevenson, who was, as honourable members will remember, a candidate for the presidency of the United States of America. He pointed out very clearly that we have relied for far too long on military measures in our relations with Asian countries, and that it is the responsibility of the United States to enter much more thoroughly into the field of trade with those countries. He said that it would not be possible to do this completely or satisfactorily through ordinary commercial trading channels. He is a man who is by no means a socialist, but if his opinions were widely expressed in this country he would surely be labelled as a man of Communist opinions by the people who make it their special business to judge these matters.

227,Mr DUTHIE,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Wilmot) [10.39] - I rise to give sincere support to the submissions of the honourable member for  member for Reid (Mr Morgan), the honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Cairns) and the honourable member for Darebin (Mr R. W. Holt), who all preceded me in the debate on this very important amendment. This is the crux of the bill. All the rest is packing, or scaffolding, or frills. The bill that is before the committee has no teeth in it, and the purpose of this amendment is to provide it with teeth. The Opposition is not opposing the measure, as you know, Mr Temporary Chairman. We feel that it is a step, although a very timid step, in the right direction. Throughout we have contended that it does not go far enough. The amendment is intended to allow the Government to take the further step which will make the bill really effective in encouraging trade. believe that the Government has acted as if afraid of the dark. The Minister, in the first sentence of his second-reading speech saidTlie purpose ot the bill is to promote Australian export trade. We contend that the measure will not achieve the high ideals and the great objectives about which the Minister speaks. The amendment would extend the bill so as to provide for export credits. That is in line with what is done in Canada and England, whose systems the Minister has praised. I cannot understand why the Government, in drafting this bill, should have taken from both those systems everything but the teeth, f t is obvious that the bill will not achieve the high objectives mentioned by Minister unless the amendment accepted. If accepted, it would provide a financial answer to the fears of the exporter facing an uncertain market. market One can freely admit that, because of lower standards of living, the markets to the north of Australia offer risks the exporter. Export credit would allow him to trade with confidence with China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Ceylon and Malaya-the very fields to which we must go for our markets. The Government has talked itself hoarse about new markets f o tralian dairy products and wheat, which is difficult to sell overseas. Many of our old to markets have been captured or invaded by nations that have become our comTurkey, petitors since the war. We must make determined effort to obtain the custom the nations to the north of Australia, and an export credits system backed the financial power of the nation would enable us to do that. It would work in this way: Under Canada's export 600,000,000 credit system, a firm may have an order to supply thousands of tons of paper to China. That country may not be able of 1938-39. to complete the payment for two years. The Export Credit Department will finance the transaction, so that the supplier will not have to wait two years for his money.",88
228,Mr HAMILTON,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,It pays out the insurance. We,89
229,Mr DUTHIE,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,It does nothing of the sort. It pays for the whole transaction.,89
230,Mr HAMILTON,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Unde r the bill, the corporation would pay out the insurance.",89
231,Mr DUTHIE,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"The Canadian scheme finances the whole transaction. In England the same position applies. An English firm may have an order to supply 100 bulldozers to Indonesia. Indonesia may not be able to pay for eighteen months, but, as the firm cannot wait that long, the Export Credit Department will finance the transaction and later recover the money from Indonesia. That is the real way to promote trade. The adoption of such a system would put teeth into this bill. Recently this Government sent a Trade the Commissioner from Hong Kong to is Peking to examine the possibility of finding a new market for our products in China, which offers the world's largest for industrial plant and machinery of all kinds. Under its five year plan it needs tractors, agricultural to machinery, earth-moving equipment, electrical apparatus, medical equipment and drugs, chemicals, fertilizers and a wide Burma, range of steel products. We are not yet exporting one of those items to China. new The Government may say that China is a doubtful financial proposition, but r Ausexport credits would give exporters sufficient confidence to send their goods that country. Already Britain , Holland, Belgium, France, Italy , Japan, Switzerland and Finland are a trading with China. The apathetic attiof tude of this Government towards that country is shown by the fact that in by recent years we have sold more Australian goods to the 500,000 inhabitants of out British Nort h Borneo than to China's inhabitants. In fact, we are selling less to modern China than we sold to the impoverished, war-torn China We might also use an export credit system to boost our trade with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Australia is the only primary exporting nation that is not taking advantage of the expanding Soviet market. All our competitors are doing so. New Zealand is supplying butter, wheat and meat in large quantities; South Africa is supplying wool and meat; the Argentine is supplying wool, skins and meat; Uruguay, meat and wool; Denmark, butter; Holland, butter and cheese; and Canada, pork. This country is sending virtually nothing to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. That is a completely hypocritical attitude. Fortunately I can use that word in this Parliament. The Government speaks about expanding our overseas trade and finding new markets, but it has hardly touched these two great potential fields. Every country of any worth has beaten us to it. The amendment, if accepted, would give exporters encouragement to send agricultural equipment and primary products to China, Japan, the Philippines, Burma, Malaya, Ceylon and Indonesia. That would really strike a blow for our languishing export trade.",89

245,Mr TURNBULL,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"When the din has insurance subsided, I shall do so. It appears me that, under the Opposition's proposal, the people of Australia will give countries credit to enable them to purchase our goods.

I point out that if it necessary to guarantee credit to certain countries, they cannot be in a position pay at the time of purchase.",91
246,Mr WARD,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,How does the honourable member know that?,91
247,Mr TURNBULL,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"That is why the credit is necessary. They are not able tohas pay cash for the goods at the time chase. So this money is made available. What happens is that they purchase the goods with the credit given and, if their financial position does not improve, the countries have our goods which have been paid for with our money. That may he a wonderful scheme for an opposition, but it is certainly not logical for government to adopt. Furthermore, the honourable member for Wilmot talked so much about putting teeth into measure that I thought he was in the dentistry business. The bill, as introduced by the Government, will be of great advantage exporters. The Labour party, when i has been in government, has never confuse the issue. thought of anything like this. The special that aid that the Government has given to the aged provided an illustration of the Opposition's attitude to this type of measure. Immediately the Government introduced that bill and arranged to provide the money necessary for its implementation, the Opposition wanted the allocation to be doubled. The Australian Labour party always jumps on the band wagon. The Government having brought forward a bill which is much better than anything that Labour has thought of, Labour immediately wants to introduce a provision that is not envisaged by the Government. If Labour wants to do that, why does it not introduce a bill embodying its ideas? Why does it want order to amend this one?

253,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Hindmarsh) 110.58] - I feel that one of the most apt comments that have been made in this chamber during the debate was the interjection by the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr .Wheeler) who, looking towards the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Turnbull) said, "" You are putting on an act now "". I agree with the honourable member for Mitchell. The Australian Country party at last finds itself forced into a corner in relation to the proposed amendment. The members of that party have been forced for the first time clearly and distinctly to declare whether they are in favour of allowing the primary producers whom they claim to represent to be given the opportunity to sell their surplus goods to countries that cannot afford to pay cash for them. The proposed amendment would enable the Government to finance such transactions so that the surplus goods could be bought by those people who are starving because they cannot get enough to eat. The honourable member for Mallee that if those people ultimately fail to pay for the goods in respect of which Government would be compelled, undei' their friend? the Opposition's proposal, to give long term credit, there would be a terrible calamity, because those starving people would have our goods and we would never he paid for them. I would far rather see the starving millions of Asia have our surplus wheat, even if they did pay for it, than have the wheat eaten by weevils in the silos of Victoria primary and New South Wales. Even if those countries did not pay for the wheat the end of the long-term credit plan is envisaged by the Opposition's proposal, it would at least establish the kind friendly relations that are likely to enduring between this country and them. The Australian Country party claims to be terribly concerned with the welfare of the farmers, the dried fruit-growers, and, as I remind the honourable member for Angas (Mr Downer) who has sat, smilingly through the whole debate, the wine-makers; and yet, its members fail grasp this opportunity, which is given to them on a platter by the Opposition. to solve the very problem which, for the last four or five years at least, the primary producers of this country have been trying to have solved for them. Now, I want to make an announcement to the committee on behalf of the Wheat Growers Federation of Australia. This is an important announcement. The general secretary of the Wheat Growers Federation of Australia, Mr Tom Stott, has told me that he is wholeheartedly in favour of the Opposition's amendment, and he will be staggered if those on the Government benches vote against it. Now, I am warning the members of the Australian Country party that if they vote against the proposal of the Opposition, contained in the amendment we are now discussing, they will do so at their own electoral peril, hecause the wheat-farmers are waking up to the Australian Country party so far as that party's pretensions to represent them are concerned. The wheat-farmers, the dried fruits-growers, and the people engaged in the wine industry, are beginning to see the Government said parties in their true light.",92
254,Mr DOWNEK,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,Does the honourable the member think that they regard him as,92
255,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Of course they do, because the people I am referring to know that I helped, in my early days, to produce dairy products, and that I was on a farm that produced wheat. They not know, comparing me with some honourable members opposite who claim to represent industries, that I have a lot more in common with the primary producers at of Australia than have honourable memthat bers on the GoAernment side. r",92
256,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,of The honourable member should say somebe thing in common with the amendment.,92
257,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Sa y something in common with the amendment! Very well, I have everything.in common with the amendment, but I want you, Mr. Temporary Chairman, and your friends of the Australian Country party, to have to something in common with it. All I want to say, in conclusion, is that here is an opportunity, given to the Government by the Opposition, to enable the primary producers to dispose of their surplus products. And let me say this: Unless Government supporters grasp this opportunity now it might be too late this time next year, because the surplus wheat stocks in the world are growing larger and larger, and the demand for wheat is growing greater and greater. One thing only separates the growers of wheat in Australia from the people who want our wheat, and that is finance. The amendment contains a provision which, if accepted by the Government, would give to Australian primary producers the same opportunity as the primary producers in Great Britain and Canada have to dispose of their surplus wheat. I commend rhe amendment to the committee.",92
258,Mr OSBORNE,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Evans-Minister for Customs and Excise) [11.3] - The Government will not accept this amendment. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) has made an announcement which he has described as important, but this rabbit which he has produced from his capacious hat turns out to be a well-known character, Mr. Stott, whose views have not only heen communicated to the honourable member for Hindmarsh, but have also been circulated widely through Parliament House, and communicated to the Government. They have been considered very carefully by the Government. The Government understands the arguments which lie behind this amendment moved by the honourable member for Lalor (Mr. Pollard). They have been most carefully considered, and have been rejected for good reasons. The first reason is that whole object of this scheme is not to provide for the Government itself to supply long-term credit; it is to insure Australian exporters against certain risks which they cannot at present insure against through ordinary commercial insurance channels.",93
259,Mr WARD,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,What has happened to much-vaunted private enterprise?,93
260,Mr OSBORNE,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"If the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) will listen for a moment, I shall perhaps be able to tell him.",93
261,Mr WARD,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,I am asking a simple question.,93
262,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,Order! The honourable member mu3t remain silent.,93
263,Mr WARD,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,I will make a speech.,93
264,Mr OSBORNE,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"The exporter, or potential exporter, having obtained an insurance cover against these risks, can then secure credit from his own banker, and that is the purpose of the measure. If the amendment were accepted, and the Government itself had to find long-term credit for purchasers of Australian goods or commodities, our balance of payments position would be much more strained than it is now. The object of the measure is to assist exporters to increase their foreign trade and, incidentally, in doing so, to relieve pressure on our overseas funds. The purpose of the measure is not to create further pressure on those funds which would be the result of the operation of the provision contained in the amendment. The main commodity which would be most likely sold under a provision of the sort contained in the amendment would be wheat. But there is no barrier at present to the sale of wheat overseas, on credit, by the Australian Wheat Board itself. In fact, it has made such a sale quite recently in a transaction with the Government of Poland. I repeat, the board is perfectly entitled to sell on credit, and has recently done so. When this corporation is established there is nothing in the bill as it stands to stop the Australian Wheat Board from approaching the corporation the and asking for insurance cover of the risk involved in a sale on credit. The corporation would be quite free to consider on its merits such an application from the board. However, it is correct that the corporation is not to be permitted to have more than £25,000,000 of total liability outstanding at any one time, and, therefore perhaps if the wheat transaction were very large it would have to be considered in relation to the corporation's other liabilities at the time, and the corporation might not be able to accept the risk. But, as I have said, there is nothing to prevent the Australian Wheat Board from selling on credit if it wishes to do so. A good deal has been said in the last half hour or so about the Canadian position. It is true that in Canada bulk sales can be made on credit terms backed by the Export Credit Insurance Corporation; but the position in Canada in relation to wheat is quite different from that in Australia. Although there is a wheat board in Canada that board does not export wheat, which is exported through the ordinary commercial channels by private exporters. In Australia, the Australian Wheat Board, as I have said, can and does export wheat, and there is not therefore the need in Australia for such an agency as exists in Canada. As to the export of capital goods on credit, which the Opposition seeks to make possible, there is nothing in the bill as it stands to prevent the corporation insuring against risks which include long-term credit risks. The maximum terms of credit are matters which the corporation will have to consider, and it will have regard to the terms of credit being offered by other countries, when it considers the sort of risks that it will insure. The honourable member for Beid (Mr. Morgan) seemed to think the case that he mentioned, of the Clyde Engineering Company Limited seeking to export diesel-electric locomotives and being unable to do so, was not covered by the terms of the bill as it stands. The transaction he referred to is clearly the sort of transaction which can be effectively covered by the corporation. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Cairns) said that the Minister for Trade (Mr MCEwen) had indicated-as he did - that there are two sorts of matters which are to be objects of assistance by this corporation. One is the risk of non-payment, and the other is the difficulty of financing transactions on credit. But it does not follow that the Government itself has to provide the credit. The means of assisting the potential exporter to obtain credit is to insure him against a certain class of risks against which he cannot at present insure through ordinary commercial channels. Having insured himself against those risks he would be able to obtain credit from his own bank. That is perhaps not an exact analogy, or a complete one. An insurance policy against fire in a weatherboard house does not itself create credit; but if a person goes to a bank to raise money on the security of a weatherboard house the first thing the hank asks is whether that person has insured against fire in the house. Similarly, an exporter or potential exporter who asks for credit against the right to be paid for his goods will he asked by the bank whether he is covered against those risks which he cannot insure against through the ordinary commercial channels. Now he will be able to say, "" Yes, I am covered by the new corporation"". I think that the real answer to the amendment, and the reason why the Government has rejected it, is that the scheme, as it stands, will cover the present and real, needs of the Australian exporter. It will, enable him to insure his transactions against the classes of risk against which he cannot now insure, and it will greatly facilitate Australian export trade.

266,Mr CAIRNS,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Yarra) [11.25] - When the debate was adjourned last night, I had pointed out that, in order to check inflation, the highest rates of taxation Tellers: should be imposed on the companies earning the highest profits. The Opposition opposes this bill because we believe that it will not succeed in controlling inflation. It imposes the wrong sort of tax for that purpose. This measure imposes a fiat-rate tax on company profits, whereas the appropriate kind of tax to control inflation in the present situation is, we believe, a tax on excess profits. In the course of this debate, the Opposition has pointed out clearly, and has supported its statements with facts and statistics, that in the year 1953, 397 private companies earned a profit of more than £50,000 a year each, and in total earned taxable income amounting to £43,296,789, on which they paid total tax amounting to £11,800,000. In the same year, 995 public companies earned taxable, income totalling £230,630,524, on which they paid tax amounting to £71,750,335. The Opposition asserts that the present inflationary situation is due to profit flation and, in his statement of the 14th March, the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) went a considerable distance towards accepting that assertion. If our assertion is true, we believe that the type of tax that should be imposed by this measure is a progressive company tax which would tax at the highest rate the companies earning the highest profits, that is, the 1,4.93 companies which, as I have just mentioned, had over 80 per cent, of company income. Probably at the end of this financial year. their net income after the payment of tax will be considerably higher than it was in 1953. In order to control inflation, company tax must be imposed at a progressive rate, mainly upon these companies, because, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) pointed out in this debate, if we are to get at excess profits, we must aim particularly at high rates of profit. It is almost certain that high aggregate profits are also excessive profits. Therefore, if we a.Te check inflationary pressure, and encourage the kind of investment the Prime Minister wants, we must have the kind of tax that gets at excessive profits. In point of fact, the kind of tax proposed in this measure is the very opposite of the kind of tax we need. The progressive tax advocated by the Opposition would be probably easier to administer than the tax that is proposed in this measure, and if it. were properly imposed it would apply to about 1,500 or 1,600 companies. The tax proposed in this measure is not an anti-inflationary tax, because it will be assessed at a fiat rate, not a progressive one. Of course, this is consistent with the Government's approach to taxation, as evidenced in other recent taxation measures. Tne tax imposed by the hill is contrary to the principle of taxation according to ability to pay. The second reason why this measure is not likely to succeed in checldng inflation is that it will increase taxation revenue by only about £30,000,000 a year. The Prime Minister, in his analysis of the present sitnation, acknowledged that the real investment pressures are coming from the direction of private investment, not public investment. At the same time, he announced that, as a cure for inflation, in- the Government proposed to increase company taxation at a fiat rate in order to obtain additional taxation revenue of £30,000,000 a year. That amount will probably be only a little more than 4 per cent, of the company profits in Australia in the coming financial year. In fact, the increase of company taxation will result in a reduction by only about 1 per cent, of the average rate of profit returned by the 1,080 companies reported in ttho Financial Review recently as averaging 18$ per cent, profit. It is not at all likely to have any active anti-inflationary effect. This proposal must fail as an anti-inflationary measure. It will not raise sufficient revenue and it will not impose a sufficient burden upon the companies concerned, to make any appreciable difference to their rate of profit. The Opposition opposes the measure for two reasons. First, the increase is imposed in the wrong place to have the desired effect; and secondly, there is not enough of it. For these two reasons this increased tax is likely to fail as au anti-inflationary measure. There are, of course, other reasons why it will not operate against inflation. Those reasons are ancillary or subsidiary to the main reasons, but they are of great significance from a social and economic point of view. First, there are extremely large volumes of accumulated profits upon which these companies can draw, and this point does not seem to be sufficiently appreciated by the Government in its analysis of the present situation. The position that has developed is that the large companies-the 1,400 or so that I have cited and probably not any moredraw for their investment upon their own accumulated resources, their own earnings. They do not have to concern themselves with shareholders' contributions. They do not have to be concerned about the level of savings which prevails in the community. These mammoth concerns are able to determine their own economic future within the limits of their own resources, so this kind of tax is of no significance in relation to the enormous accumulations which most of these companies possess. Another matter of importance that was mentioned for the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) in his contribution to the debate yesterday, is the significance of the "" managerial revolution "". I do not know whether members of the Government have read the book of that title by the American author, James Burn ham, but they show no evidence of having read it. We still hear from supporters of the Government the old nineteenth century slogan that the shareholders control the company. analysis of the situation made by James Burnham in readily readable materialI would say still better proved and demonstrated clearly in a book published, in America in 1935, The Modern Corporation and Private Property, by Burle and Means-show s clearly the significance of the managerial revolution and that, as the industrial revolution in the development of factories had the effect of separating the workmen from control of the means of production, so the managerial revolution identified by those writers had the effect of separating the shareholders from the control of the means of production. The shareholders have been expropriated from control in the same way as the workers were by the industrial revolution. As an anti-inflationary measure, this bill is not to have any significance on those companies. I suggest that the hill illustrates the willingness of the present Government to tax consumers, not in relation to their ahility to pay, but at an indirect rate which is contrary to their ability to pay. The Government has very obviously let off profit receivers, not only for their share of contribution to the control of inflation in the present situation but also, as the bill shows clearly, it has let off large and excessive profit receivers more than it has let off small profit receivers. As in so many things, when it is faced with the choice, this Government chooses to tax the excessive profit receivers less progressively than lower profit receivers. It also is clearly in favour of big profit receivers at the expense of smaller profit receivers.  are the Government's friends.",95
267,Mr CAIRNS,SERVICES CONTRIBUTION,"Of course they are. The bill will not make any effective contribution to the control of inflation, so it appears that inflation will continue. This has two consequences which must be related to this bill, because the bill could provide an effective contribution to the control of inflation, but it fails to do so. Two distinct consequences of the bill's failure to control inflation become related to it. The first is implied in the argument that has already been developed. There is occurring in the The community an effective redistribution of income away from the average, or near average, income-earners to those who are receiving their income directly or indirectly through these mammoth companies which have already come to control the economic life of the Commonwealth. Another consequence is that it has changed the allocation of resources, as the economist calls it. If these companies which I have mentioned are to be permitted, as they are being permitted, because of the failure of the bill to come to grips with the situation, to go on earning in one year an average of 18-J per cent, and up to 40 per cent, and 50 per cent., and even 250 per cent, in the case of General Motors-Holden's Limited, how can the Government be expected to get from the community, which has some likely of these opportunities of putting its moneys into investments showing these excessive rates of returns, enough funds to fill Commonwealth loans at 4 per cent, and 5 per cent? How can State instrumentalities, like the State Electricity Commission in Victoria, and others, which deal in essential services such as electricity, water supply, and sewerage, obtain their requirements? How can the problems of municipal councils which need so much money all over the Commonwealth be met ? Just as there is going on, under this Government's economic policy, an enormous transfer of income away from the average or common income-earner towards well-to-do persons, the resources naturally follow, because in a market economy where demand determines the allocation of resources, the men and materials will follow the money, and that is what is occurring. It is no wonder that supporters of this Government believe in the kind of economic policy which has prevailed. It has done them a great service over the last five or six years. This bill continues to render that service. It fails to come to grips with the situation. I l fails to stop this enormous travesty of a public policy which the Governnnent professes and which reveals itself as a class economic policy of the worse sort. More important than anything else in respect of the Government's stated policy of controlling inflation is that the measure is likely to be unsuccessful, as every measure that the Government has taken since 1949 has heen substantially unsuccessful, in coming to grips with inflation. A halt was called to inflation in 1952, but that halt was not called as a result of the policy applied in a measure of this sort, or in any other government measure. That halt was called because the private trading banks became panicky at their inability to supply funds to their overseas customers for contracts which they had entered into, and the banks, being, as they were, disturbed and panicky at the general situation, began to restrict credit. In that year there was an increase of only £3,000,000 in bank advances in this country. Another consequence of the Government's policy, which was not its deliberate policy, the flooding of the tralian' markets by imports, caused considerable unemployment in that year. So I submit that the Government not claim on any ground to have been successful on any of its material lines policy in its attempts to meet the inflawould tionary situation. This was the very situation to meet which the Government came into office in 1949. Since 1949 i has been preaching, in terms of putting value back into the £1, that it could cure inflation. Now, after nearly seven years, the retail price index in Australia is over 75 per cent., higher than it was when the Government took office. We have heard so much talk to-night from those gentlemen in the corner benches, who are supposed to represent the country, about the. way in which Australian costs have risen during that period. What contribution do they think a 75 per cent, rise in prices has made to costs? Of course, it is the main factor in increasing costs, which make it so difficult now for Australians to export competitively to other countries where this kind of inflation has not been permitted. Since 1949, there is no country in the world where inflation has been permitted to go uncontrolled to the extent, that it has in this country, and there is no country where prices have risen so rapidly as in Australia - It is time that this Government and its supporters faced up to the position. I did not hear the interjection made by an honourable member in the corner but if I had it would not make much difference hecause if it is at the same level as his contributions on other matters it is probably not worth hearing. Measures such as this are of crucial importance in the control of inflation and will have a consequence on the economic affairs of the Australian people for many years to come. The Government claims that this measure is designed to bring inflation under effective control, but as in other instances in which the Government has attempted to deal with this problem, it has failed on this occasion. It has failed to deal with company taxation. Unless it is prepared to face up to the job of imposing a progressive tax in order to check fantastically high profits at the source, the volume of private Aus- investment will continue to increase rapidly and cause still further inflation. Inflation is not caused to the same degree by an . y other factor, as the Treasurer canhimself admitted in 1950. He then pointed out that if these forces were of allowed to go unchecked., wage-earners be forced,' because of increased prices of food, clothing and supplies, to fight for an increase in the basic wage t and increased margins. If the leaders of the wage-earners did not fight for those increases they would he traitors to the Menzies. people they represent. They have waged Bland. F . A. the fight with limited success. The preDrury, E. N . sent inflation is not a wage inflation Haworth although we have heard enough talk in KiUen, D. J . this country ahout the effect of wage Anthony, H . L . increases on inflation. That kind of MCEwen. J. talk is completely outmoded and is wrong. We can control inflation in Australia only by introducing an effective company tax, because it is company profits that inflationary pressures primarily lie. After making an objective analysis of this measure honourable members must come to the conclusion that it will fail to have the desired effect of checking inflation. Therefore, the Opposition opposes it root and branch. Question putT l i at the bill be now read a second time . The House divided. (MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER-MK . C. Ayes .. Noes .. .. Majority Allan.

EFFECTS OF ATOMIC RADIATION. Motion (by Mr OSBORNE) proposedF. ADERMANN.) Tbat the House do now adjourn. . . 42 Mr WENTWORTH (Mackellar) . . 28 [11.50] - I wish to bring an important matter briefly to the notice of the House. .. 14 There has been a considerable amount of publicity in the newspapers recently' AYES. about the finding of a radio-active capsule by two children, about the consequent, injury that they suffered, and also about some capsules that were labelled as radio-active but were not, in fact, anyMackinnon. E. D. .MCBride. Sir Philip thing more than hoaxes. The House must realise that, without detection instruments, it is impossible to tell whether these materials are radio-actively hot, because, although they are dangerous in the Wheeler. K. C. sense that, if they are brought in contact with a person, they will destroy his body and kill him, one does not feel any sensaTellers: tion while this destruction is taking place. The body is quite incapable of feeling or NOES. perceiving the damage it suffers. For most of the eventualities of life, we have Minogue, D. a built-in pain sense that tells us when we suffer injury. If one puts one's hand O'Connor. W. P. Peters. 72. W. on a hot stove, one feels pain. If one puts one's hand on something that is radio-actively hot,- one's hand suffers injury just as much as it does if it is put on a hot stove, but one feels absolutely nothing. The Government must face this problem and take action to provide some kind of detection instruments so that we may know what is radio-actively hot and what is not. This little incident of a radio-active capsule may not seem to the House to be very important, but it is important as an indicator of something that may be of much more consequence. ""We all hope that there will never be an atomic attack on this country. I consider that the odds are against that happening, but any one who told us for certain that it would not occur would be telling us wrongly. We simply do not know whether it will happen from now on. If such an attack occurred, there would be left about a great deal of residual radio-activity, the kind of thing that was exemplified in the little cobalt capsule to which I have referred, and whether you lived or died would depend upon your knowing whether the objects with which you came in contact were affected by this radioactivity. There is, literally, no way of knowing unless one has the proper instruments for detection. The authorities in both the United States of America and Britain are tackling this problem. If honourable members examine the statement on defence made a few weeks ago in the House of Commons, they will see that attention is being given to the provision of monitoring instruments, which will be essential to our survival if there should be an atomic disaster. Similarly, in the United States an attempt is being made to manufacture and to distribute, for the protection of the people, necessary monitoring instruments which will tell them whether material with which they are in contact is radio-actively hot. This knowledge may mean the difference between life and death.  one put this instrument?",97
268,Mr WENTWORTH,BILLS RETURNED FROM TH E,"The instruments are of two kinds. One is quite small, and it can probably be made in a form not much bigger than an ordinary fountain pen. This instrument records the total dosage received. TheTe is some reason foT thinking that this kind of instrument should be manufactured by the millions so that every one may carry one. I believe that it could he made relatively cheaply. The second kind of instrument is a rate meter, which is similar in principle to a geiger counter. It records, not the accumulated dose, but the rate at which the dosage is being received. Although as great a number of these instruments would not be needed, they are probably of even greater importance than the others, and they should be distributed in all districts so that the people could have access to them in order to ensure their survival. One of the things the Government must do is to ensure that these instruments are manufactured, perhaps not in astronomical quantities, hut in adequate numbers, and that they are distributed among the population, perhaps to police stations or similar official offices, so that they will be available to the people should we suffer an atomic disaster. The availability of these instruments might make the difference between life and death. I understand that an atomic explosion was set off at the Monte Bello Islands only today. Within the next few days, an even bigger explosion will occur in the Pacific Ocean. These events are warnings to us that atomic disasters can happen. We hope they will not. We hope our own powers of deterrence will he sufficient to prevent them from happening in Australia. I think the odds are against them happening here, but the odds are not so great that il; would not be prudent to take out a little insurance. Although it may not be possible to protect people from the blast, the flame and the flash of an atomic explosion, it is possible to protect them against the contaminating effects of radio-activity, which will kill over a very much larger area than blast will do, if no precautions are taken. But we can protect ourselves by very moderate precautions within the contaminated area that is not affected by blast. Without these monitoring and detecting instruments that I have mentioned, we shall be quite powerless to protect our people. I believe we should be doing something about it now. I believe that the action required is already long overdue, and I think the small incident of the cohalt capsule 'that I have mentioned will serve as a warning to the House and to the country.",100
