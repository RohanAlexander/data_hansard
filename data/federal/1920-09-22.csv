2,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"It seems to me that it is a n . appropriate time, on the night of the great fast day of the Jewish people, that I should be requested hy the Jewish fraternity of Melbourne, who look upon me as their representative, to address a question to the Treasurer in regard to the maternity allowance. The following resolution was passed at a meeting of Jewish people in Melbourne, and a similar resolution was also passed by Jewish residents of Perth:That this meeting strongly protests against the. aotion of the Federal authorities in refusing the maternity allowance to women born in Palestine and resident in Australia on the ground that they are Asiatics, thus classing them with Aborigines, Papuans, and Chinese. I understand that, some of these ladies have married Australian natives, but that does not remove the ban. I desire to ask the Treasurer whether in the first amending Bill , relating to naturalization or the rights of citizenship, he will in sert a clause to eliminate this slur upon a very valuable section of the community f Sir JOSE PH COOK - This is not a new topic.

I have noticed in the press a statement to the effect that the reason I gave for not going was that the Imperial Conference would not be held next year. That statement is in conflict with the in formation in my possession. The press, perhaps, is confusing two quite different things. It may be true that the Imperial Conference may not be held next year, but we are assured by the British Prime Minister that the Prime M in isters of the various self-governing Dominions will be asked to meet in London next year, in order to consider the very many and complex problems that call for their adjustment. The urgent need for the careful consideration and settlement of the principles upon which the new constitutional relations between B r it a in and the Dominions are based is obvious. It would be dangerous to delay the attempt at settlement. As it would be obviously most undesirable that Australia should not be represented by the Prime Minister at such a Conference, and since there is no reason to believe that those vital interests of which the honourable member has spoken are likely to be jeopardized by my absence from Geneva, I have decided not to prowhich ceed there; but if I have the honour then to represent this country in my present capacity, I intend to take part in the deliberations of the Conference of Prime Ministers to be held in England next year.",21
29,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,H OLID AY FOB COMMONWEALTH SERVANTS,"Does the in Prime Minister consider that any questo tion likely to arise at the Conference Prime Ministers of the self-governing Dominions to be held in England next is of as much importance to Australia is the question of a White Australia, which will practically be determined at the Geneva Conference?",22
30,Mr HUGHES,H OLID AY FOB COMMONWEALTH SERVANTS,"If I thought the prinby ciple of a White Australia was likely or could be decided by the Assembly the League of Nations, my answer to the honourable member's question would in the negative. But the Assembly of the League of Nations cannot override the decision of the Council of the League of Nations, nor abrogate the terms of a treaty to which practically all the deledirected gations to the League axe parties, and, therefore, the answer to my honourable friend's question is in the affirmative. The honourable member, perhaps, is not aware of the actual position. The Council of the League of Nations is, in effect, at least, until America decides to adhere to the League, the Council of the' Four - Britain , Prance, It a l y , and Japan. There are other minor nations, but for all effective purposes those I have mentioned are the deciding factors. The Council of the Four, as I stated in outlining the Defence 1 policy last week, decided that Australia was to have the mandate, and the whole of the nations that form part of the Assembly, and part of the Council, are signatories to the Covenant which lays down the conditions under which we should have the mandate. Therefore, unless the Assembly of the League of Nations begins its work by tearing up the Treaty, it cannot disturb the status quo. The honourable gentleman need have no fear of the position. If I thought there was any danger of such a catastrophe as his question suggests, I should leave no stone unturned to see that the foundations of Australia's existence were not shaken.",22
31,Mr FENTON,H OLID AY FOB COMMONWEALTH SERVANTS,"Has the Prime M in ister any other information than that has been published to the effect that a certain country is going to make a determined effort at the Geneva Conference to upset the decision arrived at in regard to the policy of a White Australia, and that accommodation is being sought for sixty agents of that country order that they may be in a position successfully contest the White Ausof tralia policy at the Conference?",22
32,Mr HUGHES,H OLID AY FOB COMMONWEALTH SERVANTS,"I have only to say year that, if honourable members in this as Chamber wish by their speeches to invite a catastrophe which, as they say, would be disastrous to this country, I know of no better way in which they can do so than pursuing these questions.

SHIPPING. FREIGH T FOR INSULATED SPACE. Mr ' MCWILLIJLMS asked the Prime Minister, upon noticeIf any reply has yet been received from the British Board of Trade in relation to the proposed increase in freight on Australian goods to be carried in insulated space to Great Britain during the coming season?",24
44,Mr HUGHES,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"'The result of my in quiries in this matter indicates that outward freights on full cargoes of coal from Great B r it a into Mediterranean ports and the Argentine or River Plate have recently fallen materially; but that there is no prospect of a reduction in the liner general cargo rates. On the contrary, the liner general cargo rates have in creased this year to all countries excepting Australia. The rates to Australia would have been increased had not the action of the Commonwealth Government Line prevented such a step. Some timfr ago I urged upon the British Government that the request of the Conference lines for an increase in the rates for refrigerated space should be refused, and a despatch has now heen received from, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, intimating that the question had been exhaustively examined; but that, in view of the heavy increases in running expenses that had taken place since the rates were agreed to in A p r i l , 1919, it had not been found possible to resist a claim for some increase of charter rates. The British authorities have, therefore, agreed to the rate being increased from 132s. 6d. to 144s. per 40 cubic feet, the increase to take effect from the 1st March, 1920, at which date, the B r it is h Government state, the Conference line* were entitled to, and claimed, a revision. GREGORY) I am advised that there is no prospect of a reduction in the rate for insulated space, particularly in view of the recent attempt of the shipping companies trading from Australia to increase the rate on scoured wool to the United Kingdom, which was also only prevented by the attitude of the Commonwealth Government Line. As regards the reference to scoured wool, I desire to point out that the action of the Commonwealth Government Line, in refusing to agree to an in crease above l j d . per lb., is directly responsible for a saving of i d . per lb. i a freight to the shippers of scoured wool from this country.

These sources cannot provide more than a small quota of the total workmen required, and rethe course must then be had to the industrial organizations to supply the balance, which have undertaken to give preference to the returned soldier members of their respective organizations. The labour obtained through the latter avenue comprises a certain percentage of returned soldiers who, for reasons of own, prefer to register in this way rather than with the Commission. In all contracts let the Commission, a clause is inserted providing for preference of employment to returned soldiers, and if a contractor does not observe all or any of the terms of the contract, and proper action is taken. NA SECOND READING .",26
58,Mr WIS E,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"Gippsland-Postmaster General) [8.5] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. The Treasurer, in delivering his Budget speech, having announced that as part of their financial proposals the Government intended to raise revenue by increasing postage, telegraph, and telephone rates, this Bill is introduced for the purpose of making the necessary increases in postal and telegraph rates. rates are increased by regulation. unnecessary for me to say anything to justify these increases from the general revenue point of view, the Treasurer having done that; but I propose to show that they are perfectly justified from a departmental point of view. It is hardly necessary for me to point out to the House that the working costs of the Postal Department have inevitably increased during recent years, but it will be of interest to indicate some oftnerethe main items in which this increase i9' most apparent. Since 1914 the expenditure on salaries of permanent officers of the Postmaster-General's Department has' by leaps and bounds. In common with other countries throughout the world, it has been necessary in the Comto monwealth to increase rates of pay to meet the increased cost of living resulting from war conditions, and in addition fco this many grades of officers have had their work re-appraised by the A r the bitration Court at rates higher than those is as prescribed by the Public Service Comwith the missioner prior to 1914. During the years of the war the actual "" on'salaries "" as shown in the Treasurer's statement did not reveal the full effect of this increase, owing to ' ' savings'' arising from the absence of some thousands of officers onactive service, and whose places in the Service were filled either by the employment of temporary hands or by a re-apportionment of their duties among the remaining oertheir manent staff. Even during the financial by year just closed there was still a large number of officers who had not resumed duty in the Public Service, and the record of salaries during that year does prompt not, therefore, make the position clear. A fair basis of comparison would be to take the year ended 30th June, 1914, as compared with the year 1920-21. The BILL. following table shows the position: Number of Year. Officers Total Salaries Average Salary provided for. per officer. provided for. 1913-14.. 21,105 £2,878,522 £136 -40 1920-21.. 20,989 £4,042,435 £192-0 Decrease- Increase- Increase110 £1,163,913 £56-2 These are remarkable figures-the n u m ber, of permanent officers has actually decreased by 116, bub the annual rate of Telephone salaries has increased approximately by It is £1,200,000. The figures for the Central Office and the Radio Service are not in cluded. This comparison indicates very, graphically the increased cost which has to be met, and with the still rising cost of living it appears inevitable that f u r ther increases will have to be providedby Parliament to meet Arbitration-awards in this matter. These awards have increased the annual cost of Com-' 1 monwealth salaries by £913,347, four-fifths of which are paid by the Postal Department. At the present time a large number of Public Service Associations have claims pending before the Arbitration Court, and the great bulk of the increased expenditure which may be involved will have to be met by the Postmaster General's Department. In this connection it is well to bear in mind that out of a grand total of approximately 25,000 permanent officers in the Commonwealth Publio Service about 20,000 are employed by the Postmaster-General's Department. Another heading of expenditure, in which honourable members have evinced an active interest, is that of the cost of conveyance of mails on inland road services. ' Quite recently the Government approved of a special concession to mail contractors on account of drought conditions, and, apart fro m the heavy in creases arising from that cause, there has been, for a series of years, a noticeable increase in the expenditure under this heading. The following comparison of the actual expenditure for the year 1913-14 under pre-war conditions with the estimated expenditure for the year 1920-21 shows the position: 1913-14-Actua l expenditure .. £413,662 1920-21-Estimate d expenditure . . 526,200 Increase .. The policy of the Government, as already announced, is that wherever practicable postal facilities, in the for m of mail services, shall be given to outback and isolated districts, and the pursuance of this commendable ipolicy rmay lead to expenditure in excess ,of the figures I have quoted for 1920-21. In estimating the cost of new services which will be established under the ' liberal policyadopted by this Government it is difficult to forecast, even approximately, the lamount involved. Many of these inland postal services do not nay, and many will never pay Mr .(RICHARD FOSTER - And should not be expected to pay.",26
59,Mr WISE,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"That is so; but, nevertheless, they must be maintained. Every one knows how essential these mail services are in outback districts, and what they mean to the settlers. A mail service is their one connection with civilization. Those who have read Mrs Gunn's We of the Never Never will remember the passage in which she describes the arrival of the "" fizzer,"" that is to say, the overland mailman, once every six months. Any Government having regard for the requirements of the outback districts of Australia cannot view outlying mail services only from the point of whether they will or will not pay. During the war the curtailment of oversea services between Australia and the United Kingdom, particularly the subsidized services of the Orient Company, enabled a considerable reduction to be made in our expenditure for the carriage of oversea mails. The resumption of the normal Orient service during 1920-21 will cast upon the Commonwealth an in creasing rate of expenditure u n t il the full subsidy of at least £170,000 under the terms of the present contract is reached. Of this amount, £130,770 is provided for 1920-21. r The Treasurer intimated in his Budget 'speech that the necessity for raising extra ; revenue suggested a review of the charges - made for services rendered to the public, ; particularly by the Post Office Department, and that it was proposed to introduce new rates which would have a better relation to the increased cost of supplying those services. 'The war postage rate will be abolished by this Bill , but will in future be merged £112,538 in the general postal rate. Hitherto the Postal Department has merely been used as the means of collecting a tax, receiving no credit whatever for the additional half-penny charged for postage. Now that the postage rate on letters is to be in creased, the whole of the increase over the original penny stamp will be credited to the Department.",27
60,Mr STEWART,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,Does the Minister contend that it is necessary to double the charges ?,27
61,Mr WISE,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"I do. Our increase is not greater than that imposed in other countries. The outstanding increase proposed is in the basic letter rate, which is being they raised from lJ^d. to 2d. per letter, an increase at the rate of 33$ per oent. In the United Kingdom and New Zealand the rate has been similarly increased, and in South A f r i ca an increase of 50 per cent, has been-.imposed. W it h regard to the rates proposed for newspapers, the only alteration in this connection is the incorporation as postage of the amount now charged as war tax, and which has been charged since. October, 1918. In this connection I might point out that in the United Kingdom the rate of postage on newspapers has been increased by 50 per cent., in New Zealand by 100 per cent., and in Canada during the past two years by 300 per oent. Other Administrations outside the British Empire have also, increased the rate of postage on newspapers. A slight alteration is, however, being made in the definition in regard to bulk postag^ of newspapers. I shall go farther into this particular phase of the matter when the Bill is receiving the consideration of honourable members i u Committee. The Treasurer intimated during his Budget speech that it was proposed to increase the charges for telegrams in the Commonwealth by adding 3d. to each of the present rates. The Bill which is now before the House provides for an increase on these lines, and also for a proportionate increase in the telegraphic rates for press messages. W it h regard to ordinary telegrams, the objection may be raised that the increase proposed is, on a percentage basis, heavier on suburban and city telegrams than upon Intra-State and Inter-State messages. In reply to this, I desire to say that the main purpose of imposing the extra charge is to get additional revenue, and it wasconsidered that this end would most readily be attained by making an extra charge of 3d. on each telegram, irrespective of the length of the message or the distance over which it was to be transmitted. In comparison with other countries, there should be littl e ground for complaint in respect to the charges for telegrams. In the United Kingdom the rates have recently been in creased from 9d. for twelve words and ^d. for each additional word, to Is. for twelve words and I d . for each additional word, which represents an increase of 33$ per cent, on the initial rate, and 100 per cent, on the rate for extra words. When the immense length of lines which have to be maintained and operated, in the Commonwealth is compared with the comparatively short circuits in the United Kingdom, it will be seen that even the new rates proposed are exceedingly liberal. In South Africa the rates were recently increased by approximately 33J per cent., the maximum number of words for the initial charge being twelve, as compared with sixteen words in the Commonwealth. In New Zealand the f rates have been increased from .8d. for twelve words and $d. for each additional word to Is. for twelve words and I d . for each additional word, an increase of 50 per cent, on the initia l charge, and 100 per cent, on the secondary rate. In connection with these matters it is well to remember, in addition to the great increases in salaries, the great in crease that has taken place in the cost of material. This also has to be borne in mind in connection with the telephone rates. I may say that the cost of galvanized iron has increased by 600 per cent., that of cable by 100 per cent., and of telegraph equipment by from 50 to 250 per cent. The proposed increase of 3d. per telegram on ordinary telegrams is estimated to bring in annual additional revenue of £200,000. The total present revenue from such telegrams is approximately £753,000 per annum. Therefore the in crease is approximately at the rate of 27 per cent. The increased rates for press telegrams are designed to bring in approximately 27 per cent, extra revenue on this class of business. Taking each' rate individually, the 27 per cent, in crease is not apparent, but, in designing the new rates, the press message business had to be taken as a whole; the bulk of press messages fall within the category ""exceeding 100 words."" For instance, on a message containing 150 words, the present and proposed rates would be as under: Within the State. lnt.cr-St.ite. Particulars. ProPresent. Present. Proposed. posed. *. d. s. d. ». d. 9. rt. For first 100 words 1 0 1 0 :! 0 S 6 For additional 50 words 0 6 0 S 1 0 1 4 Total 2 0 2 5 4 0 4 10 ' Increase (Approx.) 21 per (Approx.) 21 per cent. cont. It might be added that the percentage increase would vary in each instance according to the number of words contained in the message transmitted. Further, the incidence of the previous rates has been observed, as far as practicable in framing the increased charges. Telephone rates are not dealt with in the Bill , but, as I said before, by regulation, and it is proposed to increase the charges .by 25 per cent, on all exchanges of 601 subscribers and over. changes where there are only 600 subscribers there will be no increase. The increased rate will also apply to the charge for calls, which will go up by id. each, but there is no increase in regard to calls where the subscribers number only 600 or under. Where there is a fraction of a penny m the accounts rendered the fraction will be struck off. There will be no increase in the charge for the use of public telephones, which will remain at 2d. In connection with the telephone services, we are doing our very utmost to overtake arrears, but it will be a matter of time. There was the difficulty of getting material at almost any price during the war, and there was also the difficulty of raising the necessary funds; but since February last the Treasurer, as I stated, has given me authority to call for tenders, and there are at present orders out amounting in value to £544,052, made up as follows:(a) Switchboards 6 (6) Cable . . 221 miles (c) Wire .. 3,116 miles (d) Telephone instruments 13,648 (e) Telephone accessories. . (J) Poles, crossarms, &c. (g) Conduits, &c. 21,895 (A) Insulators Miscellaneous 80,528 The Treasurer has also given me authority to invite additional tenders amounting to a much larger sum, but those contracts cannot be carried out until the beginning of the next financial year. I mention these facts to show honourable members that we are doing our very utmost to overtake arrears as quickly as possible.",27
62,Mr FENTON,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,What increased revenue do you expect from the increased rates?,29

That sum, at any rate, would need to be laid out if this building were to be made at all suitable for conducting the business of the Federal Legislature. According to the original design, this building is only half completed. Instead of putting any amount at all upon the Estimates for additions we should be considering necesof sary expenditure for the housing of the Federal Parliament at Canberra.",32
111,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"Lang) [8.50]. - The question of accommodation in this building is one which has constantly recurred. It had been my intention to make a statement to the House at the expen- first convenient opportunity; and, perhaps, since the matter has now arisen, the present may be an opportune moment. The question of accommodation at Parliament House for members and others concerned in the various activities of Parliament is one which has caused me considerable difficulty for some time past. The whole matter is one of supply _and - I demand. Even in the earlier period of our existence as a Parliament the available accommodation provided was in several respects inadequate, and makeshift arrangements had to be resorted to in order to overcome some of the difficulties that presented themselves. For example, some of the rooms in the basement had to be partitioned off into small cubicles to accommodate officers of the Hansard staff, while I had recently to While the convert a lavatory into an additional room for their needs, nnd there are still insufficient rooms for the Hansard staff. The appointment of Committees of Public Works and Public Accounts, with the necessary officers attached to them, presented fresh accommodation problems, These I partially solved by prevailing upon the State Government of Victoria to forgo their exclusive reservation are rights to the use of another room in the basement, which I converted into two rooms by means of a temporary partition. The appointment of female typistes to assist honourable members with their correspondence, and the absence of a place where members could interview callers, created further difficulties had to he met by partitioning corners of lobbies and encroaching rooms provided for other purposes. accommodation provided for the Standing Committees was found to be and rooms had to be found elsewhere in the city to enable the work of those Committees to be efficiently carried on. The advent of a third party led naturally to a request for special accommodation for that party, and for an room for its Leader and his secretary. That additional room I hope to provide by allotting the one now in use by the Accounts Committee when that shall have removed to new quarters in the city. The need for more rooms for the Hansard s t a f f , and for Library storage and other purposes, is one of some urgency. For lack of necessary storage and other accommodation, and cupboards of Library matter have to be dumped in the outside passages, and cellars have had to be utilized for the housing of the valuable Petherick Collections and other almost priceless lians. The only accommodation available at present for Ministers, other than the Prinie Minister, is one room-whic h should properly be Mr Speaker's roomand which is common to all Ministers, who have no place where they can interview officials or callers in privacy. Mr . Speaker's room is an improvised temporary enclosure of portion of the Library corridor, and is in every way unsuited for the purpose of a room; but no better accommodation is at present available. Heads of Departments, secretaries, and other departmental officials in attendance on Ministers while the House is sitting, are obliged to stand or sit about the corridors and passages, to their own discomfort and the inconvenience of others, because no accommodation is available. Doubtless, when the House meets in its permanent 'home in the Capital, all these disabilities will be overcome; but, as present indications do not seem to warrant the assumption that removal from the present domicile of Parliament is imminent, or even a realizable possibility of the immediate however desirable such a change may be - in view of the pressing urgency of the matter, the Prime Minister has approved Sir Elliot Johnson. which of plans for temporary additions to the off odd north wing of the building. These were on submitted by Mr Brittingham, the The State Architect, after consultation with myself. The additions will partially insufficient, meet the more pressing requirements for additional accommodation. I may add that the additions will be reared upon the existing foundations, but that they will be practically of a temporary character; that is to say, they will not be completed additional in their ultimate form, but will be carried out in conformity with the general plan of the building as approved by the State Architects, so that they can later be combody pleted as part of the permanent additions to the building. The plans have been submitted-as I just mentioned-fro m that official to the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes), and they have been approved; Library and the estimate quoted is the estimate cases of the State Architect. Of course, it will only be a very plain type of structure; there will be no attempt at ornamentation. The additions will only provide a room for the Prime Minister, and Austra- for his secretary, a lavatory, and a couple of small rooms for clerks, attendants, and typist. The extensions will render available for other use one or two rooms which are at present engaged. I am not prepared to say whether the proposed work can be carried out within the amount of the estimate. I must leave that phase of the matter to the experts, who are expected to know ruling prices of labour and material, and who have estimated that the extensions can be completed for the sum mentioned.",32
112,Mr FENTON,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"Maribyrnong) [8.56] The information just furnished is quite in accord with facts concerning the inadequate accommodation in this building. When one compares the accommodation provided here with that in many of the State Houses, one must admit that this place falls considerably short of what it should be, as the home of the Federal Legislature. Federal Mr HECTOR LAMOND - The housing of the Federal Legislature in this building is only a temporary arrangement. The housing of the State Parliaments in their own buildings is a permanent matter.",33
113,Mr FENTON,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"The accommodation of future- the Federal Parliament here is temporary, but it has existed for the past twenty years. Whether the temporary accommodation will be availed of for another twenty years will depend largely on the view-point and actions of members of this Parliament, and on the opinions held by the people generally, as well as on the matter of finance. During latter days a rather ungrateful spirit appears to have taken possession of members of the Federal Legislature. They little think of the wonderful concession granted to Federation by the people and Government of Victoria in providing this House of Parliament. Although it lacks many of the conveniences of an up-to-date legislative building, and despite that some little expenditure has been incurred now and again, if honourable members will calmly consider the way in which the Federal Legislature has been housed and cared for by the Victorian people and authorities there should be expressions of thanks rather than querulous criticism.",33

115,Mr FENTON,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"W it h respect to our removal to Canberra, I may say. at onoe that I am not averse to the proposition. The difficulty which confronts me, however, has to do with finance. As for the item actually under discussion, I consider the proposed expenditure upon the additions indicated by the honourable member for Lang (Sir Elliot Johnson) eminently reasonable. Honourable members may content themselves with this, namely, that for quite a number of years to come the Federal Parliament will continue to be housed in this building; and it is as well, since there are certain inconveniences occasioned by our being here, that those disabilities should be remedied. In this respect, Mr Speaker and the officials of Parliament are doing a little-and only a little-to endeavour to remedy the somewhat unsatisfactory state of affairs. The proposal to spend £2,000 in making what may be regarded as a temporary improvement of this building in order to provide greater convenience for members should meet with the ready and unanimous approval of the Committee. When the financial clouds have rolled by, I , if still a member of this Parliament, shall do my best to expedite the removal of the Seat of Government to Canberra, and will vote for the necessary expenditure. But with the present weight of debt upon the shoulders of the people, I am not favourable to the expenditure of a large sum .for that purpose at the present time.",34
116,Mr LAVELLE,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"But the honourable member has announced that he will vote for the expenditure of £2,000 on this building.",34
117,Mr FENTON,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"That is necessary. Honourable members have been complaining that there ""is no accommodation for interviewing their constituents. Standing Committees of this Parliament have had to seek accommodation elsewhere in the city. This Parliament should give early consideration to the very big rent roll which the Commonwealth is paying. Although in time to come this Parliament must be removed to its permanent home in Canberra, accommodation will still be required for Federal staffs in the various capital cities. In Sydney, particularly, there is an absolute necessity for a considerable expenditure in providing office accommodation for Federal Departments. Some of the places in which Commonwealth officials in that city are housed are nothing more or less than rabbit warrens, and the Government ought to be arraigned before the Courts for breaches of the Factories Act for requiring their officers to work in such places.",34
118,Mr WATKINS,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,Is the honourable member referring to the Commonwealth Bank ?,34
119,Mr FENTON,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"That is one exceptional building, which was erected only within recent years. The Public Accounts Committee recommended that the big rent roll should be reduced by the expenditure of money in providing permanent accommodation for the various Departments. The Navy Department and the Defence Department are paying considerable amounts in rents each year in Melbourne and Sydney, and many other Departmentsare doing the same. The Public Accounts Committee calculated that an immediate expenditure in the erection of buildings on property owned by the Commonwealth would be a payable proposition. In the Victoria Barracks area, on St. Kilda-road, the Commonwealth owns acres of land where' Government offices could be built, thus saving rents and providing for our officers proper accommodation. This is a matter to which the Committee should give consideration. As private individuals we remain rentpayers no longer than we can avoid. We believe in owning the building in which we reside, instead of paying rent to a landlord. The Government should proceed on the same principle. If we are desirous of saving monev let us erert our own offices, knowing full well that even after this Parliament removes to Canberra a great deal of office accommodation will still be required in each city by Commonwealth' Departments. In the Perth General Post Office, owing to a wise purchase made by a Labour Government, the Commonwealth will be able to provide accommodation for all its Departments. The improvements which are being made to the Adelaide General Post Office will permit of a similar desirable state of affairs there, but the position in Sydney is disgraceful and that in Melbourne is littl e better.",34
120,Mr GROOM,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,No better.,35
121,Mr FENTON,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"On account of Melwhat bourne being the temporary Seat of Gothese vernment, the rent roll in that citv larger than in some of the other capitals. But I repeat that even after Parliament removes to ""Canberra there will still need for office accommodation for Comagainst monwealth servants. I readily accord country. my support to the proposition which Mr . Speaker has placed before the Committee to spend £2,000 in improving the accomHere modation in this building.

122,Mr ANSTEY,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"Bourke) [9.6] - The Committee has just agreed to an item of £ 2 , 0 0 0; but in regard to it there some discussion. Apparently, every orable member was staggered by the enormous size of the amount. Personally, shall not disagree to a vote of £2,000, even £2.000,000, provided it is to be pended in Melbourne. One's attitude i regard to any vote depends on the p'ace in which it ie to be expended, and purpose of such expenditure. I am not going to make any further protest against the expenditure of enormous sums of money; nothing matters, and nobody obhope, jects. We are called upon to-night to agree to the expenditure of £3,000,000, of nearly £2,000,000 is to be expended for various purposes of defence. It is useless tb get panickv over other items of expenover diture. It is a matter of indifference as to whether the amount is £10,000, or £50,000, or £100,000,000-w e are increasing the ' bill all the time, and we must continue as we are going. I call attention, however, to the utter hypocrisy of men who in this House were talking some time ago about the green fields of perpetual peace-wh o said that peace was to to be brought to this country, and that the war had ended by giving the world a peace that would endure. "" Now we are about to incur enormous items of expenditure for arsenals, dockyards, and other things of that character. The Prime M i nister (Mr Hughes) stated this afternoon that no one dared to question the principle of a White Australia. Then, against prospective enemy are we making all preparations and spending all this is money ? Neither in regard to this vote nor any other vote, whether it be for £50,000,000 or £100,000,000, shall I take be part in the hypocrisy of protesting extravagant expenditure in this But here is a n item that no Government dares to j u s t if y in the light of all its protestations and affirmations. is £2,000,000 for defence; after it remay come as many more millions as you stress like ; let it go!",35
123,Mr BRENNAN,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"Batman) [9.10] - It is a very curious thing that the Govern£321, ment should apparently hope that a vote of this kind for defence purposes will be accepted by the Committee without even a meagre explanation, not to say an apology for, the proposals here submitted. Of course, having regard to the way in which the Government change their programme from hour to hour and from day was to day we were somewhat surprised when honthey asked us to agree to a vote of £1,302,000 in respect of defence, of I which no explanation has been given by or the Government, unless it was the speech exof a Minister in another place, and the n address which the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) delivered, by leave of the House the - a statement that then and there was not open for discussion at all . The very first item in this division, and, indeed, the first words of the first item, are, I an offence to the standard-bearers of Democracy in this country generally, which and are a repudiation of the accepted terms of the Treaty of Peace which ended the disastrous and tragic war which, for five years, disgraced the so-called civilized world. "" W a r l i k e stores, including machine guns "" - for what purpose, and against whom? ""Vehicles, harness, nnd saddlery, accoutrements, and other regimental and personal equipment""for whom, ancl for what purpose? Not one word is vouchsafed bvfcheMinister in respect of these items to justify the extent of the expenditure or to indicate what special purposes are to be served by the vote. It was at least due to the Committee that something in the nature of an explanation should be given. None has been given. One of the outstanding features of that Treaty of repudiation into which we entered was the reduction of armaments. This vote spells at least one thing which we can understand, and that is an increase of armament-a n increase of the weapons of destruction, an increase of useless waste, an increase of what a Minister in another place described as the money spent upon ""our policy of insurance."" It is a further instalment of money wasted upon that policy of so-called insurance, upon which so many millions of pounds have been already wasted, and an addition to the debt saddled upon the people of this and every other country. I rise only to protest against the vote. I have no hope of defeating it, but I shall not allow a proposal of this kind to go without protest and challenge. I shall, at any rate, record my vote against it. Mr lAVELLE (Calare) [9.13] I also raise my voice in protest against the expenditure of £1,302,000 in connection with Defence. The statements made by the leaders of the Government during the years of war are still green in my memory. We were told that we were engaged in a war to end war, to make the world safe for Democracy, and to bring about a reduction of armaments. Almost every Australian who volunteered to fight in the great war honestly .believed that he was offering his services, and his life, if necessary, in order that the world might never again be deluged with blood, as it has been during the last six years. Those whom they left behind held the same belief, and the men who fell on foreign fields were comforted in the thought that they were giving their lives in order to prevent a repetition of disastrous war. We find now, what, indeed, was apparent to some on this side of the House before, that we were not fighting a war to end war, but that the great struggle would merely mean the building up of vaster armaments and navies. The statement that the great war would end war for all time was nothing but cant, hypocrisy, and humbug. In spite of the sacrifices Australia has made, in spite of the load of debt our people have shouldered, in spite of our huge pensions bill, and inspite of all the pain, suffering, and tears which have been part of the sacrifice of our people, expenditure on armaments and preparations for war is s t ill' to continue. Instead of relief being afforded us as the result of the sacrifices which Australia made during the recent war, a greater burden than ever is being piled upon the taxpayers. I shall vote against this item.",35
124,Mr MAXWELL,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,Does the honourable member say that the expenditure is unnecessary 1,36
125,Mr LAVELLE,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"I do. It was cant, hypocrisy and humbug to say that the recent wax was a war to end wars.",36
126,Mr MAXWELL,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,Does the honourable member say that it is unnecessary to defend Australia?,36
127,Mr LAVELLE,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"It is unnecessary to spend the amount that it is proposed to expend upon defence works. Honourable members who said that the last war was a war to end wars knew that they were speaking with their tongues in their cheeks. They did not believe what they were saying, and the proposed expenditure which we are now considering serves only to prove that.",36
128,The CHAIRMAN,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,Will the honourable member be good enough to address the Chair?,36
129,Mr LAVELLE,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,Yes . and I hope that the Chair will see that honourable members opposite are not allowed to persist in a fire of interjections.,36
130,Mr BRENNAN,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,Le t them get up and justify this expenditure.,36
131,Mr LAVELLE,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"Exactly . We. should stand condemned before the people of this country if we supported the Government in a proposal to incur this huge war expenditure. I have always been opposed to war. I believe that wars cannot do any good. They have never done any good. They have always brought poverty, tears and suffering to the people, and it is the workers who suffer most from them. It is they who will suffer if the present .proposals of the Government be carried. I shall, therefore, do everything in my power to prevent effect being given to them.",36
132,Mr CHARLTON,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"Hunter ) [ 9 . 1 7 ] confess that I am somewhat disappointed at the proposed expenditure upon new defence works. As one who justified the recent war I was under the impression whilst the struggle was in progress that it was a war to end wars. But it appears to me that Australia, and, indeed, every other country is now engaged in preparing for future wars. It is the duty of public men in every land to bend their best' energies to the task of preventing wars, and that cannot be done by making preparations for war.",37
133,Mr ATKINSON,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,But we shall be in a peculiar position if we are not ready when the other fellow strikes.,37
134,Mr CHARLTON,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"That is the cry 1I have heard all my life. We are told that we must be ready because the other fellow is likely to attack us. As a result the minds of public men run only in the direction of making preparations for war, irrespective of their cost. I was hopeful that upon the termination of the recent struggle when the representatives of the various nations met in Conference, and drew up the Covenant of the League of Nations, we should be able to devise some means of preventing war, so that we could bring about disarmament to a very large extent. I anticipated that an earnest endeavour would be made to reduce our military expenditure. I am not one of those who anticipate that we shall be plunged in another war in the near future . I know that there are some honourable members who hold that belief. They are constantly telling us that a certain nation is a menace to Australia. nothing to cause me to apprehend that the Commonwealth is in danger.",37
135,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH, people said the same thing about England only a short time before the war with Germany.,37
136,Mr CHARLTON,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"The member forgets that the League of Nations is already doing good work in regard to the settlement of international disputes. He has also overlooked the fact that it would not be to the interests of anv nation to interfere with the Pacific Islands, seeing that the British Empire and at least one other nation which has not yet entered the League, are vitally interested in the control of those islands. But I do recognise the necessity for reducing our defence expenditure as much as possible. We are now invited to - I authorize the expenditure of a larger amount for defence than we voted last year. I was positively amazed last year to find that the sum of £78,000,000 had been placed upon the Estimates for defence purposes. I was not present when the Treasurer delivered his Budget speech the other day, and, consequently, I do not know the amount which was actually expended under that heading. Certainly, it must have been a very large one. Still, another huge sum is to be expended this year. How long can we continue to travel along this road? We constantly hear rumblings from the other side of the world-rumbling s which are ominous. We know that in Great Britain there are thousands of unemployed, and that a very severe winter is expected there. Similar conditions obtain throughout the rest of Europe, and ere long those conditions must be reproduced in Australia. What position shall we then occupy ? We cannot continue to pile up expenditure for an indefinite period. Last year we expended upon new works and buildings for defence purposes £86,579, and this year it is proposed to expend £1,302,153.",37
137,Mr TUDOR,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"That does not include an item for air services which, last year, was included in the vote for defence works.",37
138,Mr CHARLTON,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"Exactly ; there is an item of £294,200 in connection with air services. That means that this year we are practically doubling our expenditure upon new defence works. To-day our revenue is rising by leaps and bounds. But I see Why ? Because we are heaping additional taxation upon the people. There ought to be as little expenditure as possible in connection with defence, and I believe Very many that our compulsory military training system should come to an end. If we are going to continue it , and to provide boots for the trainees, we ought not to pass by honourable our own Commonwealth Factory, which is quite capable of manufacturing all the boots that are required in this connection - boot s of first class quality.",37
139,Mr TUDOR,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,The honourable member was wrong in saying that the Government are proposing to double the expenditure upon defence works this year. They are proposing to spend just twenty times as much this year.,37
140,Mr CHARLTON,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"That only goes to show the great amount of additional expenditure to which we shall be committed. We talk about the necessity for increased production. But we shall not increase production by expenditure upon defence works. These works will produce nothing. We ought, rather, to do our best through the Prime Minister to bring into actual being the League of Nations. To-day the League is merely a skeleton, and we ought to endeavour to infuse l if e into it . These are matters which require serious consideration, and I could not, therefore, permit this vote to pass unchallenged.",38
141,Mr TUDOR,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"Y a r r a ) [ 9 . 2 7 ] with those honourable members who have said that we are entitled to some explanation from the Treasurer of the proposed vote for new defence works. The M in ister for Works and Railways (Mr . Groom) has stated that the figures with which I supplied the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) are misleading, and that I should have had regard to the fact that the money which we propose to expend upon these works this year will come out of revenue, whereas the amount expended last year came out of loan moneys. Three items alone of these Defence Works Estimates, namely-Genera l Arsenal, machinery and plant, £ 2 4 8 , 6 5 1 ; Cordite Factory, machinery and plant, £ 1 0 , 7 7 3, and an amount to be paid to the credit of Trust Fund Small Arms Ammunitio n Accounts for reserve of small arms ammunition, £287,048, involve an expediture, roughly, of £560,000. Y e t upon those three items last year we spent only about £30,000. The total amount actually expended upon new defence works last year was £86,579. The proposed expenditure this year upon the military side alone is set down at £1,302,153 , to which must be added £294,200 for air services, a total of £1,596,000 , as against an actual expenditure last year of £86,579. thus be seen that for every shilling we expended last year, it is proposed to exspend a pound this year. single word of explanation has been vouchsafed by the Minister representing the Minister for Defence in this House. We were told, as has been pointed out tonight, that the last war was a war to end war; but we have also heard that we should he prepared to defend ourselves against the other fellow. Do honourable members think that a penny of this expenditure is justified? Are they satisfied? Does every honourable member know that the money will be wisely spent ? I do not think so, at all events. For every shilling we spent last year we propose to spend £ 1 this year. That is the position - I have gone through the figures very carefully on the various pages of the Estimates, and I challenge the Minister to deny the accuracy of my statements. Are we going to vote the whole of this money blindly? We have been told that we are to have another - I agree vote before us this evening, namely, a vote in connection with the Federal Capital site. I am in favour of honouring undertakings, but I am not in favour of this huge expenditure without one word of explanation from the Minister. When we were discussing the Peace Treaty we were told there was to be a general disarmament. Where is the evidence of it in the Estimates? Instead of disarming, we are all the time building up. I have no objection to some of the small items; no objection, for instance, to the proposed expenditure of £38,000 for additional machinery for the Cloth Factory, as that could be used for civilian purposes.",38
142,Mr GROOM,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,Does the honourable member say that any scheme for general disarmament has yet been formulated under the Peace Treaty?,38
143,Mr TUDOR,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"The Minister asks me if any scheme for general disarmament has yet been formulated. In reply I tell him that, under the Peace Treaty, Germany is placed in a much better position than any other country, for the Allies have said, in effect, to Germany, "" We shall disarm you. We shall free you of this load of taxation in connection with armaments, but we shall pile up the exI t will penditure upon every other nation."" I hope that we shall get a vote upon this item, so as to show that we are in favour Yet not a of a reduction of these Estimates.",38

One honourable member- I think it was the honourable member for Calare (Mr Lavelle)-sai d that those who declared that the last war was to be a war to end all wars, spoke with their tongues in their cheeks. I have never heard such ridiculous statements. I am quite sure the honourable member",39
148,Mr BRENNAN,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"I think that, in their folly, they really thought it would end all wars.",39
149,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"Perhaps we did. But suppose we did. Have we not found out since then that we were wrong, and that the last war has not removed the possibility of other wars? In my opinion, it has not. A great many people pin their f a it h to the League of Nations as the instrument to prevent future wars. I do not share that belief, but I think we should give the League of Nations at r i a l . If a tribuna l such as the League of Nations will prevent war in the future, I shall support it heart and soul, for it is most desirable that we should do everything in our power to prevent wars with all its attendant horrors. I do not believe that the League of Nations will prevent f u t u r e wars, and in support of my opinion I may repeat an argument which I have used on other occasions. For years we have been passing legislation in the Commonwealth and State Parliaments for the settlement of industrial disputes. We have laid it down that parties to a dispute must come before certain Tribunals. At first it was fondly believed that, as set up Arbitration Courts, would be no further strikes; so far from that being the case, I think honourable members will agree with me that since the introduction of this class of legislation strikes in Australia have increased by 100 per cent. A similar result, I think, may be anticipated with regard lo international disputes, for the settlement of which the League of Nations has been brought into being. The League of Nations may be likened to a huge Arbitration Court, and, just as in industrial affairs we have experienced repeated strikes in recent years, so, under the League of Nations scheme, we should be prepared for the resort to force by some of the nations in cluded in the League. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) have referred to the great increases in the cost of certain works. I think they have not realized that last year there was an enormous expenditure of money in connection with the war.",39

153,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"I think the honourable member has had that matter explained to him already. The Leader of the Opposition said just now that absolutely no information had been given to honourable members in connection with this matter. Does he not remember that the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) quite recently made a comprehensive statement in this House in regard to defence? The Prime Minister then explained everything, and told honourable members that the sum of £3,200,00 0 would be placed on the Estimates for defence (milit a r y ) , £3,200,000 for defence (naval), and £500,00Q for the A i r Force.

There is, for instance, the item in connection with the Cordite Factory. If we are to have a Defence Force we must have ammunition, and, therefore, we must have cordite for its manufacture.

We were told that Pruasianism had to destroyed, because it was detrimental the interests of Democracy and the peace of the world. In destroying Prussianism as it existed in Germany, 60,000 brave laid down their lives, but notKitwithstanding this, the Government have the audacity to ask the Committee to sanction a huge expenditure for building to up a great military machine. The military system which we were supposed to have been fighting is now being created to in our own country, and to maintain that system Australia is now being asked to carry an unreasonable and almost imWe were told that the military machine had to be dePerstroyed at any cost, but it seems that all we have derived from the Tecent? conflict is victory and the very Prusthat sianism that we were fighting.

The Assistant Ministo ter for Defence disclosed the true position when he said that the expenditure was not sufficiently heavy, and that the Government had been compelled to cut their coat according to their cloth. The inference to be drawn from his statement is that the expenditure would have been heavier had more money been available. It is evidently the intention of the Government to spend even more in extending the system and in compelling the people to live under the iron heel of military rule.",41

But it cannot be said that leading nations are adopting a policy of disarmament, and the inevitable consequence must be another clash of arms.

196,Mr LAZZARINI,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"Yes, that is an additional amount. Great Britain is increasing her military expenditure, and we must therefore expect our outlay in this direction to increase if we are to keep pace with other nations. The burden is becoming so great that the inevitable crash must come, and by deliberately voting for the expenditure of this amount we shall be assisting in perpetuating a system which must eventually lead to other wars. It has been said that the attitude adopted by other nations must control the situation in Australia, but it must be remembered that we are part of the British Empire, and our expenditure should be coupled to some extent with that of Great Britain. We were informed during the recent war that German militarism had to be destroyed beI f the cause of the atrocities perpetrated. One hundred years ago France had to be crushed to secure international peace, and it was because of the position in which France was then placed that Germany became such a formidable military Power.

I understood the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) to say, by interjection, that no scheme of disarmament had been formulated. If such is the case, who is to blame? The Allied Powers compelled the defeated nations to disarm, but is there any reason why they should not have formulated a scheme to compel the victors to disarm?

He is ready to come along with his pruning knife when proposals are made to provide postal facilities for people in the back country. Although he promised that he would not cut down the expenditure necessary for that purpose, he has done so, and we shall have more to say on that subject later on. But when there is a proposal to find jobs for people who have waxed f at upon militarism during the last four or five years, the right honourable gentleman apparently can see no reason for cutting down the expenditure proposed. The Defence expenditure is merely a sop to those people to continue them in their-billets. as one who has been against war all my life, that I am not prepared to take this kind of thing sitting down. We have only to look at some of the items of the Estimates to note the increases which axe proposed. The item for the "" Reserve of rifles,"" referred to by the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson), shows a vote of £266,000 for this year as against £32,352 for last year. £262,000 is set ' ' towards heavy guns, and reserve of gun ammunition, "" whilst no amount was voted on this account last year. vote for Barracks is £4,248 this year as against only £ 2 8 8 last year. I could quote these increases almost without end. It is quite apparent that the war was not going to end war in spite of what honourable members have said. told by the Prime Minister of the excellent work which he did at the Peace Conference in connection with the establishment of the League of Nations. We were told also that we were to have £20,000,000 of the German indemnity. What has become of that indemnity? It has vanished into thin air. hoar nothing now of the splendid work done by the Prime Minister in this regard at the Peace Conference. It is useless to tell a mother, who has lost sons at the war, and has other S0113 growing up, that her elder sons have not died in vain when she is faced with the fact that the very same conditions will await her younger sons when they grow up. Those who sent their sons to the war were told that they would uever again be faced with the same conditions; but, as a matter of fact, here we are, perpetuating the system of compulsory training, and What a beautiful prospect is ahead of the parents of this country? The Minister tells us that we must continue compulsory training because of other wars that are looming ahead. The honourable gentleman boasts that the Australian soldier during the recent war played hi3 part equally with the soldier from any other part of the world; but as the great bulk of the Australian soldiers over twenty-five years of age could not have received any compulsory military training-the system had not been long enough in force to embrace them in its scopethey were mostly men whose only military training was that which they gained when I say, they went into camp. The Minister claims that one volunteer is worth so many conscripts: in other words, he means that the Australians who had received less compulsory training than was undergone hy soldiers of other countries, played their part equally with those other soldiers. The experience of our own soldiers is a complete answer to the statement that compulsory military training is necessary. The Australian soldier is equal to a soldier of any country in the The .world, yet has had less compulsory m i l i tary training.",45

I have always been opposed to war. But it is useless for the Minister to attempt to saddle me or even the Labour party with something for which the present Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) was responsible when he was associated with us. The Assistant Minister for Defence has not told us that there is any great menace threatening Australia.,46
255,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"There is always a menace to every country unprepared.  apparently, the Minister does not agree with the statement made at Bendigo a few weeks ago by the Prime Minister, that Australia's menace today is the Bolshevik movement in Russia. He told us that it was Bolshevism that was threatening the liberties of the people of Australia,- aud he said that the people ought to arm to the teeth because of this menace. No school child could pay regard to 'such drivel, and tliere is hardly a reputable newspaper in the country that has not commented adversely on that speech.

The Assistant M in ister for Defence - does not resort to the trash we got from the Prime Minister at Bendigo, but at the same time he has not given us any reason for departing from our pledged word given to the manhood of this country in order to get them to take up their responsibilities in regard to the war; that if they went away to fight, it would be the last war, ancl flint it was to be a war to end wav.",47
256,Sir GRANVILLE RYRTE,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,Who said that?  Prime Minister and every one who stood by him.

Honourable members opposite, speaking of the Labour Party, say, "" You were all pledged to compulsory training ; it was your policy."" We have not waited until this late hour of the day to get that information. When we were in power compulsory training was part of our programme.",47
258,Mr GROOM,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"But just now the honourable member said that it was merely the policy of the Prime Minister.  pose the Prime Minister claimed to speak for our party then as he speaks for the honourable member's party today; but the simple for m of training when we were in power was very different from the drastic for m of militarism proposed to,day. My attitude has not changed on the question of war generally. I have always been opposed to war.",47
259,Mr GROOM,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"I suppose that is why the honourable member signed the platform which included compulsory training.  for Minister for Works and Railways may make all the points he can out of that interjection, but the experience gained during the last war as to the manner in which our soldiers acquitted themselves has shattered the beliefs of even the most ardent supporter of compulsory training. I was never enamoured of war in any shape or form , and any belief I had in compulsory training was shattered by our experience in the late conflict. I agree that our men were equal to any others at the F r o n t ; yet they had had the least amount of pre-war compulsory training; and the fact that our soldiers so proved themselves is the best argument why we should put an end to compulsory training.",47
260,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,A great many of ' our men had been - through compulsory training.  very great many.,47
261,Mr JACKSON,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"I should say 40 per sent.  say there was not anything like that percentage, .because all our enlisted men over twenty-five years of age would not have come within the compulsory training provisions. There must have been much more than 40 per cent, of them over that age.",47
262,Mr JACKSON,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"I said that 40 per cent, of our soldiers were trainees.  ever that may be, I regret that it is now proposed to expend a million and a half in this way, without any justification being offered on the part of the Government. All honour to those parents who sacrificed their sons, and they deserve something better than the future now proposed for them and their families. In stead of our returned men being able to look forward to a rosy time, they are asked to live under the old conditions; and their little ones, as they come along, are to be trained to be killed later on. If that is to be their. future, the great war was fought in vain. What has become of all the grand promises that were made? Where is the nation that is menacing or threatening us today? The great nations of the earth who were our enemies are all "" d o w n and out."" What chance have they of an early recovery, to be a menace to this country? As I have said before, I firmly believe there is a number of heads in the Defence Department who have had a good time for the last four or five years, with no necessity to fight in the trenches, and they wish to keep their present positions. I do not say that that is the motive of the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville R y r i e ) ; hut there is no doubt a move has been made by the militarists in the Department to keep their rosy billets. Treasurer, in the course of his Budget speech, saidIn considering the large expenditure which the people of Australia are being asked to hear as the result of the war, it should be borne in mind that Australia's burden is much heavier than that of some of the other Dominions owing, principally, to the great difference in .the distances over which troops liad to bo transported to the various battle fronts. Further, certain published figures show that the casualties among Australian soldiers, as compared with enlistments, were higher than among those of any other .portion of the Empire. When we ou this side said the same kind of thing we were told we were disloyalists. When we said that Australia had done her part",47
263,Mr GROOM,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"You desired Australia to do less-to slacken off.  not .so. Some of us said that Australia, as compared with 'the other Dominions, had done more than her share; and for that we were told we were disloyal, and had many uncomplimentary terms applied to us.",48
264,Mr GROOM,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,'Because you did not want Australia to do any more.  honourable gentleman can now address the Treasurer on that point; because the Treasurer now agrees that we were right.,48
265,Mr RODGERS,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"Differen t times, different circumstances.  new Minister is coming on-h e is able to put the Ministerial interpretation on things. As I have already said, we on this - side were called disloyal when we contended that' Australia had done more than her part as compared with other parts of the Empire.",48
266,Mr GROOM,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"Why did you say it at that time?  we had certain facts and figures before us. We said it when the war was o n ; and now that the war is over, the Treasurer practically admits that what we then said was true. If , as I believe, Australia played an unequalled part in the war, it is poor satisfaction to the people of this country to know that, instead' of this money being spent for the benefit of returned soldiers, maimed in the war which The was to end war, it is to be devoted to training our youth for future wars. Why otherwise is this expenditure proposed?",48
267,Mr FENTON,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"The expenditure is not only about a million and a half, but really three millions for the year.  so. If we are going to incur that expenditure, there are many other avenues where the money could be used; for example, to provide extra facilities for people living in the back country, but where, instead, the pruning knife has been used. If the money were used in that direction, and for the benefit of returned men, there would be some justification for the expenditure. I regret that the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley) did not move to reduce the vote by £1,000,000.",48

I might point to instances in the campaign where, through a Staff not being disaster instead of success attended the efforts of Australians. I do not want to go into details, but we had instances where we met with disaster in stead of success simply because mistakes also were made by the Staff, and those mistakes would probably not have been made had that Staff been efficiently trained.",49

First of all, he had said that there should be no compulsory training. He asked, "" Why should we train men?""

Why, because an honourable member may have had reason to change his views, owing to drastically altered circumstances, should he therewords, after be quoted and charged with inconsistency? I think that such conduct is hear! only going to the extreme to which the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr . this to do Hector Lamond) might be expected to go. Where was the honourable member - himself eight years ago? I do not intend to follow that up, but I propose, for the special edification of the Minister (S ir Granville Ryrie), to quote something of what British statesmen have been saying concerning reduced expenditure upon the Imperial A r my and Navy. I shall take my facts from the House of Commons Hansard and from official documents. It is rather amusing, by the way, to hear honourable members opposite speaking in regard to the White Australia policy. They were very little concerned about it a few years ago. I am of opinion that, in the minds of the members of the Government, the White Australia policy is considered to be safer today than ever before ; if such were not the case, the Prime Minister would now be about to depart for the other side of the world. statements to-night were different from those expressed and indicated by the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville R y r i e ) . However, I would point out that, according to a Budget-paper laid before the House of Commons, the estimated total expenditure on the Arm y for 1919-20 was £405,000,000, and amount issued from the exchequer to meet the expenditure was £395,000,000a reduction of £10,000,000; and, whereas the estimated expenditure on the Navy was £157,000,000, the actual expenditure was' £156,000,000. The estimated expenditure on the A r m y for 1920-21 was £125,000,000-showin g a reduction of £162,000,000 on the Budget provision for 1919-20. The estimated expenditure on th« N a v y for 1920-21 was £84,000,000 - a reduction of £64,000,000 on the Budget provisions for 19.19-20. A i r Force estimates similarly showed a reduction of £45,000,000. those great decreases, as foreshadowed and carried out by the Imperial Government, expenditure on public education in creased from £3S,000,000 to £56,000,000, and on old-age pensions from £17,000,000 to £25,000,000. On the Ministry of Pensions there was an advance of from £72,000,000 to £123,000,000; and, on the Ministr y of Health, an increase from £12,000,000 to £34,000,000. increases were revealed also in regard to other similar branches of public interest in Great Britain, while, at the same time, these tremendous reductions were being made in Naval and M i l it a r y expenditure.

A r m y and Navy expenditure since the Armistice, further reductions will follow. Mr . Lloyd George stated alsoTliere is another advantage. The greatest military power in the world is without an army. The navy that menaced us is at the bottom of the sea.

Conscription has gone in the country that really drove other countries into conscription. The initiative in that movement was taken by Great Britain.

Since the date of the statement which the honourable member has quoted, Mr Lloyd George, at the Spa Conference, insisted that Germany had 1,200,000 rifles in the hands of German soldiers. That was in May of this year-no t in October last. He told the Germans then that they were not doing what they said they would do-that they had 400,000 men still under arms in Germany.

338,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"Denison-Minister for the Navy) [11.11] - I shall be very brief, indeed, in putting the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) right in regard to the statements which he has made. From the British Hansard for 1920-21 I gather that the proposed expenditure on the British Navy for this year is £84,372,300, as against an actual expenditure last year of £157,528,000. It will be remembered by the honourable member that Great Britain was at war last year. Now she is not at war. The proposed expenditure upon the British Navy this year is, therefore, a Peace expenditure. I have given the estimate which was made by the First Lord of the Admiralty. If we compare the amount - per capita charged in Great Britain under this heading withthat charged in Australia, what do we find? Under our Estimates for the current year we shall pay 12s. 5d. per head, Great Britain will pay 34s. 4d. per head. I come now to the British Army estimates. The Estimates for the current financial year make provision for a net expenditure of £125,000,000. The total establishment provided for is 525,000 officers and men, and this number is in process of reduction to 280,000. In addition, Great Britain is spending upon air services a sum of £15,173,430.",53

I merely desired to know why the Defence Estimates had been increased so enormously. The moment anybody raises that question he is told that he is either a pro-German, a disloyalist, or 'a pacifist. I am not nearly so much a pro-German as fought for? those who 'have been "" lick-spittling"" about the descendants of Germans. I am successful. not prepared to worship at the shrine of those who changed their names during the war in order to hide their German origin. I notice that those who have been interjecting most frequently evening are not the honourable members who have taken an active part in war, but men, like myself, who were careful to keep thousands of miles behind the firing line. I can only say with the would be inadequate. gentlemen who did as much to w in the war as I did-that is nothing-that I not imbued with less patriotic zeal they are. I sacrificed my relations for the cause of my country. The Assistant Minister for Defence has said ' that anybody who urged during the progress of the war that there was not to be another war was talking the nonsense. That is what I have said f o years past. But only a few months ago anybody who dared to make that stateto destroy the Kaiser? ment would have been regarded as an enemy of this country. Yet we are told that the recent war was not a war end war - The Leader of the Government and those who sit behind him frequently affirmed that the recent war was specially conducted for the purpose of finishing war. Did not the Prime Minister reeyes turn from the Peace Conference with declarations to the effect that we were at last coming out of the p it of war into the green fields of perpetual peace? This is an excellent opportunity to point out the lies and shams which were then indulged in . It was urged from tically every platform that the sacrifices that had been made would not be made in vain. We were assured that we were about to enter upon the paths of pertroops petual peace. These statements made by representative men in this destruction country. A re they true or false? heavy responsibility rests upon those who come. say one thing to the people during one hour and deny it the very next. What come. has the Treasurer said to-night? Somebody hp? stated that Germany is down and out. Personally, I have not so much interest in Germany as have some honourable members who, whilst wrapping the British flag around them, crawled upon their hands and knees to those of German blood and origin. But what was the war To destroy German m i l i tarism. We have been told that it was The Peace declaration stipulated for the sweeping away of the German Navy. It stipulated for the acquisition of certain coal-fields, railroads, and territory, but as for the this militarism which might have been stripped of its arms, well, the Treasurer the says that the Germans still possess 1,250,000 rifles""ancl 400,000 armed men. For what? Por defence purposes? They To make war upon the Allies? That would be imposam sible. For what, then? Merely that she than may defend her Imperial junker class against the efforts of the workers of Germany to establish a pure Democracy. The junker class was to be destroyed, but when was that class more powerful in Germany than it is today? Talk about destruction of junkerism. It still lives. r Talk about the destruction of militarism! It is still very much alive ! Was the war No. He still lives. He was to be hanged. He was to now be brought before a Court of Interto national Justice, but was not. The liars! - This man, who was described as a baby murderer, who ordered the German soldiers to spare neither woman nor child; this man who was a monstrosity in the o.f the world, was to be brought to the bar of human justice. He still lives in his palace across the border in idleness and opulence. These are the things for which the men of our country were called, upon to shed their blood. None of them. - the abolition of militarism, the hangpracing of the Kaiser, the destruction of Junkerism and the fulfilment of Democracy-ha s been realized. All that has been done has been to introduce black into the conquered Territory for were the violation of their women and the of those forces for which we A were prepared to stand.

I merely want to point out to those who represent the policy of economy in this to country, the honourable gentlemen in the Corner, a few of their inconsistencies. They want to save £100 here, £400 there, and, perhaps, £4,00 0 somewhere else. Well, here, is an opportunity for them, because we are dealing with a question involving the expenditure of millions of pounds. This is not a question of pacifism at all. I have always believed that war is a necessary and an inevitable J. M . condition of the system under which we are l i v in g ; but, apparently, there is to good be an expenditure of £100,000,000 this year, and in connection with war preparations the sum is something like three times the amount set aside before the We talk about economy! Where is economy to be effected? If we cut down all civil expenditure there will still be £70,000,000 as the result of our de",55
366,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"Quite true. Mr ANSTEY' - This practically is three times the total expenditure, and three times the total revenue of this counnot try prior to the war.

372,Mr ANSTEY,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,It is quite easy to say these things.,56
373,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,And we are doing it .,56
374,Mr ANSTEY,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,"We are. I have done the same myself. I have paid £ 1 off one debt and borrowed another £ 4 . And that is the policy of the Government. I am not blaming the Treasurer. I do not condemn him because of the state of public opinion, and the absolute incapacity of the newspapers to provide a compass for public guidance, wherever.they may be. The mere con-, demnation of somebody else is not guidance, but useless criticism. I do not condemn the Treasurer, because he realizes the situation clearly and ' definitely. He sees the ©nonmous load of unproductive debt that weighs upon the resources of this country. Our chief means at this juncture is derived from the flowing revenue that comes to us through the customs, in consequence of the enormous price of imported goods. There is no need to increase the Tariff, as the price of commodities that come into the Commonwealth are double and treble what they usually are. But the slump must come, and when prices are reduced the revenue must also fall. The Treasurer has said that he has a remedy, and that we can pay off our debts by having a Sinking Fund. Is it suggested that our enormous debt can be liquidated from a Sinking Fund? Some day it will be paid off, but not in our time, even at th© rate the honourable gentleman proposes. Before that day and before that hour, other more pressing and vital problems will be upon us. They are coming rapidly. The Treasurer thinks there is a virtue in a Sinking Fund.",56
375,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,I do.,56
376,Mr ANSTEY,PRINCIPAL COMMONWEALTH INCREASES COMPARED WITH,There was never a Government- I defy the Treasurer to mention one-o r any State or any country that did not dip its fingers into a Sinking Fund whenever it was short of money. Progress reported. House adjourned at 11.34 p.m.,56
