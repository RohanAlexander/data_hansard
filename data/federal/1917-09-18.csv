2,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Bendigo-Prime M in ister and Attorney-General) [ 8 . 1 ] - It is my melancholy duty to move That this House desires to record its profound regret at Hie loss which the Commonwealth suffers in the death of the Honourable Charles' Carty Salmon, who was at one time Speaker of this House, and was one of its members at the inauguration of the Parliament, and also for many years afterwards, and who was at one time a member of the Victorian Ministry, and expresses its sincere condolence with his, widow and the members of his family in their bereavement. One rises on an occasion, like this overpowered with the sense that he stands uuder the very shadow of death. Before the majesty of that dark presence, - how petty and f u t i l e appear the ambitions and struggles of men 1 This our colleague, our companion, our friend, who but a little while ago was with us, is now gone, and we who knew him well sincerely mourn our loss. He played a conspicuous part in the political history of Victoria, and of the Commonwealth, and his kindly 'dip position endeared him to all men. It can be t r u l y said of him what can be said of few, that he was a man who. did his duty fearlessly as he saw it , without arousing the enmity of others. His geuiality aud kindness of heart were such that all men f e l t drawn towards him . He has been untimely taken from us, and we deeply mourn him. He has crossed thab dark stream over which, sooner or later, we must all travel, and we who remain feel it to be indeed true that 11 the wings of men's lives are plumed with the feathers of death."" I ' speak for, I am sure, every member of the House when I say that we sincerely regret Dr Salmon's death, arid extend to those whom he loved, and who loved him, our sincerest sympathy in their hour of great grief.",20
3,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Y a r r a ) [3.5] - It is with the . deepest regret that I rise to second this motion. I was acquainted with Dr Carty Salmon for many years, and knew hirn before we both entered this Parliament. We belonged to different political parties, but he was a man beloved, honoured, and respected even by those who differed from him politically. In him the Commonwealth has lost one of its best citizens. Dr Carty Salmon was never a f r a i d to do what he thought to be right. Occasions like the present have been all too frequent in the life-time of this Parliament. I could not help thinking so when the Archbishop said today in the Cathedral that the late member for Grampians was a martyr to public duty. It is possible that many of us will find later that the l if e here has been too strenuous for our health, and what happened to Dr Carty Salmon will happen to others. They will find that their constitution has been undermined by their efforts for the public welfare, and that they are thus unable to stand the strain of illness. Regret for Dr Carty Salmon's death is felt by all of us. I desire, on behalf of honourable members on this side of the House, to sympathize with his widow and relatives. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places.

Is it a fact that very serious discontent is being caused among the soldiers who have enlisted in New South Wales by the aetion of the Defence Department in sending these men from Sydney to Broadmeadows Camp, and thereby making New South Wales soldiers part of a Victorian unit? 2.

Some discontent arose among members trench mortar battery reinforcements from New South Wales whom it was found sary to transfer to infantry units, and whom it was proposed to embark from Melbourne to join New South Wales units on their arrival in England. There was never any intention that they should form part of a Victorian unit. 2. So far as the above-mentioned men are concerned, this has been arranged, but men concentrated in Victoria for special training, such as artillerymen, machine gunners, engifrom neers, signallers, and tunnellers, will barked from Melbourne as heretofore, because the expense of transferring them back to their own State would be too great.

27,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The answers to the b o n orable member's questions are as f o l low:1. No. No dental officers"" now in Australia were accepted for overseas service.

There are to be some cases that will deserve exempchildren, tion, and it is necessary that the Go the vernor-General should have power to grant exemptions. Amongst the persons prevented from enlisting for active service outside Australia are the men garrisoning our forts, who are required to remain at their posts for the defence of the Comand monwealth.",24
34,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH REPRESENTATION ON,Do the Government pose to exempt those people?,25
35,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH REPRESENTATION ON,"We propose to to give the Governor General a general so. power to grant, exemption in any case where that course seems to be justified. The power is wide, and necessarily so.",25
36,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH REPRESENTATION ON,Why not give the Comgone missioner power to grant exemption?,25
37,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH REPRESENTATION ON,"There is no from the war. doubt that some such power must be given in order to avoid the infliction hardship, but I do .not think that the power should be given to the Commisdivision sioner.",25
38,Mr JH CATTS,COMMONWEALTH REPRESENTATION ON,I thought that Government intended to honour the conwas scription referendum.,25
39,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH REPRESENTATION ON,"I propose later on to deal with the very phase of this which the honourable member has in mind. Subdivision P imposes a tax in certain cases on* male persons betweeil the ages twenty-one and forty-five years, and I am very glad to have this opportunity of pressing my own views on this proposal. I make no apologies for it . I am willing to take the whole responsibility for this tax if necessary. But it is the policy the Government as a whole. Honourable members who have beau in public life for a long time know that Ministers are always in complete personal accord with proposals that they advocate in the shall House. A Minister is only one member of a Cabinet, and expresses the corpoBut thab may be in other cases, I have no reservation to make in regard to I this tax. I am in absolute accord with it personally as well as in my capacity",25
40,Mr JH CATTS,COMMONWEALTH REPRESENTATION ON,Does that remark \,25
41,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH REPRESENTATION ON,"I believe it does. At any rate, I have no knowledge of dissent on the part of Ministers. I in wish to say very briefly, but definitely, the object of this special tax. It is considered by the Government that those who sure are unmarried or are widowers without and are physically fit to go to war, but have elected to stay at home and pttend to their personal business, may fairly be asked to specially help in the repatriation of those who, at the call of duty, voluntarily left their homes and kindred, forsook their personal businesses, went abroad to fight for the protection and freedom of the peoples of Ausprotralia and the Empire. The law does not) compel any person go to the war, and this Bill will not do It will , however, impose an obligation on unmarried men and widowers without children, who are physically fib, and within the prescribed ages, but who have not to the war, to specially help in the repatriation of ithose who have returned",25
42,Mr JH CATTS,COMMONWEALTH REPRESENTATION ON,Will the money be of ear-marked for that purpose?,25
43,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH REPRESENTATION ON,"It will . SubF will apply to every male person, whether in receipt of a taxable in the come or not, who, on the 1st July, 1917, (1) unmarried or a widower without children; and (2) was not under the age of twenty-one years and w,as under the tiax age of forty-five years, those being the ages within which persons are accepted for service abroad. The tax is to be £ 1 0 , of or 10 per cent, of a person's' taxable in come, whichever is the greater, and will exbe additional to the ordinary income tax. When the Commissioner is satisfied that, by reason of the support given by a person to his dependants, f h e payment of of the full amount of the tax would impose hardship on him, the Commisisoner' may reduce the amount qf tax payable by that person to such an' Amount as he in his discretion may determine. I shall read the list of exemptions in the amended form to which I propose to ask the Committee to agree(6) The preceding provisions of this subdivi. sion shall not apply to a person who satisfies the Commissioner(i) that he has been on active service outside Australia during the present war.or is a member of an Expeditionary Eorce raised for service outside Australia or has enlisted for service outside Australia on a ship of war; or (ii) .that he has since the first day of January, One thousand nine hundred and seventeen, endeavoured to enlist' in an Expeditionary Force raised for service outside Australia or to enlist for service outside Australia on a - ship of war, but has been rejected solely on the ground of physical unfitness; or (iii) that, notwithstanding that he has not endeavoured to enlist in an Expeditionary Force raised for service side Australia or to enlist for service outside Australia on a ship of war, he is obviously unfit for any naval or military service whatever; or (iv) that all his brothers of military age have been on active service outside Australia during the present war qr arc members of an Expeditionary Force raised for service outside Australia or have enlisted for .service outside Australia on a ship of war or (v) that he is permanently incapacitated for work; or (vi) that he is employed in the police or prison services of the Commonwealth or of a State; or (vii) that he is employed on a lighthouse; or (viii) that he is a minister of religion. The last three exemptions appear in the Defence Act. There are a good many more exemptions in that Act , including the exemption of members of Parliament, but the Government do not propose to include any but the three I have just read- Then comes a proposed new sub-clause, which I shall move to in sert(ix) That he has been exempted by Order of the Governor General from enlisting in an Expeditionary Force raised for actjve service outside Australia, or from enlisting for service outside Australia on a ship of war. I have already explained that the tax is to be £ 1 0 , or 10 per cent, of the taxable income, whichever is the greater, and that it will be additional to the ordinary income tax. We make the further provision that(c) For the purposes of this subdivision ""taxable income"" means the amount which is ascertained by deducting from the taxable income of that person within the meaning of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1915.1016 the sum of Twenty-six pounds in respect of each dependant wholly dependent upon him, and such less sum as the Commissioner allows in respect of each dependant partially dependent upon him. There will no doubt be cases where persons liable to taxation may have justifiable reasons to submit claims for exemption from the tax, and the power given to.the Governor General in .this paragraph- a provision which was not arrived at hurriedly, but after a good deal of consideration-is sufficiently wide, the Government think, to cover' all such cases. I wish to say-and the honourable member for Cook (Mr J. H . Catts) will - find here an answer to his question-that out- this proposal has nothing whatever to do with compulsory service in time of war. An effort will probably be made by the Opposition to associate it with, what is termed "" conscription."" Mr J . DT. CATTS - Economi c conscription.",25
44,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH REPRESENTATION ON,The public are already associating it with conscription.,26
45,Sir JOHN PORREST,COMMONWEALTH REPRESENTATION ON,"I am speaking, not of what the publio may say, but of what honourable members opposite will do. I wish to inform the House and the country that the compulsion proposed in this measure is not to force eligible persons to go to the war, but to compel those who have not gone to specially assist in repatriating those who have done so, on their return to Australia. That is the only compulsion which we seek to exercise. Honourable members of the Opposition will find that I ehall deal with this matter very briefly, but fairly, although perhaps in a way that .will not please them. In regard to military and naval service in time of war, there are three classes of people at least in community who will not be affected by this measure-(1 ) those who favour voluntary military, and naval service in time of war; (2) those who favour compulsory, as well as voluntary, military and naval service in time of war; and (3) those who have already gone to the war, or have offered to do so, None of these three classes is affected by these provisions.",26
46,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH REPRESENTATION ON,It is purely class lation. It shows the vindictiveness of the whole thing.,27
47,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH REPRESENTATION ON,"I take no notice of what the honourable member says, and I am sure he does not expect me to answer him.",27
48,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH REPRESENTATION ON,The righ t honourable gentleman has the numbers on his side.,27
49,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALTH REPRESENTATION ON,"I have righ t and justice on my side as well, and that is better than mere numbers. The objections to the measure must come from those who have not offered to enlist for service abroad, and who object to specially pay to help the repatriation of those who have been doing their duty in a distant land in defending them as well as Australia and the Empire. In regard to compulsory service in time of war, the National party, represented by the majority in this House, gave a distinct promise to the electors at the general election on 5th May in these words, which I take from the declaration of the GovernmentI t accepts the verdict of the electors on 28th - October, 1916, and appeals to the patriotism of the people to uphold the honour of Australia by maintaining the Australian divisions at their full fighting strength by voluntary enlistment. The verdict of the electors on 5th Maywhich ought to be a day of glorious memory-wa s clear and unmistakable, and their mandate we are determined to respect and adhere to. The objection that this proposal is contrary to that mandate can come from only two classes of persons-(1 ) those like the members of the Opposition and their supporters, who rarely see much virtue in the proposals of ""the Government; and (2) those who are opposed to the decision of the people by the referendum of the 28th October last being accepted, and who wish the Government not to adhere to it . The declaration of the Government on the 5th May, and the verdict given by the people on that day-the mandate we received then-w e intend to adhere to. The Government is actuated by two principal reasons in bringing forward this proposal. The first is that we believe it will stimulate and increase recruiting, not so much, we hope, by the fear of having to pay the tax, as by bringing prominently before those who have not yet volunteered for service what is not only their duty to their country, but their paramount duty to. themselves. legissecond reason is to provide funds towards the repatriation of those, who have returned from the war after having served their country. Is that not a„<jood object? I hope that honourable members will bear with me for a few moments longer, b& ± cause I desire to say something very earnestly before I sit down. It is difficult to understand why such a glorious opportunity of doing their duty, by serving their country, has not been embraced by every qualified person. Nelson's stirring call, made over one hundred years ago, is as inspiring now as it was then- "" England expects every man to-do his d u t y .

Those who would ask us not to propose this measure ask us, in effect, to say that those who have not gone to the war, but have remained at home attending to their own interests, have no obligation resting upon them to specially help to repatriate those who have voluntarily done so.

50,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH REPRESENTATION ON,"In conclusion, if I may venture to express my own opinThe ion, those who do not go to the war are acting most unwisely and foolishly from their own personal stand-point.

' Whether honourable members are in favour of or are opposed to compulsory service in time of war has nothing whatever to do with this proposal.

SECOND READING .",27
51,Mr GROOM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"Darling Downs-Hon orary Minister) [8.55] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This Bill , which is entitled a Bill Act to amend the Defence Act of General 1903-15, is more one for consideration Committee than for discussion on the second reading. It is intended to a number of defects which experience has disclosed in the working of the existing Act, and a memorandum has been prepassing pared, and will be immediately circulated, showing the various amendments probeen posed. Honourable members will realise that the Defence Act was framed, and that it operated for manv years, before war conditions arose; and the practical amination."" experience of the war has shown the necessity for amendments in order to remove doubts concerning several of provisions. In consequence of the large number of troops sent to the Front from Australia the authorities have found it necessaryto take action, in regard to which some question has arisen, and it is necessary to set all doubt at rest by making explicit declaration, and, - as it were, validating that action. In illustration, I may mention that section 31 of the original Act gives power to the Governor General to appoint and promote officers of the Defence Forces, and issue commissions to them. Honourable members are aware, however, that it has become necessary to make promotions and appoint officers overseas; indeed, altogether some 5,400 promotions have thus been made from the ranks, and ,some of the men have risen to very high positions indeed. The poWer to make appointments has practically been delegated, and clause 3, providing a new section 8A to the principal Act , enables the Governor General to delegate to the oflicer in command of any ""part of the Militar y Forces, when beyond the limits of the Commonwealth, power to appoint or promote officers to acting rank in the Militar y Forces. Of course, all those provisional appointments subject to confirmation by the Governor General. A sub-clause of clause 3 provides for the validation of any appointment already made, or powers exercised, in pursuance of the delegation. . I mention this as an illustration of the class of amendment with which the Bill deals; and another illustration is contained in clause 5. The men of the Expeditionary Force will be returning, and it is desirable that the Commonwealth should reap the benefit of the experience of those wbo have fought abroad on behalf of the Empire. Many of these men were privates in our Citizen Forces, and power is taken for an under clause 5 to enable the Governorto appoint, for distinguished seri n vice in time of war, or for exceptional gallantry on active service, any person to amend be an officer or non-commissioned officer, or promote an officer or non-commissioned officer in the Citizen Forces without his the prescribed examination. Many who went abroad as privates have promoted to commissioned rank.",28
52,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,They havfc done better than the passing of any '-' prescribed ex,28
53,Mr GROOM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,Thei r fitness has been the proved by a very practical test.,28
54,Mr MANIFOLD,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,Do such men now retain their commissions after they return?,28
55,Mr GROOM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"The rank conferred on them is retained as honorary rank. The provision about which I am speaking empowers us to incorporate in the Citizen Forces, without examination, so many of these men as may be needed, and may be willing to serve. Clauses 14 and 15 deal with the application of the Army Act and its incorporation in our defence, law. Our Act now incorporates the Army A ct by providing that the Militar y Porces shall, at all times, while on active service, within or without the limits of the Commonwealth, be subject to the Army Act , except so far as the provisions of the latter may be in consistent with our Act, and regulations under it may prescribe that any provisions of the Army Act shall not apply to our military Forces. It has been found necessary, however, not only to apply the Army Act to our Forces, but also to adapt it to Australian conditions.",28
56,Mr FENTON,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"When our men come under British officers, are they not immediately controlled by the British Armv Act?",29
57,Mr GROOM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"They may be under the British A r m y Act here in Australia, ex- sonate a returned soldier. cept so far as any of the provisions of that Act may be - inconsistent with our own Act.",29
58,Mr JH CATTS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,Why not incorporate in our legislation so much of the Army Act as may be needed ?,29
59,Mr GROOM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"The A r m y Act may be amended from time to time, and if we were to adopt it as it is today, the result might be, when a portion of our troops was serving with Imperial troops, that the law applying to them was different from that applying to the others.",29
60,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"The British Army Act is being modified, and is being made to apply, not only toAustralian Forces serving outside Australia, but also to men on their way from Australia to serve abroad, or on their way back. Then subclause 3 of proposed new section 54A says, "" This section shall be construed as amplifying, and not as restricting, any of the other provisions of this Act . "" That is pEr.aseology that I have not seen before.",29
61,Mr GROOM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"There are Australians serving in Mesopotamia, Egypt, France, and elsewhere; some of them are serving with New Zealanders, and many are fighting side by side with Imperial troops. It is essential under these conditions that the provisions of the British A r m y Act shall apply to them on active service. But we are taking power to modify and adapt the provisions of the Army Act in its application to the Militar y Forces. For instance, ""certain Courts are specified by the British Act, and we are taking power to apply it to corresponding Courts here. We are also applying the Aot to war service.  paragraphs b and c of proposed new section 54A ?",29
62,Mr GROOM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"I shall deal .with that matter later, when speaking of the definitions of ""active service"" and "" w a r service."" Roughly speaking, "" active, service"" is service abroad according to the definition in the Army Act, and "" w a r service"" covers service after the w,ar has ceased. These, however, are matters for Committee rather than for the second-reading debate. Clause 17 makes provision for the granting of preference in the employment in the Department of returned soldiers, giving effect .to a policy already announced. Clause 21 makes it an offence, to perMen have been found unscrupulous enough to obtain money under false pretences by passing themselves off as returned soldiers, and a penalty is provided for that offence. A series of clauses punishes the trafficking in and the improper wearing of military decorations.",29
63,Mr FENTON,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,Would any of those provisions prevent the wife of a soldier from wearing her husband's medals ? Mr GROOM:- A special clause deals with the wearing of medals by female relatives.,29
64,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,But the pawning of medals would be stopped ?,29
65,Mr GROOM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"Provisio n is made to prevent the disposing of medals. Clause 42 remedies a defect of the present law. Section 134 of the Defence Act is contained in Part XII . of the Act , and imposes a penalty on employers who prevent employees from serving in camp, thus interfering with the training required by law. It was thought that that provision applied, to other parts of the Act, but on the matter being referred to the officers of the Crown Law Department, the opinion was given that it applies only to the universal service training. Under Part III . and Part IV . , however, employees may be called up, and have been called up, for military work.",29
66,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"Me n were called up on the outbreak of war, and many of them lost their jobs in consequence.",30
67,Mr GROOM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"That is so. Clause 42 enacts that an employer shall not prevent an employee, or a parent or guardian a son or ward, from rendering personal service under Parts III . and IV . of the Defence Act, and penalties are provided for any infringement of this provision. This is necessary for the protection of employees who are called upon to do service on behalf of the country. It is desirable to alter the law relating to the training of cadets. The training of the Senior Cadets is an important part of our compulsory service. The regulations fix times for the training of the cadets at night and on Saturday afternoons, but there have been many objections by parents to the taking up of so many evenings in training, and it is felt that the Saturday afternoon drills often restrict unfairly legitimate opportunities for sport and recreation. Clause 49, therefore, enables the Government to provide for the training of senior cadets during hours when they are really in the service of their masters.",30
68,Sir WILLIAM IBVINE,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,How such time will be taken ?,30
69,Mr GROOM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"Onl y part of the training will be done in such time. Action will be taken after consultation with the proper officers. Our present concern is to get power to provide for the training of cadets in part, during the time .of service with their employers.",30
70,Sir WILLIAMIBVINE,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,I suppose that not more than an hour a week will be taken ?,30
71,Mr GROOM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"Probably not so much, on the average, during a year. But the desire is to take power to do it . I do not think that any employer will object to the provision. Drills for the most part will be held on Saturday mornings, in the employers' time, but in certain towns Saturday afternoon - is not a half-holiday, and the drills may be held during the afternoon. The proposal is to make the Aet more elastic, and to make the training easier for the boys, and at the same time to meet the wishes of parents. Clause 51 modifies section 148, which providesNo person who is not a graduate of the Military College as prescribed shall be appointed an officer of the Permanent Forces: Provided that this provision shall not take effect until the .expiration of five years after the establishment of the College. That provision was made in the Act in accordance with the recommendation of Lord Kitchener, but there were certain classes of officers, for instance, veterinary officers, for which training is not given at the College; and as it is desired to make appointments to the permanent staff from such officers, clause 51 has been inserted in this Bill . It provides that members of the Permanent and Citizen Forces, or persons who have served with satisfactory record in any expeditionary force raised for service outside the Commonwealth, who are not graduates - of the M i l it a r y College, may, subject to such conditions as are prescribed, be appointed 6r promoted to be officers in the non-combatant branches of blie Permanent - Forces, in cluding the Medical, Veterinary, Ordnance, Survey, and Clerical branches; and that warrant and non-commissioned officers of the Permanent Forces may be appointed to commissioned rank for the position of quartermaster to units of the Australian Militar y Forces. This provision will meet a necessity which is now felt in connection with the' adminis- tration of the Department. much of Mr J. H. CATTS - What about the death penalty ?",30
72,Mr GROOM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"There is no proposal to alter the law in that regard. This is a E i ll more for consideration in detaili n Committee, but my .remarks will have given honourable members an indication of its contents.",30

74,Mr GROOM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,Yes ; it has been a long time before the House.,30
75,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"I thought that we might deal with the Railways Bill , though I understand that honourable members opposite consider that there is some contentious matter in the amendments sub-. . mitted by the Senate. I would like to understand whether we can discuss provisions of the principal Act which are not touched by this amending Bill .",30
76,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,The honourable member will not be in order in doing so.,30
77,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"The Minister has assured us that the provisions relating to the death penalty are not being altered, but I am anxious to know whether there has not been some alteration effected by placing our soldiers under the Army Act. Honourable members are at a disadvantage, because until a few minutes ago they had not received copies of the randum showing the. alterations proposed to be made in the principal Act. memorandum was before another long before the Bill was introduced; but, of course, amendments were made in Senate, and it has been necessary to have the field. a reprint made. Apparently, the Government propose still further alterations.",30
78,Mr GROOM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"There are two minor amendments, necessitated by what war has produced.",31
79,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"Apparently , the experience of the past few days has shown the necessity for amendments. Honourable members are at another disadvantage, in that they do not know the provisions of the Army Act. The Minister has told that all of our men will be placed that Act.",31
80,Mr GROOM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,They are under the Army Act today.,31
81,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"I Imderstand that this Bill goes further in that respect. Minister has pointed out that we have "" phraseology in this Bill which has been used in any other measure. For stance, the proposed new sub-section section 54A reads as follows: This section shall he construed as ing, and not as restricting, any of provisions of this Act.

I am glad that the Minister has gone a certain length in that direction by providing that certain persons who have served with a safcisfacV tory record in the Expeditionary Forces and are not graduates of the Military College may be appointed or promoted to be officers in the non-combatant branches of the Permanent Forces.",32

100,Mr GROOM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"The law in regard to training at the Military College will remain the same. We must not alter that, because that condition was recommended by Lord Kitchener.",32
101,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"In regard to the training of the cadets, we compel a boy to undergo training, and we insist that the employer shall continue his pay while he is in camp. I do not know to what extent that provision will apply to boys who are employed on piece work. The honourable member for Hunter has several times mentioned the cases of boys employed as wheelers in collieries, and who are employed on niece work.",32
102,Mr BOYD,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"I think, under the new Coal Mines Act of Victoria, wheelers must be over eighteen years of age.",32
103,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,We are insisting that the employer shall pay senior cadets of from fourteen to eighteen years of age during the time they are engaged in military training. W hy should we not make the same provision in regard to cadets up to twenty-one years of age ?,32

105,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"That seems a valid reason for the differentiation. I agree with the Minister that this is a measure for consideration in Committee.

108,Mr GROOM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"Wheneve r the Arm y Act is inconsistent with the Australian Act , the latter prevails.",32
109,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"I wish to be certain upon that point. We know that some Australian soldiers who kicked over the traces have been punished out of all pro'piortion to their offences, and for that reason we should be careful about binding ourselves io follow the Arm y Act.  Bill is principally one for consideration in Committee. But I ask honourable members on both sides to assert the principle that there is no man more deserving of consideration than he who has won his spurs and has been promoted on the field of battle. I feel sure that every member of this House will be only too pleased to insure that the returned soldier gets everything that is due to him, and it behoves us to see that he enjoys the same rights and rank as men who have merely passed prescribed examinations. It is all very well for a Minister to say that this Bill will apply only to the Citizen Forces. We know that the men best fitted to set an example to our youngsters ar® those who have been under fire, who have stood the test of battle, and have both practical and theoretical knowledge. We could get no better instructors and leaders for our Citizen Porces than the men who led the Australian lads at Gallipoli and in Flanders and Mesopotamia, and I should like the Minister to frame a clause that will insure that returned soldiers get full recognition and opportunity. We know that we cannot employ in the Citizen Forces every returned soldier, but it is our duty to specially safeguard the rights of those who have done heroic d'eeds on the field of battle.",32

It would never to have at the Front one set of men servto ing under the Defence Act of Canada or Australia, another under the Defence of New Zealand, and yet another under the defence laws of Newfoundland or South Africa . The British operates just as readily as does any defence law of the Dominions, and when do our men .are serving with the Imperial Forces abroad, they must be all under the one law.

Coming to the provisions dealing with prothe position and pay of young men who our have to train for our Citizen Fonces, I .think the Government are acting wisely. further We call upon the young men of this country, just at a time when they like to afternoons to sport, to give up some of their spare time to the work of training themselves to become efficient in the defence of Australia. proThat being so, their employers should be called upon to shoulder some of the buri n the way proposed by the Governmenb. This is not a Bill which calls for a lengthy second-reading debate, but I hope secbhat when we go into Committee we shall re-fashion some of its provisions so that it will leave our hands a far better Bill than it was when sent down to us from another",33
118,Mr ARCHIBALD,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"Hindmarsh) [9.52]. - The honourable member for Maranoa  we should so amend this Bill in certain directions as to reduce to a minimum the .possibility of any misunderstanding. I think it would be a mistake to depart too widely from the laying down of general principles, and to proceed to emphasize details. As my honourable friend knows very well, very large discretionary powers ar© vested in the authorities under the British Army Act, the assumption being that the British Parliament will always keep a watchful eye on the state and condition of the Army. rest assured that, whatever may have happened in the past, future Houses 'of .Commons are not likely to forget the gallant deeds of British soldiers during this terrible war. I think that the right view for this House to adopt is that in this measure we should not go beyond the affirmation of general principles, since we may ' rest assured that future Parliaments of the Commonwealth will always be caref u l that the interests of officers and men who have served at the Front are in no wise neglected. I do not think there is any chance of a future Parliament of the Commonwealth allowing mere carpet knightsi to be promoted at the expense of men who have been on active service. Our legal friends will tell us that when in an Act of Parliament we depart from the affirmation of general principles and proceed to particularize, we very often defeat the very object we have"" in view. I think it would be well in the circumstances for the House to be largely guided by the view of the Government in this matter. Neither the Government nor any of its supporters can have any object but that of doing the best for the officers and men who have done so well for Australia.  would say otherwise.",34
119,Mr ARCHIBALD,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"I am sure the honourable member would not. We should exercise care in dealing with the question of promotions. All civilized countries, with the exception of Germany, recognise the principle that where men are , promoted for deeds of gallantry on the field, they should not be required to undergo any examination. When we were building up our Citizen Forces, however, it was very necessary to provide that a strict examination should be passed by those seeking commissioned rank. peace, care must be taken that an Army does not degenerate because of its control by half-educated officers. That is why we have insisted upon candidates for commissions in our Citizen Forces passing certain prescribed examinations. We established Duntroon Militar y College to provide for the proper education of our officers, but scientific training is not the Only desideratum. A man who on active service shows that he has tact, judgment, and initiative is quite as serviceable to his commanding officer as is any man who has passed the highest technical examinations). Some of the greatest generals of We may bygone days were masters of strategythey had completely mastered military science, but they never won a battle. On the other hand, history tells us of others who were deficient in these respects, but were among some of the most remarkable in the armies of Great Britain and France. The promotion of men for deeds of gallantry while on active service is a recognised practice in the British Army, and we must see that the principle is respected and upheld here. That, I think, is one of the objects of this Bill . As to the clauses which provide that our troops while returning on transports to Australia shall continue under the operation of the Army Act , I am inclined, to agree with a good deal of what the honourable member for Maranoa has said. But there can be no harm in calling upon our men on their way to the Pront to submit to the discipline for which that Act provides, and to which they will be subjected as soon as they land. In conclusion, I would urge honourable members to recognise that those who succeed us in >this Parliament will , in view of the happenings of this terrible war, be just as zealous in guarding the interests of the men who have put up so splendid a record for Australia as are the members of the present Parliament.",34

Against his will, he was sent back to Australia, where he has been given very important work to do; but only to find that a second lieutenant, with whom he had worked here, had been promoted to major, and was drawing pay, while he, on arriving, had his pay reduced to that of lieutenant. Is this Bill intended to remedy, or to tolerate, that sort of thing? stances are certainly not calculated to encourage young men to thoroughly qualify in the A r m y .",34
121,Mr GROOM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"I do not know the facts of the case the honourable member has cited. This Bill provides that if the Government desire to take advantage of the services, in the Citizen Forces, of men who have served abroad, they may do so; that is the object of this Bill .",35
122,Mr WISE,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,Where there is a vacancy.,35
123,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"If there is no vacancy, of course, a man cannot be appointed; but if the Bill will give preference in the Citizen Forces to practical soldiers, it shall have my support.",35
124,Mr GROOM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,This Bill also gives power to appoint them to positions in the Defence Department.,35
125,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"Of course, I cannot expect the Minister, offhand, to decide .such a case as I have cited, and I shall forward him the names and details.",35
126,Mr GROOM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"When a man returns to Australia with a certain rank, he is put on the reserve with that rank.",35
127,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"The case I have cited is that of a Duntroon graduate, who was one of those who did so well at Gallipoli that I a n Hamilton said they were worth their weight in gold. This officer won his commission on the field, and then found a "" stay-at-home "" placed over his head. I confess I do not understand the Bill , nor do I think any one else can, without the memorandum.",35
128,Mr MANIFOLD,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"Corangamite) [10.5] - It is rather difficult to under-- , I stand the position. According to the Defence Act , when there are enough officers turned out of Duntroon, they are to be the only officers to hold staff appointments in the Australian A r m y .",35
129,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,Is not that altered by this. Hill ?,35
130,Mr GROOM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,In certain branches only.,35
131,Mr MANIFOLD,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,What I have stated is laid' down in ' the Defence Act . The Bill provides that men who have done conspicuous work on the battle field may be selected and given certain appointments. major's - Mr GROOM - Provisio n is made in regard to the Citizen Forces.,35
132,Mr MANIFOLD,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"At any rate, it means that, no matter what may be proSuch in - vided in this amending Bill , no man can be given a staff appointment unless he has been through Duntroon College. Precisely similar conditions prevail in the British A r m y . The officers are divided into two classes, and no man, unless, he has passed through Sandhurst or Woolwich, is given a position on the permanent staff, but is placed in the special reserve. The result is that a great proportion of the junior officers fighting in the British Arm y at the Front are in the special reserve ; and men out of Sandhurst or Woolwich practically go over the heads of those who have done the fighting from the start. In my opinion, the men who return from the Front should hold the rank they have won there.",35
133,Mr GROOM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,Thei r rank is being recognised now.,35
134,Mr MANIFOLD,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"That is something that has been settled; but the circumstances disclosed by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro are not satisfactory. A man who has been 'promoted on the field of battle, and in a school of in struction behind the lines, has received all the training necessary to make him a leader of men, and has a perfect right to retain the rank he has won overseas. If a man under the age of twenty-five returns, it may be with the rank of captain or major, he has to go into the Citizen Forces as a private. He may be good enough to fight for the Empire and for Australia; but when he returns, unless he has been through the> Duntroon College, he has to go into the Citizen Forces as a private.  such a man will retain the rank he has won.",35
135,Mr MANIFOLD,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"The Minister does not say anything of the kind. If a man on returning with commissioned rank, has to go into training in Australia, he ought to be allowed to retain the rank he has won.",36
136,Mr HEITMANN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"What is the position of a returned officer in relation to another who held a commission prior to the war, yet never has been to the war ?",36
137,Mr MANIFOLD,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"Some commissioned omcers may not have been - permitted to go to the war; but if an officer has had the chance, his billet should be available for the man who has done the fighting. As to the cadets, I think that they ought to be trained in time given by their employers on other days than holidays. There is no doubt that for this, not an hour, but half a day is necessary, and it is not too much time to devote to the work. In the country districts, where cadets have to travel long distances, their training may occupy more than half a day, and in spite of what honourable members opposite may say, it will be found that honourable members on this side are quite in favour of the training being done in the employers' time.",36
138,Mr ORCHARD,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"Nepean) [10.14] I should like some enlightenment from the Minister as to the operation of the clause dealing with promotions on the field. I have in my mind a case where a non-commissioned officer, after winning the rank of captain at Gallipoli, was in valided to Australia, where he re-enlisted. His desire was to ,have the same rank that he had won under actual war conditions. He was informed by the Defence Department that, in order to obtain commissioned rank on going abroad a second time, he must pass through an officers' school at Duntroon. As a consequence, that man went away as a private, under the orders of an officer who was a mere theoris't,",36
139,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,Some of. the officers who returned retained their rank. The son of the Minister for the Navy did so.,36
140,Mr LECKIE,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,Perhaps the whom the honourable member for Nepean (Mr Orchard) was referring was discharged.,36
141,Mr ORCHARD,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"He was discharged, and, on becoming medically fife again, reenlisted. I am led to believe that his is not an isolated case. There have been innumerable instances in which men have gone away as non-commissioned officers, and, while away, have fulfilled satisfactorily the duties of their r a n k , ' but , because through some oversight their appointments were not gazetted, they have not been given the pay and privileges of the rank in which they have been serving, and, notwithstanding that evidence has ^been available to prove their service, they have obtained no redress. We have had many assurances from the Minister for Defence that, where possible, returned men will be puti into home service positions. No doubt the Minister is actuated by the best of intentions, but often his instructions are not carried into eflect. I know of eleven officers in New South Wales, between the ages of twentv : five and thirty-five years, who are occupying soft billets in connection with the various camps, and whose work might well be done by returned men.",36
142,Mr BOYD,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,That sort of thing needs explaining ,36
143,Mr ORCHARD,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"Yes . Returned men say "" The Defence Department promises to treat us fair l y , ' and yet it gives good positions to men who will not go abroad, many of whom have also excellent private positions.""",36
144,Mr GROOM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,If the honourable member will give me the names of those to whom he refers I shall have the matter inquired into.,36
145,Mr ORCHARD,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"When a man comes back with honourable scars and an excellent record, he should receive preference for any soft home-service billet. It is disheartening to returned men to find that other men can occupy good positions for fifteen and eighteen months, and even for two years, without going abroad. Some of those who have nob gone abroad have stated that they will be satisfied to remain where they are until the war is over. Such men should not be retained in the service. 'The arrangements under which promotions are made abroad have their defects. man to At the present time great dissatisfaction exists with the method of appointing, commissioned officers in Egypt. Non-commissioned men who have served with the utmost ability have been passed over aud privates without experience as non-commissioned officers have received commissions. I have this on reliable authoritythe statements of men who have returned Some inquiry should he made into the matter. I wish to draw attention to the manner in which officers in London are neglecting their duties. For the past two years the delay in forwarding "" non-effective statements "" has been a burning complaint. On my return from Great Britain last year, I brought the matter before the Minister, and certain cablegrams were sent to London, with the result that 3,000 non-effective statements arrived by one mail. Evidently they had been accumulating in the London office. many cases the non-receiplt of these statements had delayed the settlement of the estates of deceased soldiers, whose families were in actual need. I have which a widow whose son was killed more than twelve months ago cannot obtain a settlement of the estate because the noneffective statement relating to him has not yet arrived, and. I am sure that hundreds of such cases have been brought before various members. The almost criminal carelessness and indifference of those in our London office to the claims of the dependants of men who have sacrificed their lives on the field of battle should not be permitted to go unchecked. I advocate the sending Home of a special officer to inquire into the delay regarding non-effective statements. Unfortunately, the number of these statements will in crease rfather than decrease. We ask eligible men to enlist, but when the extreme hardship endured by the families of many men who have been killed becomes known, the forces operaiting against the success of recruiting can well be understood. I hope that the Defence Department will see whether the London office cannot be galvanized into life, and those employed there made to realise their duty to the men who are actually fighting and to their dependants.",36
146,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"Darling) [10.27] I am sorry thab it is not proposed to amend the Defence Acti to deal with appeals. A case has come under my notice - I have all the papers, and shall place them before the Minister later-in which a private attached to a veterinary corps in Egypt got into trouble with the authorities for some neglect of duty, and was ultimately marked down as a venereal patient and sent to an isolation ward. Subsequently a doctor regarded him as mentally deficient, and he was told that he had been wrongly sent to the isolation ward. But the medical officers connected with the case did not agree either as to his being a venereal patient) or as to his suffering from mental disability. He was asked if he would return to* his unit,* and he refused 'to do so unless his case was investigated. He was placed on the Suffolk and sent home, and he states that he was wrongfully put into the isolation ward on board ship. There should be some process whereby such a man would have an opportunity to clear his character. This man and his wife are so ashamed of the charges In made against him that they cannot go back to the town where he was attested. Provision should be made for an appeal in such cases. I think that a Board of In a case in quiry should be constituted.",37
147,Mr LAMOND,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"I l l a w a r r a) [10.30]. - I am glad that the Ministry has seen its way to move in the direction of making the traiuing of cadets a little more attractive to the lads. I am informed by officers who have taken a great deal of interest in the cadets, that the greatest cause of insubordination among them is the objection that all healthy young persons have bO being deprived of opportunities for taking part in sports. This has been accentuated recently by the fact that our cadets have been called upon to attend more drills than has been the case in the past, because some time ago the Department suspended all training. I would like to have heard the Minister speak a little more definitely as to the. extent to which it was intended to press this reform. He seemed to indicate that there was not to be full recognition of the right of the boys to the Saturday half-holiday, and that an indefinite number of hours would he arranged which might still call upon them to d r ill on some Saturday afternoons.",37
148,Mr GROOM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,In some districts the Saturday afternoon is not a half-holiday.,37
149,Mr LAMOND,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"I have no more - to say if the intention is that the cadets shall not be asked to d r ill on half-holidays. It is in the interests of efficient training that the lads should not be required to give up their holidays in order to fit themselves as soldiers. Apparently, it is still the intention to compel those members of the Australian Imperial Force who are not beyond the compulsory age provided in the Act to resume their training in the Citizen Forces on their return from abroad. It is an absurd proposition, and I hope that the Minister will give it further consideration. The men who have gone to theFront have had quite sumcient training to obviate their being called upon to do further services in the Citizen Forces. Mr Charlton"" (Hunter) [10.33]. - I desire to endorse the view put forward by the honourable member for Nepean (Mr Orchard) in regard to non-effective statements. It is time that the Minister for Defence made some better provision in regard to getting that information. The way in which it is delayed is shameful. It brings great hardship on widows and the dependants of soldiers who have passed away on the other side of the world. This most important question has been before honourable members for the last two years, and has heen debated in this House on several occasions, yet no attempt appears to have heen made to bring ahout a remedy, I do not know why the information cannot be forwarded to Australia within four months of the death of a soldier. Apparently, there is some unnecessary delay on the part of those who are administering affairs in connection with our troops overseas. A further matter to be taken into sideration is the question of providing for the children of a soldier whose wife has died during his absence. Relatives or friends who take care of the children make arrangements for payment the State Relief Boards, but they never secure the full amount of the allotment money that a soldier has left for his deister pendants until they hear from the himself.",37
150,Mr WISE,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,'Unti l a fresh allotment been obtained.,38
151,Mr CHARLTON,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"I have had a score of cases brought under my notice where the soldier has written to his friends notifying them that he has made with the officials abroad all arrangements necessary for making a fresh allotment so as to put his dependants on a proper footing, but there has been no communior . [81] cation from the local military authorities for months afterwards.",38
152,Mr WISE,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,On several occasions I have induced the localauthorities to aet on similar letters.,38
153,Mr CHARLTON,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"At the present time. I am asking them to do so on one letter; but I have had cases where twelve months have elapsed before the requisite information has come to hand through official sources. I rose chiefly to speak in regard to Saturday drills. The honourable member for Hlawarra has just said that he will be satisfied so long as the drills do not take place on Saturday afternoons, but if they are held on Saturday mornings a great injustice will be done to all the lads who are employed in coal mines. Every second Saturday in the coaLmining industry is a holiday, and on those days the lads employed in the mines go fishing or indulge in sport, and if they are asked to drill in the morning the employers will not be called upqn to pay. The only method of overcoming the olifnculty is to have the drills on days other than Saturdays.",38
154,Mr GROOM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"The Bill will give greater elasticity in regard to the drill hours, and we can hold the drills in, the employers' time without deduction of pay by the employer. Mr Charlton"" - When exercising that power I hope that the Minister wiS bear in mind that the lads employed i i concoal mines have their holidays ever] second Saturday, and I trust that he will fix the drills for any day except Saturday. The lads object to drilling at night, but they would rather do that than break from into their Saturday holidays.",38
155,Mr GROOM,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,It will he open to the Minto adapt his regulations to the cussoldier toms of different districts.,38
156,Mr CHARLTON,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"I quite agree that it will be necessary to have some discrehas tion. In regard to the matter mentioned by the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman), I recognise that there are many difficulties in reference to the position, of men who have heen promoted on the field. Though a man may have been, promoted on the field of battle, it may be held that his promotion was not due to distinguished service some act of. gallantry. I hope that the case mentioned by the honourable memcipline, ber will be borne in mind. He was speakin ing of. an officer of the Australian perial. Porce who was promoted to the rank of captain, but was reduced to the rank of lieutenant on his. Teturn.",38

At the outbreak of war there was a great, deal of discontent the among our troops because incompetent and men were placed in certain positions, and gaveorders which proved' very irksome; while others who were competent did not securethe opportunity of provingtheir worth. . I think that every one agrees that it is. absolutely necessary that our officers should' have practical' knowledge; but, in gade. my opinion^ to become efficient leaders they should also possess a theoretical knowledge. More characteristics than one go to makeup a successful officer: _ man must have; not only dash and daring; but also brains'. Those who possess both qualities are successful officers, and' their return to Australia they should given such positions in our Forces as are open to them. Two honourable members referred to what they considered' the harsh treattions ment meted out. to some of our men. and' I . have been in charge of prisoners at martial,, and I can say from experience that every consideration has been given Australian officers to. the men who were standing their trial. Honourable members must bear, in mind that the position of man on. active service is very different from that of a man. in civil life. In army in wan time there, must be strict disanother and I . do not. know of any instance which our officers have been unduly Imsevere. Only today I met in Melbourne a returned soldier on crutches. He was a member of my unit, and when last I saw him he was paraded before his unit and discharged from the Forces with ignominy. was returned to Australia, and here he re^enlisted. He went to France with the out 59th Battalion, and made good. He is wound suffering from a machine-gun in the leg. That man was at one of his officers and today comhe jokingly referred to "" the hell of a time ""' he had caused them. I am satisfied to that the sentence passed upon that man we wasjust, although, excepting the deatih penalty, it was the most severe punishof ment that could be imposed.",39

This A Bill is a very timely measure-, because it will serve to obviate many injustices that are caused today. I know of instances 1 on of men who have carried out, on private's be pay. the duties of non-commissioned officers, and' then have' been, compelled to revert to the ranks without receiving any recognition of the services: they performed. One soldier who possessed special qualificawas withdrawn from the firing line, placed in charge of a hospital over the courts heads of confirmed corporals who were drawing 10s.. per day.

NEW SOUTH WALES COLLIERIE S : ALLEGED DANGEROUS MINES - PATRIOTIC FUNDS : ADMINISTRATION. Motion (by Mr. JOSEPH COOK) posedThat the House do now adjourn.",41
178,Mr CHARLTON,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"Hunter) [11.7] - I moved the adjournment of the House on Friday last in order to discuss the proposals of the New South Wales Government for working coal mines in that State, and in the course of my speech made certain remarks in regard to the danger attendant upon the working of the Pelaw Main and Richmond Main mines. It has been declared by the Premier of New South Wales, and also by Mr Hagelthorn, a member of the Victorian Government, and by the Victorian representatives of Messrs. J . and A . Brown, that the statement. I made in regard to those mines has no foundation in fact. The statement. I made was, as reported in Hansard, thatThe Richmond Main and the Pelaw Main, which are to be worked on hehalf of the Victorian Government; are very dangerous mines, because they give off gas in large quantities. Yet the Victorian Government is advertising for gold miners, labourers, and workmen of any sort to man these mines. With inexperienced labour of that character, an explosion might occur at any moment. I was referring to .the danger of working these mines by inexperienced men, because of the gasthat is given off in them. I was not speaking of their equipment, but the fact that the mines in question are two of the best equipped in New South Wales lends colour to my statement that they have to be so equipped in order to prevent the ignition of gas - There is nothing better than their ventilation plants, and especially the ventilation plant of the Richmond Main . The' owners were compelled to put in the very best appliances in order to keep them free from gas. That in itself bears out my statement as (to the danger of working them with inexperienced men. In the New South Wales Parliamentary papers for 1908, to be found in the Commonwealth Library, there appears the annual report by Mr Atkinson for 1908. in which it was stated that fire damp had been reported under rule 4 in the Maitland portion, northern inspection district, at the Eastl Greta, Heddon Greta, Stanford Merthyr, PelawMain , Richmond Main, Hebburn, and South Greta mines. In the annual report of the New South Wales Department of Mines for 1916-the latest available-w e have the statement, at page pro134, "" Mr Humble reports fire damp has been seen and reported under the general and special rules during the year."" Pelaw Main and Richmond Main are mentioned, in addition to some other mines. It is stated, further, that one individual was prosecuted for having matches in the Pelaw Main mine, and that the following collieries, amongst others, are using locked safety lamps throughout: - Stanfor d Merthyr, Pelaw Main, Richmond Main, Seaham, and Seaham No. 2. These are mines in which the Government are endeavouring to employ inexperienced labour, and, notwithstanding what may be said outside as to their safety, I repeat that they are not safe if inexperienced men be employed in them. Mr . JOSEPH COOX - Do they shoot in these mines?",41
179,Mr CHARL,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"TON - Unde r certain, conditions they shoot in every mine in the Newcastle and, Maitland districts. The only exception that I can recall to mind was in the case of the Pelaw Main - Mr MATHEWS Some time ago they were driving two main headings, and the gas coming off was so great, according to the under-mahager at that time, that they could not fire a shot; they had. to scallop it out for fear of an explosion. Not more than two months ago, if I remember rightly, a fire occurred in Pelaw Main , and the men had to he withdrawn because of the fear of an explosion. Notwithstanding all these facts, I am told that my statements were incorrect. Prom the point of view that the mines in question produce gas, my statement is absolutely correct, and the greatest care must be taken to safeguard the lives of those who go into them.",42
180,Mr MATHEWS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"Melbourne Ports) [11.11] - I put a question today to the Honorary Minister (Mr Groom) in regard to the administration of the Victorian Patriotic Fund, and was asked to give notice of it . I regret to have to say that, whilst those in charge of the Patriotic Fund in Victoria mav be well-intentioned people, they move very slowly, and are doing hut little. What makes their slow-going methods' harder to hear is the fact that in New South Wales those in charge of the Patriotic Fund are doing excellent work and carrying out the functions for which' the fun d was called into existence. I know that the .Government have no supervision over these funds, and that it would be difficult to single out the controllers of the Victorian fund for special treatment. The administration of the South' Australian fund is even worse, so that the situation is a very delicate one. If the Victorian and South Australian funds were singled' out for special action on the part of the Government there would be a rumpus, and if , on the other hand, the Government stepped in with regard to the whole of these funds in the several States, it would stop the good work that is being done in New South, Wales, and, to a lesser degree, in Queensland. Mr .RODGERS - There - was a recent conference of representatives.",42
181,Mr MATHEWS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,I shall refer to that conference. For a long time we have been promised that the allowance to the wives and children of the men at the Front would be supplemented from the Victorian'Patriotic Fund.,42
182,Mr RODGERS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,Arid that is being done. - U p to date they have done npthing in that direction.,42
183,Mr RODGERS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,They have.,42
184,Mr MATHEWS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"Necessitou s cases are brought under the notice of those controlling the fund , but they do not deal with them. If it'were not for the Victorian State War Council there - would be nothing done to meet these cases. The Victorian State W a r Council, through its officials, is doing splendid work, but it has very little money with which 'to giv« Telief. At ths conference it was promised that £1,000 would be handed over to the State War Council to enable it to deal with necessitous cases. .According to to-night's issue of the Herald, that amount has been reduced to £500. No attempt has yet been made to pay out the extra amount that was to he payable as from the 11th instant. I know that the Government have no immediate supervision over these funds', but they could secure it , and they should do something in the matter. If I were to make statements of this character outside, the War Precautions Act would he applied to me. and I have no desire to adorn a cell, as I would have to do, since I would not have the money to pay the heavy fine which would probably be inflicted. I do not infer that those responsible for the administration of the fund have no sympathy for the - wives and families of the men at the Front, but the fact remains that one can get them to do but very little. They have a considerable amount of money, and they should use it in the direction in which it was intended it should be used. I know from what I have learned from those interested in other bodies that the people responsible for the Patriotic Fund are not carrying out the promises they gave. If something is not done to remedy the existing state of affairs, - I shall take the risk of saying outside what may .bring upon me the charge of interfering with recruiting. It is up to those in charge of ifche Victorian Patriotic Fund to do some of the work for whioh the fund was brought into existence. At present I can only say thaH this fund is being administered unfeelingly.",42
185,Mr RODGERS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,To what fund does the honourable member refer 1,43
186,Mr MATHEWS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"To the Patriotic Fund, supervised by the Lord Mayor of Melbourne.",43
187,Mr RODGERS,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC,"Those administering the fund have done wonderfully good work - , Mr .MATHEWS - Tell me one thing, they have done. They do not attempt to spend the money for purposes for which it was gathered. I do not know what the expenses of administering the fund are, but I am told that the daughter of one public man is getting J& 6 a week for supervision of some sort. I have no proof, but if that be true, both she and her father ought to be ashamed. I do know, however, that there are enormous expenses, and that the fund is not being expended on the objects for which it was gathered.. At a conference a promise was made that the money would be properly disbursed, and I draw attention to the matter now in the hope that Victoria may be placed on a par with New South Wales so far as the administration of the Patriotic Fund is concerned. Mr. JOSEPH Coox - I will take a note of what the honourable member has said. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.19 p.m. 1",43
