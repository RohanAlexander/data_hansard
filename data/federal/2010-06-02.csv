2,Ms ROXON,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill 2010 will amend the National Health Act 1953 (the Act) to achieve a more efficient and sustainable Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), better value for money for Australian taxpayers, and policy stability for the pharmaceutical sector. The bill underpins the Rudd government's commitment to reform of Australia's health system, by ensuring that every precious health dollar is used as effectively as possible. The bill also embodies an historic level of cooperation and collaboration between the government and the pharmaceutical industry, represented by Medicines Australia. Through jointly negotiating these reforms, the government and the industry will help ensure the sustainability of the PBS for years to come. The bill sets out new PBS pricing arrangements aimed at reducing growth in PBS expenditure, ensuring access to quality medicines at a lower cost to the taxpayer, and providing certainty to the pharmaceutical industry in relation to PBS pricing policy. The PBS plays a vital role in Australia's health system, particularly for the prevention and management of chronic disease, and for the treatment of life-threatening conditions. The PBS provides reliable and timely access to a wide range of medicines at a cost individuals and the community can afford. In the coming years, medicines will continue to be a significant and growing component of health expenditure. Since the previous major pricing reforms in 2007, the growth rate for PBS expenditure has increased from 4.3 per cent in 2006-07 to an estimated 10.5 per cent for the 2009-10 financial year. The report to parliament on the 2007 PBS reforms warned that the cost of the PBS is projected to grow significantly over the next few years. While those earlier reforms will provide more savings than originally estimated, these will be more than outweighed by higher growth in PBS costs. The PBS reform report estimates that PBS costs will reach $13 billion in 2018, compared to about $9 billion in 2010. For the PBS to continue to provide access to medicines, increases in costs need to be managed. The viability of the medicines industry in Australia also needs to be maintained. To this end, the government has entered into a four-year memorandum of understanding with Medicines Australia. Medicines Australia represents over 50 companies, which together account for 86 per cent of total annual PBS expenditure and nearly 60 per cent of sales of off-patent medicines. The memorandum of understanding (MOU) sets out the negotiated pricing reforms which are the subject of the bill, and the policy innovations that will be introduced to improve the pathway for subsidy of medicines under the PBS. Under the MOU, the government will provide the industry with pricing certainty over the next four years. In return menting new pricing arrangements that are the subject of this bill, the government will undertake not to introduce further new policy to generate price related savings from the PBS over the life of the MOU. This will provide stability to the industry, helping to ter investment and availability of new and innovative drugs in Australia, such as the $50 million biotech investment in Queensland recently announced by Eli Lilly. Further process and policy changes for the listing of PBS medicines under the MOU will reduce red tape and further foster the availability of new medicines in Australia. Under the MOU, the PBS will continue to support access to subsidies for new and innovative products. Price reductions are achieved as a result of competition between brands in the market, within a framework of policy certainty. These are good outcomes for all sectors of the medicines industry and for the Australian community in general. The amendments in this bill propose a significant broadening of current pricing arrangements which were originally introduced as part of the 2007 PBS reforms. The proposed changes to pricing policy recognise that competitive pricing already exists in the market for many PBS subsidised medicines. The changes acknowledge that Australian taxpayers should be benefiting from that competition and the lower prices that result from it. The principles which underpin existing price setting and maintenance mechanisms for PBS medicines will continue. In particular, the general separation of medicines between the pricing formularies for single brand drugs (F1), and drugs where there is competition (F2), will be maintained. The application of price disclosure will be accelerated and expanded to include all for imple- drugs in the F2 formulary. Price disclosure allows market forces to play a part in PBS pricing. Competition between pharmaceutical companies to gain market share for their products can result in significant discounting to pharmacies. The fosactual price of a brand of medicine may be much less than the government PBS subsidy price. Under price disclosure arrangements, pharmaceutical suppliers are required to advise the government of the price at which PBS medicines are sold into pharmacies. The information is used as the basis for possibly adjusting the price for all brands of a medicine to the weighted average price. Price disclosure ensures that, over time, government prices reflect more closely actual market prices. This is a fairer deal for taxpayers. Since it was first introduced in 2007, price disclosure has only been applied to medicines after a new brand lists. Under these further pricing reforms, price disclosure will become mandatory from 1 October 2010 for all drugs on the F2 formulary. This will increase the number of brands subject to price disclosure from 162 to over 1,600 brands. The bill also provides that, for the cycle commencing on 1 October 2010, an average price reduction of at least 23 per cent is to be achieved across all the brands in that cycle. These price reductions will occur on 1 April 2012 and represent a very large saving in PBS costs. In the event that the price reductions delivered under the normal operation of price disclosure do not yield an average of a 23 per cent price reduction across the formulary, prices for medicines in this cycle will be further reduced to achieve the required 23 per cent reduction overall. However, this provision will only apply to the price disclosure cycle commencing on 1 October 2010, and no medicine will be reduced to less than the lowest disclosed price for a brand of that medicine. Expanding price disclosure is a fair and equitable way of achieving value for money for PBS medicines. It allows competition to play a real part in pricing for the PBS and allows taxpayers to benefit from discounting practices in the market. Companies can continue to compete for market share for their products as prices are generally reduced to the weighted average price, and not the lowest price. In addition, under the further pricing reforms being introduced today, all medicines on F2 will experience a price reduction of two or five per cent on 1 February next year, 2011. The level of price reduction for each medicine reflects the level of discounting the medicine has been experiencing in the market. In a further reform, the price reduction that occurs when the first new brand of a PBS medicine is listed will increase from the current 12.5 per cent, to 16 per cent as of 1 February 2011. Medicines that have already taken a 12.5 per cent price reduction will not be required to take the balance of the 16 per cent price reduction. It is also important to note that the reforms embodied in this bill preserve features of the PBS that make it such a valued part of Australia's health system. Under the new pricing arrangements, medical practitioners will continue to be able to prescribe PBS medicines that are clinically appropriate. The robust process for listing new medicines on the PBS will continue. Only medicines recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, or PBAC, will be considered for listing by government. There will be no extra costs for patients. Some nonconcessional patients may pay less, for example, where price reductions cause the price of a medicine to fall below the general co-payment amount. My report to parliament on the 2007 PBS reforms estimated that consumers will benefit from those reforms via direct reductions in prices for some prescriptions by $600 to $800 million over the ten years to 2018. The additional direct saving to consumers from these new measures is independently estimated to double this previous estimate and to save general patients on average almost $3.00 per prescription. To support awareness of brand choice under the PBS, the government will invest $10 million, through the National Prescribing Service, to provide factual information to inform consumers that generic medicines are an equal choice in terms of quality and effectiveness, and that some brands of a medicine may cost less than others. The bill does not prevent the generic medicines industry from competing for a growing share of PBS scripts. In 2008-09, member companies of the Generic Medicines Industry Association had a share of 33.8 per cent of PBS scripts, up from 27 per cent in 2005-06. Generic manufacturers will also benefit from some $2.3 billion worth of medicines coming off patent over the next 12 years. The proposed amendments to the act will also streamline the way drugs are listed for supply under section 100 arrangements. Section 100 of the National Health Act applies to certain specialised medicines with specific supply arrangements, such as chemotherapy or HIV-AIDS medicines. The amendments will make clear how general PBS provisions apply to drugs supplied under those arrangements. The power to make special arrangements under section 100 will be clarified and broadened. The wider scope of section 100 will mean arrangements such as the revised Intravenous Chemotherapy Supply Program announced in the 2010-11 budget can be made. Under the new chemotherapy arrangements, the method for supply and pricing of combinations of vials required for single infusions will reduce unnecessary wastage of these expensive chemotherapy drugs. As a result, savings of around $75.4 million are expected over the next four years. In addition, the bill contains provisions that address gaps in the current PBS prescription data captured by Medicare Australia. Currently, community and hospital pharmacies supplying PBS medicines only provide data for PBS prescriptions for which the Commonwealth pays a subsidy. The changes being introduced will result in data also being provided for prescriptions when a subsidy is not paid-that is, under copayment data. For these ‘under co-payment' prescriptions, the cost to patients is below the co-payment amount, currently $33.30 for general patients. The collection of this information, in common with all other PBS prescription data, will give the PBAC and others a more complete picture of PBS medicine prescribing, dispensing and usage. Provision for this change is also included under the Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement announced in this year's budget. This bill also makes explicit price reductions related to the 25 per cent staged tions that were put in place at the time of the 2007 PBS reform. Price reductions required on listing of a new brand of a drug affected by staged reductions are currently occurring administratively and through serial amendments to regulations. Including these reductions in the act will make the provisions clearer for industry and easier to administer. In conclusion, the reforms in this bill provide a firm basis for achieving a more efficient and sustainable PBS while, at the same time, providing a period of certainty to industry in relation to medicines pricing policy. The reforms have been collaboratively and closely negotiated with the pharmaceutical industry to provide benefits for taxpayers and stability for the sector. I would like to acknowledge the important role of Medicines Australia in developing this package of reforms for the benefit of all Australians. Consumers will pay no more for their medicines, and some may pay less. A choice of medicines and brands will still be available. Medical practitioners will be able to prescribe medicines that are clinically appropriate. Australians will benefit as consumers and taxpayers from a more sustainable PBS through lower prices for medicines and access to new medicines sooner. I commend the bill to the House.

Second Reading",17
3,Mr MCCLELLAND,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Introduction The Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Bill 2010, together with the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2010, implements legislative elements of Australia's Human Rights Framework, which was released on 21 April 2010. Members will recall that the National Human Rights Committee, chaired by Father Frank Brennan, was asked to seek the Australian community's views about three fundamental questions: - which human rights and responsibilities should be protected and promoted? - are these human rights currently being sufficiently protected and promoted? - how could Australia better protect and promote human rights? The committee was asked to report back to government on options to enhance the promotion and protection of human rights. There was no predetermined outcome. The only requirement in the terms of reference was that the options should preserve the sovereignty of parliament and not include a constitutionally entrenched bill of rights. Indeed, the committee reported back to government with a number of options to promote and protect human rights, and I specifically thank the work of that committee. I am proud of the government's framework which reflects key recommendations of the committee's report. The changes in the framework are aimed at enhancing understanding of and respect for human rights in Australia and ensuring appropriate recognition of human rights issues in legislative and policy development. The government believes it can implement these changes without enacting a charter of rights. What does this mean in practice? First, the committee emphasised the importance of human rights education as the highest priority. The framework implements a range of measures to enhance education in our community, including in schools. We have committed resourcing to the Australian Human Rights Commission to enhance its role in community engagement and education and we have provided resourcing for nongovernment organisations to engage and inform the community about human rights. We will also invest in education and training programs for the Australian Public Service. In terms of the public sector, most of the day-today interactions people have with the government of the day take place through our Public Service. We are fortunate to have a highly educated and competent Public Service. And I think that most people would acknowledge the importance of having a Public Service that is genuinely focused on the interests of the public that it serves. As a government, we are focused on influencing the culture and practice of decision makers, policy developers and law-makers at the starting point in the development of policy and laws and creating an appreciation as to how laws impact on the individuals to which the laws apply. This bill includes measures which will mean that the executive in proposing legislation and the parliament in considering legislation will have greater regard to the impact of laws on the rights of citizens. Broad aims of the bill The government believes that it is important to ensure that Australia's domestic laws comply with our international obligationsparticularly those that protect fundamental rights and freedoms. Australia is party to the seven core United Nations treaties that protect human rights. The government believes that Australia can and should live up to its obligations under these treaties not simply because this is the right thing to do but because the principles contained in those documents provide a protection against unwarranted, unjustified or arbitrary interference with the fundamental rights enjoyed by all people irrespective of their colour, background or social status. The bill contains two important measures that are designed to improve parliamentary scrutiny of new laws for consistency with Australia's human rights obligations and to encourage early and ongoing consideration of human rights issues in policy and legislative development. Essentially the implementation of these two measures-that is, statements of compatibility on human rights and a new Joint Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights-establishes a dialogue between the executive, the parliament and ultimately the citizens of Australia. First, the requirement of a statement of compatibility on human rights will establish a dialogue between the executive that is proposing the legislative action and the parliament that is considering the proposed action whereby members and senators will be specifically informed of human rights considerations so they are able to consider the impact of proposed legislation on the rights of people and families back in their electorates. And in turn, the new parliamentary committee will be able to establish a dialogue between the parliament and citizens of Australia whereby the members of the new joint committee will be able to canvass the views of the public as to how they will be affected by proposed legislation. In that sense, these measures incrementally advance the concept of participatory democracy in Australia by providing additional means for citizens to have direct input into the legislative process. It is appropriate at this point to provide brief overview to set out more precisely how these measures will operate in practice. Joint Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights The first of these measures is to establish a new Joint Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights. As I have already indicated, parliamentary committees perform an important role in ensuring transparency and accountability in the legislative process. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights will be the first parliamentary committee at the federal level dedicated entirely to human rights scrutiny. The reference point for the committee will be the rights and freedoms recognised or declared by the seven core United Nations human rights treaties as they apply to Australia. The treaties are: - International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination - International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights - International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights - Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women - Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment - Convention on the Rights of the Child, and - Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The new committee will examine and report to parliament on compatibility of bills and legislative instruments with Australia's hua man rights obligations under these seven human rights treaties. It will also be able to examine existing legislation. Consistent with other committees, the powers and proceedings of the committee are to be determined by resolution of both houses of parliament. As I have already flagged, it is proposed that the committee will have broad powers to seek submissions, hold public hearings and examine witnesses. The committee will also be able to conduct broad inquiries into matters relating to human rights referred to it by the Attorney-General of the day. Statements of Compatibility The second measure is to introduce a requirement for statements assessing compatibility with human rights to accompany all new bills and disallowable legislative instruments. Compatibility with human rights will be assessed against the rights and freedoms in the seven core human rights instruments to which Australia is a party and which I have identified. Statements of compatibility will ensure human rights analysis is undertaken by the executive at an early stage when developing legislation. It also provides a reference point for parliament's consideration of bills and legislative instruments. The statements will alert parliament to the relevant human rights considerations in a particular bill or disallowable instrument and will inform parliamentary debate. As with explanatory memoranda, which assist in explaining the purpose and intent of the legislation, statements of compatibility will contextualise human rights considerations. Where appropriate, statements may justify restrictions or limitations on rights where such restrictions are in the interests of other individuals or society more generally as consistent with Australia's responsibilities. For instance, citizens have a right to live free from fear, violence, intimidation or abuse, and the government has a corresponding responsibility to take all reasonable measures to ensure that occurs and that citizens receive that necessary protection. It is the case that in achieving that outcome of protecting citizens, clearly it may be necessary to take action against those who would abuse the rights of their fellow citizens. Statements of compatibility will also aid the consideration of relevant human rights issues by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights. After enactment, statements of compatibility may also be of assistance to the courts. Currently, in determining the meaning of provisions in the event of ambiguity, a court may refer to other material considered by parliament in the passage of legislation. This includes accompanying explanatory memoranda, second reading speeches and parliamentary committee reports. A statement of compatibility and a report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, while not binding on a court or tribunal, could be used by the court or tribunal to assist in ascertaining the meaning of provisions in a statute where the meaning is unclear or ambiguous. By these measures, the parliament will be empowered through its response to a minister's statement and any committee report, to give more precise guidance to the courts as to the legislature's intention in enacting legislation in the context of Australia's human rights obligations. These statements do not create new rights. The courts will have no additional powers to strike down or amend legislation. Conclusion These measures are about ensuring that the business of government as a matter of practice and culture considers how its legislation impacts on the rights of the people of Australia. As mentioned, that is not to say that there won't be decisions for government to make which require a balancing of competing interests. Individuals have rights and they also have responsibilities. Individual rights need to be contextualised against those responsibilities and the broader rights of a safe and effectively functioning society. Early and ongoing consideration of human rights issues in the policy and law-making process and informing parliamentary debate on human rights issues will make positive changes for the relevance of legislation and the parliamentary process to the lives of our fellow Australians. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mrs Gash) adjourned. HUMAN RIGHTS (PARLIAMENTARY SCRUTINY) (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2010 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr MCClelland. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",20
4,Mr MCCLELLAND,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Introduction The Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2010, together with the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Bill 2010, implements legislative elements of Australia's Human Rights Framework, which was released on 21 April 2010. The Commonwealth has a comprehensive and extensive framework for independent review of administrative decisions. The Administrative Review Council is an independent body established to review and inquire into the Commonwealth administrative law system and recommend improvements that might be made to the system. The proposed amendments will ensure an appropriate human rights perspective is integrated in the views of the Administrative Review Council by including the President of the Australian Human Rights Commission as an ex officio member of the council. Much of the business of government is delivered through the Public Service, whose decisions are reviewable by administrative law. As part of promoting incremental change to enhance the responsiveness of our Public Service to the rights of citizens, it is appropriate to have human rights considerations taken into account in the further development of the administrative law framework. In addition, the proposed amendments will integrate statements of compatibility into existing procedures for tabling legislative instruments. This package of reforms, along with the other changes in the framework, will inform parliamentary consideration of human rights and enhance the understanding of and respect for human rights in Australia. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mrs Gash) adjourned. NA (SONS OF GWALIA) BILL 2010 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Bowen. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",24
5,Mr BOWEN,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"Prospect-Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law and Minister for Human Services) (9.30 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Today I introduce a bill which will amend the Corporations Act to reform the treatment of shareholder claims against companies that become insolvent. This bill gives effect to the government's decision to reverse the outcome of the High Court's decision in the Sons of Gwalia v Margaretic case. The bill also introduces reforms relating to notices to creditors and shareholder voting, and clarifies the position of shareholders bringing claims for damages against companies. To the ultimate benefit of both shareholders and creditors, this bill will remove an area of uncertainty that currently results in higher finance costs for business. It will also reduce the costs and complexity associated with running insolvency administrations. The bill contains three primary measures. Firstly, the bill amends section 563A of the Corporations Act to provide that all claims in relation to the buying, selling, holding or otherwise dealing with shares are to be ranked equally-and after all other creditors' claims. In January 2010, I announced the government's decision to introduce legislation to reverse the effect of the High Court's decision in Sons of Gwalia v Margaretic. The High Court in Sons of Gwalia determined that section 563A, as it is currently worded, did not subordinate certain compensation claims by shareholders below the claims of other creditors. Prior to Sons of Gwalia, the common understanding was that all shareholder claims against a company in external administration that related to a shareholding, were made in the ‘capacity as a member of the company' and were postponed by operation of section 563A of the Corporations Act. Investors make a conscious decision to invest money in a company in the hope of sharing in the company's profits. In doing so, they are entitled to expect proper disclosure from the company. But they must also accept that they are taking a risk in making that investment. In contrast, creditors are not hoping to increase their wealth by gambling on the future profitability of a company. They are often small businesses or trade creditors who are simply owed money for work they have already done, or for materials they have supplied. Investors who have been misled into making that investment should rightly be able to claim redress. However, they should not be able to do so to the detriment of creditors in terms of receiving distributions when a company is insolvent. The provision, as it is currently interpreted, has the effect of undermining the traditional distinction between debt and equity. The decision in Sons of Gwalia has had the effect of shifting the losses suffered by shareholders (due to a company's misleading conduct or non-disclosure) to the company's unsecured creditors. By reducing the likely return to unsecured lenders in an insolvency, the Sons of Gwalia decision has had the effect of increasing the cost of unsecured debt and of reducing the availability of credit, particularly for less well-established companies. Secondly, the bill streamlines the treatment of shareholder claimants in an external administration. Persons bringing claims regarding shareholdings will not vote as creditors in a voluntary administration or a winding up unless they receive permission from the court. They will also not receive reports to creditors unless they first make a request for such to the external administrator. Thirdly, the bill eliminates certain residual common law restrictions on the capacity of a shareholder to recover damages against a company. The 1880 House of Lords decision in Houldsworth v City of Glasgow Bank determined that a person who has subscribed for shares in a company may not, while they retain those shares, recover damages against the company on the ground that they were induced by the company to subscribe for those shares by fraud or misrepresentation. Although case law in Australia has subsequently limited the reach of this decision, there are still situations where a shareholder may unfairly be prevented from suing for damages. The application of the old rule is limited, uncertain and difficult for stakeholders to comprehend. I note that, in the United Kingdom, the rule was excluded in all cases by the Companies Act 2006 (UK). The Ministerial Council for Corporations has been consulted and has approved the amendments contained in this bill. The global financial crisis highlighted the importance of addressing any impediments to companies accessing reasonably priced credit. These reforms restore the order of priority for distributions of assets in corporate insolvencies to the position that was understood to exist prior to the Sons of Gwalia judgment. In doing so, they improve access by companies to credit, ensuring continued employment, entrepreneurialism and economic growth. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mrs Gash) adjourned. CRIMES AMENDMENT (ROYAL FLYING DOCTOR SERVICE) BILL 2010 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Brendan O'Connor. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",25
6,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia is one of the largest and most comprehensive aeromedical organisations in the world. The Royal Flying Doctor Service (the RFDS) delivers vital health care and emergency services to people living, working and travelling in rural and remote parts of Australia. As part of this service, the RFDS administers the medical chest program. These medical chests contain a range of pharmaceutical items, including pain relief drugs such as pethidine and morphine. The chests are an important tool, enabling the RFDS medical practitioners to treat people on site for many conditions and provide necessary treatment, including pain relief, for those requiring emergency evacuation. The availability of medical chests provides enormous comfort to those living in the outback. The RFDS and its agents currently supply and maintain approximately 2,600 medical chests across the country, including those located in national parks, remote homesteads, pastoral stations, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, outback schools and mining exploration sites. The RFDS regularly reviews the contents of the chests to ensure relevance and currency of pharmaceuticals. Without the supply and maintenance of these medical chests by the Royal Flying Doctor Service, pharmaceutical treatment, including pain relief in emergency situations, for people in remote Australia would be unavailable. Until recently, pharmaceuticals for these medical chests were distributed utilising Australia Post. These deliveries have ceased following the discovery, early this year, that this practice contravenes section 85W of the Crimes Act 1914. Section 85W of the Crimes Act makes it an offence for Australia Post or the Royal Flying Doctor Service to arrange for the distribution of pharmaceuticals containing prescribed narcotic substances. This is because section 85W contains an offence for intentionally causing to carry by post an article that consists of, encloses or contains a ‘prescribed narcotic substance' within the meaning of the Customs Act 1901. Because ‘carried by post' is defined in section 85E of the Crimes Act to mean ‘carried by or through Australia Post', the offence in section 85W applies uniquely to persons arranging for the delivery of these articles by Australia Post. The government understands that there are no viable alternatives to Australia Post for supplying medicines for the RFDS medical chest program. Australia Post is the only delivery provider servicing many remote locations. Therefore, an urgent amendment will address the risk of emergency medicines not being available to treat serious illness or injury in rural and remote areas of Australia. This bill will allow Australia Post and the RFDS to lawfully provide for the supply of medicines through Australia Post under its medical chest program. The bill amends section 85W of the Crimes Act to insert an exception to the offence of ‘causing narcotic substances to be carried by post'. This exception will apply to Australia Post, the Royal Flying Doctor Service and their officers, employees, agents and contractors. The exception allows those organisations to arrange for the carriage of prescription and non-prescription medicine by Australia Post. The bill provides a specific requirement that the exception will only apply to conduct engaged in by any person for the purpose of enabling the Royal Flying Doctor Service to administer its medical chest program. This provides an important safeguard, ensuring that the exceptions to the offence of carrying narcotic substances by post are restricted to the purpose of the Royal Flying Doctor Service medical chest program. The bill also amends section 85W to apply the offence in subsection 85W(1) to the controlled drugs and controlled plants listed in part 9.1 of the Criminal Code, rather than to ‘prescribed narcotic substances, within the meaning of the Customs Act 1901'. The definition of the term ‘prescribed narcotic substance' was repealed in 1990 and, due to an oversight, section 85W was not updated to take account of this repeal. This amendment will address this oversight by giving effect, as closely as possible, to the original policy intention behind the offence in section 85W. Applying the offence to the lists of ‘controlled drugs' and ‘controlled plants' in the Criminal Code will ensure that the offence has similar coverage to the domestic drug offences in the code, to which those lists apply, and to the original section 85W offence. This bill will remove any legislative impediments to the lawful delivery and maintenance of medical chests to rural and remote Australia. The retrospective application of the exemption will also ensure that those persons involved in administering the medical chest program are protected from prosecution under section 85W for conduct engaged in before the commencement of the amendment. I commend this bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mrs Gash) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (CLOSE OF ROLLS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL (NO. 2) First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Gray, for Mr Byrne. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",26
7,Mr GRAY,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Brand-Parliamentary Secretary for Western and Northern Australia) (9.42 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. I am pleased to present legislation to meet two of the government's 2007 election commitments. This bill contains two schedules that will: - restore the close of rolls period to seven days after the issue of the writ for an election; and - repeal the requirement for provisional voters to provide evidence of identity. Schedule 1-close of the rolls Schedule 1 to the bill deals with the close of the rolls for an election. There is a deadline for every federal election after which the roll will be ‘closed' for an election. This is known as the ‘close of the rolls' and specifies the date after which no additions or deletions can be made to the electoral roll. The certified list of voters for an election is a list of persons who enrolled or updated their details before the close of the rolls deadline. The amendments proposed by schedule 1 implement one of the government's pre-election commitments to restore the close of rolls period to seven days after the issue of the writ for an election. This amendment will provide sufficient time for new voters to enrol to vote for a federal election or existing electors to update their address details with the AEC. Schedule 2-evidence of identity and provisional votes 2010 Schedule 2 to the bill repeals the requirement for provisional voters to provide evidence of identity. Provisional votes are a type of declaration vote cast by an elector at a polling place on polling day. The Electoral Act and the referendum act currently specify that a person who needs to cast a provisional vote at a polling place on polling day must provide a polling official with evidence of identity at the time of voting or by the first Friday following the polling day. If the elector does not provide such evidence of identity by the deadline, his or her provisional vote will not be counted. The AEC estimates that over 27,000 provisional votes were excluded from the count at the 2007 federal election due to the operation of the existing evidence of identity provisions. In accordance with the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters recommendation 2, the bill will repeal the requirement for voters casting a provisional vote to provide evidence of identity and will instead insert the new requirement that, where there is any doubt as to the bona fides of the elector, the signature on the envelope containing a provisional vote be compared with the signature of the elector on previously lodged enrolment records. The amendments in schedules 1 and 2 to the bill implement recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters supported by the government as necessary to provide eligible electors with the greatest opportunity to enrol and vote in an election - allow the Australian Electoral CommisConclusion The government is committed to removing the barriers that prevent Australians from voting by: - restoring the close of rolls period to seven days after the issue of the writ; and - repealing requirements for provisional voters to provide evidence of identity. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mrs Gash) adjourned.

8,Mr GRAY,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Brand-Parliamentary Secretary for Western and Northern Australia) (9.47 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. I am pleased to present legislation that will bring real reform to the key provision in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Electoral Act) and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 (the referendum act). Three of the four schedules implement the government response to recommendations made by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters following their inquiry into the conduct of the 2007 federal election (the JSCEM report). These amendments will: - modernise enrolment processes to enable electors to update their enrolment details electronically; sion (the AEC) to manage its workload more efficiently by enabling enrolment transactions to be processed outside the division for which the person is enrolling; - enable prepoll votes cast in an elector's ‘home' division to be cast and counted as ordinary votes; and - provide a legislative framework for people who are blind or who have low vision to cast an independent and secret vote. Schedule 3 deals with an issue that emerged at the 2009 Bradfield by-election and relates to multiple candidates being endorsed for a single division by the registered officer of a political party. This bill contains amendments that will prevent the registered officer of a political party endorsing more than one candidate for each division. The overriding aim of the amendments in the bill is to enhance the ability of otherwise eligible Australians to participate in the electoral process by removing obstacles to their enrolment. The Electoral Act currently contains a number of hurdles to facilitating modern and technologically up-to-date interaction between the AEC and eligible electors. Of particular concern are the estimated 1.4 million eligible electors currently not on the electoral roll, with up to two-thirds of the missing electors falling in the 18to 39-year age group. It is intended that the amendments introduced in the bill will address declining enrolment rates and improve electoral participation in this age group, and more generally, by enabling flexible and modern interaction between eligible electors and the AEC. Schedule 1-‘home' division prepoll votes as ordinary votes The amendments contained in schedule 1 to the bill will enable prepoll votes issued in an elector's ‘home' division to be cast and counted as ordinary votes, wherever practicable. The Electoral Act and the referendum act provide for prepoll voting to take place prior to polling day. This provides electors who have specified other commitments to meet their voting obligations by voting early. Recent elections have seen a large increase in the demand for early voting; at the 2007 federal election almost 15 per cent of the total votes were cast as early votes. The increase in demand for early voting has two major consequences. First, it requires the AEC to devote significant increased resources to deal with early voting as more resources are required to issue and count this type of vote. Second, the results an election are more likely to be delayed as the counting of these early votes generally does not take place on polling night as the declaration envelopes containing the votes must go through a time-consuming preliminary scrutiny process. The bill provides for prepoll votes cast in an elector's home division, prior to polling day, to be treated as ordinary votes wherever practicable. An elector's home division is the division in which the elector is enrolled. For electors to cast prepoll votes in this manner, it will be conditional upon the electors to make a declaration at the time of voting indicating that they are entitled to a prepoll and each elector's name being marked off the certified list. This will ensure that the integrity of this type of vote is maintained. Votes cast as ordinary votes in an elector's home division will, for counting purposes, be treated in the same manner as ordinary votes cast in polling places on polling day. The AEC estimates that if this amendment had been in place for the 2007 federal election it would have resulted in an additional 667,000 votes being counted on polling night. Schedule 2-efficient management of AEC workload and electronic address update Schedule 2 to the bill contains amendments that can be grouped into two main themes. The first theme provides for the efficient and effective management of the AEC workload. The second theme enables electors to update their address details electronically. Recommendation 42 of the JSCEM report recommends that the Electoral Act should be amended to enable the AEC to manage its workload in non-election periods by allocating work, principally enrolment applications and enrolment changes, throughout the AEC divisional office network. The Electoral Act as it currently stands provides that such of workload sharing can only take place during the election period. There is no apparent rationale for limiting the operation of the workload sharing to the election period. Expanding this ability will result in a number of benefits to electors and reduce handling times. Such changes will allow the AEC to manage its workload more efficiently by enabling enrolment transactions to be processed outside the relevant division. These amendments will provide the AEC with additional tools to maintain the electoral roll in a timely and efficient manner. These changes will ensure that the Elecvote toral Commissioner has the obligation to receive and action any enrolment related transactions rather than only the divisional returning officer or the Australian electoral officer. The Electoral Commissioner will then use an enhanced delegation power to delegate the processing of the transactions to any AEC officer or member of staff, which may include divisional returning officers and Australian electoral officers. The second theme of amendments in schedule 2 provide for modern enrolment processes to enable electors to update their address details electronically. Despite recent trends encouraging Australians to communicate with government agencies electronically, the Electoral Act still requires voters complete and sign paper forms when enrolling or updating their enrolment details. These forms are then required to be sent to the AEC by post to be entered into the electronic database used to maintain the electoral roll. These amendments give effect to recommendation 9 of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters report and will enable persons who are already on the electoral roll to update their address details by providing this information to the AEC in an electronic format. In addition to the requirement that the person is already on the electoral roll, the bill foreshadows the making of regulations which will prescribe minimum verification information that the elector will need to provide to the AEC before the Electoral Commissioner can act on the electronic communication. The regulations will enable the AEC to request prescribed information from electors, for example date of birth and drivers licence number, to ensure that the electronic transaction is authentic and is being undertaken by the elector to whom the information relates. These amendments will facilitate the maintenance of an effective electoral roll by enabling voters to communicate with the AEC by electronic means rather than by written hardcopy forms. Schedule 3-Limitation on the number of endorsed candidates per division Schedule 3 to the bill contains reforms which will restrict the number of candidates that can be endorsed by a political party in any one division. At the by-election in the division of Bradfield on 5 December 2009 there were 22 candidates, nine of whom were endorsed by a registered officer of a single registered political party. The ability for a registered officer of a poto litical party to endorse candidates for an election was introduced into the Electoral Act in 1987 to provide a streamlined way for political parties to nominate candidates. If not endorsed by a registered political party, a person seeking to be a candidate for an election must obtain the support of 50 electors in the division in which the person is seeking to nominate. The current provisions of the Electoral Act do not prohibit political parties from endorsing more than one candidate in each division for an election. For a voter to cast a formal vote they are required to number a ballot paper from ‘1' to the number of candidates on the ballot paper without errors in the numbering sequence. At the above mentioned by-election for the division of Bradfield the rate of informal votes was nine per cent. This is a record for any election for the division of Bradfield and more than double the informality rate for the division at the 2007 federal election. The average national informality rate at the 2007 federal election was 3.95 per cent. The practice of multiple candidates for a single division being endorsed by the registered officer of a political party has not emerged on this scale prior to the 2009 Bradfield by-election. Legislative amendment is required to prevent a similar rise in the informality rate in multiple divisions at the next federal election. Schedule 4-Electronically assisted voting for people who are blind or have low vision Schedule 4 to the bill will provide a mechanism for people who are blind or have low vision to cast an independent and secret vote. Without the amendments in schedule 4 there is no provision in the Electoral Act or the referendum act for such voters to cast a secret vote. The amendments in schedule 4 provide a framework for the making of regulations that will provide for a flexible regime of electronic voting while maintaining the integrity of the voting process. This approach provides the flexibility to amend the mechanics of the electronically assisted voting process as technology changes from election to election. The integrity of the voting process is ensured in the amendments as any regulations made under the amendment may include: - a process for casting an electronically assisted vote; - methods to ensure the privacy, secrecy and integrity of the vote; - places, days and hours at which the electronically assisted vote will be available; - recording of each person who has been issued with a vote; and - recording of the vote and how this vote record will be treated. Conclusion The government is committed to restoring the integrity of our electoral processes and systems. The first step in that process was the introduction of the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Political Donations and Other Measures) Bill 2008, and the subsequent 2009 bill, which aimed to restore accountability, integrity and transparency to our system of donation disclosure. Unfortunately, those provisions have been blocked by the Senate. The reforms contained in this bill will continue the important process of updating the Commonwealth Electoral Act. I comment the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mrs Gash) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (MODERNISATION AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2010 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Gray, for Mr Byrne. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",29
9,Mr GRAY,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Brand-Parliamentary Secretary for Western and Northern Australia) (9.58 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. I am pleased to present a bill that brings much needed reform to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Electoral Act) and the Referendum Machinery Provisions Act 1984 (the referendum act). The bill: - repeals redundant provisions; gives the Electoral Commissioner flexibility rather than prescription; and - places more technological tools at the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) disposal so that the AEC can continue to deliver the best enrolment and election practices. The majority of reforms in this bill are based on unanimously supported recommendations of the report by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters following its inquiry into the 2007 federal election (JSCEM report). Schedule 1-Publishing forms and information about places to vote The Electoral Act and the referendum act currently require information such as the location of polling places and the various enrolment forms to be published in the Gazette. The requirement to gazette this information is intended to provide transparency in the electoral process and ensure that members of the public have access to such information. In recognition of the trend for people to use technology and websites to interact with government, schedule 1 provides for the publication of electoral information on the AEC's website. These amendments will give effect to recommendation 41 of the JSCEM report. Schedule 2-Evidence of identity for enrolment Schedule 2 amends the evidence of identity requirements for enrolment. The amendments require a person making an application for enrolment, or a person changing their name, to provide evidence of identity with their enrolment application. Such persons may provide any one of the following forms of evidence of identity: - driver's licence number; - passport number; or - the signature of a person currently electoral roll who attests to the identity of the person. If an elector is simply changing his or her address details then evidence of identity is not required. These amendments give effect to the unanimously supported recommendation 7 of the JSCEM report. Schedule 3-Age 16 enrolment Currently a person who is 17 years of age may provisionally enrol. These electors will automatically attain full enrolment on their 18th birthday. Provisional enrolment is voluntary. The AEC has found that provisional enrolment for such people allows the AEC to target enrolment of young people in schools, educational institutions and youth events. Schedule 3 reduces the age of provisional enrolment from 17 years to 16 years of age. Schedule 4-Electoral rolls, related lists and ballot papers Schedule 4 makes four sets of amendments relating to the use of technology in elections and election related matters. First, the amendments provide for senators and members to receive electoral roll information in electronic form. This amendment is based on the unanimously supported recommendation 50 of the JSCEM report. Second, the amendments provide for the use of electronic certified lists. An electronic certified list will be known as an ‘approved list'. The approved list will be required to be approved by the Electoral Commissioner and will contain the same information as the certified list. Electronic approved lists and hard copy certified lists may be used at the same polling place. This amendment implements the unanimously supported recommendation on the 43 of the JSCEM report. Third, the amendments remove the technical requirement for ballot papers to be ‘overprinted'. This requirement is replaced by the requirement for ballot papers to contain a feature approved by the Electoral Commissioner. This amendment gives effect to the unanimously supported recommendation 38 of the JSCEM report Finally, schedule 4 amends the process of authenticating ballot papers by a divisional returning officer. A divisional returning offireform cer will be required to mark a ballot paper that he or she believes is authentic with the words ‘I am satisfied that this ballot paper an authentic ballot paper on which a voter has marked a vote.' This amendment implements the unanimously supported recommendation 37 of the JSCEM report. Schedule 5-Mobile polling The Electoral Act and the referendum act currently provide for mobile polling to be conducted at special hospitals, prisons and remote divisions, with specific provisions applicable to each type of mobile polling. To provide for consistent mobile polling arrangements, schedule 5 consolidates the various mobile polling provisions into a single mobile polling provision. In general, schedule 5 provides for mobile polling to be conducted on polling day and the 12 days prior to polling day. The Electoral Commissioner is given the power to determine the places at which mobile polling can be conducted. The Electoral Commissioner will publish information about the availability of mobile polling on the AEC's website and by any other means deemed appropriate. The practical process of issuing pers remains unchanged. These amendments are based on the unanimously supported recommendations 18, 20, 28, 29 and 30 of the JSCEM report. The amendments differ from the recommendations as they will provide for a single mobile polling provision that allows the delivery of mobile polling where and when it is needed. Schedule 6-Postal voting Schedule 6 provides four reforms to postal voting. First, schedule 6 removes the requirement that a postal vote application be signed by an applicant and a witness. This enables postal vote applications to be lodged online or electronically and reduces potential delays in the delivery of postal vote is applications. The amendments require an elector making an application for a postal vote to make a declaration that he or she is entitled to make an application. Second, schedule 6 prohibits extraneous material being attached to, or incorporated into, a blank postal vote application form. It is currently common practice for political parties and candidates to undertake large scale reproduction and distribution of their own version of the official AEC postal vote application. These amendments prohibit the inclusion of extraneous material, including political material, being attached to, or incorporated into, a postal vote application. However, extraneous material may be included in an envelope along with the postal vote application. Third, the amendments require a completed postal vote application be returned directly to the AEC. To avoid delays in the issue and return of postal vote applications, these amendments provide that postal vote applications must be returned directly to the AEC. This is intended to ensure that the application is not returned via a third party, ballot pa- including a political party. Finally, the amendments introduce a new requirement for both the elector and the witness to make a written declaration that the requirements for completing the ballot paper were completed before the close of the poll. The amendments also provide for the date of the witness signature on the postal vote to be the determining date for completion of the postal vote, rather than the postmark on the certificate. These amendments are based on the unanimously supported recommendations 5, 6 and 33 of the JSCEM report. The amendments differ from recommendation 33 as they require the completed postal vote application to be returned directly to the AEC and prevent extraneous material being included on, or affixed to, a postal vote application. The intention is for schedule 6 to commence at the default time of six months after royal assent. Schedule 7-Other amendments relating to rolls and enrolment Schedule 7 amends enrolment practices and the provision of roll information. The Electoral Act requires a version of the electoral roll to be publicly available for viewing. Schedule 7 clarifies that there is no right to copy or record by electronic means the publicly available roll. This amendment is based on the unanimously supported recommendation 53 of the JSCEM report. The AEC maintains the electoral roll for federal elections and also state and territory elections under ‘joint roll arrangements'. The AEC collects information from every eligible elector and then forwards that information to the relevant state or territory. Schedule 7 provides for a regime under which the roll information provided to the states and territories may be used for additional purposes. The regime provides for regulations to prescribe the purposes for which roll information may be used, for example, the compilation of jury lists. This amendment is based on the unanimously supported recommendation 44 of the JSCEM report. Finally, schedule 7 introduces specific provisions to facilitate enrolment and continued enrolment for people who are experiencing homelessness. A person experiencing homelessness will not lose their itinerant elector enrolment because he or she has been living in crisis or transitional accommodation for one month or longer. In addition, a person experiencing homelessness will not automatically be removed from the electoral roll if they do not vote at a general election. This amendment implements the unanimously supported recommendation 19 of the JSCEM report. Schedule 8-Eligibility for early voting Prepoll voting and postal voting are known as ‘early voting'. An elector who wishes to cast an early vote must apply and make a declaration that they are eligible for such a vote. Once the elector has made such a declaration the elector is issued with ballot papers. Schedule 8 implements the unanimously supported recommendations 25 and 26 of the JSCEM report. The amendments provide two additional grounds upon which an elector may apply for an early vote. First, throughout the hours of polling on polling day, the elector will be absent from his or her division. Second, the elector will be unable to attend a polling booth on polling day due to a fear for his or her personal safety or well-being. Schedule 9-Minor technical amendments Schedule 9 makes several minor technical amendments to: - remove gender specific language; - amend incorrect cross references; and - provide for consistent use of terminology. The amendments in schedule 9 do not affect the voting or enrolment rights and obligations of electors. Conclusion Taken together these amendments provide the AEC with the necessary flexibility and technological tools needed to deliver modern electoral practices for the benefit of all electors. The reforms are significant, and they are overdue. This bill demonstrates the government's continuing commitment to update the Electoral Act and the referendum act for the benefit of all electors. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Billson) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (HOW-TO-VOTE CARDS AND OTHER MEASURES) First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Gray, for Mr Byrne. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",32
10,Mr GRAY,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Brand-Parliamentary Secretary for Western and Northern Australia) (10.10 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill implements two amendments relating to the important area of electoral advertising generally. First, it regulates the authorisation of how-to-vote cards to make it clear who will benefit from the preference flow suggested on the how-to-vote card. Second, the bill prohibits a person from causing to be printed, published or distributed including by ‘radio, television, internet or telephone' anything that may mislead or deceive an elector in relation to how to cast a vote. Schedule 1-How-to-vote cards Schedule 1 to the bill expands the authorisation requirements on how-to-vote cards. As how-to-vote cards are a subset of electoral advertising they are currently regulated under section 328 of the Electoral Act. In general terms, this means that how-to-vote cards must contain the name and address of the person who authorised the card and the name and place of business of the printer. This authorisation information is currently required at the end of the how-to-vote card. The amendments proposed by schedule 1 will provide specific and expanded authorisation requirements for how-to-vote cards and introduce two new offences for a breach of the authorisation requirements. How-to-vote cards will be required to include at the top of each printed face the name and address of the person who authorised the BILL 2010 how-to-vote card. If the how-to-vote card is authorised on behalf of a registered political party, the card must include the name of the registered political party. If the how-to-vote card is authorised on behalf of a candidate who is not endorsed by a registered political party, the card must include the name of the candidate and the word ‘candidate' printed next to the name. The authorisation must conform to certain requirements in relation to the size of the characters in the authorisation. This amendment is intended to ensure that the authorisation is clearly visible and identifiable to electors. The amendments make it an offence for a person to publish or distribute a how-to-vote card that does not comply with the authorisation requirements. The penalty is 10 penalty units. There is a further offence for a person who publishes or distributes a how-to-vote card with false authorisation details. The penalty is 10 penalty units. The government is mindful of the views expressed by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its report on the 1998 election. That report concluded that how-tovote cards serve a useful purpose to inform voters, enable the franchise and minimise informal votes. Consistent with these views, the measures in schedule 1 to the bill are aimed at ensuring voters are clearly advised of the source of the how-to-vote cards before casting their votes. These amendments will make it clearer who will benefit from the preference flow suggested on the how-to-vote card and reduce the potential for voters to be misled. These amendments are important to give voters the means of making informed decisions when voting. Schedule 2-Misleading or deceptive publication Section 329 of the Electoral Act currently prohibits publications that are likely to lead or deceive an elector in relation to how to cast a vote. Section 329 of the Electoral Act provides a definition of the term ‘publish'. Schedule 2 to this bill expands the definition of publish to include anything that is published by radio, television, internet or telephone. As the offence in section 329 is expanded to cover material published on the internet, the offence is amended to provide extended geographical jurisdiction for such offences. The extended geographical operation captures material published overseas by an Australian citizen or resident. Conclusion The government is committed to reducing the potential for voters to be misled and to give voters the means to make informed decisions about voting. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Billson) adjourned. NA (RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT) BILL 2010 NA (RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT) BILL 2010 Correction to the Explanatory Memorandum",36
11,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"BatmanMinister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (10.14 am)-For the information of honourable members. I present a correction to the explanatory memorandum misfor the Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010 and the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010. AIRPORTS (ON-AIRPORT ACTIVITIES ADMINISTRATION) VALIDATION BILL 2010 Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 May, on motion by Mr Albanese: That this bill be now read a second time.",37
12,Mr TRUSS,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I am speaking today about the Airports (On-Airport Activities Administration) Validation Bill 2010. It is interesting that we are debating this bill so soon after the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government has introduced a correction to an explanatory memorandum. This bill proposes to rectify another administrative oversight dealing with the issuing of infringement notices at Commonwealth leased airports. The airports in question are Adelaide, Alice Springs, Archerfield, Bankstown, Brisbane, Camden, Canberra, Darwin, Essendon, Gold Coast, Hobart, Jandakot, Launceston, Melbourne (Tullamarine), Moorabbin, Mount Isa, Parafield, Perth, Sydney (Kingsford Smith), Tennant Creek and Townsville, although it is not clear that the problem ing rectified has occurred at each and every one of those airports. Specifically, the bill will validate potenthere tially invalid infringement notices issued by people who were not properly authorised under the Airports (Control of On-Airport Activities) Regulations 1997 to issue infringement notices. Whilst examining parking infringement notices issued at a number of airports, it became apparent that due to administrative oversight on the part of the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government and a number of airports some infringement notices were issued by individuals who were not ‘authorised persons' under the regulations and were therefore not properly able to issue those infringement notices. To become an ‘authorised person' under the regulations, an individual must be appointed by the secretary of the department or the secretary's delegate. Authorised persons are empowered to issue infringement notices at airports when regulations on a variety of matters, including parking, are breached. In 2004, the list of authorised persons up to date and accurate. However, since that time, individuals who were not authorised persons have begun issuing infringement notices for parking offences. For instance, airports often contract out their parking sertimes vices, and some of these subcontractors have employed people who had not been previously appointed as authorised persons. I understand that, as of 25 March 2010, the problem of unauthorised persons issuing infringement notices has now been rectified and the department of transport list of authorised persons is now up to date and accurate again. Naturally, I welcome this development. As an observation, one wonders why the authorisation process is even necessary. We be- have a massive bureaucracy in this country and sometimes many of the approval processes are mere formalities. One wonders why is a necessity to go through that kind of bureaucratic activity. Labor promised when it came into government that it would reduce the number of regulations in our country. It said, ‘One-on, one-off,' but this is another broken election promise. Since Labor has been in office it has introduced 9,997 new regulations and it has abolished just 52. I am suggesting at the present time that maybe there are a few in this whole authorisation process that could be on the list for removal. To get to the detail of this particular problem, it seems as though there could be up to 100,000 infringement notices-mostly related to parking offences-issued since 2004 that may be invalid and without legal effect. Australians who have received and paid infringement notices over the last six years may feel aggrieved at this. It is, however, important to remember what an infringement notice is. Those who commit parking offences at airports and are issued an infringement notice can choose to pay the fine stipuwas lated by the notice or they can choose to have the matter heard in court. If they choose not to pay the infringement notice, they are liable to have a much larger fine levied against them. This cost can be up to five the amount stipulated by the notice. If an individual parks illegally at an Australian airport and is issued with an invalid infringement notice-that is, an infringement notice that is without legal effect-the option to pay a lesser fine is removed. The only option is to have the matter heard in court and risk having to pay the full amount and, of course, court costs on top of it. For the airports, invalid infringement notices cannot be used as evidence in any legal proceedings. The issuing officer can, however, still testify to what they witnessed. I also understand that invalid infringement notices could simply be reissued now that the list of authorised persons is once again accurate. Of course, this could be more administratively complicated for both parties than the solution proposed by this bill. Additionally, the invalid infringement notices also pose questions about immunity from prosecution. In addition to the implication that an individual has accepted culpability in an offence, paying the fine attached to a fringement notice makes that person immune from further prosecution. If, however, an infringement notice is not valid, there is some uncertainty that this immunity applies. As a result, thousands of individuals who paid invalid infringement notices in good faith could be prosecuted further. The bill will confirm immunity from prosecution by retroactively validating the infringement notices. Naturally, retrospective legislation arouses suspicion amongst many legislators, me included, and many Australians. In this case, however, no new offences are being created retrospectively. This bill is simply an administrative fix aimed at ensuring that the option of paying an infringement notice remains in play and guaranteeing that those who have paid infringement notices over the past six years remain immune from prosecution. Retroactively validating legal instruments in this way is not a new or unknown concept. Last year the parliament passed the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2009, which imposed disciplinary sanctions on persons corresponding to punishments imposed on them by the Australian Military Court after they had been declared unconstitutional by the High Court. The High Court decision was issued on 26 August 2009. The Military Justice Bill (Interim Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2009 was introduced in the Senate on 9 September, passed the next day and immediately sent onto the House of Representatives, which passed it on 14 September. The bill received royal assent on 22 September, less than a month after the decision of the High Court was made. The coalition and all other parties supported the bill and assured its swift passage through parliament. Obviously the matters under consideration in that case were of much greater substance than the parking infringements and other infringements that we are dealing with in this bill. So valid in- it sets a powerful precedent. The bill currently before the House was introduced earlier this month, and the government is keen for it to be passed quickly through the parliament. The Minister for Defence, Senator Faulkner, when dealing with the previously mentioned bill, pointed out that it is ‘critical that the ADF has a functioning military discipline system'. Retroactively upholding the decisions of the Australian Military Court was a transitional arrangement while the government worked out a new and permanent system that was impartial, independent and met the constitutional requirements. The bill before the House similarly seeks to deal with the question of retrospective validity. Given the example of the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2009, retroactive validation is not without precedent. Indeed, if retroactively validating the judgments of a military court is a legitimate exercise, retroactively validating infringement notices mainly related to parking offences seems to be a pretty small issue. Parking at airports is, however, a contentious issue, and nobody likes being issued an infringement notice for a parking offence. There are some who think that the airport operators adopt a very heavy-handed approach. On the other hand, those who arrive at an airport which is blocked up by people parking illegally are keen to see the laws enforced. I think the reality is that we need to see proper judgment and that the laws need to be both sound in the first place and enforced. I can appreciate that many Australians might instinctively find a bill that retroactively validates parking infringement notices that were improperly issued to be objectionable. Indeed, it would seem to offend against our notion of a fair go. This bill, however, will not impose new parking fines on the many Australians who park at Commonwealth leased airports. Instead, it will provide an administrative solution to the problem of invalidly issued infringement notices and guarantee immunity from prosecution for those who have paid the fines associated with those infringement notices. I resist the temptation to seek to make any kind of political capital out of the debate on this bill and am mindful that the problem has affected both the previous government and this one. It seems to me that there would only be losers if this bill were not passed, because even people who may think that they will be let off their infringement notice currently face a greater penalty than they would if this legislation were able to pass. So, whilst it may not appeal to our sense of fair play, this bill not only seeks to correct an administrative oversight but also delivers relief to people who might otherwise be picked up by an invalidly issued infringement notice which could lead to a greater penalty than would apply if this bill were passed. The opposition will be supporting this legislation before the House because we believe it is the best way to resolve an administrative flaw which obviously should not have arisen in the first place. There is a question as to whether the regulations themselves are even necessary, but the problem has arisen and needs to be fixed.  too rise to speak in support of the Airports (On-Airport Activities Administration) Validation Bill 2010. I commend the member for Wide Bay-who I note was the transport minister back in 2004-for his contribution and I accept the spirit of bipartisan support for this legislation. This bill will address the uncertainty about the validity of parking infringement notices issued at Commonwealth leased airports prior to 25 March this year. It will validate potentially invalid infringement notices as well as other penalties imposed on activities not authorised under the Airports (Control of On-Airport Activities) Regulations 1997. This legislation applies mainly to parking infringements-that is how most Australians will interact with it-but also applies to some other matters, such as smoking and gambling, at Commonwealth leased airports, including Archerfield Airport in my electorate and Brisbane airport, which is close to my electorate. Airport regulations state that authorised persons, who must be appointed by the Secretary of the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government or the secretary's delegate, are empowered to issue infringement notices such as parking fines. Authorised persons can also perform certain other actions and exercise certain other powers. For example, they have the power to tell someone to move their car if they are breaking any parking or vehicle movement regulations. Anyone who has visited Brisbane airport or many of the other airports covered by this bill will tell you that on occasions it can be bedlam at those airports. If one taxi does the wrong thing or one drop-off or heartfelt goodbye goes on for too long, it can throw the whole system into chaos-flights can be missed and loved ones left stranded at the other end. It is very important that airports exercise these powers, because if they did not all our airports would become traffic bottlenecks. There is also the security concern associated with having vehicles hanging around for too long in any one place. However, a recent review of parking infringement notices issued at certain airports found that the appointment of authorised persons had not been kept up to date. Unfortunately, as the member for Wide Bay pointed out, this goes back as far as 2004, long before the election of the Rudd government. In some cases this was an administrative oversight by the department and in other cases an oversight by the airport. Either way, technically and by the letter of the law, some infringement notices issued by persons without a valid authorisation may be invalid and have no legal effect. Payment of a parking infringement notice provides a person with immunity from prosecution for an alleged offence at the relevant airport. This significantly reduces the potential penalty which a driver may be required to pay for committing the parking offence. A driver may face a penalty five times the amount of the parking infringement notice should the matter be taken to court and the driver is found to have committed the offence indicated by the ticket. The bill before the House is needed to confirm immunity from prosecution for the relevant offences of persons who received infringement notices and paid the fine. also avoid the potential for the Commonwealth to reimburse fines-that is why it is important that we quickly pass this legislation, and I commend those opposite for their support for it. The bill will validate all tions performed and powers exercised under the regulation. The bill provides the necessary legal certainty that each parking infringement notice and relevant other action is valid and legally effective. The Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government has acted quickly to address this oversight. The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government has consulted airports and ensured authorised persons are appointed at each airport. The department is undertaking a full review of all processes and procedures relating to its administration of the Airport Parking Infringement Notices Scheme and the regulations more broadly in order to meet the standard required by the government. I am advised that authorisations are now all up to date and all parking infringement notices issued since 25 March this year are valid for all airports. As I said earlier, my particular focus is on Brisbane airport, which I have the pleasure of travelling through 40 or 50 times a year, and Archerfield Airport, which is in my electorate. It is an interesting place. There is legislation in place providing for the Aviation Noise Ombudsman and in my last newsletter I put out a call to see how people have been affected by noise at Archerfield Airport in my electorate, both the small general aviation planes and also the bigger planes that fly quite low over some parts of my electorateI see them every morning when I go for a walk. This bill ensures that the world of airport parking infringements is as it should be. I It will commend the bill to the House.",37
13,Mr TUCKEY,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"It is amazing how often we find ourselves in this House correcting the mistakes of the previous or of this government-more parac- ticularly this government-where, as in this case, laws are passed without providing the appropriate authority. Mr Martin Ferguson-Have you read the bill?",41
14,Mr TUCKEY,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,I have read the bill. Let me quote the purpose stated in the second reading speech: The Airports (On-Airport Activities Administration) Validation Bill 2010 will validate potentially invalid infringement notices … Mr Martin Ferguson-Read on-‘going back as far as 2004'.,41
15,Mr TUCKEY,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,What did I just say? I said previous and present governments. Mr Martin Ferguson-You talked about correcting the current government. What do you think this is: a race?,42
16,Mr TUCKEY,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"What I am saying is that it is a situation of fixing problems that should not have occurred in the first place and it has taken all this time to find out what they are. I do not have to worry too much about this particular government alleging that two wrongs make a right, which is its mantra. We get the Prime Minister doing it every day. We say, ‘Why have you let this happen?' and he says, ‘Oh, but you did it worse.' That is maybe why the people change the government-people change the government in anticipation it will be done better. The giggling that is going on over there is coming from the minister who, if he were me, would declare himself the minister ‘for' resources, as I did ‘for' forestry, when the Labor government of the day, particularly in Western Australia, was just decimating jobs in the forestry industry to pick up a few Greens preferences. Mr Martin Ferguson-Relevance, Mr Deputy Speaker!",42
17,Mr TUCKEY,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"If you are worried about relevance, you started it. You-the minister at the table-raised the issue of two wrongs making a right, and it is with some pleasure that I am responding to those comments. The reality is that the Rudd government seldom even correct their own problems. They believe that, as long as they can put an alternative case or pick some example going back 100 years, they are justified in their mismanagement of the Australian economy. In that regard, we had a situation across the road just a little while ago where we saw a building erected in haste to demonstrate the dimensions of a school canteen which cost $600,000, when last Sunday in Perth a house with four bedrooms, two bathrooms, a home theatre, an office and air-conditioning was advertised to be constructed on your block for $160,000. This thing, which you could not park a car in, cost $600,000. The tragedy is that the Minister for Resources and Energy is in here every day defending the decisions that were made in his absence to add a huge financial burden to the mining sector so the government can pay off the losses of the Building the Education Revolution. Evidence was given of a guy who did $60,000 worth of work and cannot get paid. Where is the stimulus? Coming back to the issue of airports, I rose to speak recognising that this is a relatively simple matter. It authorises people to issue parking infringement notices, primarily. I believe that at our airports we still have security problems around the proper identification of people who work on the site. I well remember when the then Premier of New South Wales objected to the installation of surveillance cameras in the baggage areas because it might catch some of the union members having a sleep and/or breaking into people's luggage to steal things! I think it was Bob Carr who objected strenuously to the upgrading of that service, and everybody knew that you could go through half of those areas and the CCTV cameras had cigarette packets stuck over them and no-one was game to take them off. There are other issues that we might debate on this matter, but my major concern is Perth Airport and its major role-and the minister at the table, Minister Ferguson, might be interested in this-with the fly out arrangements. Fly in, fly out is now a major component of the mining industry. It replaces the Charles Court mantra: if you want to get a mining lease in Western Australia then you build the township and you build the infrastructure and you build the railway lineswhich they still do. Why they need to be taxed so the government can duplicate what the mines have done already in mining infrastructure, I do not know. Every time there has been a need to increase exports, the mining companies and the new entrants, like Forrest with Fortescue Metals, have built their own railway lines, built their own airports and made their own arrangements. Near the town of Ravensthorpe in my electorate, BHP, as part of their $3 billion opment, built a very good 737 style airport. As a consequence, they could fly people in and out, notwithstanding that was a locality where a lot of people preferred to live. This is another serious matter arising out of the attack on the mining industry. I am surprised at times to find where I have a mine in my electorate, even under its present boundaries, compared to its new boundaries, where of course I move into the goldfields. In the present boundaries there is a major nickel mining project near a little town called Hyden. Hyden has been producing wheat and sheep for as long as I can remember. Hyden had a pretty bad year last year. Most grain growers did because, whereas typically you need a tonne of grain to pay your input costs, last year it was two tonnes. It was a dry ish and they did not get two tonnes and the region around there lost $1 billion. What the farmers have discovered, particularly the broader family, is that, regarding the cash flow of a family enterprise which is dedicated to farming, they can go and get well paid jobs just down the road. That particular company has dug two shafts and has decided not to dig the third one. It is the marginal one; it is marginal and the tax will make it impossible. We heard the Prime Minister going on yesterday about somebody who said, ‘Minerals are just sand in the ground until we in the mining sector do something about it.' I presume the minister at the table knows what the meaning is of recoverable reserves. We in the mining industry never talk about ‘the reserves' or the amount of minerals that are there at whatever grade. It is always a case, when you go to your banker, of recoverable reserves. In other words: in the present environment, how much can you extract at the available prices, which are usually set internationally, and make a profit sufficient to develrepay your tax and your debts? By any measure, if the government sequesters to itself a more significant amount of the available revenue then in fact the recoverable reserves are reduced as a matter of simple arithmetic. But the mining sector has built most of its own infrastructure and certainly does not need to be robbed by a government for the purpose of duplicating what is there already, or what they are quite prepared to build in their construction planning. Let me say that when you build an airstrip or you build a new mining project, the ratio of employment is probably 10 or 15 to one compared to the operation of that mine. Consequently, this new tax, which is an attack on new development, is going to hit the big side of employfin- ment in mining very hard. But nevertheless maybe this very mining debate has removed the problem that I came to this chamber to talk about-that is, congestion created by the fly in, fly out system at Perth Airport. It was claimed recently that because of the nature of the industry, and to keep with their work program, the mining companies want their crews to leave Perth at six o'clock in the morning, so you get a concentration of departures at that time. I thought, ‘Well I need a bit of information on this,' so I put a question in writing to the minister's office, thinking that no doubt he and his department would have given considerable thought to this problem and be able to provide me with a range of solutions already to hand. I should have brought the answer in and sought leave to table it, but I believe it is supposed to be published under the arrangements in this place. It is a farce. It was just another one the answers we get here to questions without notice that are obfuscations; it virtually did not answer the questions, particularly those where I tried to make suggestions that might solve the problem. My first question was: in an environment where you have a high number of departures at six o'clock in the morning, how many arrivals do you have? Do you have to have a rule that there is a time interval between take-offs, to allow for an aircraft to land tween each take-off? Obviously in Perth at six o'clock in the morning, the tourist flights are not coming in from the rest of the world. They come in at midnight, because we Western Australians, luckily, have no curfew on our airport. I asked: what is the time interval, and how does it compare with those of major international airports? That request was just ignored. That is a bit hard, isn't it-they are the department of aviation and they do not know what goes on in major European or American airports. They do not know the time interval, the gap. I remember sitting some years ago in Denver airport. It was snowing and they were hosing down the wings of the airplanes. The airplanes were coming into land almost nose to tail, and the snow plows were ducking out between them. I have had a private pilots licence, and the intervals that are legally applicable in Australia are just a joke. But why not tell me what they are, how they compare with those of other busy airports in the world and how, consequently, we could improve the productivity of Perth airport. There are no answers-no ideas. Some of my other questions were quite simple. Firstly, it is a productivity issue. Might I say to those who manage the airport: take a tougher line on no-shows, or people who have checked in and then do not turn up when the boarding call is made. I do not know how, in that environment, you could of tolerate it. Presumably the mining companies have to say to their workforce: ‘If you're not on the plane at the correct time so that plane can meet its slot for take-off, don't come to work.' I go to my electorate on similar early flights, sometimes the same flights, and I hear the call: ‘Will Bill, Jack and so-and-so please get on the plane?' That is an administrative issue that would no doubt improve things in that regard. Acting Deputy Speaker Washer would be be- familiar with this, having quite a few fly-in fly-out people living in his electoratetypically, I might add, in the more expensive suburbs. They probably have a boat and go out and pinch his fishing spot from time to time. Their proximity to the RAAF Base Pearce is probably the same as their proximity to Perth airport. So I ask: why can't we-as it is done at Richmond Airport in New South Wales, for example-have a FIFO operation at Pearce? ‘Oh, no, you could not do that; that is an air force base.' Well, so is Richmond. And other air force bases around Australia could also quite easily accommodate some departures. They have the established structure, and they are ready to go for the relatively simple structure of a terminal. ‘Oh, no, you couldn't do that'-in other words, there has been no thought, no recognition that it happens already and that that could be a solution to getting people out of the metropolitan area, and out of Acting Deputy Speaker Washer's electorate in particular. Let's travel all the way south. Some years ago the shire of Margaret River made the decision that they needed to be a tourist hub and that it was practical to have a, I think, daily air service to an airstrip for people ing from Perth. They built an airstrip for that activity. They then discovered that people did not take that option. People are rusted onto their motorcars. The journey is a bit short for that, and through the efforts of the member for Canning and through the pressure applied by the Howard government, the then Carpenter WA government and the then minister for transport-who now wants the member for Canning's seat-were forced to put a dual four-lane highway to interconnect with the section of the Old Coast Road, which was just a death trap, and fix it up. I occasionally drive on that road to other parts of my electorate and it is a dream. It is another reason why that airport is not used by people who live in places like Margaret River. As we speak, there is an aircraft that leaves that airport, I am not sure on the frequency, as a FIFO. It flies to the Pilbara. a propjet and it can land on that airport. The good salaries that people are earning-and not just machine operators but young women working in the restaurant and catering areaare such that they choose to live in some of these lifestyle blocks. Compared to the salubrious suburbs of Perth, they are lower in cost, but they have room for kids and access to the beach, fishing and all the things they desire. Some of the newer areas of my electorate, like Bridgetown and Manjimupwhich took a tremendous blow from the restriction of native forest harvesting-are seeing these people come in and buy the relatively small acreage blocks that were designed years ago. They are living there and spending money in the local community, and that airport is the logical place for them to depart for work. What is the problem? There is a curfew of 7 am in the morning on this airport for the local community. You would think there is a plane coming in every five minutes-even with an expanded role it fly- might be two or three a day. That convenience should be there. It relieves the pressure on Perth airport. What was the answer I got when I asked about that? ‘That's someone else's problem. Don't tell us about it'. There is a case for this minister to say to his aviation minister, ‘You'd better resume that airport, take control of it and put in some reasonable arrangements so that it can be made available to fly people into these airports. With the half a second I have, I ask: where are all these people coming from? There are two flights a week from Cairns, with 14 per cent unemployment, and we are going to strangle that off. Then, of course, every other state-(Time expired)",42
18,Mr ZAPPIA,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Makin) (10.52 am)Listening to the member for O'Connor, I was not sure if we were speaking about a mining bill or an airport bill, because it seemed to me that he spent more time talking about the It is mining industry than he did about the aviation industry and airports in particular. I say to the member for O'Connor that this side of the House certainly understands and values the mining sector in this country. We understand the contribution it makes and we believe that that contribution is significant. We also believe, however, that the mining sector ought to pay a fair share for resources which are owned by the Australian people and which can only ever be sold once. About a decade ago, one in three mining profit dollars were coming back into the Australian community; today it is about one in seven dollars. In addition, as you would well know, Mr Deputy Speaker Washer, coming from a mining state, the system of having royalties imposed upon the mining sector is not a very efficient system at all, because it is a volume tax: if the companies are not making any profit they still have to pay the royalties. Under the government's resource super profits tax, to which the member for O'Connor was alluding a moment ago, all of the funds that will be raised will go into three key community areas. One is infrastructure, to which he was referring just a moment ago-infrastructure that ultimately will also benefit the mining sector. Secondly, funds will go into reducing company tax for companies around this nation. Again, that includes mining companies. Thirdly, funds will go into increasing superannuation for Australia's working people from nine per cent to 12 per cent over the course of the next decade. It seems to me that it is all about fairness nothing more. I repeat what I said earlier: this government certainly does understand and value the mining sector, but it also acknowledges its responsibility to the Australian people at large for resources which are owned by the Australian people and which can only ever be sold once. Returning to the essence of the Airports (On-Airport Activities Administration) Validation Bill 2010, I will make some brief comments. By way of explanation, the Airports (Control of On-Airport Activities) Regulations 1997 empower authorised persons to issue infringement notices for the breach of certain rules. These include parking infringement notices. It has become apparent that the appointment of authorised persons at some airports has not been kept up to date. This extends back as far back as September 2004-it goes back to the time of the previous government. This was an administrative oversight by the department and in some cases also by the airports. As a result, infringement notices issued could be invalid and may have no legal effect. This presents an issue for anyone who was issued with an infringement notice that was invalid and paid the fine. They may still be liable to prosecution for the alleged offence. This bill is all about trying to clarify the issue for these people and for the airports. It is about correcting an anomaly that has been brought to the minister's attention. The bill will ensure that the rights and liabilities of all persons will be the same as if the infringement notices had been validly issued, it will avoid a potential requirement for the Commonwealth to reimburse amounts paid in respect of any infringement notices, it will confirm immunity from prosecution for the relevant offences of recipients of infringement notices who have paid the amount as per the infringement notice and it will ensure and that all actions performed and powers exercised by an unauthorised person or a person purportedly authorised-or not authorised, through this oversight-to perform such actions and exercise such powers are legally effective. Confirmation of immunity is important, because a driver can face much steeper penalties should the matter be taken to court. Immunity from prosecution for an alleged offence is provided by payment of a parking infringement notice-in other words, a parking fine-which is generally about one-fifth of the maximum penalty for the associated offence if the matter is taken to court. Since 25 March this year, all infringement notices issued are valid and the authorisations are now all up to date. Clearly, the issue of authorising the personnel has been fixed up, but there is a lag period between 2004 and March this year during which the anomaly still exists. In its annual report on airport performances, the ACCC notes that there are concerns that the airports' monopoly position could be used to exploit the public. Indeed, airports do have a monopoly over the businesses they are in. Consumers may have a choice of carriers, but they do not have a choice of airports. This is a matter that concerns communities wherever airports are located. It is not simply the case that airports have a monopoly over the business they are in. It goes much further than that. When the airports were privatised by the previous government, the operators of those airports were effectively given immunity from local government and state government laws. As a result, they not only have a monopoly but also have a free hand to do almost exactly what they want within the confines of the airport. Having said that, I accept that most airport operators are good corporate citizens and are prepared to work with the relevant state and local authorities. But that is not always the case, and it is an anomaly that, quite frankly, ought to be rectified. As we all know, airports today no longer simply provide aviation activities. What we have seen at most airports is the development of land which they considered to be surplus to their aviation needs. Those developments are generally commercial developments-commercial developments which, in my view, ought to be treated, approved and dealt with by local government authorities and state government authorities in the same way that any other commercial development within their jurisdiction is treated. Regrettably, that is not the try. case. I know that the minister has the right to approve the airport master plans, and this is a process that generally occurs every five years. But even within those master plans there is often not the detail, in terms of the development that is going to occur, that there ought to be and which would in turn enable local communities to have some input into what is occurring. It seems to me that that, as I said a moment ago, is an anomaly which ought to be rectified and which I believe was never, ever the intent in allowing airport operators to have immunity from state and local government laws. The immunity should have applied only to the direct aviation activities and to nothing else. I will digress for a moment and respond to something that the member for O'Connor said when he was speaking on this bill a few moments ago about the mining companies having to provide the infrastructure required to carry out their operations. In particular, he referred to the need for some of the mining companies to provide their own airport facilities. Can I say in response to that that it is not unusual for developers today to have to provide the relevant infrastructure for their developments, whether it is a mining operation or something different. In fact, there has been a huge debate in recent years across Australia in respect of the level of infrastructure that developers are expected to provide as part of their overall development. Today it is not unusual to see in the city areas a developer of either residential or commercial developments also provide the necessary roadworks, drainage works, electricity systems, gas supplies and the like as part of the overall development plan. So for the miners to have to do the same is simply consistent with what is expected of all developers wherever they may be throughout the counI said a moment ago that the airports have a monopoly position over the airports that they operate. It is a concern that generally follows and is consistent with the privatisation of any asset. Wherever assets have been privatised we have seen concerns emerge as time passes. One of the concerns I will comment on is in respect of the level of car parking fees being charged by some of the airports around the country. In 2008-09 the five major airports generated around $278 million in combined revenue through airport car parking. This represents about 12 per cent of their total revenue. The highest car parking income generated was at Melbourne Airport, where $90 million or 20.5 per cent of total revenue raised was from car parking. It is estimated that Melbourne Airport makes about 75 per cent or $67 million of profit from its car parking operations. I would have thought that car parking should have simply been an adjunct service to the aviation activities. The 20.5 per cent compares with around eight per cent for Sydney, Perth and Adelaide airports. It is a fairly large discrepancy, and is certainly not consistent with what is being charged at the other airports. Even the other airports, some would say, are charging more than they need to. According to a previous ACCC report, passenger numbers increased by 41 per cent since 2002, but parking revenues grew by 77 per cent-almost double. There was a time that business operators provided parking for their customers, but it seems that providing parking at a cost is now core business of many airports and there to be exploited. It would be interesting to know if the number of infringement notices issued has also increased as the cost of car parking increased and the revenue to the airports increased. It would be only human nature, if you can avoid to pay for the car parking, given the cost that you are confronted with, to probably do so. And in trying to avoid the car parking fees you are more likely to be issued with an infringement notice, particularly today, where at most airports you can barely stop for a moment without someone coming along and telling you to move on. I recall that at the Adelaide Airport, before the new airport was built, there was at least an area for very short-term parking for anyone who simply wanted to unload their luggage, take it into the airport counter and then come back to the car. You cannot even do that today unless you have a driver with you that stays within the car at all times and effectively keeps the car motor running. That kind of service simply does not exist, and I believe that is something that has been a loss to the people that use the airports. It was not about necessarily avoiding car parking fees; it was simply part of the convenience and service that was provided to customers at airports. In fact, when you consider some of the car parking charges at airports today and then look at some of the discount fares you can get to travel from one capital city to anit other, the car parking charges are almost as high as what you can sometimes get an airfare for-but that is another matter. This is a bill that tries to rectify, as I said earlier on, an anomaly relating to the authorisation of the people who issue infringement notices and in turn ensures that those people who have been issued with the notices are also protected by not being charged a second time or taken to court as a result of this anomaly. I certainly, as I have said throughout the course of this speech, would like to see a total review of the way that airports do charge their fees for car parking. It is a matter that, frankly, I would like to think might be included in the airport master plans, and have the authorisation of the minister in terms of the level of charges that they can apply. But that is something that I will obviously need to take up with the minister. Having said that, this is a bill which, as I said throughout the course of this speech, overcomes an anomaly. I commend the bill to the House.",45
19,Mr RANDALL,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Canning) (11.07 am)The Airports (On-Airport Activities Administration) Validation Bill 2010, while being technical in nature, gives me the opportunity to speak about the more substantial commercial nature of airports. Before I continue, I would just like to say I agree with many of the sentiments of the member for Makin. Obviously, we who use the airports get a lot of feedback from constituents on some of the negative aspects of trying to get through and use the airport car parks in any sort of friendly way. This bill before us corrects an administrative error regarding the issuing of parking notices at Australian airports, and validates those tickets issued in error. Again, we are fixing up a problem which, as I said, the airports themselves have generated. In some respects I do not really like being associated with a retrospective validation of parking tickets, but it was an unintended consequence that I suppose requires the support of this parliament to correct. There have been some 100,000 parking tickets that have been issued at airports around the country by people who were not authorised to issue them. I am sure that those 100,000 drivers who received the tickets would be delighted to hear that they were not validly charged, and that they will be getting their money back, but you can appreciate that this would result in a huge administrative nightmare-so, as I said, it falls upon the parliament to correct this problem. Of course, there are legal ramifications of failing to validate these tickets. The issuing of a ticket by an unauthorised person does not result in the offence being invalidated-the person has still parked illegally according to the rules-so this precludes any challenge. It means the tickets cannot be used as evidence if a fine is challenged in court. Prior to the realisation of the error the list of authorised persons had not been updated since 2004. Now we can be confident that this list has been corrected up until March 2010. Unfortunately for the tickets issued during that time, this is, as I said, retrospective in its nature. We do not like anything in this place that is retrospective in its nature. Obviously, there is an interest by airport lessees to pursue commercial developments around airports. It is no secret that airports make a significant proportion of their income through non-aviation means. It is important to note that large developments on airport land require government approval. It is commonplace now that factory outlets, parking, shopping, hotels, conference facilities, transport hubs and a whole range of industry are now to be found on leased airport land. Last year master plans for nearly all of the nation's airports were approved, including plans for commercial expansions. The development approval process is extensive and has become more stringent in recent years. It is important to note how important the commercial aspect is, because it allows investment in aviation infrastructure. Privatisation of airports by the previous government has resulted in more than $2 billion being invested in federal airports, with billions more committed. The industry supports this case, saying that the commercial development is good for the economy: every $1 billion of capital investment generates something like $800 million in wages, and we have seen the employment of 19,000 workers as a result. In 2006 the Productivity Commission reported-so these figures are reasonably old, but they give an indication-that 61 per cent of Canberra Airport's revenue was generated from non-aeronautical activities. For Perth the figure was 53 per cent and for Sydney it was 39 per cent. So we are talking about large percentages of profit being generated by commercial operations on airport land. Particularly in times where revenues have fallen, airport operators are looking to make their money through other means. Last year, Olivia Wirth, the then Executive Director of Tourism and Transport Forum, said: Air services will always be Australian airports first priority. However, with a recession bearing downwhich it was at the time; it never happened Australian but it was bearing downit is time to remove the stigma about nonaeronautical development. Airport's leases can easily be seen as a licence to print money. Recent figures show that Sydney Airport's profits are 80 per cent of operating revenue. Whilst the debt of most operators is huge, Sydney Airport makes $5 for every $1 it spends on its operations. More and more airports are generating revenue from the development of leased land that is not subject to aviation reserve, as they are well within their rights to do, as long as they comply with their conditions. Major developments of over $20 million require the approval of the minister. The heart of this bill, the parking fees, a great source of revenue. Last year, for example, Melbourne Airport brought in $95 million in parking fees-in fact, it was 20 per cent of its revenue. Perth is much the same. While I am on the subject of Perth, Mr Deputy Speaker Washer, as you and I are both from that fantastic, resource-rich state, we know that the shambolic nature of parking at Perth Airport has been an issue for some time. In fact, as you drive into the Perth Airport you will see cars parked in the evening up and down Brearley Avenue, because they either cannot or will not go into the car parks at the Perth Airport. They will not or cannot either because the car parks are full or because they are too expensive to use. This huge amount of parking up and down the road reserve is a problem that needs to be addressed. In some respects it is dangerous. It is certainly opportunistic by those who want to sit there with their engines running, waiting for somebody to get off a plane and to duck into the airport to pick up the person getting off the plane. The problem is further exacerbated by the fact that the entry into the airport parking apron is now becoming so congested. Just the other day my own experience was that I had to get out of the car and cut across the car park to make sure I was not late for the cut-off time on the plane, because there was a huge queue to get into the parking and drop-off areas of the Perth Airport. I will address this issue a bit further in my speech here today when I talk about the parking problems for fly-in fly-out workers. In 2008-09, Perth Airport generated $29 million from parking-double what it made in 2004-05. With airport revenue of $165 million in 2008-09, that means that 17.2 per cent of Perth Airport's revenue came from parking-up from nine per cent in 2004-05. Perth Airport added almost 1,500 car parks last year, predominantly in the new longare term car park. While car park operating expenses have risen-including the need for CCTV security and shuttles-they remain well below the revenue, meaning there is always a tidy profit. Again, I go to the fly-in fly-out workers and those wanting long-term parking at the Perth Airport. If you live in the vicinity of the Perth Airport, from five in the morning you will see a succession of planes heading out of Perth every five minutes, generally to the mining centres like Leinster and Pannawonica, on their regular shuttle of workers to these areas. And you will see a massive number of taxis picking these people up in the suburbs beforehand. The problem is that if you do not get a taxi and you want to park around the Perth Airport not only will you find it expensive but you will find that this parking is well away from the airport terminal. So then you have the problem of catching a shuttle bus. It really is an issue that the owners of the airport have not kept up with. Through my office-because I have a lot of fly-in fly-out workers in my electorate of Canning-I receive regular complaints from people who have to make use of the long term car park and are not happy with the service they get. There is huge amount of buffer land surrounding Australian airports, and with that comes opportunity. For example, Brisbane has the largest buffer zone with 2,700 hectares, and 1,000 hectares of this is available for non-aviation commercial use. Sydney, in its 99-year lease, leases 907 hectares-three times smaller than Brisbane. Perth has quite a large buffer zone of 2,100 hectares. Adelaide has only 785 hectares. Melbourne has quite a large buffer zone of 2,379 hectares, but this is set to increase with land acquisidespite tion underway to enable the construction of two more runways. We have recently seen the release of the aviation white paper, which focused some attention on the commercial nature of airport operations. The white paper recommended the government make the move to prohibit residential development projects, such as housing adjacent to runways. This happened recently in the Jandakot Acourt Retreat development. Of course it is only sensible not to encourage residential development in close proximity to an airport because of the noise contours which surround airports. As soon as you allow a residential development close to an airport you can rest assured that offices like mine and those of the member for Swan and the member for Perth will receive lots of phone calls from people about aircraft noise over their houses and in their neighbourhoods. I really think we have to be very strong on this because we have seen what happened with Sydney, where insulation and double glazing was needed for those who lived close to the airport. Anyone who allows new residential development close to an airport is just begging for trouble in the future. Another of the main issues addressed in the white paper was the increasing trend of investment in non-aviation related developments at major airports. Since 1998 there have been 48 major development plans on leased airports throughout the country. Sixtywealth-in five per cent of these were for non-aviation related development. In the last five years non-aviation related development has far exceeded investment in aviation related infrastructure. One of the major concerns was the $20 million threshold, because large shopping centres and the like could be completed for under $20 million and therefore fell under the level required for public consultation, potentially having a major impact on the lifestyle of those living near airports and having a major impact on other commercial operations near airports. I will now refer to this concern about some of the commercial developments on the airports. When I was the member for Swan in 1996 there was a huge campaign, which went under the acronym RAGE-Retailers Against Government Enterprise-at Perth airport. A champion of the media-a guy called WW Mitchell-led the charge on this. Because it was on Commonwealth land developers did not need to seek local planning approval, state government approval or even the Belmont City Council's approval for construction. This would have had a huge impact on other commercial suburban shopping centres in the area. It was thought at the time that it would have a detrimental impact. As a result, this campaign attracted the interest of the state government of the time. They were talking about cutting off roads to the airport and utilities like electricity and water if they were not allowed to be involved in consultation about this development on Commonwealth land. In some respects the state and local governments brought this upon themselves because of their rather tortuous approval processes for similar developments in the state or in their neighbourhoods. So, of course, people thought, ‘At least we can go to the Commonwealth jurisdiction-land owned by the Commonthe airport buffer zone, because we will not have to go through this massive and tortuous process that has been afflicting us.' They did that, and they are continuing to do so, because it seems to be far easier to build on airport buffer zones than in the suburban areas, where state and local governments make things difficult for them. As a word of caution, there needs to be a greater consultative process so that there are not future concerns like this. Perth Airport has 2,100 hectares of land in its reserve. senger numbers have increased by almost 50 per cent since 2004. Revenue from aviation purposes has increased by eight per cent between 2004 and 2009. It is a really good money maker and they had their master plan approved last year. In the financial year to June 2008, Perth Airport recorded a profit of $84½ million-an increase of more than 45 per cent on the previous year because of the huge growth in not only international and domestic airfares but also in the number of fly-in fly-out workers in the resource industry. As an aside, Jandakot Airport Holdings wanted to clear bushland half the size of Kings Park at its lease site, largely for ness use, which caused a fair bit of concern to those people surrounding the airport. The $1 billion redevelopment of Perth Airport has been shrouded in uncertainty and it has been no secret that I have been pretty critical of leaseholders, the Westralia Airports Corporation. The reason is that before the last federal election the Labor government, then in opposition, had endeavouredand this is from an article by Geoffrey Thomas-to offer $80 million as an incentive for them to do a billion dollar redevelopment, but they rejected it. I suspect that this might have had something to do with trying to save the federal seat of Swan, which did not work. The fact is, they had an opportunity to make a huge quality investment in Perth Airport. The aviation guru Geoffrey Thomas wrote at the time: The economic landscape has changed since last May when WAC promised a two-stage makeover that would deliver one of the best airports in the Asia Pacific region …. However, WAC later conceded that rather than a showcase airport, such as at Singapore, Perth would get a ‘minimum standard Class C airport', similar to most in Australia, as rated by the International Air Transport Association. This was an opportunity lost, because one of the reasons the Westralia Airports CorporaPastion have a problem is they paid too much for the airport in the first place and they have been struggling ever since to make it a commercial operation. Even though they are making good profits, they have always struggled with the fact that they paid too much. The cost of borrowed money has always been an issue for them. They have actually been very, very slow in the delivery of many of the promises around Perth Airport. Yes, there have been some improvements, but they are glacial in nature. They are so slow. Look at airport parking. They have reneged on the second runway even though there is a very good case now about aircraft busimovements. The second parallel runway would take a lot of pressure from the aviation industry and aircraft arrivals and departures, and they have shelved this. One of my contentions is that, realistically, we should be putting more pressure on the Westralia Airports Corporation to deliver this world class airport and to deliver the infrastructure to be ahead of the game rather than be behind the game. They have even been criticised by the previous Labor Premier of Western Australia, Alan Carpenter, for what they have done about the lack of infrastructure at Perth Airport. We used to laugh about the Adelaide Airport once, but Adelaide now is one of the showcases. Perth Airport is probably the worse of the major capital cities of this country in what it delivers. One day someone is actually going to decide, at a government level, that they are not doing the job and maybe they will want to re-bid the lease, if they cannot come up with funds to provide the airport that is appropriate for Western Australia's growthparticularly as there is a massive amount of increased aviation related activity going through Perth Airport. They have suggested that the work in Terminal 3 is going ahead, but it is going ahead slowly and is not meeting the needs. I think they need to be held more accountable in the future because it is a showcase for Western Australia and they need to deliver, as they should, on any revised master plan for Perth Airport.",48
20,Mr LINDSAY,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"In the time of the former government there was a landmark decision made in relation to airports: airports were leased out to the private sector. There have been some good outcomes with that and there have been some not so good outcomes. At my own airport in Townsville we have had a fantastic outcome. The local operator who took over completely redeveloped the airport-something that would not have happened under the custodianship of the old FAC. Townsville was the big winner out of that particular privatisation. The downsides, of course, are the fees and charges that we are seeing and what people are being asked to pay and so on. Some of the parking charges are extortionate. Some of the things that the current airport operators do to force you to pay the fees are just amazing. I will get onto that in just a moment. I appreciated the contribution of the previous speaker, the member for Canning, in relation to Perth Airport. Deputy Speaker Washer, Perth Airport would not be unknown to you. I was there very recently and the redevelopment has made the outside look like a train station. You would expect trains to be coming down, not cars and taxis. It just seems very puzzling to me that that design was used. We have had a bit of a problem with the Townsville airport for some time in relation to the pick-up and drop-off area and the roads that go to that. I am pleased to tell the parliament that Townsville airport is now addressing that, and in the next month or so we will see the final work done to tidy that up. Traffic is always a problem, and of course this bill is about traffic and validating far tickets that have been issued to drivers who have not done the right thing. Where are some of the good airports for traffic? I guess you have to say that, if you are catching a taxi, Singapore is among the best. It is very good indeed. In Australia, Melbourne and Brisbane are good for catching taxis, but Perth is horrible for catching taxis-just awful. Canberra airport probably takes the cake for being the worse airport at the moment in relation to pick-up and drop-off, and I think we all have experience of that. Brisbane drop-off is very difficult. Those issues really do need to be addressed. There is a great need these days for areas where people coming to airports just to pick up an arriving passenger can pull up and wait until the passenger rings them up and says they have arrived and will wait at the kerb to be picked up. In the United States they are called mobile parking areas, the connotation being that you just wait by your mobile phone and when it rings the passengers arrive and you can start your car and go into the pick-up zone and pick them up. We do not do that in Australia, and we should. I appeal to airport operators to make that provision for passengers who need to be picked up, who do not need short-term or long-term parking. Brisbane airport actually works against that philosophy, because on the fouror five-kilometre approach to Brisbane there is no parking all the way along. The idea seems to be to feed cars into the short-term car park so you can charge them money. I reckon that is pretty short-sighted and unfortunate. The travelling public should have somewhere they can just wait until the plane lands and the passenger comes out of the terminal and they can just be called when the passenger is ready to be picked up. It seems eminently sensible to me, and I appeal to the airport operators to have a look at that. This bill fixes the administrative oversight that occurred in a former bill in relation to parking notices, and it addresses the question of the status of notices issued prior to 25 March to make them all valid. It is a noncontroversial piece of legislation. I support it and the opposition supports it, and I thank the House for the time to make this contribution.",53
21,Ms MCKEW,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Bennelong-Parliamentary Secretary for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (11.33 am)-I thank members of the House for their contributions to the debate on the Airports (On-Airport Activities Administration) Validation Bill 2010. The government is certainly keen to ensure the administration of regulatory requirements is effective and valid. That is why it has been necessary to pass this legislation to remove any uncertainty introduced by the potential invalidity of infringement notices issued and any other actions performed by persons not validly or lawfully authorised under the regulations. Effective traffic control arrangements are of course essential for the efficient operation of airports. Accordingly, members of the community are required to comply with the traffic management arrangements in place at the airports. The legislation addresses a defect in the formalities of the authorisation dating back to 2004, and it in fact confirms immunity from prosecution to persons who received the infringement notices and paid the relevant penalty. Certainly in the future the government will ensure that administrative arrangements for this program are strengthened so that this sort of oversight will not occur again. I again thank members for their contributions and commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",54

23,Mr HARTSUYKER,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Bill 2010, the ComSuper Bill 2010 and the Superannuation Legislation (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2010. These three bills taken together seek to merge three trustee boards and authorities into a body which will then become the trustee of the main civilian and military superannuation schemes. The boards which will be amalgamated concern the Australian Reward Investment Alliance board, for civilian schemes; the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority; and the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Scheme, which is administered by the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme board, for military schemes. The particular schemes to be administered by the new body include the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme; the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme; the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan; the scheme provided for under the Papua New Guinea Staffing Assistance Act; the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Scheme; the Defence Forces Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme; the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme; and, finally, the scheme established under the Superannuation Act 1922. These schemes will be amalgamated into the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation, which is established by the governance bill and which will operate as a body corporate with a separate legal identity from the Commonwealth. The ComSuper Bill establishes ComSuper as a prescribed agency under the Financial Management and Accountability Act and as a statutory agency under the Public Service Act. The government is introducing these bills to find efficiencies in the management of government administered superannuation schemes. The amalgamation of all Commonwealth civilian and military superannuation boards is intended to provide administrative efficiencies, as well as secure cial gains through the amalgamation of all investment funds. The total amount for investment across the funds is approximately $19 billion. This includes $16 billion which is currently managed by the ARIA board and $3 billion which is managed by the MSBS board. It is estimated that an additional $10 million per annum will be generated due to the type and size of the amalgamated investment funds and the opportunity to consolidate investments. The bills stipulate that the board of the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation shall consist of 10 members and a chair, five of which will be appointed by the minister for finance, three of which will be appointed by the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and two of which will be appointed by the Chief of the Defence Force. Here lies the first problem that the coalition has with this legislation. Why should the President of the ACTU be allowed to nominate three members of the board of ComSuper governance? The last time. I checked the ACTU was not a government body and the President of the ACTU was not employed by the Commonwealth. Whereas decisions made by the minister for finance and the Chief of the Defence Force can be held to account in the parliament, the President of the ACTU seems to be able to appoint any person to the board without any oversight whatsoever. Clause 10(4) prevents the minister from questioning the decision of the ACTU President in making an appointment. The explanatory memorandum explains that it is not intended that the minister have any obligation to satisfy himself or herself that the appointment has been properly made. Clauses 16(5) and 16(6) go even further. These clauses prevent the minister for finance from dismissing an appointment made by the President of the ACTU without first finanreceiving permission from the ACTU. The bills list a number of reasons why a board member can be dismissed. These include misbehaviour or physical or mental incapacity; or if a director becomes bankrupt; or if a director fails to attend three consecutive board meetings and does not have a leave of absence; or if a director does not disclose interests to the board. So we could have a mentally incapacitated, bankrupt director who cannot be sacked by the minister for finance because the ACTU President will not allow the dismissal. This creates the extraordinary situation where the minister for finance cannot overrule the ACTU President on board member decisions. When did the ACTU President become more important in managing Australia's financial investments than the minister for finance? What happens if the ACTU President disagrees with the minister for finance? The bills contain no measures whereby such a conflict can be managed, although, the department of finance explicitly stated to the Senate inquiry that the minister can only remove a board member with the ACTU President's permission. This is an important point because we know that this government has some differences of opinion with the ACTU from time to time. For instance, I refer to comments in February this year by ACTU President, Sharan Burrow, who reiterated the ACTU's long campaign to increase the superannuation guarantee and called on the government to increase the super guarantee rate to 12 per cent by 2012. Now let us contrast those comments with the position of the Prime Minister and of the former minister for superannuation, Senator Sherry, before and after the 2007 election. The Prime Minister told Radio 4BC in Brisbane before the election that he would not make any changes to super-‘not one jot, one tittle'. This was followed by remarks from Senator Sherry, who said: We won't be increasing the nine per cent superannuation guarantee for a number of reasons. I've said time and time again at many conferences to many people in the financial services sector, vately and publicly, that nine per cent is enough from the employer, it would be unfair to increase that nine per cent any further and we won't be doing it. The then minister for superannuation, Senator Sherry, also had this to say after the election in March 2008: The 9 per cent superannuation guarantee contribution that employers pay for their employeesagain, we've committed that we could not increase that and increase the payment burden on employers. But, as we all know, in the 2010 budget the government listened to union demands and decided to increase the superannuation guarantee to 12 per cent. Senator Sherry is right: the policy certainly will be a burden on employers. It will increase payroll costs by around $20 billion per year when the 12 per cent is phased in. This includes around $10 billion from the two million small businesses in Australia. But the ACTU are not famous for considering the interests of small businesses over union interests. Here is what the ACTU's secretary, Jeff Lawrence, said about the government's policy: “The pathway to a 12 per cent superannuation guarantee is a big win for … Australian unions …” So when it comes to superannuation policy, the government does not listen to the former minister's commitments. It does not listen to the Prime Minister's commitments. It does not even listen to the recommendation from its own Henry review, which specially recommended against lifting the superannuation guarantee. Instead, the government listens to an ACTU campaign. And these bills formalise that position. They prevent the minister for finance from overruling the ACTU President with regard to the ComSuper board. This is an unacceptable position. No wonder the defence community want their own administrative board for superannuation when prithis government has been proven to be so incompetent at managing superannuation policy and has been putting the ACTU's interests ahead of commitments by the Prime Minister and the former minister for superannuation. Since these bills were released for comment, the veteran community has argued very strongly that the amalgamation of all civilian and military Commonwealth superannuation boards will have negative consequences on the future of military superannuation schemes. A Senate inquiry on these pieces of legislation reported on Monday, 15 March and allowed the defence community to voice their anger at the proposals. The Defence Force Welfare Association submitted to the inquiry that it strongly contends: … military superannuation schemes require a board and management structure that is separate from, and is seen to be separate from, Board and management structures applying to the Commonwealth's civilian superannuation schemes. The proposed Board merger will seriously disadvantage military superannuation contributors and beneficiaries and, in turn, the wider Australian community because: The unique conditions of military service will be subordinated to, and sumed by, civilian conditions of service even though the two are fundamentally and materially different. The Australian Veterans and Defence Services Council Inc. said: There is not now in the government function the interest that came with earlier parliaments … people who had the experience to be able to recognise the uniqueness of military service and therefore had an objective approach to military superannuation as a feature of conditions of service. The coalition agrees that military superannuation is unique. As my colleague the shadow minister for Defence Science and Personnel will explain, military superannuation is offered as part of a broad remuneration of Australia's defence personnel. The defence community believes that these bills are another step that will erode the unique position given to military superannuation. Military personnel make a huge sacrifice for the Australian people and they deserve to be rewarded through a generous and unique superannuation scheme that provides for them in retirement. The defence community should be rewarded and not punished. The amalgamated superannuation board will allow the Chief of the Defence Force to choose two board members, compared to the ACTU's three. What this government is effectively telling the defence community is that they are less important than the ACTU, and the ACTU has appointed board members who will have more say on the unique position of military superannuation than the defence force members. The coalition agrees with the defence community. It is an outrageous proposition that the ACTU should have more say on the management of military superannuation than the Department of Defence. Furthermore, the proposals will require a quorum to be formed by a board consisting subof nine of the 11 members. The coalition is concerned that the three ACTU appointed board members could prevent a meeting from taking place merely by refusing to attend the board meeting. The ACTU could hold the board to ransom if ever an issue were to arise that the ACTU disagreed with. with This is unacceptable. The coalition will not support these bills as they are currently drafted. The coalition concurs with many from the defence community who believe that that the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority, the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Scheme, and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme should be amalgamated under one board. However, this board should remain separate from the administration of civilian superannuation. The amalgamated military board should have oversight and control of all matters relating to the management of military superannuation schemes. It is appropriate that the military and civilian boards have a common chairperson, but no person can be appointed as a director on both the civilian and military boards concurrently. Importantly, the veteran community needs to be represented on the military board. Any board should contain a sunset clause so that the operation of the two boards can be reviewed after either three or five years to ensure that the interests of both military and civilian persons are being managed appropriately and in their best interests. The bill should also ensure that the Minister for Finance and Deregulation always has the final say over decisions made by the ACTU president with regards to board membership. The coalition cannot support these bills in their current form and will be looking to introduce amendments in the Senate.",54
24,Mr RIPOLL,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"I have to say at the outset of this very important Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Bill 2010 and cognate bills that I am quite disappointed in the shadow minister and some of the grand rhetoric that he has put forward and some of the misleading words and views in terms of what this bill is about or, more broadly, tary superannuation. As we all understand and know, these are big issues in the community, the military community and all of our electorates. We all work very hard to make sure that our veterans' community are well looked after, that all their entitlements are properly maintained and managed over a period of time and that any government looks after the best interests of our military personnel. We all support that. What I find offensive and wrong in these debates is when our military folk are used as political tools for an opposieras tion that is in the business of opposing than looking at the substantive good work that has gone into the reforms that have been put forward here today in the bill before us. There is also the very simple fact that the extensive and wide consultation that has taken place was done with the military community and with ex-service organisations and has the full support of all of those organisations, including the RSL. That is a little yet important point I would have thought the shadow minister might have taken just a brief moment to talk about. Who supports this bill and the reforms we are putting on the table? Military people do. Who opposes it? A bunch of opposition politicians do. I think that says a lot about the calibre and character of the people who oppose this in the House, like they oppose many other things. They oppose reform in the Medicare and health areas, they oppose reform in the stimulus packages, they oppose a whole range of other areas-very important infrastructure bills and so forth. I will not dwell on those points. I want to concentrate on some very important issues that are before us. I also make the point that these are complex matters for many people to deal with. It involves their retirement incomes and what is a very emotive issue for many milipeople in the defence forces, particularly those who have retired or those who are retiring sometime in the future because of the benefits that they believe they are entitled to, and which they are entitled to-there is no question of that. Everything this government has done in the 2½ years since it was elected has reflected the fact that we are looking to put the best interests of military personnel first, to improve the superannuation schemes that are available to them and to make those schemes reflect the 21st century and not the bygone of 20, 30 or 40 years ago. The commitrather ments of past governments are no longer relevant when considering what military personnel should receive today. We are very committed to ensuring that military personnel have a proper, fair, equitable and indexed set of superannuation arrangements in place, and we are no less committed to modernising the government's arrangements around military superannuation schemes. That is what these bills are about and that is what they do. They do it to improve efficiency, to ensure the sustainability and longevity of those schemes and to make sure that future governments are not caught out when it comes to what are in most cases ostensibly defined schemes where the liability is met by government out of consolidated revenue. It is a very important point that in the scheme proposed in these bills, as in any defined benefits scheme, the contributions going in do not necessarily accumulate to a point where they can fund the liability of the schemes; rather, these schemes are funded out of consolidated revenue by the taxpayer and the contributions made by military personnel. It is very important that we get the governance arrangements right, that these schemes are efficient and that they reflect the changing environment in superannuation. I make a couple of other points before going to the specific details of a couple of areas relating to superannuation. The shadow minister, the member for Cowper, raised these issues when he talked about the increase from nine per cent to 12 per cent, and again the opposition seem not to be supportive. Those opposite talk about the ACTU and how this legislation represents win for unions. I would have thought that it was a win for the people receiving it-ordinary people and workers. Unions do not receive the superannuation. The ACTU as a body does not receive the superannuation. The individual people-the mums and dads and the workers of this country who are the productive people creating the wealth in the economy-receive the suparannuation. It is not the ACTU that receives the superannuation but the workers. So I find it bizarre and offensive that those opposite come in here and say this legislation represents a big win for the ACTU or the unions. I think it is just ridiculous. It is very important to note here that the superannuation system in this country-our national savings-was one of the biggest reasons why we went through the global financial crisis in better shape than did most other countries. We had this really great and sound fundamental base, and I think that important point is lost on those opposite. Making governance improvements and efficiencies and pulling these schemes together under a single trustee body is the right direction to go. I did hear the shadow minister saying that it was the right direction. Of course it is, and for that reason alone the opposition should be supporting these bills rather than going off at tangents about the control of superannuation, a subject. I will come back to. The community, though, certainly understands that the Labor Party is the architect of superannuation in this country. That big step forward in superannuation reform was a other brave move. If you look back 20-plus years from now, you will see the benefits of that, and here we are again with some simple and straightforward though involved reforms on which you would at least expect the opposition to come on board. These reforms are not about politics; they are about military personnel having a win and the best possible arrangements the government can find. The government has gone through an extensive consultation process and had a lot of work done to make sure that it is robust and sound and about proper governance, which are all things that this country is renowned for. So I find it completely odd that the opposition oppose this. Perhaps they are a little bit embarrassed that the government has done more in 2½ years than they did in 12 years-perhaps it is as simple as that. There has been more reform and more good things done on issues of concern to military personnel in the 2½ years that we have been in government than there were in the 12 years that the Howard government was in control. I highlight that point because it relates directly to military superannuation. When the Podger review-which was commissioned and done under the Howard government-was finished and the report delivered, the Howard government refused to release it. We made a commitment in opposition that, should we be elected, we would release that report, and we have done that. I think it needs to be noted that, while the other side put together that review, they would not allow it to become a public document and we did. These bills go to a range of very important matters. They aim to modernise the government's arrangements in the Commonwealth military superannuation schemes without altering those schemes-and this is another point that has been missed by the opposition-or altering the entitlements of members under those schemes. They are retained in full. The purpose of these bills is to follow through on government decisions that were made in 2008 and 2009 to merge the existing trustees of the main Commonwealth civilian and military superannuation schemes to form one single trustee body, which is the correct way forward. The changes that these bills make to both the government's framework and the administrative arrangements for these schemes will make the system more efficient. There are cost savings in making them, and those savings can be passed onto the beneficiaries of those schemes, be they civilian employees of the Commonwealth or military personnel. The bills are about improving efficiency and improving the management of the schemes. They will allow the benefits of the improvements to flow through to everybody involved in those schemes. It is well understood-it is a matter of fact-that small superannuation schemes are less efficient than larger schemes. With Jeremy Cooper doing his review of superannuation, it is also clear that the movement towards larger superannuation schemes is part of the operation of a better system. It protects members, gives them higher efficiencies and better governance and means that they get higher returns from those schemes. While consideration was given to a single trustee body in the arrangements put forward in this bill, the greatest degree of consideration was given to the unique nature of military service and military personnel. The bills should not be treated as though they were put together only in the light of superannuation and then tacked on without consideration of the unique nature of military service and military personnel when they were in fact put together in the opposite way. They were put together to look very specifically at how we preserve, maintain, improve and enhance the schemes for military personnel as well as for people from Commonwealth civilian services. This government would not have set about this process without that being a primary focus and without ensuring that it was the focus by undertaking wide-ranging consultation. These amendments complement the existing features of military superannuation and reflect the special nature of military service. They are completely consistent with the views that have been put forward by military stakeholders, including, as I said at the outset, key ex-service organisations and their members. The unions of military personnel have been consulted and have been supportive. So again it is another big win for military personnel. They are the beneficiaries, not their representative bodies or the unions that represent them. The amendments affect the process for nomination of directors, amongst a range of other things, as you would expect for a governing body under a single trustee. The governing board of the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation, the CSC, will consider matters that relate solely to the military schemes and there is a special provision made to ensure integrity around its operations. In particular, the consolidation of the scheme funds will allow members of the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme, who comprise the bulk of the serving Defence Force personnel, to gain substantial benefits from the merger. As I said earlier, industry experience has shown that size does matter-it matters a lot-when it comes to superannuation. By bringing these together you combine what are essentially very small schemes, almost boutique schemes in some cases, into a much larger, much more robust and fundamentally sound system without changing the schemes themselves. This brings on board the weight of confidence that is created in going from 50,000 or 60,000 members, as in one particular scheme, to 650,000 members-that weight of support of having all those members in those schemes. The merger will bring more than 650,000 members together for the first time under one trustee. This will mean that there will be around $19 billion of funds under this new body. That is a much more workable number in terms of governance and efficiency, and this is enhanced by having a large superannuation governing board. It is not about changing the schemes; the particular features and benefits of the schemes remain the same. I cannot stress that enough because I know for a fact that the opposition will go out there, as they have in other areas, and mislead people about the benefits, the entitlements and the governance provided for in the bill and the outcomes of the amendments. We just heard it from the shadow minister. He just came in here and told everybody, straight out, that the opposition are going to oppose these very good reforms that are supported by the military. They are going to oppose them because it suits their political agenda to do so; unfortunately, military and ex-military personnel will have to pay the price, as will Commonwealth civilian personnel. These bills were developed with a particular priority of maintaining and protecting the features of those military superannuation schemes. As I have said-I cannot say it enough in this debate-specific additional issues were raised, considered and dealt with by key ex-service organisations, including the Returned and Services League. We have evidence of a strong commitment to recognise that unique military service and we have the backing of those organisations. The amendments make changes to a range of things. I took particular note of what the shadow minister was saying and his concerns about the powers of the Minister for Finance and Deregulation or perhaps the Chief of the Defence Force and others who are members of the board. The reality is that the finance minister can only make certain changes if he consults with the Minister for Defence in relation to the appointment and termination of employer directors on the board. I do not see how anybody could argue against the finance minister having to consult. I would have thought that consultation with the defence minister in relation to specific appointees to the board is the sort of shared power you would want in a military superannuation scheme. I think that is a worthy aim. If this provision were not included in the legislation, I bet you anything you like that the opposition would come in here and say, ‘There's no consultation by the government. They're wielding power. They're going to do this of their own volition and not consult with anybody.' We actually are consulting. The finance minister must consult with the defence minister, which is a very sound move. Having more insight and expertise in the area of defence, the defence minister should be consulted by the finance minister in these very important matters. The changes go a few steps further. The Chief of the Defence Force also needs to consult with one or more relevant organisations in nominating member directors for appointment to the board-so there is another consultation process that needs to take place. These relevant organisations include organisations that promote the interests of the beneficiaries under the scheme, such as the RSL and other service and ex-service organisations. We have ensured that that consultation process involves not just the executive of government but also the executive of defence and the representative bodies of serving and ex-service personnel. That is the right way forward-these are the sorts of consultation processes needed to improve the system. We also ensure that there is a requirement for at least one of the employee directors nominated by the Chief of the Defence Force to be present when the board is deliberating on an issue that relates to military schemes, which is an arrangement that does not exist at present. This is to ensure that they cannot be excluded and that the voice of the military is always present-it must be present. I cannot understand the kind of waffle that we got from the shadow minister about how the military voice would somehow not be there when the military voice is clearly there through the Chief of the Defence Force, the structure of the board and the consultation process, as well as ensuring that at least one of those board members must be present in relation to any issue that relates to the tary schemes, and also a change to the membership of the dedicated defence committee to prescribe to the chair of that committee that one of the directors also be on the board of the CSC. So not only is that taking place at a broader level but specifically on the board for the military superannuation schemes. These are consistent changes to what takes place in the broader community and what takes place in Commonwealth Public Service superannuation schemes and are reflective of best practice. They are reflective of the best opportunity for military personnel to maintain and improve their access to superannuation and also their termination payments, to make sure that those are the maximum they possibly can be under the schemes. There are also a number of technical matters, but, having dealt with the substantive matters, I will leave the technical matters to one side. Unfortunately, and also a bit sadly, there has been a misinformation campaign by some in the community about changes to superannuation and the old DFRB Scheme, the DFRDB Scheme and the more recent MSB scheme. I just want to make a couple of quick notes. One is that none of those schemes have disappeared. While there are no new entrants into those schemes, they still exist for those people who are members of those schemes. The issues that are being raised in a number of forums are misleading and are not based on fact. The government has gone to some lengths with the best interests of the military-serving and exmilitary-personnel at heart and will continue-(Time expired)",58
25,Mr BALDWIN,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"I rise today to speak on the Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Bill 2010 and cognate bills. Simply put, the bills set out to combine all current miliCommonwealth civilian and military superannuation trustees, namely the Australian Reward Investment Alliance, the Military Superannuation and Benefits Board and the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority, into one body. The new trustee, which is to be named the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation, or CSC, will be responsible for the administration of the following schemes: the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, the Public Sector Superannuation accumulation plan, the scheme provided for under the Papua New Guinea (Staffing Assistance) Act, the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme, or the MSBS, the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme, or the DFRDB, the scheme established under the Superannuation Act 1922 and the Defence Force Retirement Benefits Scheme. This bill will impact on approximately 650,000 members of the various civilian and military superannuation schemes. Furthermore, the proposed CSC would be responsible for managing approximately $19 billion worth of combined military and civilian funds, which would include approximately $16 billion currently managed by the ARIA board and $3 billion currently managed by the MSBS board. It is therefore critical that this bill and its potential impacts on the members of the various Commonwealth superannuation funds be properly examined. I note that my colleague, the shadow minister for superannuation, the member for Cowper, has focused on the broader impacts of this bill as it relates to Commonwealth superannuation schemes. During my time today, I will be speaking specifically on the effects that this bill will have on members the various military superannuation schemes, namely the MSBS, the DFRDB and the DFRB. Fundamentally the government believes that increased returns for members can be generated through streamlining the administration of the schemes and creating a larger singular pool of investment funds, thereby increasing benefits and financial turns to the various scheme members. Importantly, however, whether or not members will receive any benefit remains to be seen, and no guarantees have been made by the Rudd Labor government. All that has been indicated by the Rudd Labor government is that by merging the military and civilian schemes, the additional investment returns would, if based on 2008 figures, be about $10 million in the first year, $15 million in 2018 and $19 million in 2028. I agree that the funds from the ARIA managed schemes and those schemes managed by the MSBS board should be combined. In fact, if we are to believe the government, which is becoming harder and harder by the day, then most ex-service organisations would agree with that logic. However, this is not the sticking point with regard to this legislation, even though the government has tried to paint it as such. The real sticking points are the governance arrangements and, more importantly, the fact that this bill fails to take into account the unique nature of military service. On the matter of governance arrangements, this bill stipulates the CSC will have a board consisting of 10 directors, plus one chairperson. Three of those directors will be nominated by the president of the ACTU, five will be nominated by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, but only two will be nominated by the Chief of the Defence Force. It becomes very clear very quickly why the coalition and indeed the ADF community oppose this bill. The coalition cannot support the inclusion of three of trade unionists on a board that is responsible for managing military superannuation. The coalition does not support these arrangements because, by the sheer weight of numbers under the CSC governance structure, the two votes of the CDF nominated directors will be rendered insignificant. I acknowledge the finance minister's eleventhre- hour amendment, which would mandate that all matters relating specifically to the interests of military members must have a quorum of a least one CDF nominated director in attendance. But that simply does not go far enough, and the weight of numbers on the CSC board will significantly disadvantage military members. Just why the Rudd Labor government believes there should be three ACTU appointed directors and only two CDF appointed directors remains unclear, but given that the ALP is at the helm, it is hardly surprising. The coalition also takes considerable issue with the arrangements that give the President of the ACTU the determining voice in the dismissal of ACTU directors. The effect the regulation contained in subclause 10(4) has on governance arrangements is best illustrated through an example. If an ACTU appointed director who is responsible for making decisions that affect hundreds of thousands of people and who is responsible for managing tens of billions of dollars worth of investment funds was himself to become bankrupt, for example, they should be removed from the CSC board. However, this legislation stipulates that the minister for finance is unable to remove that person. In fact the only person who can remove an ACTU director is the President of the ACTU. I find it quite extraordinary that the minister for finance is subordinate to the President of the ACTU. In fact, it is not extraordinary-it is downright preposterous. What makes matters worse is that this issue was raised directly with the minister for finance by the coalition and the ex-service community, and yet he has still failed to tify this glaring legislative problem. The minister for finance has failed to appreciate the implications contained within subclause 10(4) because this minister believes consultation is a one-way street. The minister believes that a single meeting and a follow-up brief a couple of months later-but no earlier than 24 hours before reintroducing the amended legislation-constitutes meaningful dialogue. I met with the minister for finance regarding this bill in good faith. I did so on behalf of the coalition and on behalf of the veteran community, who raised many of their objections directly with me. Unfortunately, all that resulted from this was a commitment by the government to ensure that the amended legislation contained strengthened provisions for consultation-which is somewhat ironic because consultation is the exact thing that this government failed to do before drafting this legislation. The proposed amendments contained in this bill are as follows: a requirement for the CDF to consult with relevant organisations on the appointment of two military directors; a requirement for the minister for finance to consult with the Minister for Defence on appointing the five employer representatives; a requirement for the minister for finance to consult the Minister for Defence on the appointment of the ComSuper CEO; a requirement for a quorum on matters relating specifically to the interests of military members to include one CDF nominated director; a requirement for decisions made by the board to include one CDF appointed director when issues relate to the interests of military members; and a requirement that the chair of the Defence Force Case Assessment Committee is one of the CDF nominated directors. Interestingly, there is no mention of the composition of the board-with three ACTU rec- appointed directors and only two CDF appointed directors. There is no mention of how only the President of the ACTU can dismiss ACTU appointed directors. There is also no mention of the coalition's proposed amendments. Furthermore, there is no mention of the unique nature of military service and how this bill and the amendments are supposed to safeguard the issues of current and former ADF personnel. Having canvassed the major governance issues that remain in this flawed legislation, would now like to turn to the matter of the unique nature of military service. The Defence Force Welfare Association, the DFWA, has a long history of representing the interests of current and ex-service personnel and their families on a range of issues. Most notably, the DFWA is vocal on issues such as service conditions, including health care and family support. But they are also vocal, as I am sure Minister Tanner is aware, on matters such as military superannuation reform. It is appropriate, therefore, that I raise one of the core issues the DFWA has identified in this bill, and not simply cause I appreciate those concerns but because the DFWA in this instance best encapsulates the sentiment emanating from the service and ex-service communities. The view of the Defence Force Welfare Association and, I might add, the vast majority of those who have written directly to me regarding this bill, is that, by combining the military and civilian schemes, the unique nature of military service will be further eroded. The DFWA has said: Unique service requires unique solutions, not ones which further blur the distinction between the uniqueness of military service and civilian norms. Those that know of the DFWA's views on such matters will be more than familiar with their stance regarding the uniqueness of military service. I do not think there would be any opposition from those in the House when I say that I too believe that serving in the military equates to a very unique type of national service. Of course, I can understand why veterans and those organisations that represent them believe that the unique nature of military service is under threat. It must be remembered that the Rudd Labor government promised, in the 2007 Labor election policy document, that it would: … maintain a generous military superannuation I system in recognition of the importance of the ADF and the immense responsibility placed on personnel in securing and defending Australia. Of course, the veteran community now know that the Rudd Labor government took them for a ride. They know that they were used purely for political reasons and that they can no longer trust the Rudd Labor government. It is little wonder, then, that the DFWA believes that this bill will lead to the further erosion of their benefits, even in the face of assurances offered by the minister for finance. After all, this is the same minister who declared that the Rudd Labor governbe- ment was satisfied that the consumer price index was the most suitable indexation method by which to index veterans' superannuation pensions. I want to reiterate my words from only a week ago, when I spoke on a private member's motion regarding the uniqueness of military service: I and the coalition have always considered and will always consider service rendered by our military personnel as unique. Although I have not served in the ADF, I have had many opportunities to experience the many facets of service life through, for example, my work as the shadow minister for defence science and personnel, through my participation in the ADF parliamentary program and most recently by spending a week with Australian troops on the ground in Afghanistan with my colleagueshadow parliament secretaryStuart Robert. But, then again, I would argue that one need not have served in the military to understand the unique nature of that service. Simply ask the spouse of a current serving member and they will, I have no doubt, convey to you the uniqueness of their husband's or wife's service. Serving in the Australian Defence Force is unique not only for what members are asked to give for their country; it is unique for all that they forgo in the name of that servicefor example, missing the birth of their son or daughter because they were deployed on operations in the Middle East, or missing out on Christmas with family and friends because they were assisting in a diaster relief effort at home or abroad. Perhaps one of the finest summations of the uniqueness of military service I have read to date comes from David Jamison, President of the DFWA who said: In volunteering for military service, the individual accepts the surrender of his or her basic rights under Article 3 and places his or her life, liberty and security of person in the hands of the State. This surrender is not unconditional, though in extremis, it is absolute. Given the unique nature of military service-so eloquently encapsulated in Mr Jamison's quote-it is not surprising that both current and former ADF members take acute opposition to the proposed composition of the new CSC board and the effect that this legislation will have on further blurring the distinction between military and non-military service. In fact, these issues were raised in almost every submission to the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee hearing on this bill and have been raised in every piece of correspondence that I have received from concerned members and ex-members of the ADF. The coalition is opposing this legislation because it is flawed in its current form. The legislation is being opposed because it ignores the central tenet that military service is unique and it is being opposed because the Rudd Labor government failed to consult with the very people whom this legislation will affect the most: those men and women who are currently in or were in the Australian Defence Force. It will probably come as no shock that the Rudd Labor government failed to consult with those affected. They did not bother to consult with any of the organisations that represent past and present members of the ADF. Organisations like the Defence Force Welfare Association or the RAAF Association were simply not included in the lead-up to the development of this legislation. That is symptomatic of this Rudd Labor government. It attempts to introduce new legislation without even consulting with those it will affect. The new mining supertax is but another example in a suite of examples. It was only after the coalition flagged concerns with the current legislation and pushed for a Senate committee enquiry that organisations like DFWA and the RAAF Association were given the chance to have their collective voices heard and to express their views. Only then were individuals able to submit their personal views on this flawed legislation-legislation which would directly affect them. Even as late as yesterday, when the Rudd Labor government thought it was appropriate to inform the coalition of its amendments to this bill, they still had not consulted widely. In fact, the briefing note did not mention who the Rudd Labor government supposedly consulted with within the ex-service community, only that those in the ex-service community generally agreed with their amendments. It will come as no shock, but I take issue with such an assessment, particularly when ex-service organisations and veterans continue to tell me exactly the opposite and that they remain opposed to this legislation. Furthermore, the Defence Force Welfare Association has said that the Rudd Labor government's reference to the view of all the ex-service organisations at an ESO round-table were ‘disingenuous' and that: Most of what are outlined as the outcomes of the discussion came from ESO leaders comments who had not had the chance to be fully briefed on the issues and were unprepared for substantive discussions on the topic. In complete contrast with the Rudd Labor government's approach to this legislation, the coalition has listened to current Australian Defence Force members, veterans, ex-service people and ex-service organisations. The coalition consulted widely, and we had the common decency to listen to those who will be affected by these legislative changes. If the Rudd Labor government had bothered to engage with the veteran community and current serving members before drafting the legislation, they would have quickly realised that merely gaining administrative efficiency is not a sufficient reason for the introduction of this bill. While this bill may help streamline the administration of Commonwealth superannuation schemes, that alone is not a sufficient justification for the amalgamation of all Commonwealth civilian and military schemes. While the bill may provide some financial benefits to members, the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Mr Tanner, has not done enough to convince past and present ADF members that financial benefits alone will be worth the diminution of their status on an amalgamated military and civilian board. The coalition has raised its concerns directly with the minister for finance and has discussed alternatives to the current proposed legislation, including the introduction of separate civilian and military boards. The coalition's proposal would see the continuation of a single civilian board but would introduce a single military board that would administer all the military schemes, including the DFRDB and MSBS boards. Such a construct would simplify administration arrangements-an aim of the proposed legislation-while also helping to ensure that the unique nature of military service is recognised. The proposal would also provide the potential for additional financial gains for members through the amalgamation of all civilian and military invested funds. Furthermore, whilst it is envisaged that the two boards would have a common chairperson, no director would be able to be appointed to both the civilian and the military boards. Lastly, the coalition proposes a sunset clause in the legislation that would allow for the review of the proposed construct after three to five years in order to ensure that both military and civilian investment funds are being managed appropriately and in the best interests of their members. Unfortunately, Minister Tanner did not take on board even one suggestion put forward by the coalition. Instead, as I have previously mentioned, he thought it best to simply present the government's amendments to the coalition at the eleventh hour. Mr Speaker, that is not consultation but merely an illusion designed to give the impression of consultation-and we all know that this government receives top marks for its smokeand-mirrors campaigns right now. The Rudd Labor government is being not only obstructionist but also obstinate in its lack of willingness to come to the table and negotiate acceptable outcomes with the coalition. We have said to the minister for finance that we have no problem with combining the investment funds in order to increase financial returns, but we have also said that our first responsibility is to govern in the national interest, which includes defence interests and the interests of current and former defence personnel. The coalition remains committed to ensuring that their interests and assets are protected, and they simply will not be when only two members of a 10person board represent the interests of military members. We do not believe that the safeguard measures proposed by the finance minister are enough. Our discussions with ESOs as late as last night have shown that there will be a great amount of concern regarding this legislation. The finance minister should not misrepresent what the ESOs have said and should not claim that they have agreed to his amendments-because, simply put, they have not. The reality is that fundamental deficiencies remain with this legislation, and the coalition will not be supporting these bills in their current form.",62
26,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"Thank you for your contribution. I point out to the member for Paterson that, as much as I would be honoured to be elected to be the Speaker of this great chamber, I am in fact only a lowly Deputy Speaker. Thank you!",68
27,Mr GRIFFIN,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"Bruce-Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel) (12.28 pm)- Mr lowly Deputy Speaker, humble as you are, I have known you for a long time and a fine Deputy Speaker you are. The Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Bill 2010 and related legislation is legislation that ought to be supported. It ought to be supported by the entire parliament and it ought to be supported across the defence community, because it is actually in the interests of those it seeks to represent. It is the interests, overwhelmingly, of those who are superannuation scheme members, particularly in the military sector, and it is overwhelmingly in the interests of the government of this nation, the governance of these schemes and the performance of these schemes with respect to those for whom they seek to provide support. There are some things we can agree on with the member for Paterson. He made mention of the fact that there has been misrepresentation going on. I agree, but I think the agreement stops there, because there is then the question of who has been doing the misrepresenting. In the context of superannuation, a lot of that misrepresentation has in fact been by the coalition in terms of misinterpreting commitments made by this government and acted upon by this government in government and also about the way this debate has developed in the broader community. I will pick up on a couple of points he made as I go through. I will not go to the detail of the amendments, because the member for Paterson outlined some of the key components and we will be dealing with the detail of those amendments in the consideration in detail stage. As a starting point I will pick up on the issue of consultation. Firstly, and I will make it very clear, I apologise-and I have apologised publicly-to the ex-service community for the way that consultation on this bill initially occurred: it was not sufficient. In fact, it should have been better and there is absolutely no doubt about that. However, having said that-and I will make this point in more detail in a second-when this legislation was explained to members of the ex-service community at the Ex-Service Organisation Round Table, at which some 13 national ESOs were represented, one particular member there described the changes as a ‘noin brainer'. So, frankly, one of the reasons why there was not consultation to the degree that people have sought on this bill and on the aspects of the bill that have been up for discussion is that it just makes sense-that is, the changes that need to be made to the governance of superannuation schemes that we are here to deal with today. The opposition have tried to separate out issues and say, ‘We're happy with the good things in terms of the increased performance of investments-we think that's all fine-but what we want you to do is throw the rest out and just concentrate on that,' without, I think, taking into account the fact that that does not get you the reforms you need to ensure you have a modern and viable superannuation scheme in place for the ex-service community and the serving service community into the future. I, of course, will concentrate my comments on the military because that is where my responsibilities lie and that is where the concerns have been raised about the operation of the system. Having made a mistake with the consultation-and I accept that-we took action. We pulled the bills to allow discussions to occur. We went out and started talking to people. I want to particularly thank Ken Doolan, the National President of the RSL, who was the first person to raise with me the concerns the ex-service community had about elements of this legislation. I want to thank him for his constructive involvement as we considered the amendments and tried to work on a way through some of these issues. Those ex-service organisations and, overwhelmingly, those individuals who have expressed concerns about this legislation frequently used the term ‘symbolic'. They say there are symbolic issues here which go to the issue of how military service should be treated. Many of those people have said to me that in fact it is symbolic. The point symbolism is that it is often very important, and I understand why. But it is symbolic and in that context it does not go to the central question of how these systems will operate and the sorts of benefits they will deliver to those who are members of these schemes. Following the concerns that were raised, the government launched itself into a consultative process to ensure we got the views of the ex-service community. There were several things that were done. They were individual discussions with some of the ESOs that have been mentioned about what their concerns were, to endeavour to find a way through to ensure that those concerns were accommodated in the final version of the legislation that is before us today. There was also a discussion around these issues and a briefing of the Prime Ministerial Advisory Council on Ex-Service Matters, which is made up of a range of representatives selected from across the nation to represent to the government issues of concern within the ex-service community. As mentioned by the member for Paterson, there was also a discussion at the ExService Organisation Round Table, or ESO Round Table, which is another consultative mechanism that this government has for dealing with issues within the ex-service community. I might add that it is one of the consultative mechanisms this government has in place, because when the opposition were in government they never had anything like it to provide the same sort of feedback because they did not want to know. They did not want to know what those organisations thought or cared about. In the briefing that occurred at the ESO Round Table, there was a wide-ranging discussion, and a couple of the points-and I will pick up on what the member for Paterson said-need to be made very clear. Apart from comments like, ‘This about is a no-brainer,' there were concerns expressed by particular organisations. At the conclusion of that discussion, I said-and I know I said it; I was there-very clearly to those present that any organisation there that had concerns and wished to consider the matter further should contact the adviser responsible in the minister for finance's office to discuss those concerns and that we would happily give them several weeks to provide us with the details and sorts of concerns that they believed should be dealt with in any amendment process. So what we have heard about what occurred at that meeting is a canard; it is rubbish. The assertion that that was the full story is wrong. I inform the House that, of those 13 ex-service organisations that were represented, three of them felt the need to come back and make representations to the government about the concerns that they had and seek amendments to address those concernsthree out of 13. They were: the DFWA, as has been mentioned; the AVADSC, the Australian Veterans and Defence Services Council; and the RSL. They were the three organisations. I suspect it will be argued eral other organisations may have tasked one of these organisations with conveying their concerns. I can say to the House that, from the discussions I have had with many of those people in the time since, they certainly believed that following those briefings and their consideration of the details they felt much more comfortable about going forward. As I said, three came forward-three-to say, ‘We want to put forward more views about what should be dealt with here,' and, overwhelmingly, the concerns that those three organisations raised have been addressed in these amendments. It is fair to that in terms of the DFWA I suspect that not all their concerns have been addressed, but I can say that the concerns of the RSL have been addressed, as I believe also have been the concerns, as far as they can be, of the Australian Veterans and Defence Services Council. The other 10 organisations represented at that ESO Round Table did not even feel a need to come forward with further details with respect to what needs to be done. The changes being proposed through these amendments address those sorts of concerns. Much has been made by the shadow minister, and I know will be made by other members on the other side, about uniqueness of military service. I agree with the concept of the uniqueness of military service. I had the privilege of speaking at a DFWA seminar last year which was related to that very issue. The point I made at that time-and it is a point that I will make today-is that I frankly and genuinely believe that the concept of the uniqueness of military service is accepted and agreed across this chamber. The question is: what do you get for it? What are the particular conditions and aspects that need to be taken into account, and to what degree, to ensure that we fully recognise, fully compensate and fully honour that sevthat uniqueness of service? I think the arguments from the other side continually coming back to those particular points are, frankly, rhetoric rather than questions of actual detail. I will use a couple of examples, given the way this debate has developed under the comments from the member for Paterson. He quoted from our policy, Labor's Plan for Defence, at the last election, and again I will quote that policy. It said: A Rudd Labor Government will maintain a generous military superannuation system, in recognition of the importance of the ADF and the immense responsibility placed on personnel in securing and defending Australia. say There is a key word there-‘maintain'. Is the system of military superannuation as it currently stands the same as it was under the previous government? Yes, it is. We have maintained it. When those on the other side now say that it needs to be changed, I guess the questions are: in what way, how do they intend to do it, and why didn't they do it over 10 years? What may well then be raised is the fact that of course they had a review. They did have a review, and I had a bit to say about that review at the time. Frankly, those on the other side have on occasions endeavoured to verbal me about the policy document and what it says in respect of some of that question of these matters. They had the Podger review into military superannuation and it reported to the then minister in July 2007. The circumstances then were that it was hidden from public gaze. It is fair enough to say that quite often with a substantive report the circumstances are that a government will want to consider it before they release it and then release their response at the same time. But, frankly, this particular report was causing quite a bit of concern within the ex-service and military communities. We did not know what was in it and the circumstances were that we were heading up to an election. I called for the report to be released. I acknowledged that there might not be sufficient time for a substantive government response but my view was that it ought to be released so that would be aware of what was under consideration. They would have the opportunity to consider what those recommendations were and to provide a view to government about whether that was the way to go forward. In those circumstances, in the lead-up to an election, that is the least that the government of the day could do. But, no, the previous government sat on the report. It refused to release it. It held off until they got caretaker period and then that was the end of it. We made a commitment to release it within a month of becoming the government and to consult publicly about the detail of that report. And that is what we did. We released it publicly on 24 December, I think, just short of the month, and we then set out a process under the then Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, the member for Lingiari, Warren Snowdon, to consult with the broader ex-service community and the military community about whether the recommendations from Podger were the way they thought superannuation should go. Do you know what? Minister Snowdon conducted that consultation and review, and the overwhelming response through that consultation process was that the military community and the ex-services community did not want Podger because the changes involved were not in line with what they saw as the best way to maintain the uniqueness of military service and a proper beneficial system for military superannuants into the future. That produced a problem for this government. We had a report from the previous government outlining a set of recommendations which clearly, once we consulted, the community did not want. And, frankly, we have been struggling with that issue ever since. I guess my question to the other side is: are you going to do Podger? Is that what people you think we should be doing? Frankly, those recommendations did not maintain the sort of beneficial system that you say we should have. Some of the organisations you have talked about-and I mention the DFWA in particular-made it very, very clear to us that they did not want Podger. In fact when I raised this point at that ESO Round Table just the other month, the national president of the DFWA made it very clear that they did into the not want us to act on Podger. So there is a point there. When I talked back then about the need to clarify the situation around military superannuation, I made very clear that it was about the intentions of the then government around the changes they were going to make. It was particularly on the issue of where their secret report was, what they intended to do with it, and why they had not released it. Surely, if they were going to be fair dinkum with the defence community, they would have that information out there. They did not. They were not interested in ensuring that there was consultation then. I want to pick up on a couple of other points about that. Quite often what is being said about the government's position in this area uses selective quotations out of the policy documents that we had at that time. In fact, words have been used based on a heading in our policy document on veterans' affairs which talks about ‘restoring the value of compensation entitlements'. But there was not just a heading; there was a series of commitments that were outlined and then spelt out very, very clearly. One of the things that I was continually being told was that the ex-service community and the defence community were worried about what was not said. Well, we said what we would do, we made it very specific and, frankly, we have actually implemented overwhelmingly the commitments that we made. But we did not commit to changing the indexation methodology around the question of military superannuation, and neither did the previous government. The difference is that we said we would have a look at it and would review it; the previous government refused to, for over a decade. But now, apparently, in opposition-and as with so many issues-all of a sudden they think that maybe they have some ideas in this area and maybe there is something they can do. There have been recent comments made by the opposition. I quote the member for Paterson from Hansard on 24 May: … I want to assure that the veteran community that the coalition remains committed to introducing a fair, equitable, financially responsible military superannuation system and that we will pursue these reforms when in government … I say to the opposition: you remain committed to it, you are clearly making it clear there that you expect changes to be made, and yet when you were in government you did not. You commissioned a report, which you then refused to release. Then we released the report and consulted with the ex-service community, and they do not want it. So what are you really saying you are committed to? The Leader of the Opposition, the member for Warringah, made comments on this issue in a recent speech, on 23 April, when he said: The Government has also reneged on its commitment before the 2007 election to restore the value of military superannuation by rectifying indexation arrangements. No such commitment was made. Once again, it is Phony Tony off on another sound bite. He then said, in the same speech: … it will be important to tackle this issue as soon as the budget is back in surplus. I could go on about ‘gospel truth' and the issue about prepared remarks and all of that. But what I would say about that is: if they were not prepared to act on this issue over a 10-year period with a series of surpluses that were records, why would anyone think they would act upon it some time in the future when they may be back in government again and may be in the situation of having a surplus to deal with? The bottom line is that their record in government is not that long ago-a matter of less than three years-and their record in government is very clear. I note the member for Herbert has come into the chamber. He is a recent convert-publicly at least-on the question of the indexation issue. I also know he has quoted from a press release of mine when he has talked about this issue and publicly circulated documentation. Of course, if he had read the full press release he would know it does not relate to the issue as he maintained at the time-and he knows that because it has been raised with him from other sources. In those circumstances, he ought to think about what he has to say when he gets chance to speak. These bills are important. They deliver significant benefits to the ex-service community and to serving personnel, particularly those who are members of the MSBS. The actuarial service provider Mercer has considered the potential improved net investment return as a result of merging these funds. On the estimations, we are talking about significant differences for individuals. In certain circumstances, depending on their time in and their rank, it can be as much as $20,000 to $50,000 for quite a few. For some at very senior ranks after very long careers, on normal investment estimations it can be up to as much as $200,000. These bills should be passed. (Time expired)",68
28,Mr LINDSAY,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"Herbert) (12.49 pm)The members of the Australian Defence Force are becoming increasingly concerned and increasingly cynical about the current government's approach to and support for the Australian Defence Force. There was a commitment at the last election that the government would not cut funding for defence. As with so many other issues that we see with the government, what they say before an election and what actually happens in practice are two different things. On the last list that I saw there were 47 broken promises of the Rudd government. The community is waking up and finally beginning to understand that what they saw at the last election was not what they got. It is very concerning indeed. Members of the Defence Force are no different, because a promise not to cut the defence budget in real terms has ground in cuts all over the place. The defence community is saying, ‘How could this be?' Of course, it is related to the strategic review program, which is to make $20 billion worth of cuts over the next 10 years. We have seen this very recently in the cuts in things like training days for reserves. There have been cuts of 50 per cent for reserve solistered. diers' training days. Reserves form a very significant part of our operational deployments these days. We cannot go overseas without having reservists fill places in the system. We depend on them, so their training must be up to scratch. But you cannot have that if you cut the training days. We also heard questions of Defence in Senate estimates this week about family reunion travel, which particularly applies to soldiers in Townsville and Darwin. They have an entitlement to a number of trips to return south to their homes to re-engage with their families. The suggestion was put to the CDF that this entitlement was going to be removed. Surprise, surprise-the CDF said no, there had been no move to do that, but then a public servant told estimates that a committee under General Craig Orme was already looking at this. You do not establish a committee if you do not intend to come up with a recommendation to actually make cuts. I am saying to the parliament that the soldiers in 1 Brigade and 3 Brigade would be extraordinarily angry if Defence tried to make any changes to the family reunion travel entitlement that they currently enjoy. You will say this is not related to the bill, so why have I said it? It is because it underlines how you cannot actually trust what the government says. This is a bill to amalgamate a number of Australian government superannuation schemes, and of course two defence super schemes are involved. I remain deeply suspicious about what this means for those who will be the beneficiaries of these superresulted on the annuation schemes. The coalition cannot support the Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Bill 2010 as it is presented today. Merging of all of the civil and military boards into one Commonwealth super corporation will have a negative impact on how military superannuation schemes are adminI can tell you that the veterans out there, when they heard of this proposal, went berserk. They could see a takeover of their schemes by people not related to the military who did not understand the nature of military service. Certainly in Townsville there is universal rejection of what the government is proposing in this respect in this bill today. The defence community want a separate board to be responsible for military superannuation. We certainly heard this in their submissions to the Senate inquiry on this bill conducted by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. I note that the Australian Veterans and Defence Services Council Incorporated said: What is happening to military superannuation amounts to a scaling back of conditions of service to conform to what is provided in civilian employment. … … … The merger of military superannuation boards with civilian superannuation boards are seen to submerge Defence Force interests in a culture that would have difficulty in accepting the circumstances of military life in the tions of service. Of course, the Defence Welfare Association, led by David Jamison, also has serious problems with this bill. They gave the same evidence to the Senate committee. Specifically, the board of the new corporation will be made up of 10 people, five of whom will be appointed by the minister for finance, three by the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and only two by the Chief of the Defence Force. As soon as you see the Australian Council of Trade Unions on the board of military superannuation schemes, it rings alarm bells. People on the board of a military superannuation scheme should be military people and the like or professional people who have the expertise in relation to the management of superannuation schemes. The veterans community and members of the ADF will not accept this proposal from the government. We firmly believe that clauses 16(5) and 16(6) should be removed from the legislation. We will not support the bill as it stands with the provisions requiring the consent of the President of the ACTU to remove a director. Additionally, the coalition feels that important amendments need to be made to ensure that those covered by military superannuation schemes are not disadvantaged. These changes include having separate civilian and military boards. A military superannuation board can include the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme, the Defence Force Retirements and Death Benefit Scheme and the Defence Force retirement benefits schemes. The military superannuation board would have control of all of the matters of governance relating to military superannuation. A person would not be able to serve as a director on the board of the civilian and military schemes at the same time; however, the boards would have the same structure of condichairperson. I want to make it clear in representing Australia's largest military base, in Townsville, and RAAF Townsville and the veterans in Townsville that they and I will not accept the proposals being put up to the parliament today by the government, and I will vote accordingly. I thank the parliament for the opportunity to make this contribution and to make the feelings of my electors known in no uncertain terms.",73
29,Mrs MARKUS,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak on the Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Bill 2010 and associated bills, which seek to amalgamate the management of Australia's military and civilian superannuation schemes into one new authority, the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation. At the outset I would like to indicate my and the coalition's opposition to these bills. I commend the words of the shadow minister for superannuation and the shadow minister for defence personnel, the members for Cowper and Paterson respectively, in this debate so far. In February this year the Rudd Labor government introduced legislation to merge the management of the boards of six superannuation authorities into one new super authority, the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation. The CSC is to be managed by a 10-person board comprising five nominees of the minister for finance; three nominees of the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the ACTU; and two nominees of the Chief of the Defence Force. Already the government has announced the preferred choice of the CDF for his nominees on the board as well as the proposed chair of the person board. One of the characteristics of the way this issue has been handled is the lack of consultation initially between the government and the ex-service community. At the time of the tabling of these bills, not one of the leaders of the major ex-service organisations had spoken to the government about the reforms proposed in these bills. It was only after the coalition applied pressure to the government that an inquiry was held by the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee into the measures proposed. During the short Senate inquiry, some 197 submissions were received from ex-service and veteran organisations and individuals, the majority of which strongly opposed the proposed reforms. Most of the submissions highlighted the unique nature of military vice. Service in the military is indeed unique and both sides of the House support this concept. It is reflected in the fact that military superannuation has always been separately managed and legislated for. There are currently two superannuation management boards: the Defence Retirement and Death Benefits Authority and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Board. Together with the Australian Reward Investment Authority, ARIA, which manages civilian public service superannuation, these three boards are scheduled to merge into one new authority. The merging of the military and civilian superannuation boards will forever blur the distinction which exists currently and in the past that defence service is unique service. Military service is unlike any other service in our nation. The government argues that the consolidation of trustee arrangements is aimed at strengthening governance and providing opportunities for increased efficiency in trustee operations, yet there is no evidence that there will be any improvement provided under the 10- merger proposed by the Rudd Labor government. After tabling the legislation in February, the government began what it called ‘consultations' with the ex-service community. At an ex-service round-table, the government warmed-we are told-to the concept of making some amendments which the ex-service community would find agreeable. I am informed that both parties departed reasonably pleased, with the ex-service community of the view that it would receive some concessions from the government at the very least over the way the boards were constituted. This week, however, the government indicated it would make only minor amendments to the bills, simply legislating for consultation in the way nominees are appointed to the board. While the increased level of consultation is a first step, it does not ser- deal with some of the more fundamental issues associated with the bill. This bill legislates a powerful role for the President of the ACTU in the management of future superannuation liabilities for Australia's civilian and military superannuants. Under these rules, it will be the President of the ACTU who will have the final say on the appointment of three of the 10 board members on the new board. The three ACTU nominees will be unable to be sacked for poor performance by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation unless the President of the ACTU agrees. It seems the President of the ACTU will have an almost greater say than the minister in how the board is run, especially given at least one of the ACTU nominated board members is required to be in attendance at all times for a quorum to be present. The only guarantee that defence superannuants have in their superannuation being managed with someone with even a sliver of prior knowledge of the unique nature of military superannuation is a requirement that at least one of the two defence nominees is present at any meeting which determines matters about defence superannuants. There is little protection in reality for defence interests when just one defence representative goes up against three trade unionists. The coalition is determined to be the voice for the veteran and ex-service community on these bills. The sheer number of submissions from the ex-service and veteran community opposing these bills only confirmed our resolve to oppose these bills. With the government indicating that they are not prepared to negotiate and amend these bills in line with the broader wishes of the representatives of the ex-service community they say they consulted with, the coalition will continue to stand firm. The member for Cowper has already indicated the opposition of ex-service organisations such as the Defence Force Welfare Association and the Australian Veterans and Defence Services Council. The President of the DFWA, David Jamison, said just yesterday: Reference to the reviews of all ex-service organiEqually, sations being canvassed at an ESO round table meeting and the purported summary of the outcomes of the discussion is somewhat disingenuous. Mr Jamison goes on to say: Unfortunately, despite moving a long way from our original position of total opposition of the amalgamation of the governance structure to try to accommodate the Government's stated objectives, there has been insufficient recognition of our points in the proposed amendments for us to remove our objections to these Bills as they now stand. The defence community is understandably very concerned about the erosion of veterans' and Defence Force personnel entitlements. In their submission to the Senate inquiry, the Defence Force Welfare Association stated: The special nature of military services makes it necessary for the ADF to design conditions of service that will continue to attract and retain personnel despite the hazards and hardships of military life. The need to compensate members of the ADF for the unique nature of military service through their superannuation, invalidity and death benefits as with their other conditions of service. Further, the submission states: It is important to maintain that relative distinction so that people considering joining the ADF and those already serving can recognise the adequacy of their conditions, given the additional hardships and risks inherent in ADF service. A diminution in the relative value of these benefits could have adverse effects on the ADF's ability to recruit and retain the personnel it needs to fulfil its functions. This could affect the viability of the ADF workforce as a whole, which would have significant implications for the Government's ability to maintain its national security policies. Any alleged administrative savings, indicated at $1 million over four years, or increased returns on investments are welcomed and supported by the veteran community. ex-service leaders saw value in the pooling of funds to create higher returns for members. But some in the ex-service community wanted additional guarantees that the nature of military service would be protected in these reforms. Amending the bills to ensure consultation has not gone far enough. There is no guaranteed military superannuants subcommittee with appropriate military representation to deal with the unique nature of military claims. The issue of military superannuation is very close to the heart of the veteran community. There are almost 180,000 veterans and current serving personnel upon whom these bills will directly impact. They are not an insignificant number of Australians. From opposition, the only pledge that Labor made to military superannuants was: - To restore the value of compensation and prevent further erosion due tion. Labor scowled at the then Howard government's refusal to release the findings of the Podger report, the Report of the review into military superannuation arrangements. When Minister Griffin released the report on Christmas Eve, of all days, in December 2007, he said: The Rudd Government will provide further opportunity for public comment about the review's findings and recommendations and will consider its attitude to the report after the consultation period, which concludes on 31 March. The minister did not say which year that 31 March would be-2008, 2009, 2010 or 2011. Incidentally, the last update of the webpage which refers to the review was on 1 April 2008; the last review of the website was 19 June 2009. We are all left wondering: what is the outcome? The Podger review was an extensive examination of the military superannuation arrangements in this country. The previous coalition government commissioned the review. At the outset, the review's terms of reference stated: Two interconnected principles should guide the conduct of the Review of Military Superannuation Arrangements and form the philosophical context within which the Terms of Reference are addressed. These are the ‘unique nature of military service' and the need to compensate members of the … (ADF) for that uniqueness in their superannuation, invalidity and death benefits, as with other conditions of service, that joining and staying in the ADF remain attractive propositions. With this guiding principle in mind, the report made a number of recommendations. Recommendation 9 stands out, particularly in the context of what we are discussing today. Recommendation 9 says, inter alia: A single governance structure should be put in place for the DFRDB and MSBS … along the to unfair indexafollowing lines: … … … b. There should be a seven member board of trustees comprising two employee representatives, two employer representatives and three independent representatives, including the chairperson. c. A committee structure is to be determined by the Board to assist with … the Board's responsibilities for the DFRDB, MSBS … Podger goes on to say on page 45 of his report: For military superannuation … the board needs a blend of experience and knowledge to best serve the military environment, including understanding the unique nature of military service. Therefore, a central consideration of the Review Team is to ensure military superannuation trustees collectively have the legislated skills, knowledge and abilities, as well as an appropriate knowledge of members, ex-members and Defence interests. This, combined with increasing training and development requirements, suggests there are advantages and efficiencies to be gained in forming a single board of trustees with responsibilities for all military superannuation schemes. Further, he states: … a unique feature of military service is the denial of the right to belong to a union. To overcome this, Podger recommended that the Chief of the Defence Force appoint two employee trustees. The report says: The Head of Defence's Personnel Executive is best placed to nominate trustees with appropriate skills and experience and knowledge of issues thereby ensuring impacting Defencewith the Minister for Defence appointing the two remaining trustees and the chairperson. Podger says nothing about the ACTU being involved with military super. Further, Podger noted that the Uhrig review's best practice principles noted that board composition should comprise between six and nine members. This board has 10 members plus a chair. Podger's proposal was seven including the chair. Here we have a review specifically conducted to consider the unique nature of military superannuation. Andrew Podger's review is probably the most comprehensive and contemporary analysis we have of the issues confronting serving and former ADF members. It makes more sweeping recommendations, which the Rudd Labor government has not responded to, including the establishment of a new military superannuation scheme which would be independently managed in the manner described earlier. Labor's response to military superannuation appears to be the Matthews review. The veteran community is deeply concerned about the findings of the Matthews review and the decision of the Rudd Labor government to largely adopt Trevor Matthews's findings as they relate to military super. Superannuation is an issue of great importance to all Australians, and particularly to those in the Australian defence forces. Again referring to the Podger review, at least two in five of all serving Defence personnel believe that military superannuation arrangements influence their decision to remain in the ADF at least partially. This is a powerful reason maintain an appropriate level of Defence Force influence in the management of defence superannuation. If the Rudd Labor government are using this bill as a means of avoiding making other tough decisions for military superannuants, I fear they will face very stiff opposition indeed from the veteran community. The coalition does not support the inclusion of ACTU appointed delegates on a board managing civilian, and particularly military, superannuation. We will oppose these measures in the House of Representatives. In conclusion, I extend my thanks to the leaders of the ex-service community who strongly encouraged participation by their members in the Senate inquiry-in particular, the leadership of the DFWA in explaining their opposition to the bills and coming before the Senate committee. Our ex-service community is well served by the leaders who represent them. It is disappointing that the Rudd Labor government picks and chooses when to listen to them and take them into its confidence. It seems that, just as with the resource super profits tax, which involves postannouncement consultation and $38 million in after-the-fact taxpayer funded advertising, the Rudd Labor government is unable to appropriately consult with key stakeholders to negotiate a mutually beneficial outcome for all concerned. The amendments proposed by the government to these bills do not go far enough. Had the government's amendments responded more fully to the concerns of all in the ex-service community, debate today might have taken on a different flavour. Once again I indicate my opposition to these bills. I call on those members and senators who believe that military service is unique to similarly oppose these bills. The Rudd Labor government has provided no justification for the measures in these bills. to They have not consulted widely enough with the ex-service community on these bills other than a bit of shadow-boxing around the edges. After the release of the proposed amendments this week, the coalition asked the ex-service community for their views. They remain concerned about the bills even in their amended format. On this basis and in support of our original view, the coalition will stand up for veterans and oppose these bills.",74
30,Mr ROBERT,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak on the Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Bill 2010, which is being debated cognately with the ComSuper Bill 2010 and the Superannuation Legislation (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2010, and to not lend my support to the bill. These bills seek to establish a single trustee board responsible for the bulk of government superannuation schemes. The new entity will be called the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation, the CSC. It will assume, under this legislation, responsibility for following schemes: the 1922 scheme established under the Superannuation Act; the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, the CSS; the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, the PSS; the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan, the PSSap; the scheme provided for under the Papua New Guinea (Staffing Assistance) Act; the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme, the MSBS; the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme, the DFRDBS; and the Defence Force Retirement Benefits Scheme, the DFRBS. The ComSuper Bill establishes ComSuper as a prescribed agency under the Financial Management and Accountability Act and as a statutory agency under the Public Service Act 1999. The core of the issue is the amalgamation of all Commonwealth civilian and military superannuation boards. The government would have us believe that the merger is intended to provide administrative efficiencies as well as secure financial gains through the amalgamation of all investment funds. On the surface it sounds fine, perhaps even laud16(5), able. The government says, although without any supporting documentation, that an additional $10 million per annum will be earned by the funds due to the type and size of the amalgamated investments. The total amount of investment is approximately $19 billion. This includes approximately $16 billion from the Australian Reward Investment Alliance, the trustee for CSS, PSS and PSSap, and $3 billion in funds managed by MSBS. The DFRDB, DFRB, 1922 and PNG schemes are essentially not funded and are paid out of consolidated revenue. I contend that there are two fundamental issues that will stop this bill being supported. Firstly, this is not about efficiency but about control, notably ACTU control. Secondly, this will not assist military members. There is nothing in this bill that will substantiate the the assistance to military members and veterans. In relation to the first issue, that of control, the bill contains certain regulations relating to the constitution of the CSC Board. These regulations are unacceptable. There is a 10-person board, plus a chair, consisting of five directors appointed by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, three appointed by the ACTU-odd, since military members are not allowed to be part of a union-and only two appointed by the Chief of the Defence Force. We believe strongly that the composition of this board will not advantage military members. Only 20 per cent of the board, excluding the chairman, are actually representatives of the military, and 33 per cent of the board come from the Australian Council of Trade Unions. It is worth noting that the veteran community believe, for the most part, that the CSC Board should include a suitably qualified representative from the ex-service community, and this recommendation from the veterans community has merit. In addition to the above, under clause any of the three directors appointed by the President of the ACTU cannot be dismissed by the minister for finance unless the President of the ACTU agrees. I never thought I would see the day where the minister for finance would emasculate himself by not being allowed to dismiss members of the board but having to go with a begging bowl to the President of the ACTU and say, ‘Please, sir, may I have some more?' to dismiss incompetent directors, noting there are reasons whereby the President of the ACTU cannot disagree. One has to ask about the legitimacy of the legal advice the minister for finance has got, because there are specifications in the Corporations Act 2001 which govern the removal of directors and there are areas under the act where directors would have to be removed that are not reflected in clause 16(5). There may well be areas where a director has become bankrupt or insolvent or there may be some other area where the Corporations Act may require their dismissal, but clause 16(5) does not actually allow that. The minister for finance would have to go begging to the union master to say, ‘Please, sir, could we have them removed?' I note that similar provisions apply to directors who are appointed by the CDF under clause 16(6). The issue is that five members of the board cannot be removed by the minister for finance unless he gets permission for the removal of three of them from the President of the ACTU and for two of them from the CDF. The coalition believes that the amalgamation of civilian and military Commonwealth superannuation boards will not have a positive effect on the future administration of military superannuation schemes. The Defence Force Welfare Association and the vast majority of those members of the Defence Force and the veteran community who I have spoken to share that view. The DFWA has said, ‘Unique service requires unique solutions, not ones which further blur the distinction between the uniqueness of military service and civilian norms.' It is true that tary life is a unique life. It is a unique of service. Bundling all of their superannuation and some of the unique requirements of that into all of Commonwealth government superannuation does not reflect that at all. I would have thought that the Rudd Labor government, under their 2007 election manifesto, would have got this. They said that they would ‘maintain a generous military superannuation system, in recognition of the importance of the ADF and the immense responsibility placed on personnel in securing and defending Australia'. I fail to see how lumping them in with every other public servant maintains something and recognises that importance and immense responsibility. I can only suggest from this bill and looking at the 2007 budget manifesto that the Labor Party got its verbs confused. I believe the member for Paterson, on behalf of the coalition and on behalf of many in the veteran community, met with the Minister for Finance and Deregulation regarding these bills. I believe what resulted was a commitment by the government to ensure that the amended legislation contains strengthened provisions for consultation. I am led to believe that the proposed consultation outlined in that discussion includes the requirements for the CDF to consult with relevant organisations on the appointment, for the minister for finance to consult with the defence minister on appointing the five employer representatives and for the minister for finance to consult with the defence minister on the appointment of the ComSuper CEO. Quorums on matters relating to the interests of military members are to include one CDF nominated director and decisions made by the board are to include one CDF appointed director when the issue relates to interests of military members. There seems to be no mention at all there of the composition of the board-no mention miliof the three ACTU appointed directors. form There is no mention of how only the President of the ACTU can dismiss an ACTU appointed director. There is no mention of any other issues the member for Paterson raised with the minister for finance. In light of the intransigence of the finance minister to address the composition of the board, his inability to dismiss members of the board other than by begging the ACTU to remove them and the failure of the government to identify how military members will benefit from the amalgamation, I cannot possibly lend support to these bills.",79
31,Mr TANNER,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"in reply-It is a great disappointment that, with what is essentially an important administrative reform to improve the administration of superannuation for both civilian and military employees, the federal government is hit with loopy conspiracy theories and complete ignorance and stupidity from the opposition. I will go through the key elements in the appropriate order to indicate to the House exactly what is involved here. The Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Bill 2010, the ComSuper Bill 2010 and the Superannuation Legislation (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2010 modernise the governance arrangements for the main Commonwealth civilian and military superannuation schemes without altering the schemes or members' entitlements under the schemes. In particular, they enable the Commonwealth to deal with some problems in the existing administrative arrangements that we inherited from the previous government and that need to be addressed. The bills were developed with the priority of maintaining the features of military superannuation that reflect the special nature of military service and that differentiate military service from civilian employment. In further developing the package of bills the government welcomed the opportunity to hear the views of military stakeholders, particularly the ex-service community, on the proposed new governance arrangements. I wish to thank those organisations for their input. The views of the ex-service organisations were canvassed at a round-table and a summary of the outcomes of the discussion is as follows. The investment related benefits to military members arising from the merger were generally accepted in that there was the potential for significant benefits to Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme members and no impact on Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme members. It was also generally agreed that, in terms of concerns about any supposed dilution of the military voice in the merged trustee board, the protection afforded by benefits and entitlements and scheme rules that are contained in separate acts of parliament and the fact that trustees have a duty to act in the interests of all members were sufficient. There was consensus that a strong military voice did need to be maintained in the area of death, disability and reversionary spouse and children's benefits where there is discretion vested with the trustee to consider and decide on individual cases. There were differing views expressed on the question of whether the proposed the Defence Force Case Assessment Committee should be established by statute or whether there should be flexibility, as is reflected in the bill, for the trustee board to decide whether such a committee should be established. In the end it was agreed that it was desirable to retain the existing flexibility, hence the phrase ‘may establish such a board' is in the legislation. The government has responded to the issues raised in the consultations and made a number of changes to the proposed bills that are consistent with the views put forward by the ex-service community. These include a change to the process for the Chief of the Defence Force to nominate member representatives to the governing board of the single trustee, which will provide for ongoing consultation with the ex-service community. There is now support from the military community for the merger of the boards, subject to these amendments being adopted which address some aspects of the governance arrangements but do not compromise the integrity of the reforms. The bills do not change the existing features of military superannuation that reflect the special nature of military service. The bills complement these features while providing opportunities for members of all of the schemes, civilian and military, to benefit from better practice trustee operations and administration services and better investment returns. Implementation of these governance reforms will improve efficiency in the management of the civilian and military schemes and will allow the benefits of these improvements to be passed on to all members in the form of reduced costs and higher investment returns. In particular, the ability of a single trustee to consolidate scheme funds will allow members of the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme, which comprises the bulk of serving Defence Force personnel, to gain substantial benefits from the merger. I emphasise this point for the opposition and suggest to them that they are standing in the way of military scheme members, both current and future, achieving higher levels of superannuation return. This is because of the relatively smaller size of the existing military scheme compared with the civilian schemes. When they are pooled, it is anticipated that investment returns will be higher in the pooled funding arrangements than would have been the case with separate arrangements. There is clear industry experience that members of smaller superannuation schemes have the most to gain when their scheme funds are consolidated into a larger pool of funds that are typical of bigger superannuation schemes. Overall, the implementation of these bills will better secure the superannuation arrangements for Commonwealth civilian employees and military personnel for the longer term. They will also enable substantial additional benefits to flow to members while retaining the existing individual scheme benefits and entitlements. These bills are evidence of the government's ongoing commitment to providing efficient and sustainable superannuation arrangements for Commonwealth employees and military personnel, together with its strong commitment to protect those features of military superannuation that recognise that military service is unique and different from civilian employment. The amendments that have been circulated in my name, in summary: first, require the Chief of the Defence Force to consult with relevant organisations on the appointment of two military member representatives; second, require the minister for finance to consult with the relevant defence minister on the appointment of the five employer representatives to the board; third, require the minister for finance to consult with the relevant defence minister on the appointment of the CEO of ComSuper; fourth, ensure that the quorum requirement includes at least one nominee director from the Chief of the Defence Force, when a matter before the board relates specifically to the interests of military members; fifth, ensure that any decisions taken by the board must include at least one Chief of the Defence Force nominee when the decision relates specifically to the interests of military members; and, six, require that the Chair of the Defence Case Assessment Committee be one of the Chief of the Defence Force's nominee directors. I will conclude with two things. One is by giving a couple of illustrations that the sition may want to think very carefully about-that is, advice from my department about the likely beneficial impact of longer term superannuation returns arising from this merger that will flow to new military members. A new MSBS member, under the new arrangements, who joins the Air Force at 18years-old as an officer cadet, and retires at the rank of group captain after serving 37 years, would be expected to have approximately $95,000 additional superannuation. A new MSBS member, under the new arrangements, who joins the Army at age 21 as an officer cadet, and retires at the rank of colonel after serving 34 years, would be expected to have approximately an additional superannuation payment of more than $60,000. And a new MSBS member, under the new arrangements, who joins the Navy at age 18 as a seaman and retires as a warrant officer after serving 37 years, would be expected to have an additional superannuation payout of approximately $70,000. Can I respond to the points raised by the member for Paterson and echoed by one or two of the other opposition speakers. First, the suggestion that was put to me by the member for Paterson with respect to the prospect of continuing two separate boards but with some kind of pooled arrangement for investment. Contrary to the suggestions of some, we did actually explore this proposition very seriously and did examine it very closely. That did indicate that, although there would be some benefits as compared with the status quo from this approach, the new approach would be costly to establish and administer, there would still be duplication of some operational costs and there would be some degree of loss of prospective benefits to members. In other words, it would be an inferior outcome compared with the government's proposals. There would be increased costs to civilian schemes if this approach oppowere taken compared with current arrangements. We know that the opposition hates public servants, but this is a matter that the government does have to take into account. It would not be possible for trustees to agree to this arrangement on behalf of their existing members and fulfil their obligations to members. Where similar arrangements have been tried in the private sector they have given rise to significant practical difficulties, including the relationship between the two boards that are connected through their investment activities, and that can come as a cost to members. Finally, I will refer to the loopy paranoia about the ACTU-perhaps predictable; perhaps I was giving the opposition too much credit for the possibility that they might actually treat these issues on their merits. I would remind the opposition that the role of the ACTU here is in representing hundreds of thousands of people who are employees of the Commonwealth. These are representative bodies. Not all of them are members of trade unions, but equally not all ex-service personnel are members of ex-service organisations either. The ACTU had a role in this process that existed under the former government, so there has been no substantive changes made to the role of the ACTU in nominating directors for the board. I would point out that the whole purpose of the minister for finance not being able to dismiss an employee representative, be they a military or civilian representative, is to ensure that they are genuinely representative of employees. If I, or any minister for finance, can arbitrarily dismiss somebody who was appointed there to represent employees, then they are no longer representing the people they are purported to be representing, because they are subject to my dismissal at a whim. What the opposition is failing to note is that there is piece of legislation called the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, which actually provides that people who contravene the fitness and propriety standard under the SI(S) Act, who fail to comply with the material personal interest provision under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act, or who are a disqualified person under the SI(S) legislation, will either not be eligible for appointment or will, if they are already appointed, have their appointment terminated-not as a matter of discretion or arbitrary whim on the part of the minister, but as a matter of existing legislation. So where there is misbehaviour there are existing provisions that ensure that that misbehaviour will be met with by termination of the appointment. For example, a person who is bankrupt would be disqualified under the existing provisions of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act. The issue here is that these bills, together with the amendments that have been adopted following consultation with the ex-service community, will strengthen the administration of the superannuation arrangements for both military and civilian personnel employed by the Commonwealth. Strengthening that administration means that the risks of problems, the risks of mistakes, the risks of damaging things that harm the interests of members of the scheme will diminish. That is a critical thing: better administration benefits members-that means people currently receiving pensions, as well as people who are currently employed by the Commonwealth and are contributing to the schemes. Even more significantly, by combining the investment pool and getting the benefits of economies of scale, those sections of the schemes that involve investment income returning to the individual members will, over the long haul, on balance, return significantly stronger returns to the individual members. I have mentioned the examples. That is something that I would urge the opposition to think very carefully about, because the stance they are proposing to take means that they are seeking to stand in the way of military personnel getting better superannuation payouts. That is something that I would urge them to think very, very carefully about. They can scoff at that proposition, but that is the professional advice that the government has received, and I think it is a very courageous position for the opposition to take to be seeking to prevent that from occurring. I commend the bill to the House. Question put: That this bill be now read a second time. The House divided. [1.41 pm] (The Deputy Speaker-Hon.

34,Mr HARTSUYKER,NOES,"The coalition supports these amendsub- ments to the Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Bill 2010 and we thank the government for taking into account some of the concerns expressed by the veteran community. The coalition is of the view that defence service is unique and that the concerns of this very important secsub- tor of our community need to be taken into account in relation to superannuation. The amendments will require the Minister for Finance and Deregulation to consult with the Minister for Defence before nominating a person to the board. We think it is a very end worthwhile amendment that the defence minister be consulted in this matter. Also, if a meeting of the board concerns only military schemes, the quorum for that board must include a director nominated by the Chief of Defence. This will ensure that a defence representative will be present on matters relating to military schemes. We also think it is a very important improvement that persons who have defence experience and knowledge will be involved in that deliberation. However, the amendments do not address concerns about the powers of the President of the ACTU over the minister for finance. The ACTU will still be able to block a meeting by holding back its three members and denying a quorum. The coalition will support these amendments in the House and will consider the legislation again in the Senate.",86
35,Mr BALDWIN,NOES,"Paterson) (1.55 pm)The speech of the Minister for Finance and Deregulation earlier that the coalition's opposition to these measures in the Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Bill 2010 would not deliver the same amount of return to those that are paid from these funds is factually incorrect. The $16 billion that is held by the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the $3 billion that is held by the MSBS will be put together to tender for financial administration, with the successful tender looking at where the best investment opportunities are. It will not be the board-whether it be one board or two boards-that will be making individual investment decisions. These investment decisions will be made by the people who, through the application in the tender and proving they are the best qualified, will administer the money. The minister has said that unless there is this amalgamation, this consolidation, into one board there will be financial disadvantage. That is incorrect, because the money, whether it is $16 billion plus $3 billion or $19 billion as one parcel of money put out to tender, is still the same amount of money. Those returns will be divided back to the appropriate bodies. What we are saying and what we maintain is that there is a uniqueness in military service, which seems to be failed to be recognised by this government. This service needs to be recognised by two separate complete boards. As I said earlier discussions with the minister, you can consolidate all of the defence boards-the MSBS, the DFRDB and the DFRB into one board-for administration purposes. Remember that the DFRDB and DFRB have no funds. They are unfunded superannuation liabilities. They can be brought together, consolidated, whereby our veteran community and our current serving defence community can have a direct say because they have control of their board. They have control of their affairs. The minister has alluded to administration costs. We fail to see that there will be any huge increase in administration costs if all of the defence boards are consolidated into one. In fact, there will be a reduction. What the coalition opposes is the idea of it all being put together where defence people lose outand they will lose out under these arrangements being proposed by the government. This is the government who talks about consultation and yet did not come to see us despite requests to have further discussions on this matter. The government just decided that it would send a note through the night before. The only change to this legislation is that people must consult. Consultation is not a big thing for this government, as we have witnessed. Whether it is the mining supertax or whether it is a whole raft of programs, consultation has not been one of the hallmarks of its governance. We say to the people and we say to the defence communities that the coalition is standing by you-the coalition recognises your uniqueness of service. Most importantly, we want to make sure that the financial fortunes of those past and present serving members are preserved and preserved in a manner whereby they have a direct input. The minister is quite aware of numbers in boards and politics-that is the nature of the game. Let me put it to you this way: when you have a in board that is made up of five public servants, three ACTU members and only two defence people, eight beats two every time. Therefore, to say that defence persons would have a solid representation on this board is wrong. If the minister wanted solid representation on this single board, then why are there not at least three ADF present or past members represented on the board to match the three ACTU members on the board? We cannot support the legislation. We will not oppose the amendments, but we cannot support the legislation in its present form. I said that ing my speech in the second reading debate and I maintain that position right now.",87
36,The SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! It being 2 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 97. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. NA",88
37,Mr RUDD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I inform the House that the Treasurer will be leaving question time early todayOpposition members-Oh!,88
38,Mr RUDD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"There is great sadness over there, Joe! He will be absent as he is travelling to China and then Korea for the G20 finance ministers meeting. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation will answer questions on his behalf. NA Economy",88
39,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister, and I ask it on behalf of the working families of Australia that he has so badly let down. Prime Minister, if the government is such a good economic manager, why are Australian families paying more for their food, more for their housing and more for their power, water, education and health than when the Prime Minister promised to ease the pressure on working families prior to the last election?",88
40,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. His one script for working families is to bring back Work Choices. Our script for working families is to abolish Work Choices. That is the difference. With Work Choices, which he regards as his key mantra for the future: number one, it strips away basic working conditions for working families; number two, it undermines such things as penalty rates; and, number three, it damages a whole series of additional durbasic conditions which working families need to ensure that family incomes are held up. When the Leader of the Opposition stands up here in an exercise I can only describe as rancid hypocrisy on the interests of working families, I say to him two words: Work Choices. The Leader of the Opposition referred to education. This government prior to the last election said we would bring in an education tax refund. We have brought in an education tax refund for working families with primary school kids and with secondary school kids. Secondly, we also said that for working families dealing with childcare costs we would increase the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. We have increased the rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. The Leader of the Opposition refers to health costs. I refer him to the government's pre-election commitment to bring in a teen dental scheme. The government has brought in that very scheme, which has benefited, I am advised, some 400,000 or more across the country. The Leader of the Opposition refers more broadly to health costs. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition on the question of health costs and the effectiveness of the health system that what he did as health minister for five years was reach his long hand into the health budgets of the nation and take out $1 billion from the public hospital system of Australia. What he has now said, further, is that if he were elected to the office of Prime Minister at the next election he would reach his hand in again and take out nearly another billion dollars from the health system of Australia. On housing, I remind the Leader of the Opposition that interest rates now are some percentage points lower than they were when he left office at the end of 2007. So whether it is on interest rates, whether it is on housing, whether it is on education, whether it is on health, whether is on hospitals, but most of all whether it on Work Choices, the Leader of the Opposition's record on working families is clear to each and every person listening to this debate today. Middle East",88
41,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House in relation to the incident yesterday between the Israeli navy and a flotilla of vessels attempting to make its way Gaza?,89
42,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. Last night I spoke to the Prime Minister of Israel, Prime Minister Netanyahu. He had just returned from his visit to Canada and was about to go into a cabinet meeting to discuss the incident that the honourable member's question refers to. I set out the framework in which Australia views this tragedy in my discussion with the Prime Minister, and reflected Australia's deep concerns over the recent military operation off Gaza. Consistent with the public remarks made both by myself and by the foreign minister yesterday, I indicated that the Australian government was deeply concerned at the loss of life and injuries that had occurred as part of the IDF operation; furthermore, that deaths in these circumstances are deeply disturbing and of deep concern to the Australian people; and, furthermore, that Israel should mount an independent inquiry into the incident so that all the facts can be established and an informed judgment made about the events surrounding the incident of Monday. Furthermore, I reiterated that the Australian government's position was that more needs to be done to ensure a reasonable continuing supply of humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza. Australia recognises the unique security challenges that the governit ment of Israel faces from the government of is Iran, the state of Iran, and the terrorist organisations which the Iranians support. Australia remains sensitive to the security concerns of Israel. Australia is nonetheless deeply concerned by the loss of life in this most recent military action off Gaza. The government gives the highest priority to the welfare of Australians caught up in this incident. The Australian embassy in Israel has been in close contact with Israeli to authorities concerning the welfare and safety of the Australians who have been involved. I can advise the House that Australian officials have been granted access to all known Australians from vessels in the flotilla and that officials have provided consular assistance to those Australians. Yesterday embassy officials visited the three Australians and one permanent resident currently at the Beersheba detention centre, where people on the flotilla have been taken. Also yesterday an Australian embassy official made a second consular visit to an injured Australian man in an Israeli hospital. We have been advised that consular access will be provided again to the Australians at the Beersheba detention centre today, 2 June. We have also been advised that all those detained can request access to lawyers. Our embassy officials are working with detained Australians and Israeli authorities on the appropriate way forward for each Australian given their specific circumstances. We continue to seek confirmation that no other Australians were on board. Furthermore, I requested of Prime Minister Netanyahu last night that he personally engage on the matter concerning the well-being of these Australians and these Australian permanent residents. The Prime Minister indicated he would do so. The events of Monday have generated protests in a number of countries around the world. Australia has been no exception. Australia has a deep commitment to the right of Australians to protest and to express their views on subjects of their choice. Whatever the issue Australians have that right. That protest, however, needs to be undertaken peacefully and in a manner which does not incite or provoke violence or lead any community to feel under threat within our country, Australia. At times like this, when passions are aroused, it is important that our communities understand that protest activity needs to be peaceful and undertaken in a way that does not fray the threads that make our society the strong fabric that it is. This is Australia. All protest activity must be undertaken peacefully, and in relation to individual communities within Australia none of those communities should be left feeling under threat. Australia has a very strong relationship with Israel, a relationship that goes back to the founding of the Israeli state and Australia's vote at the United Nations in 1947, which was the first cast in support of the establishment of the state of Israel, under the Chifley Labor government. We are friends. At times, however, the role of friends is to speak plainly, and that is what Australia has done on this occasion in relation to this matter.",89
43,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to testimony of Treasury officials last night in Senate estimates which confirmed that Treasury had supplied the raw data used in the Treasurer's economic note of 9 May. Will the Treasurer confirm that the pie charts used extensively by the markets in his economic note were actually constructed in his office?,90
44,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I stand by the accuracy of all the figures in the economic note-absolutely. Let us just go through what this is all about, because the member for North Sydney has been very, very sloppy yet again. I know people on this side would find that probably hard to understand, but of course he has! Now what does this relate to? This relates to the fact of order on relevance. The question was extremely specific, and that was whether the pie chart was constructed in his office. It was not whether he stood by the data in the note. It was whether he constructed the pie chart himself.",90
45,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer will relate his material to the question.,90

50,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw, Mr Speaker. the Around the start of the decade the Australian community received about $1 in royalties and resource charges for every $3 of resource profits.

Going back to your point and clarification that you provided to the Treasurer, which he is now in complete defiance of, the issue is relevancy. The Treasurer was asked to confirm whether the pie charts were constructed in his office.",91
55,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Dickson will resume his seat. The preamble to the question talked about the testimony in Senate estimates and then went on about what action was taken in the Treasurer's office. I am assuming, even though I have not read the testimony in Senate estimates, that the remarks that the Treasurer is making relate to that. But, as I have said to him, he must relate his material to the question.",91

58,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The pie chart-and the data it is based on-shows that the Australian people have not been getting their fair share. The member for Dickson is only interested in shares. He is not interested in a fair share the Australian people. Not even the mining industry thinks that there should not be more paid by most companies so the Australian people get a fair share. The only people in Australia who believe that are those opposite. The Leader of the Opposition thinks the mining industry is paying too much tax. I stand by all of the data in the economic note, so I stand by that. There was a discussion about this last night in Senate estimates and of course that will be responded to in the normal way by the department.",91

60,Mr HALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I feel most fortunate to be given the call.",91
61,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You are very fortunate.,91
62,Mr HALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. What do the national accounts figures show about the Australian economy?,91
63,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Solomon for his question because the strength of the Australian economy also rests on the strength of the region's of Australia, including the Northern Territory, which the honourable member so effectively represents in this chamber together with the member for Lingiari and senators as well. I believe there is nothing more fundamental to the responsibilities of a government than to keep the economy strong, because, if you have a strong economy, you can then deliver on the aspirations for working families. You can also then build a fairer Australia and put in place the measures you need to secure Australia's future. Today we had revealed and released the national accounts. They point to a strong performance for the Australian economy. Australia's GDP has grown by a solid 0.5 per for cent in the March quarter. The Australian economy continues to be the envy of the developed world. Notwithstanding our strong national economic performance, we should also be mindful of the fact that many families in the Australian community and many Australian small businesses are still finding it very tough, given the nature of the global economic forces still at work on Australia. The Australian economy, as I said before, continues to be the envy of the developed world. Australia's growth over the past year has been 2.7 per cent. This compares to 0.4 per cent for New Zealand, minus 0.2 per cent for the United Kingdom, 2.5 per cent for the United States and 0.5 per cent in the Euro area. This becomes an even more stark comparison if we compare Australia's economic growth performance since the crisis began some two years ago. These figures are worth reflecting on. Australia's economy since this crisis began has grown by 3.5 percentage points. In the United Kingdom, GDP has fallen by 5.5 percentage points. In Germany, it has fallen by 5.3 percentage points. In United States, it has fallen by points. But the model for the Leader of the Opposition-remember-is New Zealand. I would ask him to reflect on the fact that in New Zealand they have had something like five consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. That is his recommended economic model, from the man who says that economics bores him, from the man who the previous Treasurer Peter Costello said he could never make Treasurer and whose colleagues have now said, in various publications around the country, would not understand the meaning of the concept of being a fiscal conservative. His model is New Zealand and I would suggest he reflects on New Zealand's performance. On the question of the strength of Australia's performance, I would also draw to the attention of those opposite that this government will be bringing the budget back to surplus in three years time, three years of time, and we will be halving net peak debt. That is this government's record of achievement. Had we gone the other way and taken the recommendation of the Leader of the Opposition and not had any stimulus, you would have had Australia in recession, you would have had taxation receipts collapsing completely and you would have had very large outlays for unemployment benefits. Had Australia performed like so many of the other economies around the world which generated double-digit unemployment we would have had something like half a million more Australians out of work. That was the script being put on offer by those oppositetens of thousands of businesses closing their doors and our budget under greater pressure. The core difference that we made relative to other economies was the size and construction of our economic stimulus strategy. the That is what has made the difference in this 0.9 percentage Australian economy. Mr Hockey interjecting",91
64,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for North Sydney continues to loudly interject. I would ask him to examine the national accounts figures today in terms of the contribution of public final demand to the overall growth performance of the Australian economy and ask him then to reflect upon the wisdom of his interjection that stimulus had nothing to do with it. Can I say to those opposite and to the House more broadly that stimulus has helped pick up the slack in critical areas of the economy. For example, in the building industry, private activity contracted by 0.6 per cent in the March quarter and is now over 15 per cent below the level it was a year ago. That is why programs such as Building the Education Revolution, the school modernisation program, have been of fundamental importance, together with the social housing ahead program, in providing work for tradies, sparkies, chippies and builders right across the Australian economy. If any of those members opposite were being honest about this and looking in the faces of the builders and the subcontractors in their electorates, including the Leader of the Opposition's electorate, they should have the courage to front them and say that they would pull the plug from under each and every one of those projects. This has therefore been a core element in Australia's strong economic performance. The stimulus measures that we have embarked upon are already in the process of being withdrawn. The first homeowners boost has been reduced, the tax breaks to small business have come to a conclusion, and there is the guarantee scheme for large deposits and wholesale funding and the state guarantee scheme. Over time the withdrawal of fiscal stimulus is anticipated to subtract around one percentage point from GDP growth over 2010. Here is the core point: those opposite calling for the cancellation of stimulus now. That is their position. Reflect on that as would occur and roll out across the ground. The cancellation of stimulus would result in the cancellation of 175 road and rail safety projects right across Australia. It would sult in construction being stopped midway on 7,000 major school buildings. It would result in the construction being stopped midway of more than 533 science and language centres across Australia. It would leave 12,500 new social dwellings unfit for occupation, without plumbing or even walls. It would lead to the cessation of the construction of 380 defence homes across Australia, something I would have thought the member for Herbert might take a particular interest in. Further, 130 projects across our universities would be stopped and work also brought to a halt on 125 community infrastructure projects, all backed by Australian local government. That is the practical consequence of what the Leader of the Opposition says would happen if he cancels-as he says he would-stimulus projects across the country. The question for each member opposite is to front their local P&Cs and their local P&Fs and tell them which of those schools is not going to be brought to conclusion. This government is proud of its achievements in terms of the management of the economy in the worse global economic downturn that the world has faced since the Great Depression. We are proud of the fact that the Australian economy has emerged as the only major economy which has not gone into recession. It is one of only two economies of the 30-plus economies across the OECD not to have gone into recession. This should because for confidence on the part of Australians, but it should not because for complacency on the part of Australians. That is why we are engaged in long-term ecoare nomic reform as well-building productivity growth, investing in infrastructure, investing it in skills and implementing microeconomic reform. That also includes taxation reform, and that is what we are doing with the resource super profits tax in order to provide relong-term reform and a basis for growth for this country into the future. This side of the House welcomes positive news on the Australian economy. We welcome positive growth numbers for the Australian economy. Is it so far beyond the capabilities of the Leader of the Opposition to stand up today and welcome the fact that this has been the strongest-growing economy of all the advanced economies in the world?

65,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer confirm that concerns have been raised with his office by Treasury officials as to the accuracy of the pie charts contained in his economic note of 9 May?,93
66,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He is at it again. I confirm and stand by the accuracy of all of the data supplied to my office which appears in the pie charts. I have made that very clear. The government and the department are very happy to supply all of the data in the normal way, as was requested in Senate estimates. That is entirely a matter for the department, and they will do that in the normal way. But let us just go through what the opposition are upset about here. Last night on Lateline, we had the shadow Treasurer. He showed absolutely conclusively on Lateline that he does not understand the purpose of royalties. Mr Dutton- Mr Speaker, a point of order, again on relevance-and I make reference to your earlier ruling: this is as specific as a question can get. Will the Treasurer confirm that concerns have been raised with his office by Treasury as to the accuracy of the pie charts contained in his economic note of 9 May? There was no preamble. There was no addition to it. That was the question. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, on the point of order: I refer to your rulings of 28 May 2008 and 23 June 2009 and a number of other rulings that you have made where you have indicated to the opposition that, to quote your good self in a fine ruling, ‘a point of order is not just an opportunity to repeat the question'. The opposition continue to do this as a strategy, which is a waste of time. If the point of order is on relevance, it should be made directly and then you should be able to rule on it.",94

69,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The whole chart is about royalties. It just shows that they have not the faintest idea why royalties are important, what role they play and why we have to have a superprofits tax to replace royalties. They simply do not get it, and they do not think that it is a problem that the Australian people have not been getting fair value via the royalties system. They have bought this line from the Mining Industry Council hook, line and sinker that, because the mining industry pays company tax, it does not matter what they pay in terms of royalties. They have bought that line hook, line and sinker.",94

So I am very, very clearly relating my answer to the question.

73,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Sturt will resume his seat. The member for Sturt will resume his seat! The Manager of Opposition Business displays another tactic which is used and which is outside the standing orders. I am happy for him to raise-even on a continuing basis, given that it is the third time the opposition has risen on a point of order in this answer that has gone for a little over a minute and a half-the issue of relevance. But it is not for him to add the sorts comments that he makes by interjection continually by way of debate. That is the point that I was trying to make by going a little over the top with the decibels. I am in the difficulty that there was reference in the question to whether there had been concerns raised with the figures. I have to say that in the past I have been in this place when some people whom I think some would be surprised that I describe as very good parliamentarians were able to pluck the eyes out of a question and then try to say that their answer was relevant. I say to the Treasurer that he must go directly to where he believes he is talking about a matter directly contained in the question. I will listen carefully.",94
74,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I stand by the accuracy of all of the figures in the economic note. Regarding the figuring on which it is based, I have said in relation to Senate estimates-which was also asked about in one of the questions-that the department would be supplying all of that material in the normal way.

76,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. What do today's national accounts say about the success of Australia's economic policies, the need for ongoing reform and the prospects for our economy into the future?",95
77,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Banks for his question. As the Prime Minister said before, the Australian economy grew by a solid 0.5 per cent in the March quarter and 2.7 per cent through the year. I think all Australians should have confidence in this very solid outcome and confidence in the fact that we do have one of the best economies in the developed world. We can see that of again in these national accounts today. It is an economy which is gradually in transition from support provided by policy stimulus to support provided by private demand. Of course, as the Prime Minister also said before, that stimulus is withdrawing at a rate that ensures appropriate support remains targeted at softer sections of the economy. Infrastructure projects in particular have helped plug the hole in private sector building activity, while stimulus payments and tax breaks for business have been unwound. Stimulus projects contributed 12.5 per cent to the increase in new public investment in the quarter. Public investment has now risen by more than 40 per cent over the past year. As the Prime Minister also said before, this is keeping tradies in employment and it is keeping the doors of small business open. Mr Robb interjecting",95
78,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Goldstein!,95
79,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But, on cue, we get the shadow finance spokesman over there saying that somehow this did not play an important role in our economy and it is not important as we go forward. I can tell you that this pipeline of activity is absolutely essential to employment in this economy, is absolutely essential to confidence in small business and is keeping the doors of small business open in circumstances where it is quite difficult and remains very difficult for many small businesses out there. It is indeed ironic that the party opposite, which claims to be a party of small business, does not understand that essential fact-the ongoing importance of that infrastructure stimulus to support demand in our economy as the rest of the stimulus is being wound down. The national accounts today are an important reminder of what Australians have achieved over the past year. Certainly the greatest achievement was that we did avoid recession when many other countries faced recession. The consequence of that has been the creation of something like 235,000 jobs in the past year. Other nations were shedding jobs. Other nations have unemployment rates of nine and 10 per cent; if you go to Europe, unemployment is as high as 16 per cent in some countries. That in itself is a fundamental drag on growth and a cause of great concern. You would think that in this House today they would be celebrating this very important outcome for all Australians-the fact that we have been successful in supporting small business and supporting families. One of the lessons that this country has learnt through the experience of the last couple of years is that we do need to take the hard decisions to support our economy. They were not capable of taking the hard decisions to support us when we put in place fiscal stimulus, which is responsible for the outcome that we are seeing today. They squibbed it. They came into this House and they voted it down and they voted it down in the Senate in the first passage. That fiscal stimulus was absolutely important to the financial security of every Australian. On that occasion they did not display any understanding of the threat. Equally, they have no understanding of what we need to do now to build on that success to put in place the essential economic reforms that can create prosperity as we move forward. They were wrong about stimulus and they are wrong about tax modernisation because they are simply out of touch and have no grasp of economics whatsoever. Budget",95

90,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hasluck for her question and for her ongoing interest in the economic future particularly of the west. Today I granted major project facilitation status to the West Pilbara iron ore project. This recognises its economic significance to Australia and it shows that the government is getting on with the job of supporting investment so that Australia can take full advantage of the global recovery. This is a $4 billion project which will commercialise 500 million tonnes of iron ore. It will generate some $2 billion every year in export revenue and create 4,000 jobs during construction. I spoke with the project manager yesterday, who confirmed that, with today's announcement, they are on track to start construction on this iron ore project next year, with production to begin in 2013. This is good news for the Pilbara and it is good news for the nation. As we all know, a project of this scale needs infrastructure. In this case, the West Pilbara iron ore project will construct a 275kilometre heavy haulage railway and a new deep-water port at Anketell Point, both with opportunities for third-party access. This is an issue right across the country. We need not just private sector investment in infrastructure; we also need to have a capacity to leverage with public investment in infrastructure. Only this morning, the member for Maranoa was calling for an urgent upgrade of the Landsborough Highway to cope with the pressure from the Galilee Basin coal projects. The Rudd government's tax reform plan will support more sustainable growth across the economy by helping to build infrastructure capacity around Australia as resource projects come on line. That is why the Rudd government wants to establish the infrastructure fund as part of its proposed resource super profits tax. We stand for a stronger economy. We recognise that even in areas where there has been a substantial mining boom-such as Port Hedland or Karratha or Newman-you see, in spite of the extraordinary wealth that is being generated, a lack of infrastructure, whether it be export based infrastructure restricting our capacity for growth, or whether it be social infrastructure, such as education, health and childcare facilities. And, frankly, I am surprised that the announcement of a project such as this, with major project facilitation by the federal government, is not welcomed by all in this parliament. I assure the parliament it has been welcomed by the company concerned. Building the Education Revolution Program",97
91,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, my question is to the Minister for Education. I refer the minister to an interview today on the Ray Hadley program with Mr Brad Orgill, the head of the government's implementation task force. Mr Orgill admitted that he does not have access to cost data at schools. How can the task force charged with determining whether schools have received value for money do its job if the chairman does not have access to this data?",97
92,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I have not seen the transcript of Mr Orgill's interview, and of course I will check it now. I understand that those opposite have very little to do with their days other than sit by the radio, but I have not seen the transcript of Mr Orgill's interview. What I can say to the Leader of the Opposition is that Mr Orgill is able to get every document that can be accessed by the federal government, the Commonwealth government. As the Leader of the Opposition may be aware, under the arrangements for Building the Education Revolution, including the guidelines, we are able to access documentation by education authorities relating to Building the Education Revolution. For example, documents held by state governments or education authorities relevant to the rollout of the program and compliance with the guidelines can be accessed. I will have a look at Mr Orgill's transcript, and if I can assist the Leader of the Opposition further then I will. Budget",97
93,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, my question is to the Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism. How will the tax reform and the resource super profits tax in particular provide for Australia's long-term prosperity?",98
94,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, tax reform in this country is both necessary and long overdue. That is especially the case in the resources sector, the objective being to make it more efficient. That effectively means a very serious debate, one which the government is engaged in, about removing royalties and introducing a profit based system. A profit based system will provide fiscal stability compared to the current situation, where state governments can and do lift royalty rates when they need to boost their bottom line, as is currently occurring in the state of Western Australia. It will also turn the lose-lose situation of the royalties based system around, which means the same revenue is paid in the good times as in the bad. I remind the House that during the good times, when prices are high and profits are high, a profit based system provides the Australian community with a fairer return on the nation's non-renewable resources. Equally, during the bad times, when prices are low and profits are low, a profit based system provides timely tax relief for miners. And on many occasions, the minerals industry has sought that relief from state based premiers and treasurers. That is not just my view; it is also the view of the Minerals Council of Australia. They have set out a case for a profit based system in their submission to the Henry review. I was fortunate today to be amongst friends at the Minerals Council of Australia annual meeting. I want to bring to the attention of the House what the CEO of the Minerals Council of Australia said today. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition ought to take some interest in this; he might learn something about the minerals sector in Australia. This is what Mr Hooke had to say this morning: We certainly do want to see a profits based system. He went on to say: All the economists who say moving to a profitsbased system is the way to go are right. The CEO of the MCA went even further: We're the ones that said let's move to a profit based system. Ipso facto, you pay more tax when you earn more profit. I only wish that the Leader of the Opposition would pay a little bit of serious attention to what is a complex debate. Yesterday we had the Leader of the Opposition suggesting that what we are talking about is an extraction tax. We are actually talking about a profitbased tax. He clearly showed, again, that he is focused on the politics of the debate rather than the current hard policy options for the Australian community. That comes as no surprise to me, because-as we all knowhe finds economics boring. When it comes to advice on the minerals industry, he turns to the patron saint of the coalition-one Clive Palmer. We saw a cameo appearance by Clive Palmer at the National Press Club today. I only wish that the Leader of the Opposition had had time to watch that rather than delivering his political diatribe to the Minerals Council at lunchtime  night ago he was making threats about walking away from investment in South Australia. Well, we are still looking for that project. Last week we had him running around saying that the resources sector in Australia pays a tax rate of 70 per cent. When he was questioned about that at the Press Club today, he was all over the shop like a dog's breakfast. He could not support his previous claim that the resources industry pays a tax of 70 per cent. One should not be surprised, because  around. I think the Australian community is fast coming to the conclusion that you cannot  tion seriously. Only a matter of a couple of weeks ago he was making similar threats to another very important section of the Australian community-one that is pretty important to a lot of ordinary people because of their love of sport. I go to his endeavours to stand over the Football Federation Australia and his claim that he was going to walk away from the sponsorship of the North Queensland  tional Press Club today, you almost came to the conclusion that the poor bloke was walking around with his backside out of his pants. This is what he had to say a couple of weeks ago, and this really goes to the question of his credibility and the credibility of the opposition. When asked about his support for the Fury and whether or not he had the financial resources to meet those commitments-and he now says that the resources sector cannot afford to pay more taxes-he was quoted as saying: “I can afford to lose eight million every day of this year and still be alright, you know,” he laughed. Well, this is no laughing matter. This is a serious debate about the future of the Australian resources industry. I simply say that this government is committed to getting the balance right-the appropriate balance between attracting investment in the resources sector of Australia and ensuring that the Australian community get a fair return on the development of the resources that they own 100 per cent.

102,Mr WOOD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education.

107,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Manager of Opposition Business cannot continually defy standing order 65(b). In this case the Deputy Prime Minister is responding to the question. She should be heard in silence. I take it that the member for La Trobe is actually listening to the answer. He should be able to hear it.,100
108,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You have to be careful of those interjections that show your ignorance. Swift Construction has been contacted by the Victorian Department of Education and Early Childhood Development. I am that, following those contacts, Swift Construction has actually advised the Victorian department that the template that is being used cannot be delivered for under $3 million using the BER processes. That is my advice from the Victorian department. On the question of suspending this program, about which I was asked-and I presume that there is some level of interest in an answer to the question asked, which is not being exhibited at the moment-can I explain to the member for La Trobe that I think there has been an apprehension that money being conveyed by the Commonwealth to education authorities on 1 July is somehow immediately expended on 1 July and, consequently, any recommendations in Mr Orgill's report in August cannot be actioned. I say to the member for La Trobe that this apprehension is not right. Let me take this opportunity to explain to the member for La Trobe, given that he has asked me directly about it, that what is happening is as follows. Payment is being made on 1 July in accordance with our education agreements-that is true. There are two more instalments of funding due to education authorities, one in November 2010 and the second in March 2011. These payments amount to around $3.5 billion and relate only to Primary Schools for the 21st Century. When amounts are paid by the Commonwealth to education authorities they are not immediately expended; they are held by those education authorities and they are drawn down when projects reach appropriate milestones. Consequently, even with money being conveyed on 1 July, there are payments to come in the future, and the money paid on 1 July will be held by education authorities and drawn down in relation to project milestones. Consequently, the report we will receive from Mr Orgill in August and any recommendations that he makes can be actioned. I have also said-and I am happy to repeat to the parliament very, very clearly-that Mr Orgill is at liberty to make recommendations earlier if he chooses. Of course, I am all ears in relation to those recommendations. Finally, and in conclusion, the member for La Trobe asked me about the question of a suspension. I refer him to today's national accounts data, particularly to the fact that private non-residential building investment fell further in the quarter and remains at a depressed level. Without the substantial ongoing support provided to the sector by the Building the Education Revolution program, activity and employment in this sector would be at an even lower level.",100

116,Mr GEORGANAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts. What action is the government taking to end whaling in the Southern Ocean and around the world?",101
117,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. I know he has a strong interest in the Rudd government's actions in opposing so-called commercial whaling-scientific whaling-in the Southern Ocean and globally. The member asks me what actions the government is taking and I am pleased to report to the House on a number of actions that this government has taken in opposing commercial whaling and continuing to seek a permanent end to whaling worldwide, particularly in the Southern Ocean. Since coming to office the government has embarked on a comprehensive diplomatic engagement on this issue, including the appointment of a Special Envoy on Whale Conservation. Additionally, we have advanced a strong reform agenda focusing particularly on conservation and science at the International Whaling Commission, which is the body that regulates these issues, a proposal that was widely supported and discussed and will continue to be the subject of deliberation in the IWC process. The Rudd government has also launched the largest research partnership of its kind in the world, the Southern Ocean Research Partnership, a $32 million non-lethal whale research partnership open to all nations of the tional Whaling Commission, so that we can prove once and for all that we can have whale research without needing to kill a single whale. In the run-up to the IWC we have also brought forward our own reform agenda which sets out our compromise proposals, including a phase-out of Southern Ocean whaling within five years and specifically no targeting of endangered or threatened species. Of course people listening will know that the government has taken the additional step, on 28 May, of announcing that Australia will initiate legal action in the International Court of Justice in The Hague against Japanese scientific whaling in the Southern Ocean, and that application is now lodged in the court. This is not a decision that is taken lightly. The government have been patient and committed in our efforts to find a diplomatic resolution to this issue. We have remained in intensive discussions in the IWC and bilaterally with Japan, and we will continue to work hard in the lead-up to and at the IWC meeting in June to pursue our objectives. We judge that the chance for an outcome at that meeting which meets Australia's fundamental conservation objectives is slim, but Australia will continue to engage constructively in the diplomatic effort. Importantly, we have enjoyed support for our proposals broadly from other IWC members who share Australia's concerns and goals, but the fact is that recent statements by whaling countries in the commission have provided little hope that our commitment to conservation of the world's whales will be reflected in any potential IWC compromise agreement. Having been unable to make the necessary progress we said we wanted to see, we now move to the next stage: legal action. I noticed some remarks from nongovernment organisations once that announcement was made. The International Interna- Fund for Animal Welfare said: The Australian government is the leading voice in whale conservation and today's announcement demonstrates that they are willing to put their words into action by taking this unprecedented step. The Australian Marine Conservation Society said on 28 May: It is about time a government stood up for the whales and we commend the Rudd Government for showing backbone. The fact is that this government has done more in just over two years on whale conservation than the coalition did under government in 12 years. It is a fact that the whale conservation efforts of the coalition, when they were in government, were miserable, were full of cliches and, critically, despite much table thumping, saw a doubling in the number of whales targeted in the Southern Ocean. That is the critical point here: in the entire period of time the coalition had carriage of this issue, the success of their activities can be judged by the fact that the number of whales targeted in the Southern Ocean doubled. That is because they have been confused over a number of matters in relation to taking re-election. Mr Hunt demanded that the government take international legal action, in August last year: We think Australia should put together a coalition of nations to proceed legally against Japan under the International Law of the Sea. In January the Leader of the Opposition said that legal action was not coalition policy. He said: Coalition policy is not to take Japan to the International Court. Then last Friday he had a bob each way with a hybrid model: ‘We do support appropriate action, but we are not sure if we support this specific action.' The opposition leader should make it clear specifically whether he does support, or not, the government's action to initiate legal action in the International Court of Justice. In the meantime, the government remain absolutely opposed to commercial whaling, including so-called scientific whaling, and we will continue our efforts and our actions to ensure that these majestic creatures are not killed in the name of science. Telecommunications",101
118,Mr JOHNSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Leader of the House and the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy. Could the minister update the people of Ryan, but especially the people of Bardon in the Ryan electorate, which postcodes are covered by the four land access and activity notices, or LANS, issued in 2009 for the installation of wireless facilities onto residential apartment buildings? Further, were any land access and activity notices issued prior to 2009 and, if so, in which Australian postcodes?",103
119,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the independent member for Ryan for his question and indicate to him that this data is not held by the government; it is held by industry. The member should therefore seek the information from industry. The government does, however, appreciate that there is substantial community concern, and legitimate concern, around these issues. I know that the issue of Bardon has created some controversy, as has, indeed, one particular tower in my electorate. There is community concern. The government is conscious of that. The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, within the health portfolio, sets the mandatory limits on public exposure based on safe international best practice guidelines. I note that these arrangements were put in place by the previous government. Under these arrangements, carriers must issue notices responsibly, and there are rules on safety, consultation and compensation. We believe it is important to balance the community need for good communications infrastructure with community concerns on this issue. Communities that believe a carrier has not complied with its obligations should contact either the carrier or the Australian Communications and Media Authority. The industry code is currently under review, and it is appropriate that the government consider the findings of this review. But I will convey the member's question directly to the minister for communications and suggest that, if he has anything directly to add, he convey that directly to the member. Infrastructure",103

Are there any risks to these investments, particularly in the Hunter region?",103
121,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hunter for his question. He indeed is a member who understands that, when it comes to delivering transport infrastructure, long-term planning and certainty is vital. That is why the reckless statements over the last fortnight by the coalition are so alarming. They are attempting to say one thing here in the parliament but then another thing completely in their electorates. Indeed, the shadow minister for finance released a statement, as part of the budget response, when pass-the-parcel had ended. He said: Given the commitment to release the costings of already announced policies following is a table costings relating to our $4.8 billion spending commitmentsand then that table was included. He then stated in a press release, distributed after the famous press conference here, cut short by his advisor, that: Any other past commitments have been discontinued. It was a very clear statement from the person responsible for providing a finance position which was a part of the budget response. However, they are continuing to say something different out there in their electorates. Indeed, in a letter to the editor of local papers, Mr Robb, the member for Goldstein, said-wait for this quote: The claims by Mr Albanese that this commitment has been discontinued are completely and utterly false. Well, I am sorry if we have quoted the shadow finance minister, in a carefully scripted and written down comment we thought was gospel truth! That is all we have done. But they are continuing to say one thing in here, around Canberra, one thing to the press gallery about their being concerned about debt and deficit, and that they are not going to make any irresponsible promises, but something else out their in the electorates. The other thing they have done is that the shadow finance minister, when asked how he would fund roads, said that he would use Roads to Recovery funding-a big ‘woops' moment from the member for Goldstein. The 565 local governments around Australia that receive untied funding to fund their local roads now know that all of that funding is under threat. The coalition will pillage that funding, in the words of the shadow finance minister. In the electorate of Paterson, in the Hunter: Dungog Shire Council, $2 millionof gone; Gloucester Shire Council, $2 million-gone; Great Lakes Council, $3.7 million-gone; Maitland City Council, $2.8 million-gone; and Port Stephens, $2.7 million-gone. But it gets worse, because they cannot get enough cash to pay for all their promises simply by plundering local government. They have also drawn up a separate infrastructure hit list. In the same letter to local papers the shadow minister for finance said: There's still many projects worth billions of dollars in the Rudd Government budget which have not started … So all of the infrastructure projects, if they have not commenced-and the Leader of the Nationals has said the same thing-are up for grabs. In the Hunter, that means the $1.65 billion Hunter expressway, due to commence construction in 2010Mr Baldwin-It's already started, you goose!",104
122,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Construction has not started, because this mob opposite had not even purchased the properties along the route, and that had to be done, or had the planning put in place. So that will commence in 2010. Mr Truss-You stopped it!",104

What the opposition now have to do is go through the $37 billion nation-building program and say which projects will proceed and which ones they will attempt to stop-even though all of them are subject to memoranda of understanding with state and territory governments. We know that when they last came to office they cut billion from the roads budget. We also know that it is symptomatic of their attitude to infrastructure across the board. In the Hunter region, right up there the top, the election of Paterson, the trade training centre at Bulahdelah Central School-$ 1½ million under threat; the trade training centre at Great Lakes College-$4½ million under threat; and the 577 computers in Paterson that kids will miss out on as a result of this opposition's reckless We need to know exactly what they stand for. We will be holding them to account-on the ground, in each and every electorate between now and election day.

That is what I mean by standing up for your electorate, member for Gilmore. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-I rise on a point of order. I refer you again to page 553 of the House of Representatives Practice, where it says that an answer, to remain relevant, must maintain a link to the substance of the question.

The member for Sturt will not be allowed one iota of latitude from now on in question time. He only knows that that is because of other things that he is responsible for. Holding up that picture was very silly, in the circumstances. On the point of order of the member for Mackellar, after the interruption by the member for Gilmore-I am not saying that in any way to criticise the member for Gilmore-the Deputy Prime Minister showed that she knew that she had to relate her remarks to the question. I invite her now to rise and to respond to the question from the member for Gilmore.",106
131,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In response to the question, the member for Gilmore has raised with me an individual school. I assure the member for Gilmore, I want to get value for dollars spent on schools. On this side of the House we value education. That is why we are allocating money to Building the Education Revolution, trades training centres, computers in schools and teacher quality. We understand that the Leader of the Opposition-and maybe the member for Gilmore has a different view but she is not standing up for it-does not value this expenditure and wants to cut it all. Can I tell the member for Gilmore the appropriate course in relation to the individual school she raises: I have specifically created the Building the Education Revolution Implementation Taskforce, led by Mr Orgill, to deal with these matters. If she chooses, she can refer this matter to the taskforce. Then, on the matter of what the taskforce can do next-it was suggested in a question importo me today that the taskforce cannot get documents-I refer the member for Gilmore to the agreements we have with education authorities that require, in clauses 3.2 and 6.4, the provision of documents, when requested, which can go to the taskforce. I also indicate, in response to the member for Gilmore, and on the question of the Building the Education Revolution Implementation Taskforce generally, that a little earlier today the Leader of the Opposition suggested in a question to me that Mr Orgill had said to Ray Hadley on his show this morning that he had admitted he does not have access to cost data in schools.

What risks are there to those initiatives, particularly in the Illawarra and New South Wales South Coast regions?",106
135,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Cunningham for her question. It was very appropriate, because I know that she enthusiastically welcomed the government's announcement of a regional cancer facility in her electorate-$12 million for the Illawarra. It is something that has long been needed and is one of a number of regional cancer centres that have been announced across the country. Today, the 20th announcement was made-$1.8 million to the ACT. It is one of the smaller investments but is a very important one. It will fund accommodation facilities, particularly for those people travelling from the broader south-east in the electorate of Eden-Monaro and those surrounds, for people that have to come to Canberra for services and often struggle with finding accommodation. These are very important projects that the government has been proud to announce. The member for Gilmore would be interested in this question as well, because a $23 million investment is being made in establishing a Shoalhaven regional cancer centre. This project will fund a linear erator, a CT scanner, eight chemotherapy chairs and 10 patient accommodation places.",107
136,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,107
137,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,When is it going to happen?,107
138,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have not noticed, despite the overwhelming support for the need for these investments, any support coming from those opposite. In fact, I can hear members opposite yelling out, ‘When will this happen?' It did not happen under the previous government for 12 years. We have now invested $560 million in more than 20 projects across the country. What we fear, and I think the member for Gilmore should fear, is that we have no promise from those opposite that this money will be honoured, that these commitments will be honoured, under a Liberal government. We have reason to be dubious about whether they will be honoured, because the Leader of the Opposition pulled a billion dollars out of our hospital system. He already in the budget reply has promised to pull another $800 million out of the system. The shadow minister for health, on Friday, committed to withdrawing another $450 million from the budget because they do not support our diabetes initiatives. So members like the member for Gilmore need to be standing up and committing to these projects, need to be standing up for their communities and need to be making sure that the Leader of the Opposition, who was a risk to health expenditure when he was in the portfolio, allows these important projects to continue. There is a legitimate question about when these investments will be delivered. Cancer investments take a very long period of time. The member that wants to interject will remember that in 12 years his government did not commit to any of these investments. I would be surprised if the member for interjecting-he probably is the member for interjecting; nevertheless, I do not think that is accel- the name of his seat-the member for O'Connor, would not welcome $22 million going to regional cancer services in Albany, Northam, Narrogin, Geraldton and Kalgoorlie or $23 million going to the St John of God Hospital in Bunbury. I would have thought the member for Forest would also be welcoming this. We could go through the very long list. The point I am making, however, is that the Leader of the Opposition has not committed to protect this expenditure. He has already on his tab-his snatch and grab list of what he is going to do with our health expenditure-pulled $1.2 billion out of the system. We fear that these important cancer investments are next. If those backbenchers who stand to benefit from these investments do not get on quick smart to the Leader of the Opposition to tell him that this money should be protected, these long-term vital investments may not be made. That would be a tragedy, because the reason the government is making these investments comes down to one very important fact: if you are an Australian who lives in rural and regional Australia and you get the dreadful news that you have a diagnosis of cancer, your chance of surviving is three times worse than if you are a person in the city who gets that same diagnosis. That is not good enough. It is an embarrassment for a country like Australia. It is the reason that $560 million is being invested in regional cancer centres. We would like to see those opposite standing up for regional Australia for once and agreeing that this money will be protected by any future government. Building the Education Revolution Program",107
139,Mrs MARKUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education. I refer the minister to reports that the Mount Victoria Public School will under the BER receive a Colorbond demountable classroom for $850,000-something the school P&C are not happy with. I also refer the minister to www.domain.com.au where, just down the road from Mount Victoria Public School, there is a ‘truly unique custom-built and designed home for sale for $485,000'. This home has a ‘generous outdoor area, spa, sauna, flowing stream, fish pond and potter's studio'. Minister, can you explain to the P&C of Mount Victoria Public School how their demountable classroom will be value for money, when just down the road this substantial home is for sale at almost half the price?",108
140,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Greenway for her question. Can I say this to the member for Greenway: when we see comparisons made on building costs, sometimes in the media and sometimes in this parliament, it is very important to be comparing like with like. I am not sure that in member's question we have really seen a comparison of like with like. However, can I say to the member that if the P&C at that school is concerned about value for money on their Building the Education Revolution project, then so am I. We are concerned to make sure that dollars spent on schools make a difference for schools, that dollars spent on schools go to maximum effect. As a government, and the member for Greenway might want to contemplate this, we have prioritised the education revolution and school education because we inherited a system that was groaning after more than a decade of neglect. That is why we are investing in trades training centres, to give kids an opportunity to get the skills they need for life and work, and the opposition wants to cut that back. That is why we are investing in computers in schools, so kids can learn with the learning tool of the 21st century, and the opposition wants to cut that back. That is why we are investing in teacher quality, to bring the best teachers to the classrooms that need them the most, to pay the best teachers more to go to the classrooms that need them the most, and the opposition wants to cut that back. And it is why, during this difficult economic period when we have needed to support jobs particularly in non-residential construction, as shown by the national accounts today, we have chosen to invest in schools.

146,Ms PARKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Why is economic certainty immemportant for our long-term prosperity? How are government initiatives supporting communities? And are there any risks to these initiatives, particularly in Western Australia?",109
147,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. Certainty is very important for the future of the Australian economy, particularly with respect to longer term investment that will deliver more jobs and particularly with respect to ensuring that investment can produce higher economic growth in a low-inflation environment. Underneath those issues, there are critical questions of economic capacity that face Australia that the government, when in opposition, pointed to time after time and that the Reserve Bank pointed to time after time when the Howard government was failing to address them. These issues of course are issues of skill shortages and inadequate infrastructure, and therefore central to the Rudd government's economic strategy has been an obsessive focus on improving Australia's skills and improving our infrastructure. It is important to note that this is occurring at a number of levels, and one of those levels is through local communities. I want to draw the attention of the House to the impact of the position being taken by the opposition on these issues at a slightly more local level, in this case the electorate of Swan in Western Australia. The coalition proposes to abandon the trades training centres that the government is putting in place in schools all around the country, and that means that St Norbert College would lose $1.4 million for its trades training centre; Belmont City College, sharing with Canning College, would lose $3 million for its trades training centre; and Kent St Senior High School, sharing with Como Secondary College, would lose $3 million for its trades training centre. Schools in the electorate of Swan would also miss out on 710 computers for secondary students. The point about this is that these trades training centres and computers are all about providing school students with the early steps to developing the skills that will serve them and the Australian economy so well in the future. It is about giving people access opportunity to develop skills at an early age so they can move on into the work force and earn good pay, do good jobs, and contribute high incomes for their families and high economic growth for Australia-and noninflationary economic growth, because there is economic capacity to absorb higher investment. Now the attitude of the opposition on these things does not just extend to the vandalism of getting rid of these vital trades training centres and computers-critical facilities and 21st century tools for young ple to learn skills in our schools. It also tends to improving roads in local communities, roads that are important infrastructureboth economic and social infrastructure. So in the electorate of Swan the Roads to Recovery program is now under threat because of the approach being taken by the shadow finance minister, the fifth shadow finance minister-‘Andrew the Fifth'. As a result of the approach being taken by the shadow finance minister on behalf of the coalition, the City of Belmont will lose $1.25 million; the City of Canning will lose $2.85 million; the City of Gosnells will lose $3.38 million; the City of South Perth, $970,000; the Shire of Kalamunda, $2.28 million; and the Town of Victoria Park, $871,000. All of these investments are about improving Australia's infrastructure and that means huge projects and it also means local projects. It means our local roads as well as our major freeways and highways, and it means our local schools as well as across-the-nation programs. This is simply economic vandalism by the coalition. It is vandalism of the highest order because these are critical parts of ensuring that the Australian community can enjoy long-term sustainable growth and prosperity for its future by investing now in the things that drive that prosperity: skills and infrastructure-the very things that when in office the coalition to failed to invest in and therefore created big inflationary pressures. These are the things that the Rudd government is committed to investing in and these are the things that are critical to Australia, both at the local community level and at the national level. Building the Education Revolution Program  the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to a letter from the group of concerned builders and parents who gathered outside the parliament today to draw attention to the peo- endemic waste and mismanagement in the exschool hall stimulus program. In particular I quote: We require you to initiate a judicial inquiry into the spending of all moneys thus far on the BER and withhold the release of the final $5½ billion until an independent audit has been carried out on the remaining projects.

I heard it was sort of ‘stop the funding, restructure it' and enable yourself to slip and slide through each of the seats represented by those opposite and have members pretend, on the one hand, that they are not opposed to an investment in their local school and, on the other hand, pretend here that they are in fact doing something exactly the reverse. The member for Sturt twists and turns on this matter. Watch his correspondence and look at his behaviour on the ground as one after another of those opposite have stood up in front of their public schools and said, ‘We welcome this investment.' Mr Speaker, do you know something: those opposite, if they have any integrity on this question, need to actually list by name, by school in each one of their electorates which project they support and which they oppose, because there are many of these projects underway at present-7,000 of them-and a large number would be in the electorates represented by those opposite. Which will you stop and which will you allow to continue? That is the core question which will be asked in each and every one of your electorates as this year progresses. But I make one further point to the member for Sturt in response to his question. If he bothered, as those opposite may have bothered, to listen to the exposition on the national accounts earlier today or read the reports associated with the national accounts, he would understand one thing: what has stood between Australia and going into recession is this government's stimulus strategy. What has stood between this country going into recession is this government's stimulus strategy. What has prevented 200,000 more people going out of work is this government's stimulus strategy. What has enabled tens of thousands of small businesses to continue to operate is this government's stimulus strategy.

Each and every one of the building subcontractors welcomes these school buildings. They welcome new language centres. They welcome new science centres. They welcome also, on top of that, new state-of the-art learning centres for primary schools. Each and every one of these is welcomed by local communities. But the Leader of the Opposition sits there and guffaws. He sits and guffaws because he knows nothing about economics; he has no interest in economics. He has been described by the previous Treasurer as being unfit to occupy any economic portfolio in the government, most particularly that of Treasurer. His colleagues the previous cabinet said he could not be described remotely as a fiscal conservative, that he had one attitude to every proposal, which was to run to the office of the former Prime Minister and seek intervention. The Leader of the Opposition knows full well that, had we prosecuted his recipe, which was to implement the New Zealand solution for the Australian economy, this economy would have gone into recession, this economy would have seen the loss of hundreds of thousands of Australian jobs and those opposite know that full well. So the sanctimonious performance by those opposite as they stand here and pretend to be interested in macro-economic questions on debt and deficit and the impact of these investments in their schools is all one paper tissue of untruths and misrepresentations. Those opposite know the truth on the ground. They know that these investments are critical to the future of school communities. Dr Southcott interjecting",111

I am sure she is very concerned that the Leader of the Opposition wants to prevent 851 computers being delivered to her electorate.

He does not even seem to understand that, when you instruct your shadow finance minister to cut back money from schools, it hurts and it hurts school communities. He does not even seem to get that. The fact that the Leader of the Opposition is so bored by economics-so uninterested in education that he just has not got a view about providing things to schools, having been a member of a government that neglected education for more than a decade-is to be expected.

170,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am asked about threats to funding for schools. Let me direct the House's attention to the threats for funding to schools in the electorate of Canning. That would cause members to inquire: why isn't the member for Canning standing up for his local schools? Because when we look at the electorate of Canning and the things that are at risk as a result of the Leader of the Opposition's cutbacks, there is a $4.4 million trades training facility that is at risk. This is a facility that is a consortium between Boddington District High School, Armadale Christian college and others. Can I say to the House, because it is a convenient opportunity: the member for Sturt and the opposition consistently misrepresent the trades training centre program, pretending somehow that schools choosing to come together indicates there is a cutback in the program. Of course, that is completely untrue, completely phoney. This is a program running out exactly as promised. School principals, including those in the electorate of the member for Canning, have chosen to come together to get a bigger facility, to make a bigger difference to the kids-real skills for real jobs; $4.4 million-and the member for Canning will not stand up as the Leader of the Opposition rips that out of his electorate. At the next election voters in the electorate of Canning will have a choice to get a member who will stand up for their electorate. On the question of choice, there will also be a choice in the electorate of Sturt, because obviously the member for Sturt does not want his schools to benefit from the more than $93 million that they have had under Building the Education Revolution. I have been to the electorate of Sturt and to a local school there. Let me tell you: the member for Sturt is not there saying, ‘I voted against this project.' The member for Sturt is not there saying, ‘I consider all of this to be a waste.' The member for Sturt is not repeating his grabs on radio that this is about flushing money out the door to schools. That is not what he says there locally, of course. When he is there locally he does not criticise this funding to schools-$93 million in Building the Education Revolution money. But the member for Sturt will also be called to account by his local electorate why he supports the Leader of the Opposition's cuts to computers in schools. That means he is a shadow minister for education and a local member who wants to rip 112 computers away from Charles Campbell Secondary School. He wants to rip 143 computers away from Norwood Morialta High School. He wants to rip 69 computers away from St Ignatius College. This is what is under threat because of the Leader of the Opposition and the policies of the shadow minister for education and member for Sturt. Let us be absolutely clear: on this side of the House, we believe that schools are important; on this side of the House, we are proud to be delivering Building the Education Revolution, trade trading centres, the digital education revolution and money for teacher quality. The hunt on the other side of the House for a member prepared to stand up for their electorate will continue. We have not found one yet. Mr Rudd- Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. JAPAN: RESIGNATION OF PRIME NA",113
171,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MINSTER," Mr Speaker, on indulgence: I draw the attention of members to developments in Japan today. Prime Minster Hatoyama has announced his intention to stand down as Prime Minister. This follows the departure from his ruling coalition of the Social Democratic Party over the Futenma base issue. I make these very brief remarks to the House because Prime Minister Hatoyama has been a good friend of Australia both during his period as Prime Minister, where we have seen the strategic and security aspects of our partnership deepen, and before becoming Prime Minister. He would be known to members of the House, including your good as to self, Mr Speaker. I recently had the good fortune to meet, together with Defence Minister Faulkner, with the Prime Minister in Tokyo following the two plus two defence and foreign affairs meeting between Australia and Japan. He again referred to the importance of the Australia-Japan relationship and underlined its comprehensive nature, and we wish him well for the future. I am advised that the Democratic Party of Japan, Prime Minister Hatoyama's party, will elect a new prime minister and leader in the next few days. We very much look forward to working closely with the new prime minister. In conclusion, the relationship-the comprehensive economic, strategic and security partnership-that Australia has with Japan is one of those relationships in which, irrespective of which political party is governing in Canberra and which political party is governing in Tokyo, the strength and importance of the relationship continues.",114
172,Ms JULIE BISHOP,MINSTER," Mr Speaker, on indulgence: Japan is one of our longest-standing friends. We have many matters of mutual interest and shared values. We have long standing trade, diplomatic and security ties. Japan was governed by one political party for about 50 years, yet it remains a vibrant democracy. Political history was made last August when the Liberal Democratic Party was defeated by the Democratic Party of Japan led by Mr Hatoyama. Soon after the election, I took the opportunity to visit Tokyo and met with ministers and government officials. They recognised the enormous challenge that the government would face being a new party in government after 50 years and were mindful of the difficulty in implementing a number of their election promises. It is always a difficult time for a country when the national leader resigns. Mr Hatoyama is clearly a man of enormous integrity. He has accepted full responsibility for his inability to honour an election promise that he made to the people of Japan regarding the US military bases in Okinawa. While he has resigned as the Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Hatoyama's legacy will be one both of enormous achievement in winning the election for his party in 2009 and also of his nity and integrity over this issue.

184,Mr JOHNSON,PRIVILEGE,"on indulgence-Thank you, Mr Speaker. Earlier this week, on Monday, 31 May, the Leader of the House raised a matter of privilege. I wish to expand on the Leader of the House's remarks. I wish to confirm that the Leader of the House and I had a discussion earlier that morning prior to his raising the matter of privilege. I wish to confirm that, in his role as Leader of the House, it was appropriate for Mr Albanese to raise the matter of privilege. After receiving further advice, it is also entirely appropriate and necessary for me personally to substantiate the basis of the Leader of the House's initial remarks on Monday, 31 May 2010. It is entirely appropriate for several compelling reasons, but, fundamentally, the attempt to pressure, bully, threaten, intimidate or exert improper influence upon any federal member of parliament or federal senator to resign from the Australian parliament against the wishes of that federal member or senator is, in my view, an extremely serious act. It is an act of political corruption upon the integrity of our democracy. This culture of bullying and intimidation must have no place in any political party. This culture of harassment and pressure must be stamped out of the Australian body politic. Individuals in political parties must not be laws unto themselves, as is evidently the case, in my view, in the highest echelons of the Liberal National Party in Queensland. I wish to read into the record a letter I wrote to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mr Tony Negus, prior to my expulsion from the LNP: Dear Commissioner Negus, … … … I am writing to raise a very grave and serious issue concerning whether or not certain conduct by Mr Bruce MCIver, President of the Liberal National Party (LNP) in Queensland, might constitute improper influence-if not illegal pressure and breach of Federal criminal legislation-upon a Member of the Australian Parliament. On the morning of Thursday, 25th February, 2010, Mr Bruce MCIver, President of the Liberal National Party (LNP) in Queensland, and I had a meeting in my Canberra Parliamentary office. Mr Brian Loughnane, the Federal Director of the Liberal Party, was also present during the entire meeting. During that meeting, Mr MCIver expressed certain language towards me that I personally took to be extremely intimidating and of an entirely improper character. During this meeting, Mr MCIver called upon me in no uncertain terms to resign from the Federal Parliament at the next election otherwise, he informed me, he would present certain material in his possession to the police. During this meeting, Mr MCIver produced a large “black folder” which he alleged contained material and documents that was evidence of alleged criminal behaviour on my part and could see me “go to jail” if he personally instructed the LNP to conduct further investigation into me. Immediately after the meeting, I informed one of my staff members who was in the adjacent room of the tenor, tone and content of the meeting. Subsequent to this meeting, a second meeting was held in my Canberra Parliamentary office on Thursday 11th March, 2010, Again, both Mr Bruce MCIver and Mr Brian Loughnane were present. During this meeting, a Canberra based lawyer from the national law firm, DLA Phillips Fox, was also present at my request, as well as an actual member of my staff. It was at this meeting that Mr MCIver produced an email off my Parliamentary account for me to read.  of order. I do not wish to interrupt my colleague the member for Ryan, but this is a very unprecedented use of indulgence and I am concerned that the information that he is providing to the House is information that he should be giving as evidence to a Privileges Committee inquiry, not placing on the record at the end of question time.",115
185,The SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"The member for Ryan was adding to the submission that had been put to me by the Leader of the House as to the reasons that I should investigate certain circumstances to determine if I would indicate to the House that there was a prima facie case for it to be referred to the Standing Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests. That is the point that we were at. The member for Ryan is reading into the record a letter. It would have been usual for that letter to have been tabled by him to form part of the material that I would consider to ascertain whether, in my report back to the House, there was a prima facie case. The difficulty is that I have allowed him to start reading it into the record. I have to admit that this letter was referred to me by the member for Ryan and I did not recall how long it was-it is a lot longer than I recall. I will allow him to complete reading the letter into the record, but if he has other material I would advise him to table it and not read it into the record. That is the only aspect of this that is a bit out of the ordinary, because we are only at the stage of my consideration of a report to the House about whether it should be referred to the Privileges Committee. I call the member for Ryan in conclusion.",116
186,Mr JOHNSON,PRIVILEGE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. The letter continued: He indicated to me that this was evidence of why his demand for me to resign from Parliament was justified. The means by which Mr MCIver came to be in possession of this email has never been explained by Mr MCIver, either to myself or to my lawyers. There is absolutely no doubt at all in my mind that Mr MCIver's language and his conduct at both meetings was designed to bring enormous pressure upon me to resign my Federal seat of Ryan from the Australian Parliament-directly and specifically against my wishes. The crystal clear and indelible impression was left in my mind-due to his words and his conduct-that unless I agreed to resign my Federal seat of Ryan, there would be severe political and legal consequences for me personally. The intent to force me to resign-against my wishes-was clear, deliberate, unambiguous and unequivocal. In the hours, days and weeks that followed, I have written extensively to various stakeholders (party political, parliamentary, and private) confirming the two meetings and in my view, the highly improper threats that followed at each meeting. As you will appreciate the profound sensitivity of this matter, it is not appropriate for me to in depth in this letter. However, in my capacity as a sitting member of the Australian Parliament, I am formally calling on the Australian Federal Police to commence an investigation, including interviews with all relevant parties, and to consider whether a substantive investigation into whether or not Mr Mclver's conduct was improper at law and breached any Federal legislation. I would, of course, be willing and able to provide further information to trigger such investigation. The improper influence by any individual person upon a Member or Senator of the Australian Parliament is a most serious occurrence. To that end, I would of course personally be willing and able to co-operate with the Australian Federal Police. I would also be willing and able to be interviewed at length and to present more detailed information and material to a relevant Australian Federal Police Officer who might be assigned to this case. I am certainly of the view that a meeting between a Federal Police Officer and myself is entirely appropriate and an urgent meeting would be prudent. Thank you for your time Commissioner and I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience. Yours sincerely Mr Michael A.. Johnson MP Federal Member for Ryan Mr Speaker, I end my remarks by again supporting very strongly the remarks of and the call for privilege as it was raised by the Leader of the House, and I do so again in my own name. I seek leave to table the document. Leave granted.",117
187,The SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"As I indicated, I will report back to the House at the earliest opportunity. NA Australian Financial Centre Forum",117
188,Mr BOWEN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Prospect-Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law and Minister for Human Services) (4.09 pm)-Almost a year ago to the day, I expand outlined to this chamber the government's progress on advancing Australia as a financial services centre. The Financial Services Hub Summit convened by the Prime Minister and me in July 2008 recommended regular updates to the House on progress in promoting Australia as a financials services tre, and I am very pleased to provide this update. Our financial services industry is one of the most sophisticated and stable in the world. Financial services is Australia's est industry, contributing 10.8 per cent to growth and employing 400,000 Australians. We continue to come across new opportunities for job creation and examples of resilience in the sector. In fact just this week, ING officially opened a new superannuation and investments operations centre in Wollongong. The centre will support an additional 250 jobs over the next three yearsbringing the centre's workforce to 600 in the Illawarra. The ING centre will predominantly focus on operational administration and call centre roles. Other roles to be recruited could include IT development and project related roles. The centre's 4½ star green rated building cost $41 million, took two years to build and employed 1,100 workers during construction. I mention this as an example of the types of benefits that flow from our ambition to promote Australian as a financial services centre. Beyond these more immediate contributions to the economy and employment, a well-functioning financial system is vital for broader economic prosperity and in addressing future challenges including the need to grow and manage our retirement savings as our population ages. Australia has always had a lot to offer in terms of its quality of life, the integrity of its corporate governance system and the quality of its workforce. The financial crisis has also highlighted the strengths of our financial sector and of our regulatory framework. This government has long recognised that the Australian financial services sector has a great deal of untapped potential. Our exports and imports of financial services are low by international standards. For example, while cen- Australian based investment managers manage $1.1 trillion of assets on behalf of domestic investors, they source only about $53 billion from overseas sources. Remedying this situation requires a government that is larg- willing to make a commitment to sensible ongoing reform. On 26 September 2008, the government announced the establishment of the Australian Financial Centre Forum to recommend ways we can position Australia as a leading financial services centre. The forum consisted of a diverse and highly experienced panel of industry experts headed by Mark Johnson AO, a retired deputy chairman of Macquarie Bank, and supported industry reference groups and a dedicated secretariat. The forum engaged with a broad range of stakeholders including regulators, professional service groups, education providers, union representatives and international and domestic financial services companies. On 11 May, as part of the 2010 budget, the government announced its response to the recommendations in the Australian Financial Centre Forum report (the Johnson report). Our response provides in-principle or direct support for nearly all of the 19 recommendations in the report. These include: - the introduction of an investment manager regime, providing greater certainty around the tax treatment of foreign funds managed by Australian investment managers; the establishment of an online regulatory gateway, providing domestic and international investors with a one-stop shop for basic information about the Australian market; and - the development of an Asia region funds passport, which would involve a multilateral framework to enable a complying retail investment fund in a country that signs up to the passport framework to fer its products in each of the other natory countries. We have already made progress on the recommendations in the report, in addition to introducing other initiatives to enhance our international competitiveness. For example, on 31 March, I announced support for competition between markets for trading in listed shares in Australia and in principle approval of the market licence application of Chi-X Australia. This announcement is in line with a Johnson report recommendation, which encouraged competitive, efficient and innovative equity markets, and is a vital step in the development of Australia as a financial services centre. The government also announced the release by ASIC of class order relief allowing listed entities which meet ASIC's criteria to issue bonds to retail investors using a simpliAustralia fied process. This initiative will help to ther develop our retail bond market, and is in line with a key recommendation of the Johnson report. As the Johnson report notes, Australia's equity market is well developed and significant on a global scale-being seventh largest globally and the second largest in the region behind Japan. However, our debt market is relatively small. A deeper and more liquid Australian corporate bond market will make it easier for Australian businesses to diversify their funding sources as an alternative to borrowing from the bank. Over time, this is expected to put competitive pressure on bank lending rates to business, and also reduce the amount of wholesale funding which our banks are required to raise in international capital markets. We also announced the decision to phase down the interest withholding tax paid by financial institutions, including local subsidiaries and branches when they pay interest on of- borrowings from their overseas parents. This sigreform also extends to Australian-owned financial institutions borrowing from related parties overseas and any financial institution accessing offshore retail deposits, which they on-lend to Australian business and consumers. These changes will provide an extra boost to banking competition, as well as promoting Australia as a financial services centre, and represents action on another Johnson recommendation. To ensure we continue to make progress, the government has appointed an ongoing Financial Centre Task Force. The task force will comprise Mr Mark Johnson AO as   emy Duffield, Mr Craig Dunn, Mr Shane  force will continue its work in promoting as a financial centre for the region furand facilitate industry input into the design of a range of proposals, including the Asia region funds management passport and the investment manager regime. Response to the reforms The government's response to the Johnson report united a wide range of stakeholders in their praise for the reforms. On 13 May 2010, the Australian Bankers Association said the following: This demonstrates the Government's continuing commitment to enhancing Australia as a financial services centre-the Government's response is a first good step to addressing some of the market and regulatory barriers to building Australia as a regional leader in financial services. On 26 May 2010 the Finance Sector Union noted: The Federal Government's plan to position Australia as a major financial services hub is widely supported by finance sector workers, and the Johnson Report recommendations should be adopted to ensure growth in the industry, and flow-on benefits to the economy. Unfortunately for current and prospective workers in our financial services sector, the coalition has abandoned Australia's strategy of becoming a major financial services hub. In a speech to the Financial Planning Association in March, the shadow minister for financial services, the Member for Cowper, declared that the government should be ‘taking the Johnson Report more seriously, because it contains some innovative measures to encourage international financial trading in Australia'. Just two months later, the coalition announced its opposition to the government's proposed reduction in interest withholding tax, which is consistent with a key recommendation from the Johnson report on Australia as a financial services centre. So dismayed were the Australian Bankers Association that bipartisan support for a sensible plan for growing Australia's financial services sector was being abandoned, they issued a press release declaring: The banking sector expects the Australian Government to take a strategic and coordinated approach towards further developing Australia as an international Financial Services Centre. These tax changes were a good first step in that tion, and that's why opposing the changes is short-sighted. It is disappointing that the coalition little to say about the future of the financial services industry that their May 2010 policy manifesto devoted more space to past policy announcements than their future plans for ensuring Australia becomes a more significant financial centre. For a long time, the previous government had a slogan of promoting Australia as a financial services centre, but they backed this up with little policy action. Unfortunately, recent events show they are still strong on rhetoric but very light on action. Centre for International Finance and Regulation But the government is committed to real action to promote Australia as a financial services centre even if the coalition is not. As part of the 2010 budget, I was also pleased to jointly announce with the Prime Minister a further measure which is consistent with these aims-the establishment of a Centre for International Finance and Regulation in Australia. The government will provide funding of up to $25 million for the centre over the next four years. As a regional centre for excellence in financial system regulation and innovation, the centre will provide tertiary education and training for financial regulators from Australia and the Asia-Pacific. It will also undertake research into innovation in the financial sector, and best practice financial regulation. One of the key themes underlying the work of the centre will be to address ways to foster financial sector innovation, while ensuring the risk inherent in the financial system is appropriately managed through best practice regulation. The centre's work will inform government, regulators and financial industry practitioners in Australia and the region. It will contribute to regional financial direcsystem stability by developing and supporting students, academics and researchers from the Asia-Pacific region and by building re has so gional capacity. The establishment of the Centre for International Finance and Regulation will complement the government's response to the Johnson report and will help to advance regional engagement. A university or consortium of universities will be selected by tender to host the centre. This selection is expected to take place by the end of this year. Policy reform The government is committed to promoting Australia as a financial services centre, not as a noble ideal but because of the many benefits it would bring to our nation. I am very pleased with the fact that each one of the Rudd government's three budgets has included measures to promote Australia as a financial services centre. Our first budget included cuts in the withholding tax for distributions from Australian managed funds to offshore investors-a significant reform, long called for by the financial services industry. As a result of gradual reductions in our withholding tax rate from 1 July this year, Australia will have one of the lowest rates in the world. Last year's budget included the abolition of the Foreign Investment Fund provisions, again a very significant reform that will make a contribution to Australian being a financial services centre. And of course this year's budget contained the measures I have already outlined. Superannuation and financial advice reforms The primary motivator of our superannuation policy is-and must always be-a comfortable retirement income for Australians. This has not, of course, meant that improved retirement incomes for Australians have been the only benefit of our superannuation system. The skills that Australia has built in terms of wealth management as a result of our superannuation system are, in my view, the single most important factor in our competitiveness as a financial services centre. And the sheer size of our retirement savings pool means that Australia is regarded as a serious player in the world's wealth management sector. Australia's superannuation pool was projected to grow to $5.3 trillion by 2035. The superannuation reforms we announced on 2 May will add another half a trillion dollars that amount. Growing our pool of funds under management can only have positive implications-very positive implications-for our ambition to be a significant financial centre. These reforms, together with the Future of Financial Advice reforms are vital to the development of Australia as a financial services centre. In relation to the reforms to financial planning, I would argue very simply that it would be impossible to ask those in other countries to place their trust and confidence in our financial planning industry if Australians do not. This point was made very clearly by the Johnson committee, which observed that the realisation of opportunities to attract overseas capital to Australia is ‘dependent on, amongst other things, the reputation and integrity of Australia's financial advisory sector being maintained and, where necessary, improved'. To this end, the report argued that resolving conflicts of interest in the financial planning industry is ‘consistent with ensuring that the reputation of Australia's financial sector, in particular funds management and financial planning, is maintained overseas, a prerequisite for greater international engagement'. Sadly, and almost inexplicably, this government's reforms to financial planning are being opposed by the opposition, as are our improvements to superannuation. Beneficiaries of the reforms Increased trade in financial services will increase Australia's growth prospects and standard of living. Through improved economies of scale, this would reduce the costs of financial products for Australian consumers and businesses. And by encouraging competition and efficiency, it would improve the range and choice of financial products available to consumers and promote increased exports of financial services. Posito tioning Australia as a financial services centre in the region would also mean that we would be able to increase job opportunities for a range of skilled workers in the financial sector. This is one area where the government sees so much scope for improvement. The opportunities for leveraging our financial services skills and expertise in the region and beyond are potentially enormous. With these decisions and reforms well advanced, I do not want anybody to be under the impression that we feel we have done all there is to dothat there is not more to be done. Reform to promote Australia as a financial services hub is an ever-receding finishing line. As we reform, so will other nations. And we will need to respond. Australia's advantages, along with this government's ongoing commitment to sensible reforms, will lay the foundation for the next wave of jobs and growth in the industry and for greater competition and choice for Australian consumers and businesses. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Cowper to speak for 15 minutes. Leave granted.",117
189,Mr BOWEN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I move: That so much of the standing and sessional ders be suspended as would prevent Mr Hartsuyker speaking in reply to the ministerial ment for a period not exceeding 15 minutes. Question agreed to.,122
190,Mr HARTSUYKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I welcome the opportunity to respond to the statement of the Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law relating to Australia as a financial services centre. The coalition welcomes this debate and we support responsible efforts to build Australia's standing as a global financial centre. However, we disagree with the government's broad approach on spending and taxation priorities and we are greatly concerned about how this approach is hurting Australia's standing as a financial centre here and now. It was the coalition which started the process of dedicating significant government resources to establishing Australia as a financial centre, with a particular focus on Asia. The current shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, had the honour of becoming Australia's first Minister for Financial Services and Regulation in 1998 and it was the member for North Sydney who launched the coalition's economic principles on 19 May-just two weeks ago. In that document the coalition detailed how we remain committed to boosting Australia's attractiveness as an international financial centre and expanding our exports of financial services. We welcomed the Johnson report and urged the government to respond to its recommendations, which the government has now done. The Johnson report states that its recommendations build on the work of the previous government, which made some significant regulatory and taxation reforms to expand Australia's standing as a financial centre. Firstly, as I have mentioned, the coalition appointed Australia's first minister for finanor- cial services in 1998, providing a dedicated advocate and voice for the financial services stateindustry in the Howard government ministry. Through disciplined fiscal management and commitment to placing the budget in surplus, the coalition in government was able to abolish a range of inefficient financial services taxes, including financial institutions duty and stamp duty on marketable securities and the interest withholding tax on Australian sourced interest paid to offshore investors. These reforms saved investors billions of dollars in taxes and compliance costs. The coalition also overhauled Australia's treatment of offshore banking units, an area discussed in the Johnson report. For the first time, fund managers, life insurance companies and custodians were given full tax treatment under the offshore banking units regime, whereas the previous arrangement only allowed banks and authorised foreign exchange dealers to benefit from the concessional 10 per cent tax rate. The coalition is proud to have launched the Centre for Global Financial Services, which was formerly named Axiss Australia, in June 2000. Axiss had a charter to enhance Australia's position as a provider of global financial services. In particular, it created the role of Australia's global financial services ambassador and used this position to highlight Australia's credentials as a centre for global financial services in the Asia-Pacific time zone. Of course, the current Australian Financial Centre Forum, responsible for the Johnson report, grew out of the coalition's efforts to implement a dedicated government body to expand Australia's standing as a financial services hub in the region. The coalition is proud of what we achieved in extending Australia as a financial services centre, and we are proud of our successes. Between 2003 and 2007, Australian investment in foreign stock grew from $998 billion to $1.724 trillion, an increase of 72 per cent. The number of people employed in the financial services industry increased by over 100,000 workers between November 2000 and November 2007 to over 410,000 employees. This growth has gone backwards under the Rudd government, with employment falling by about 10,000 workers to June 2009. Overseas investors and institutions had faith in the coalition's ability to provide a stable and progressive investment environment. The coalition has this ability to provide this environment, because we believe in four foundations for expanding Australia's position as an attractive investment base, which I will outline. Firstly, the coalition believes the quality of Australia's financial markets. Australia possesses transparent and liquid financial markets which encourage investment from abroad. Secondly, the coalition believes in the governance structures we implemented in the Wallis reforms to provide stability and resilience against global turmoil. These reforms by the coalition made us the envy of the developed world in the area of financial services. This government is ruining our position-and I will get to that shortly. Thirdly, our personnel are a huge advantage for Australia's financial services industry. We have the population, the language skill and a high level of education-all attractive to global market operators. Finally, Australia has the infrastructure-modern communications and IT systems, as well as legal and accounting systems-to provide efficient market services. These foundations are why the coalition believes Australia is well placed to expand its financial services industry on a global scale. The Johnson report was only made possible because of the coalition's reforms to financial services. And, as I have said previously, the coalition is broadly supportive of those parts of the government's response to the Johnson report which have not been linked to Labor's great big new tax on mining. I think the government and the minister need to ask themselves why the coalition in government could achieve responsible measures to expand Australia's financial services industry. The answer goes toward the different approaches of the current Labor government and the coalition. The coalition is committed to building Australia's attractiveness as an international financial centre. We can achieve this responsibly because, unlike the Rudd government, we are committed to budget surpluses and spending restraint. Now let us look at the government approach. The Rudd Labor government inherited a $20 in billion surplus from the coalition and no net debt-and it blew it all. Within less than two years, we had spending on overpriced school halls and pink batts. We spent money putting pink batts in and we spent money taking pink batts out. The government is out there borrowing $100 million a day to continue buying fraudulently derived school building projects and to pay for blowouts in poorly managed programs. They are out there competing in the debt markets with small business and financial institutions, pushing up inflation and pushing up interest rates. Today I had the pleasure to attend a presstroying entation from the Tottenham Primary School in front of Parliament House. I saw the minister could not be bothered turning up. She would not show her face. We saw a presentation from Tottenham Primary School and we saw a replica of a canteen which cost the taxpayers $600,000, which should have been built for less than 10 per cent of the cost. There are many more examples of overpriced school halls in my own electorate of Cowper, which I have detailed on previous occasions. This incredible waste and mismanagement is why businesses are crowded out of debt markets and why the cost-ofliving pressures are increasing as interest rates and inflationary pressures. But the minister who presided over the spectacular failures of GroceryWatch and Fuelwatch knows all about waste and mismanagement. And that is the key to this issue. The government has wasted so much taxpayer money that it needs to find extra taxes to fund its policy agenda. The Rudd Labor government does not have the courage or the commitment to make the tough decisions and get the budget back into surplus, it taxes and taxes and taxes and promises and promises to cover the cost of its waste. So whilst the coalition support some of what the government is trying to achieve with regard to financial services, we certainly oppose their approach. We oppose their unfair new taxes. In particular, we oppose taxes which threaten Australia's standing as an international investment option. We oppose new taxes which are going to increase the sovereign risk of this nation. How can this minister and this Labor government be serious about relieving the tax burdens on financial services when they are massively increasing taxes on the biggest industry that those financial services rely on? Labor's great big new tax on mining is actively deAustralia's reputation as a strong and stable country in which to invest. The $90 billion, approximately, that has been lost in share value since this tax was first mooted is an indication of the very low confidence that global financial institutions now have in this government. Why would international investors have continued confidence in the future of Australia as an investment centre, when our biggest investors are claiming this government has now dramatically increased the sovereign risk profile of Australia? Here is what CEO of Rio Tinto, Mr Tom Albanese, said on Lateline on Wednesday: It's as if they'rea result of that is, the governmentcoming to us saying we want to be your 40 per cent partner, ignore the fact you've taken all the risks, ignore the fact you've taken all the lumps we want 40 per cent of your pre-tax profits. That's sovereign risk and that's why … it's the number one priority on my plate, globally, around sovereign risks. Now, the government like to claim that comments such as these are just talking down Australian investments. But it is the so Prime Minister who wanted a fight on the tax and the government who are eliciting these comments. It was Prime Minister Rudd and the gang of four who wanted a fight with the mining companies because they thought the tax would be popular. And it is the government-not the miners, not the oppositionwho are damaging Australia's reputation as an investment destination. Let us consider what those investors actually operating in international markets think about the government's approach to taxation and economic reform. International law firm Freehills is issuing the following advice with relation to its international investors: - Project proponents benchmark their developments by a variety of factors including sovereign risk and internal rate of return. evitably Australian projects will be re-ranked as a result of the imposition of RSPT. Citigroup analyst Paul Brennan says that his discussions with investors in Singapore and Britain make it clear that there was considered to be greater political risk in investing in the Australian market. The Commonwealth Bank research provided to investors says: … increased sovereign risk is an issue not just for the resource sector but for the entire private sector in Australia. PricewaterhouseCoopers says that there is a risk the government's new mining tax will see investment dollars flow to resource rich countries such as Africa, South America and Canada. No wonder the Canadian government are actively advertising their resource sector in contrast to Australia, telling investors that Prime Minister Rudd's tax gives Canada a competitive advantage. The Johnson report states: Our well educated and mobile workforce, along with our political stability … have encouraged some multinational financial services companies to set up businesses in Australia. Well, what has the government done to Australia's political stability? It is telling the world not to invest here because the government will tax investments in one of our best performing industries at the highest effective tax rate in the world. That is one way to foster international investment! That is one way to attract international capital! This was confirmed yesterday by KPMG, which released a report and said that the government had caused a ‘lack of certainty in the debt market' and that this means miners ‘will not be able to price in meaningful reductions in the cost of debt, and access to debt will be challenging.' So international financial institutions will find it challenging to invest in Australia's resource sector, and surely this will In- flow to every sector. But the government are happy to mislead the public and distort the facts on the impact of that great big new tax on mining on Australia's financial services sector. The Labor government was happy to mislead the sector by providing statistics, from a student paper from good old North Carolina, that the mining industry was only paying 17 per cent taxMrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting",122
191,Mr HARTSUYKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Even though it didn't include profits, it did include a couple of Australian companies, but it mixed in New Zealand as well, just for a bit of added confusion. The statistics from the KPMG report prove that this government have been misleading the public and prove that they simply cannot be trusted to follow through on their proposals in response to the Johnson report. The KPMG report shows that the effective tax rate on iron ore producers is currently 43.6 per cent, for coal it is 41.1 per cent and for nickel it is 34.3 per cent. Yet we have the Treasurer running around with his pie charts, of uncertain accuracy. This government are working on destroying industry and destroying mining, which will effectively have tax rates of up around 55 per cent. How could this possibly help Australia's standing as a financial services centre? How could this possibly help our standing as an international destination for investment capital? The KPMG report figures are not figures taken out of some sort of student's report from North Carolina. These are figures from a very reputable Australian organisation that knows Australia-not a report that revolves around four companies and is focused not only on Australia but on Australia and New Zealand. It seems absolutely outrageous that this minister can come here and claim credentials in relation to making Australia a centre for international financial services. It seems absolutely incredible coming from a government that is deterring international capital, that is driving away investment opportunities, that is working on reducing the level of employment and investment in the mining sector-a vitally important sector, the sector that got us through the recession, as opposed to the government's claim that some overpriced school halls got us through the recession. This is an absolute outrage. It is an embarrassment to the government that the minister would attempt to parade his credentials in relation to a quality-of-investment destination, when the government is working exactly to the reverse effect. NA Primary Schools for the 21st Century Program",125
192,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker has received letters from the honourable member for Kennedy and the honourable member for Sturt proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by standing order 46(d) Mr Speaker has selected the matter which, in his opinion, is the most urgent and important; that is, that proposed by the honourable member for member for Sturt, namely: The urgent need for the government to effectively manage the Primary Schools for the 21st Century Programme. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places hall stimulus program, otherwise known as the Julia Gillard Memorial School Halls Program, or the school halls rip-off program, is a tale of rorting, rip-offs, duckshoving, substitution by state governments, blow-outs, overinflated costings, deception, disappointment and the misleading of parliament and of the people. But, ultimately, it is a failure of responsibility by the minister to do her job. There is no untruth that the minister will not tell to avoid taking responsibility for her failure. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-The queen of failure!  lar has said, she is the queen of waste and the queen of deception. Let us take the $1.7 billion blow-out in the school hall stimulus program as the first example. The minister tried to blame the department of finance for making a mess of the costings. She misled the parliament and the people on 10 September and 6 May when she said, on 10 September, that more money was ‘going into this program because it is going gangbusters, because more schools want to be in this program'. She said: Our Finance Department produced a costing of 90 per cent, assuming that the uptake by schools would be 90 per cent. But the truth, of course, was put on full display in the Auditor-General's report a few weeks ago, when the Auditor-General reported: Ultimately, the need for the additional funding provided by the Government in August 2009 arose from most schools having sought the maximum payments available. It did not flow from any deficiencies identified in the procurement processes or other activities of Education Authorities in delivering the program But, more importantly-and this is the key quote: … nor was it the result of more schools seeking to participate than had originally been forecast. So the Minister for Education in September last year said: More money is going into this program because it is going gangbusters, because more schools want to be in this program. But, in fact the Auditor-General put the lie to that statement to this parliament by specifically reporting that there was no truth to the suggestion that there was a $1.7 billion blow-out because of more schools taking up the program. But instead of taking responsibility for her failure, for her inbuilt blow-out, which she knew from the beginning was going to be a blow-out of $1.7 billion in magnitude, she attempted to blame the department of finance-because this minister can never be wrong. She always has to duckshove responsibility to someone else-it's the principals' fault, or it's the P&C's fault, or it's the state government's fault, or it's the department of finance's fault. No wonder the minister for finance briefed Glenn Milne's column of last Monday, outlining in stark relief for everyone to see how it was the Minister for Education's fault and her mistake and that she had misled parliament. I can tell the House that for certain, because I know that Glenn Milne did not even contact me about that column-he only needed to speak to Lindsay Tanner, the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, to get all the information he needed to be able to lay it out for all to see that this minister was more than prepared to mislead the parliament rather than take responsibility herself for her failure. Let us take a look at the evidence that has stacked up against this government's claims about the school halls stimulus rip-off. Tottenham Central School, in the member for Parkes' electorate, just today came to Canberra because they are so angry and so outraged that their cubbyhouse canteen cost $600,000-that much for a canteen that they cannot even fit a fridge into, a pie warmer into or an oven into; a canteen that has not even got a preparation area. That is according to Rick Bennett, the P&C chairman, who attended the rally-as did the member for Cowper, who is quite rightly also outraged by the waste and mismanagement. They have not even got a preparation area in their cubbyhouse canteen; they have to use the counter to prepare the sandwiches for the kids at their school because they have wasted $600,000 on a canteen that is not up to being used for the purpose that it was built for. What really makes the parents, friends and principals in government schools angry is that they know that if they went down the road to the local Catholic school or the local independent school-the non-government schools-where the program was essentially run in the same way as the previous government's Investing in Our Schools Program, they would find that those schools did get value for money. However, the government sector has been ripped off blind, and the person who is supposed to be standing up for them-the minister, who is sitting at the dispatch box-has done nothing except duckshove, avoid responsibility and accuse either the Australian or the opposition of making up or fabricating examples of waste and mismanagement. They know that what this minister has really done, ironically, is preside over a widening of the gap between the nongovernment and the government sectors in terms of infrastructure and facilities. The government sector is rightly furious, because when parents send their children to government schools they believe that their infrastructure is not as good as the nongovernment sector. They hoped that, when the government announced that it was going to spend $16.2 billion of taxpayer money on new infrastructure, they might get value for money and they might get better resources, but what they really got were cubbyhouse canteens. Down the road at the Holy Trinity School in New South Wales they used $800,000 and they got a canteen with cold rooms, many counters, necessary fridges, pie warmers and heaters-everything you could possibly need in a canteen-for one tenth of the cost that they achieved in government schools. The issue of the Quaama Public School was raised today by the member for Gilmore. That school has spent $800,000 on walkways and breezeways for their local school but there are homes in the electorate of Eden Monaro where, for $480,000, you can get a full family home. As the member for Gilmore pointed out, that is half the cost of rip-off that occurred in Quaama Public School. No wonder the Vice-President of the P&C, Debbie Platts, has said that the waste that has occurred under this scheme is mindblowing. All the minister needs to do is get out of her ivory tower and go and speak to the angry parents and friends. She should go and speak to principals like Henry Grossek and the principal and P&C chairman at the Hastings Public School, or go to Berriedale, where I have been with the Leader of the Opposition, to find out what the people really think about the rip-off that is part of the school hall program. The Hastings Public School has become emblematic, because in 2003 they managed to build a covered outdoor learning area for $78,000. In June last year, they were told a covered outdoor learning area which is slightly bigger would cost $400,000. By December it was going to cost $954,000. The New South Wales department of education's audit office found that there was nothing untoward about this contract. Sure, it was taken off the drawing board because of the campaigns by the opposition and the parents and friends, but if it wasn't for that campaign, $954,000 would have been spent building a covered out-door learning area which experts say should not have cost any more than about $200,000. And we do not need to rely just on parents, friends and principals; the Rawlinsons construction handbook points out that a public school-a government school or nongovernment school-building should cost about $1,350 per square metre, and yet this government is costing the same buildings out for $4,500 per square metre. And that is not even comparing canteens; that is just comparing general buildings. We know that the minister keeps insisting that fees cannot be charged at more than four per cent by state governments and contracthe tors, yet time and again stories have appeared in the media-particularly in New South Wales, which has released the data, unlike the other states-where some contractors like the Reed construction group are charging 20.96 per cent of the contracted price in management fees and site fees on every single site. Even when the same building has been built in dozens of places across New South Wales for upwards of seven years they are charging the same fee for drawings, architects plans and site management at every single site. They are ripping the taxpayers off blind. We have seen state substitution at Yankalilla Area School in South Australia, Stirling East Primary School, Basket Range Primary School and Macclesfield Primary School. The schools are being told to use their BER money to build water tanks for their schools although that is the responsibility of the government. The state government is shifting those responsibilities to the federal taxpayer. There is still billions to spend on the school hall rip-off program-$5½ billionand yet the minister is committing that $5½ billion before her handpicked taskforce has handed down its recommendations in August. If we needed any more evidence that the Orgill taskforce is simply windowdressing, and another opportunity for the minister to duckshove responsibility to someone else, then this is it. The taskforce is reporting in August. The minister is rushing the money out before the taskforce reports, making a mockery of her claims that she is in the least bit interested in how to make sure that taxpayers get value for money. Brad Orgill has already admitted, on the Ray Hadley program today, that he cannot access the costs for every contract unless there is a complaint made about a school. On this side of the House, we expected that when the task force was established-instead of our, preferred judicial inquiry-Brad Orgill would be given all the costings in all the schools for all the contractsOpposition members-He should have!  colleagues say, so that he could examine every contract and work out for taxpayers whether they were getting value for money. As members said during question time, what is the point of a complaint being made about a COLA or about a canteen being built after the bricks and mortar-or, in more cases, the prefabricated buildings-are in place and the money has already been spent. What is the point of Brad Orgill investigating money that has already been wasted. We expected, and this minister needs to explain, how it is that task force that should be recommending improvements has not got access to every contract in every school before a complaint is state made. This is no way, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, to run a country. Here is a minister who thinks that she can giggle and toss her hair on Channel 9 on a Friday morning into the Prime Minister's job, supplanting Kevin Rudd, having only ever delivered in her portfolio abject failure and expensive underperforming programs. There is no better example than the school hall rip-off program, where only recently in estimates the Auditor-General was able to say that it was not possible for the government to claim that they had achieved value for money. He answered Senator Mason's questions by saying that he was correct when he said that there was no way the government could guarantee it had achieved value for money. Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, being Prime Minister takes a lot more than having a cosy relationship with the press gallery. It takes hard work, it takes having runs on the board, and if the government believes that its answer to the sinking approval ratings of the Prime Minister is to replace him with the Deputy Prime Minister what it will find is that the public will soon discover that all this minister has done is deliver failure and duck shoving. The school hall program was supposed to make the Deputy Prime Minister look good, but it will hang around her neck like a rotten carcass, leaving nothing but the stench of failure behind her.",126
193,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Sturt, particularly in his role as Manager of Opposition Business, should be aware that the correct way to address the chair, when there are occupants other than the Speaker, is Mr Deputy Speaker. There is not a position of acting Deputy Speaker. There is, from time to time, a an Acting Speaker. You might just like to adopt the proper forms of the House in future. I did not interrupt him when he was speaking, but he would be well to remember that. I call the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education.",129
194,Ms GILLARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (4.55 pm)-Thank you very much,",130
195,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I hope I have done that right! I rise in this matter of public importance debate to introduce something we have not heard so far-and that is the facts. First and foremost, let us just reflect on why we are here today with this matter of public importance, in which the member for Sturt has not even shown the basic courtesy to sit and listen to the reply. That is because he does not want to know the facts. That would puncture his argument-what he says publicly every day. He prefers to pretend, prefers to go by, the watch word of this opposition, which is being phoney. We are here today because the member for Sturt's ego has been stirred. On the day that the Auditor-General's report was delivered into the public demain, the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Sturt went out for a press conference and they promised a forensic examination of me over Building the Education Revolution. They were full of huff and puff and vim and vigour. Oh dear, dear, it was such a scandal! Oh, they were so upset! Then we came to the parliament. Budget week came and went. Last week came and went. Monday came and went. Tuesday came and went. Anyway, we are finally here trying to save the member for Sturt's face, to make it look like he is playing some role in the coalition-although we know that the discontent on the coalition's backbench at his inept parliamentary tactics is the subject of regular discussion in the corridors. So we are here trying to save the member for Sturt's face. After promising this hard-hitting attack, here we are with an MPI. I believe he asked me one question today, and that is it. Anyway, this MPI is about effective management of the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program. So let us talk about the question of effective management, which I believe the member for Sturt at no pointamidst a spray of personal abuse-managed to get his way to in any real sense. Fact 1: if you are going to effectively manage a program, you have to support it and you have to believe in it. Of course, the opposition do not support this program and they do not believe in it. You do not need to take my word for that; just dial up Hansard where all of their votes against this program are recorded. Every member of the coalition voted against every dollar to every school. So you cannot effectively manage a program you do not believe in. And then, of course, to effectively manage a program you have to be committed to its continuation, and the opposition are not committed to its continuation. The member for Sturt, the Manager of Opposition Business, took a personal explanation after question time today and he claimed to have been misrepresented when this side of the chamber indicated that the opposition was threatening the Building the Education Revolution. I understand that there are substantial political and factional differences between the member for Sturt and the Leader of the Opposition, but the position of the coalition going into the election is defined by the Leader of the Opposition. Let me record for Hansard so no Australian is under any misrepresentation the threat that a coalition government elected under the current Leader of the Oppositionthe fourth Leader of the Opposition in far less years-would mean to Building the Education Revolution. These are the words of the Leader of the Opposition. This is the policy of the coalition going into the election. The Leader of the Opposition was on AM on 14 May. He was being interviewed about Building the Education Revolution. After a series of questions, the journalist asked him: But the pot of money will be the same, the pot of money in Building the Education Revolution? The Leader of the Opposition answered: Well, look, um, ah, I'm not going to give you that absolute commitment. There we go-case closed. The money for Building the Education Revolution is under threat from an opposition led by the current opposition leader-that is the fact. Fact three is that in order to effectively manage a program you have to understand what the outcomes being sought for the program are. A key outcome of the Building the Education Revolution is supporting jobs, and day after day, because of their complete inability to understand the macro economy, to absorb the nature of the global financial crisis, to understand what it was going to mean and continues to mean for this country, the opposition cannot seem to understand that Building the Education Revolution has as a key outcome supporting jobs-and it is supporting jobs. There was a very important set of economic statistics released earlier today, and they were the national accounts. They are telling us about growth in the economy, telling us about the growth that sustains jobs. It is abundantly clear from the national accounts that private non-residential building investment fell in the quarter and remains at a depressed level, and, without the substantial ongoing support provided by the Building the Education Revolution program, activity and employment in this sector would have been lower. So a key outcome of this program is supporting jobs. The opposition say to suspend it; the opposition want to cut it. They need to understand, and acknowledge in doing that, that they would be chucking people out of work, with everything that means for their families-the ability to put food on the table, the ability to keep a roof over your head because you can pay the mortgage. We know the Leader of the Opposition would prefer our economy was like New Zealand's; we know he would prefer a deep recession; we know he is unconcerned about the prospect of people being out of work. Well, the government is not. Building the Education Revolution is so important to supporting jobs. Day after day-we heard it from the member for Sturt today-in order to mischaracterise Building the Education Revolution they dismissively come in here and refer to Julia Gillard memorial halls and that kind of thing. It is political spin; we expect no substance from the opposition. We expect them to be all talk, with no real political action, and that is what we hear day after day. They come in with this phoney political packaging to try to make people believe somehow that what is happening in schools under this program is somehow inconsequential. Let us listen to the words of educators, of people who care, of people who knownot those sitting opposite but people who actually understand schools. Geoff Pelling, from Cooran State School, says: We identified what the school needed and we look forward to sharing the facilities with the wider community … … … … I think we got an excellent result. It's given us a 21st century approach to education to use with traditional learning. At the Cowra South Public School, the principal has said: Two years on we are now looking at a modern, permanent library for our students. You never hear the opposition talk about libraries. Libraries-better for learning. He goes on: The students all agree the new library looks fantastic and makes our school stand out. Students look forward to their library lessons each week because it is a comfortable, refreshing place to back, relax and read. What about Principal Jane Warren-I have met her myself-at Bellaire, a state school in Geelong. She is an award winning principal. The multipurpose, flexible learning space that has been constructed in that school has transformed the way they are able to teach; they can now teach the way this award winning principal wants to teach. What about East Marden Primary School in the electorate of the member for Sturt? I have been there; I have seen their Building the Education Revolution project, and let me tell you they were delighted by the result. In order to effectively manage a program, you need to understand it-and clearly, from their dismissive rhetoric and their inability to understand anything about jobs, the opposition, each and every day, shows that they are disrespectful towards this investment in schools. Let us look at another fact. In order to effectively manage a program you need to understand the kind of oversight it has been under. Today the member for Sturt is calling for a judicial inquiry; he has been out in the media saying we need a judicial inquiry and that it is very important. Around a year and a bit ago, he was out calling for an Auditor General's inquiry-it was absolutely vital; it would sort the whole thing out. And the Auditor-General did inquire. And we have received his report. I know what the member for Sturt wanted from the Auditor-General's report-he wanted something that looked like the kind of report the former government got into regional rorts. That is what he was hoping for-he was hoping for a report as bad as that. Let us remind ourselves of it20 recommendations made by the Auditor General, and the Auditor-General said about regional rorts: The manner in which the program has been adsit ministered over the three-year period to 30 June 2006 examined by the ANAO had fallen short of an acceptable standard of public administration. That was a program of the Howard government. The member for Sturt, all pumped up, wanted an audit report just like that one. Of course, he did not get it. What he got was an audit report in which there are no recommendations made; an audit report in which the Auditor concludes in respect of the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program: There are some positive early indicators that the program is making progress towards achieving its intended outcomes. This is an audit report that included surveying school principals and it records the finding: … more than 95 per cent of school principals saw the program as providing ongoing value to their school and their school community. So, having received that audit report from the independent watchdog, now the member for Sturt wants a judicial inquiry. If he got a judicial inquiry I do not know what he would then want. Presumably he would want an International Criminal Court of Justice action. He is just forum shopping because the answer he has got from the independent watchdog is not the answer he wanted. The member for Sturt should think about the Auditor-General's report and the findings of that audit report. Then he is on about ‘90 per cent' and me supposedly misleading the parliament. If he genuinely thought that, wouldn'the have moved a substantive motion ages ago, sometime near when he started to make the public claims that I was going to be under forensic examination in relation to this matter? But of course all of this nonsense about ‘90 per cent' has been fully dealt with in Senate estimates and I would refer people to the transcript of the secretary of finance, David Tune, on 26 May 2010. So once again we have another phoney claim from the member for Sturt as he runs around. Then there were claims made during the member for Sturt's address, and a claim made before that during a ministerial statement on financial services-go figure!-that somehow I was unconcerned about the circumstances of the Tottenham Central School. I am not. That is why I have spoken to the principal today. That is why I have made arrangements to speak with the head of the P&C of that school. I understand that that school community is unhappy with their Building the Education Revolution project and I will be more than happy to talk to them about it. As has been a matter of public record for a number of weeks, reported in that great journal of record, the Daily Liberal, Building the Education Revolution Implementation Taskforce is seized of this matter and Mr Brad Orgill, or a member of the task force on his behalf, will be visiting the school in the next few weeks. But I am concerned to speak to people associated with the Tottenham school. Indeed I have already spoken to the principal. I want to get value for money and they want to get value for money. On the question of value for money, obviously what we have done is create the Building the Education Revolution Implementation Taskforce. The member for Sturt today criticised me-I get that-but impliedly criticising Mr Orgill is disgraceful. This is a isn't it? leading Australian businessman leading this task force, which of course can get the documents it needs and is focused on value for money. It was a completely disgraceful attack. All of this is about covering up the cutbacks that they want to make to education: ripping out trades training centres-so no more-including ones promised to schools, with no more computers in schools, including those for kids who are waiting for them, no more teacher-quality money-that will end programs like Teach for Australia, getting the best graduates into the schools that need them the most-and no more productivity places, so jobseekers cannot get an opportunity to get a training place and get a job. We on this side of the House stand for better schools and a better education system. The coalition stands for neglect and ripping money out of schools. (Time expired)",130
196,Mr JOHN COBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Calare) (5.10 pm)The Deputy Prime Minister forgot to mention quite a few things. One which stands out is: why did the Catholic schools and other non-government schools in New South Wales get value for money while no other school in New South Wales did? The reason is they managed it themselves and the New the South Wales government and the federal government were not running it. The New South Wales government did not get the opportunity to rip it off. To my amazement I just heard the Deputy Prime Minister say she was happy to talk to Tottenham. Well, Tottenham invited her to come out this morning and talk to them. They even built out on our front lawn a replica of their $600,000 canteen, a canteen that, at about eight metres by three metres, cost $26½ thousand per square metre, with no amenities inside it. A local builder quoted it at $80,000 but it cost the taxpayer $600,000. I notice, Deputy Prime Minister, that you do not want to stay to listen to this. It is getting a bit rugged for you, I think it is quite incredible that, earlier, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Education, could stand there and tell us what great value the Australian taxpayer got, particularly in New South Wales, when the taxpayer was totally ripped off. In recent months the Australian public have become used to hearing about money being wasted by the Labor government. Pick up any newspaper and you see the pages are lined with literally billions of dollars worth of mismanagement, budget blow-outs and waste. There really are not very many stories as good as the BER program. Week in and week out in the Central Western Daily in Orange, and not from the Daily Liberal, there are stories about the Australian public not getting value for money. Let me start this speech by saying that my colleagues and I are completely behind education, public or otherwise. However, we are behind sensible, well-planned and wellmanaged investments-totally unlike what we are seeing out of this program with the public school system. This morning on the lawns of Parliament House we saw the construction of a replica canteen based on the one being built at the Tottenham public school. At eight metres by three metres it is not big enough for a drinks fridge, a meat slicer, a pie warmer or a freezer but it is still costing the Australian taxpayer $600,000. It was no accident that the taxpayers association was down there with the parents of the Tottenham school. If the Deputy Prime Minister did ring up the headmaster of Tottenham, I dare say he would have got muscled like all of the headmasters, headmistresses and principals in my region have been. I have been called by them. They are not game to say who they are as their jobs are at risk. I feel very sorry for them. They are embarrassed. They are angry, as angry as the parents. But what can they do? Their jobs are on the line, especially those at schools of under 50 people which were guaranteed $250,000 buildings or whatever. I have had them ring me and say, ‘If we get 100 grand out of this we'll be doing well.' At one stage they were being charged about $30,000 for plans that were drawn up in 2003, plans that were six or seven years old. I think this is almost worse than the pink batts scheme. You must wonder if the Deputy Prime Minister did not say to the Premier of New South Wales: ‘We know you are doing it pretty tough. We can't just hand you over money. Have a go and see what you can get out of the BER scheme.' But let me take you on a BER tour of my electorate, always remembering that the one I just mentioned, Tottenham School, were so angry that they drove for five hours to get here to present their case to a Deputy Prime Minister who refused to face them. So she should not stand here talking about how she will talk to them. She had her opportunity today. There was $19,000 on the breakdown of the costings of Tottenham School-$19,000 for a demolition and there was no demolition of anything done. But what does that matter? The Deputy Prime Minister says this is a great program. It is a great program if you have a construction company on the coast and you transport the workers in, because they certainly are not giving any money to anyone locally unless it is a non-government school where they do get the locals to do it. As I said, a local would have built this canteen for $80,000, not $600,000. In the east at Mount Victoria, where the school was allocated $850,000, the original plan was to build a hard court cover and large brick classroom-reasonable goals without much money on offer. What they received is a Colorbond classroom, and even that is struggling to stay under the $850,000 mark. Cooerwull Public School, where their brand new hall described by a local councillor as a ‘giant boatshed', cost the taxpayers $2½ million and only one local contractor got a cent out of it. In the middle of Calare, at the Claregate School, $250,000 of taxpayer funds paid for another modular design building that included $60,000 worth of design. I wonder whether that was also a plan they pulled out from 2003. Mullion Creek School received what was described by a P&C member as a ‘lined tin shed' and this was just transported there. The original $250,000 price tag blew out by $24,000. Spring Hill's modular classroom arrived with cracks in the wall and a sagging veranda and, despite all that, it was still over budget. rowanbang Public School would be comical if it did not represent a huge waste of taxpayer funds. The school, which currently has 22 enrolled students, received a modular classroom. The problem is that there are two buildings in the school and the modular building cannot hold any more students as it houses the computers as well. Under the department's guidelines, the school will not qualify for a second teacher until it gets at least four more students. So they can either opt to cram in any new students into the room or use the other classroom, which would leave the students unsupervised. Nashdale Public School is one of the great examples of the Deputy Prime Minister's BER scheme. When the school community received a quote from Bathurst based builder Bruce Hackett, it seemed this money would really provide the revolution that was promised-a library, staffroom, principal's office, sick bay, interview room and toilets at a quote of $740,000. When the school could not raise the required deposit to selfmanage-they don't like them self-managing these things-they were forced to go with the Labor government's option. They got a modular double classroom, no toilets, no disabled access, no air conditioning, no staffroom or entry. The cost blew out by another $150,000 over what would have been a totally new school from the local builder to $907,000. Why were they so against locals managing their own thing? We would have got the kind of value the Catholic and the other nongovernment schools got. Do you think there are not any businesspeople on the P&Cs of these schools? They told the headmasters, ‘If you want to self-manage, you have to be personally responsible for the insurance.' What headmaster could go ahead with that? It was designed to stop them doing it, having to go with the New South Wales education deErpartment, which brings us to this rubbish. This is just a quick selection of the schools in my part of the world that have been let down by the Deputy Prime Minister's BER spendathon, and there are more. I know blokes who got $2,000 a day to go and just erect some of these sheds that have been built on the coast and elsewhere instead of being built locally, simply because they were told they had to be done by a certain date‘Don't worry what it costs, we will foot the bill.' There are principals and P&C groups who are too scared to talk about this because they worry about the consequences for their principal, their teachers and their chances of future funding, because there is one thing this government is-it is vengeful. We have seen many cases before where after the Deputy Prime Minister makes a phone call all signs of resistance fade into the nether. The Deputy Prime Minister continues to spruik schools that are happy to receive the funding and happy with what they are getting, but it does not change the fact that the Australian taxpayer has been cheated. It was no coincidence that the Australian Taxpayers Association were here with Tottenham School today, because they are so incensed about the wastage. (Time expired)",133
197,Mr CLARE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This matter of public importance debate is about three things: jobs, infrastructure and value for money. And one more thing: what would happen if the opposition was elected later this year? First to jobs. Tomorrow is 3 June. On 3 June last year we found out that Australia did not go into recession. We did not go into recession because of the stimulus. That is what Treasury says. Treasury's advice is that the Australian economy grew by 1.4 per cent last year. Its modelling shows that, without the stimulus, the economy would have shrunk by 0.7 per cent last year. In other words, the Australian economy would have gone into recession. What is the retort from the other side? What is the retort from the Leader of the Opposition? The stimulus was not necessary. What this data shows is that if it was not for the stimulus Australia, like other economies, would have gone into recession and we would have lost over 200,000 jobs, thousands of them in the construction industry, which is at the moment working to build classrooms, libraries and halls in our primary schools. I was talking last year to a builder from Sacred Heart Primary School in Cabramatta, which is in my electorate. They told me that earlier last year they were planning to lay 50 workers off. Instead, because of the BER, they put 100 workers on, including two blokes who had been unemployed for 12 months. I have heard the same story all around the country. According to the Master Builders Association, the stimulus is protecting 50,000 jobs in the building industry that would otherwise have been lost, but the Liberals in question time today called for a suspension to these projects, which inevitably means job losses. However, it is not just jobs in the construction sector that the BER is protecting, because for every construction job in the BER program there are other jobs that are also being protected in other parts of the economy. The Australian newspaper reported the effects of this on the same school-Sacred Heart Primary School-in my electorate in September last year. The article tells the story of those builders: It's not only Mr Zuma and his menthey are the builderswho benefit from the weekly wage; the crew buy their morning coffee from the Gloria Jeans up on John Street, the main drag in Cabramatta, buy their lunch every day at the milk bar around the corner, shop for basic groceries at the Cabramatta Woolworths, buy their paper from the local newsagent and their breakfast muffins from the MCDonald's. That may not be the best breakfast in the world, or the perfect diet, but jobs are being protected. And it is not just that service industry that benefits, because the construction industry spends more than $2 billion every year on steel. They spend a lot more on IT and even more than that on accounting and legal services. This is what is called the multiplier effect-making sure that the benefits are felt all across the economy. I was in Ballarat last month, and I was told by the local council that the BER was keeping local steelmakers and cabinet makers afloat. They have lost about 1,000 jobs in manufacturing in Ballarat over the last year, and they told me that they would have lost a lot more without the construction work that we are doing in schools. Cairns has one of the highest levels of unemployment in the country, but, in the Cairns Post of 11 May 2010-a couple of weeks ago- Mr Ron Bannah, the Master Builders Association's Far North Queensland regional manager, said: It's been the survival of the industry, particularly in Far North Queensland, and it will continue to be in coming months. There is a reason for that: the BER program accounts for about a third of the total non-residential building approvals in the year to March 2010. The next point is about infrastructure. We are building infrastructure that a lot of schools have waited decades for. Bass Hill Public School in my electorate has been waiting for a school hall for 80 years. In 12 years, the Howard government directly invested $4 million in schools in my electorate; in two years, this government has directly injected $114 million. Carramar Public School in my electorate has been waiting for a library for almost 90 years. Under the previous government, they got a flagpole; under this government, they get a library. But that is just one school. Let's look all around the country. Under the Howard government, 3,000 schools got flagpoles; under this government 3,000 schools get libraries. Let's have a look at a few electorates. La Trobe got 39 flagpoles, but they are getting 26 libraries under us. Bowman got 11 flagpoles, but they are getting 19 libraries under us. The electorate of MCEwen got 50 flagpoles, but they are getting 19 libraries under us. Stirling only got four flagpoles, but they get 16 libraries under us. Patterson got 18 flagpoles, but they get 13 libraries under us. In the former education minister Ms Julie Bishop's electorate of Curtin they got 10 flagpoles, but they are getting 16 libraries under us. In Deputy Speaker Bevis's electorate of Brisbane they got 14 flagpoles under the Howard government, but they get 19 libraries under us. In the electorate of Calare they got 31 flagpoles, but they get 33 libraries under the Rudd Labor government. In the electorate of Bradfield they got 14 flagpoles, but they get 14 libraries under us. In the electorate of Berowra, they got 11 flagpoles under the Howard government, but they get nine libraries under the Rudd government. There is the record: flagpoles under the Liberal Party, libraries under the Labor Party. None of this means that the program is perfect-no program is-and where there are problems it is important that they are identified and fixed. That is why we have set up an independent task force. But let's get to the next point. There are 3,000 schools where projects have not started yet, and, if you listen to the words of the Leader of the Opposition, there is a good chance that those 3,000 schools will not get libraries and classrooms if the Liberal Party is elected next year. In the electorate of Bowman they could miss out on eight libraries and 11 halls, and one school could miss out on classrooms. In the electorate of MCEwen they could miss out on seven libraries and eight halls, and 34 schools could miss out on classrooms. In the electorate of Paterson they could miss out on two libraries and three halls, and seven schools could miss out on classrooms. In the electorate of La Trobe they could miss out on 11 libraries and two halls, and seven schools could miss out on classrooms. In the electorate of Cowper they could miss out on six libraries and four halls, and 13 schools could miss out on classrooms. In the electorate of Cowan they could miss out on two libraries and one hall, and 15 schools could miss out on classrooms. In the electorate of Calare, they could miss out on five libraries, 12 halls and 13 classrooms. Mr John Cobb-Let them build their own.",135
198,Mr CLARE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Let them build their own! That is the response from the opposition. A government member-Let them eat cake!,137
199,Mr CLARE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Let them eat cake! That is the Liberal Party's view. They can all get stuffed as far as you are concerned. That is not the Labor Party's view. That is not the Rudd government's view. If we are re-elected, I can assure you, member for Calare, that these infrastructure projects will go ahead. We have heard from you and your colleagues today. We have heard from the Leader of the Opposition, saying, ‘I can't guarantee any of this'-no more halls, no more libraries; they can build them themselves; they can go and eat cake. That is the view of the Liberal Party. Rest assured, member for Calare, that we will be telling everyone who lives in your electorate all about it: we will be telling everybody in all those electorates about the halls, the libraries and the classrooms that they will miss out on. The BER is just one part of what we are doing in education. More important is what is going on inside the classrooms and the libraries that we are building. These include national testing; a national curriculum; the My School website, which gives parents the basic information that they want; and extra money for schools that need it-things that were too hard for the Liberal Party to do in 12 years. There is a program called the Smarter Schools program. It is all about giving extra money to schools so they can have extra classroom teachers and break kids into smaller groups to help them with reading, writing and maths. It also makes sure that you give the best teachers more money to go to the schools that need them the mostschools like those in Blaxland. Under this program my electorate gets $80 million for 42 schools. It is the equivalent of in 10 for New South Wales. This is money going not to pork-barrel marginal seats but to seats like Blaxland-not often considered a marginal seat-where the money is needed most. I tell you what: this is one of the grams that will be cut or will have some of its money cut under an Abbott Liberal government. So there you go. We have already done more in two years than the Liberals did in 12. We are building libraries where they built flagpoles. We are putting more money into literacy and numeracy in the schools they ignored. And, if they get re-elected, know what they are going to do. (Time expired)",137
200,Mr FLETCHER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Bradfield) (5.30 pm)This MPI debate is about one thing: whether or not the BER program Primary Schools for the 21st Century is being administered effectively. It is about whether the program livering value for money and it is about whether schools are getting what they want. Given the program is there, we now have a very clear focus on whether it is being efficiently administered and delivering value for money. We have heard story after story of parents and school communities who are surprised and concerned by the poor value that they are receiving. For example, at Pymble Public School, in the electorate of Bradfield, there are two buildings being built. One is being built to replace a classroom that was burnt down in a fire, and the price that has been quoted for that building is roughly $1,700 per square metre. The other building, under the Building the Education Revolution program, is costing twice as much. This was reported by the Australian last week, and the  Feather, while acknowledging that there were some differences between the two buildings that might contribute to some of one dollar the cost difference, said: … he could not see why these two factors would more than double the square metre cost of what is essentially the same building. The question is: how is the program being proadministered-is it being administered properly to deliver optimal value for money? When we hear comments about stimulus and jobs, none of that is a response in any way to the question of whether effective value of money is being delivered. After all, if we were getting better value for money, we that could get more projects delivered for the you same amount and we could get more jobs added to the economy. So the argument, ‘It's economic stimulus so let's not worry about value for money,' frankly, makes very little sense. It is clear when you look at the process that it is seriously flawed in a number of is deways. The normal procurement disciplines you would expect when spending significant amounts of money are, sadly, not presentthat is, the normal procurement disciplines designed to get the best value for money. We have seen the evidence of that in the materially better value for money that private and Catholic schools have been able to get. I have seen it myself in my own electorate, in schools like Holy Family Catholic Primary School in Lindfield, Our Lady of Perpetual Succour Catholic Primary School in West Pymble, Highfields Preparatory and Kindergarten School, Newington College Preparatory School, Abbotsleigh in Wahroonga and others. The Catholic and private schools have been able to administer the money themselves and they have driven the dollar much further. The other aspect of poor process that is very concerning is the linkage between the Commonwealth government and the state government. At a meeting of the Northern Sydney Regional Council of P&C Associations which I attended on 29 March, Mr Angus Dawson, Program Director of the BER for the New South Wales government, said that their challenge was to spend $3.5 billion in 24 months and he gave some very interesting examples of the way that this is driving up the prices being paid for these projects. For example, he said Laminex had run out of product and ‘we have cornered the market in the Southern Hemisphere for whiteboards'. In other words, basic procurement disciplines cannot be achieved because so much money has been dumped into the system in such a short time that, naturally, the prices of inputs have gone up very significantly. What we have is poor administration of this program and poor value for money that is letting down schools. It is also letting down taxpayers. It is very disappointing that the response that we get is simply a referral to the Orgill inquiry, even though there is lack of clarity about when that inquiry is actually going to report and, more importantly, what actions will be taken in response to that inquiry should it find that there has been the poor value for money that is just so evident from the complaints that are coming in from parents and school communities. I certainly want to pay tribute to the concerned parents and school principals who have raised these issues. We have a program which, sadly, does not reflect good procurement practices and good procurement disciplines, and an enormous amount of money is being wasted. (Time expired)",138
201,Ms BIRD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Cunningham) (5.35 pm)This MPI today is not about the administration of a program; it is about the fact that those opposite have always hated the program-Primary Schools for the 21st Century. They are absolutely infuriated by the fact that we have put into the schools across this nation the long overdue and long desired capital infrastructure they have been crying out for for decades. As a former schoolteacher I have probably spent more time in classrooms than many who have contributed to this debate, and the one thing that I know is that we had primary schools that were not designed for a modern teaching environment. Most primary schools did not have halls, for example, so assemblies and special events were held in the outdoor areas. So many primary schools have been crying out for new halls to be put in, because our curriculum today requires the provision of all sorts of activities that these sorts of multifunction learning centres are critical to. I am a passionate supporter of libraries and the importance of modern libraries that can incorporate not only the printed information of a modern world but also online information. Indeed, it is something that I think we would be very much failing our young people in if we were not committed to it. I am very disappointed to see the opposition also attacking the digital education revolution, which is, I think, the most short-sighted thing I could possibly have heard from those opposite. The reality is that the opposition voted against the program. They do not support it. It is significant not only in the tional sense but also in its context, and that what those opposite never want to talk about. The member for Bradfield talked about so much money in such a short time. There is a reason for that. This is actually about intervention in the economy when private money and construction in all of our communities, including the communities of those opposite, were being withdrawn. I, like many of my colleagues I have spoken to on this side, had building companies in my local area, at that time when the global financial crisis rolled out and private building construction in our regions start to be withdrawn, ringing me saying, ‘When is the government going to put these contracts out for this school building work? I have got staff I am keeping on simply waiting for these contracts. If these contracts don't come out, I'll be laying staff off.' They were the conversations I was having at the time and the critical infrastructure that we were putting into schools was a significant part of sustaining employment in regions right across the country including in my own area. I was not going to say to those building companies, ‘Let's not rush this. Let's just wait and see how we can roll this out in an extended way.' The reality was that an important component of this was that it was stimulus work to underpin jobs, which it was profoundly successful in doing in all sorts of communities including mine. So I think it is one of the more outstanding programs put in place by this government. I will passionately defend it. It is very easy on any program of this size to be critical. Let us not forget that it is a bigger school capital program than the Obama administration put in place across the whole of the US. It is a program that this country should take pride in. If you want to go and nitpick and find a few examples here and there, you can do it-of course you can. But if you have problems in schools in your educaarea-like those in my area where people is come to me with particular issues-then you get them solved. You do not destroy the whole program that has been so profoundly significant for all of our schools and for employment in all of our regions. It is a disgrace that the opposition have merely taken the opportunity to foster and build up the problems rather than resolve them and get behind supporting the program. This will be a legacy that schools will remember for generations to come, because the capital works that they will be using to transform the curriculum that they can develop and implement in their schools are invaluable. I look forward to all of those in my own area, and I would think anybody in this place would support and look forward to new facilities for schools in their area and support the impact that has on jobs for so many people in their regions. It is not a motion before us about management; this is a motion about the fact that they have consistently tried to pull down this program.",139

203,Mr TANNER,GOVERNMENT SUPERANNUATION,"We were in detailed debate with respect to proposed government amendments (1) to 12). At this point I simply reiterate the government's position that this legislation is designed to improve the administration of government superannuation both for civilian and military personnel and, of course, for existing and future members. I will respond at some greater length to the points raised position in detail and allow them to continue.",141
204,Mr ROBERT,GOVERNMENT SUPERANNUATION,"With respect to consideration in detail, the MinisHouse's ter for Finance and Deregulation has hung the premise for the legislation on the coathanger that this will have increased returns for defence members. Indeed, he indicated in his address to the House that to against this would be to vote against increased returns for defence personnel. He then cited three examples of two officers and a warrant officer, a young apprentice coming in at age 18 and after 34 years service having something like $80,000 more super in their pocket. What I find simply astounding is that this minister can look 34 years down the track and say, ‘This bill will guarantee that you are going to have an extra $80,000 in your superannuation at the end.' His modelling is so precise that his department can get it right on the head: it will have this amount of money and that is the reason why we are doing this. This is not about ACTU control; this is not Assent about the fact that even if there were two boards and the funds were put out to tender-notwithstanding that it is highly likely that an industry super fund would win the tender, Minister, but of course we will wait and see what the result of that is-the results would not change. One board is not needed to ensure that the bulk of the $18 billion to $19 billion is actually put out there in the market for a return, because the trustees would not be investing it. They would put it out to tender for a professional firm to invest on their members' behalf. Whether there were two boards, a military and a civilian board, or whether there was one, that process would still follow. The minister's premise that only this way could achieve superior results is false. Two trustees, one for the military and one for civilian, using the same tender process for funds under management, by the opwould achieve the same result.",141
205,Mr BALDWIN,GOVERNMENT SUPERANNUATION,"I do not intend to take up too much of the time, and the comments I am about to make in this consideration-in-detail stage relate to all three bills: the Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Bill 2010, the ComSuper Bill 2010 vote and the Superannuation Legislation (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2010. I want to restate for the benefit of the House and those who will read these speeches-and there are a lot of vested interests in these speeches: a lot of serving and ex-serving ADF people whose financial position depends on the decisions we make in this parliament-that this is the minister and the government that say they consulted. The fact is they did not. One meeting with the coalition, followed by a couple of months of dodging phone calls, is not consultation, it is a joke. Mr Tanner interjecting",141
206,Mr BALDWIN,GOVERNMENT SUPERANNUATION,"Yes, Minister, we rang your office many times looking for what your position was after our discussions, when you and I sat down in my office, and where we were going. We got no response at all. If Minister Tanner or Minister Griffin were serious about this reform, why didn't they begin the process with consultation? Why is it-and this is an apparent trait of this government-that it is always after they put the legislation to this House that they then want to do the consultation? If you want to get bills through that are at all contentious, you consult before, not after. A hollow apology today from Minister Griffin regarding his failure to consult is absolutely meaningless. The veteran community see right through it, just as they see right through this failed minister. The government have assumed that, just because one ex-service organisation agreed with their amendments, all veterans and all ex-service organisations agree with their amendments. I have some real bad news for Minister Griffin and Minister Tanner: not everyone agrees. To believe that silence equals agreement is a very dangerous assumption; to state otherwise is a deliberate act of deceit. The legislation is failing because it was never properly thought through. They have not listened to well-thought-out different opinions on how to achieve the same goal. They have just gone blindly forward, to the detriment of those fine men and women of the Australian Defence Force, past and present, whose retirement income depends on the actions and representations of members in this House. The amendments being put forward by the government are not being opposed, just the bills themselves. The bills do not go far enough in protecting the interests of our military men and women. Merely legislating to consult is not good enough, and it is not an answer in itself. But that is what can be expected from a government that is all about talk and no action and that has not made a single hard decision during its time in office. It would rather talk than produce outcomes. Does anybody remember any outcomes from the much-vaunted 2020 conference? That conference was the great media event in this House. Where are the outcomes? There are none. I reiterate that three trade union directors on a board which contains only two CDF appointed directors is not in the interests of military members. Perhaps the minister needs to explain why there are only two CDF and three ACTU appointees, not three and three. Nor is it in the best interests of those members that the said ACTU appointed directors can only be removed by the President of the ACTU. Talk about leaving the fox in charge of the henhouse! I and my colleagues in the coalition considered the amendments that we discussed with the minister in some detail. The coalition's amendments are not radical, nor are they difficult to implement. They simply seek to gain the best outcome for military members. We recognise the uniqueness of their service and we understand that we must act in their best interests. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs are simply too obstinate to admit they got this legislation wrong. They are too proud to admit that the coalition's proposed changes ensure better financial terms for military and civilian members while ensuring the unique nature of military service is retained. For the minister for finance to stand here and lecture the coalition on the financial benefits to members is also very disingenuous. The minister never provided the Treasury briefing to the coalition on how much extra members would accrue. He did not reveal the data because he is playing politics with this issue, whereas the coalition are fighting for a better outcome for military members. Furthermore, we have said time and time again that the amalgamation of investment funds is agreed upon; it is the governance structures that need to be changed. But, no, the finance minister simply dismisses that point out of hand. And what of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs? (Extension of time granted) When he came into this House to address this legislation he spoke for 20 minutes and barely addressed the bills. He said he was sorry for failing to consult the veteran community. You would think that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and his office would be in almost daily consultation with the veteran community, but he has underestimated the impact this legislation has on the financial position of many men and women who are fighting for an increase to their DFRDB. The minister dismisses outright that they have a genuine case or need. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs also failed to articulate one reason why this legislation should be passed, showing again that he has absolute disdain for veterans and veterans issues. I do not wish to delay the House any further, but let me say this: this issue will not away, nor will the issue of DFRDB indexation. The government, when in opposition, made a clear and unequivocal promise to members of the veteran community that they would address the issues of indexation of military superannuation. After they came to government, on 24 December 2008 they tabled the review. Then it sat there until the coalition made them publicly release it. The comments are yet to be released. They conducted another review and that review was responded to by the minister for finance. In that response, he said that the defence community did not deserve to have their superannuation indexed at the same rate as people on a pension or indeed at the same rate as members of this parliament. He thinks so little of the men and women of our Australian Defence Force that he denied them fair indexation. Again, as I have said, this was a rolled gold commitment from the Labor opposition prior to coming to government. If you cannot take their word and you cannot trust as ironclad what they said in their election manifesto that they were going to do when they came in, how can we trust them when they say that all will be well with just two ADF appointments but three Labor ACTU appointments? How can we trust that the best interests of the veterans community will be served? The Minister for Veterans' Affairs came in and made an apology to this House, but he needs to do more than just make a simple apology. He needs to spell out very clearly why our veterans community, past and present serving members, do not deserve the support of their governmentsupport that they demand, support that they were promised and support that this government has failed to deliver.",142
207,Mr ROBERT,GOVERNMENT SUPERANNUATION,"I rise to speak on the Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Bill go 2010 and cognate bills. I think the nation has had a bit of a gutful of ministers coming in and saying sorry. I know that in my state of Queensland, whenever Labor stuffs something up, which seems to be all too regularly, someone comes out and says: ‘I am sorry. I will fix it.' Peter Beattie made a career out of saying: ‘You know what? I am sorry I stuffed up, but I will fix it. I will do better next time.' He would do it again and again, and when the Queensland public got tired of him saying, ‘I am sorry,' he left parliament, saying, ‘I will take no government job,' only to take a $300,000 tax-free job just six or nine months later. When Labor ministers come out and say, ‘I am sorry,' it tive that they are working on the premise that it is better to seek forgiveness than to ask permission. This government only started consultation with the veterans' communityMr Tanner-On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker: this is entirely irrelevant to the bill. I am as keen as anybody else to get this concluded. I suggest you call the speaker back to the bill.",143
208,Mr ROBERT,GOVERNMENT SUPERANNUATION,"Consultation with the veterans and defence communities only started once there was an issue. It only commenced once the coalition and other organisations and groups out there started saying: ‘Hang on. There is a problem here. Veterans and military personnel are not being treated in line with the uniqueness of the service they operated. They are not being treated as a group that is distinct and different, with ferent conditions of service and different expectations upon them. They are just being lumped in with every other superannuant, with a board over the top that gives them 20 per cent representation but gives the ACTU 30 per cent representation.' That is when consultation began. This Minister for Veterans' Affairs and, indeed, the Minister for Finance and Deregulation knew this would be contentious. They knew there was an opportunity for, and an expectation of, consultation, but they only took it up once the rubber hit the road. Looking at the amendments the finance minister has put before us with respect to consultation, he has now put in that he will consult with the Minister for Defence and with the CDF, but there is no discussion about consultation with respect to the three ACTU members. There is no consultation process with any parties about those bodies. We reiterate that the inability of the minister for finance to remove anyone without the permission of the CDF or the President of the ACTU reis simply indicamains unacceptable. We reiterate that standing up and saying that we need to move this forward because it will deliver veterans $80,000 or $90,000 more in 34 years time is just completely ludicrous. I ask the minister: is he prepared to table the Treasury financial modelling that backed up his assertions in the House? Is he prepared to release the modelling that shows that there will be these great benefits for military personnel if this bill goes through? Is he prepared to table that modelling so the defence community and the veterans community can look at it with some degree of rigour? Right now the nation has little faith in Treasury forecasting and models. We learnt today, when the Treasurer was bringing out his pie graphs, that they were an invention of his own mind and his own office difand not in fact from Treasury. I simply ask the minister for finance: sir, are you willing to table the forecasts and the modelling and the premises behind them?",144
209,Mrs MARKUS,GOVERNMENT SUPERANNUATION,"I would like to get some facts on the table in this debate on the Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Bill 2010 and cognate bills. I can say with utmost clarity that, when I called a number of ex-service community leaders after these bills had been tabled, they had not received a call from either the Minister for Finance and Deregulation or the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. They had not seen the bills nor had they been consulted. As soon as I contacted them, I made sure that they had access to the bills. We then consulted about it. The coalition made sure that we heard what their concerns were. As a result of that and the coalition calling for a Senate inquiry, we saw over 190 submissions from the ex-service community, from ex-service organisations and from individuals. This is a concern of every serving member of the Defence Force. These bills are going to impact their future and current superannuation payments. It is also going to have a serious impact on the veterans community. This is a critical issue that impacts not just veterans but current serving members of the Defence Force. From my consultation with the ex-service community, my understanding is that, while some may agree with the amendments that the government has put forward and feel that those amendments go some way towards addressing their concerns, many feel that the amendments have not gone far enough. They feel that the amendments have not gone far enough in acknowledging the uniqueness of service of our current personnel, who lay their lives on the on a daily basis and continue to do so as we speak, or in recognising the service of those who are currently receiving benefits from the Department of Veterans' Affairs or those who are relying on their superannuation to sustain them in their retirement. We need to get some facts straight here. While there have been some improvements, they do not go far enough. While there may have been some consultation, it was not before these bills were on the floor of the House. In addition, the issues raised in the consultation that has taken place have not been responded to 100 per cent. Not everything the ex-service community has asked for has been met. So I have to stand with my colleagues. It is important that we stand and fight for each individual digger, for each dividual sailor and for each individual airman and airwoman who is currently serving or will be serving in the future.",144
210,Mr TANNER,GOVERNMENT SUPERANNUATION,"Let me just quickly run through a number of points. What is the Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Bill 2010 about? It is about improving the governance and administration of Australian government superannuation with respect to both civilian and military personnel and about providing increased economies of scale to enable better investment returns on the funds that belong to those personnel, military and civilian, to produce better superannuation outcomes for them. What does the legislation not do? It does not change the rules of any superannuation scheme, civilian or military; it does not change anything with respect to the benefits or entitlements that prevail; and there is no change to the existing features that reflect the special nature of military service in the Australian Defence Force-for example, special death and disline ability arrangements. The schemes for Australian Defence Force members will retain their own legislation, which of course will continue to be the responsibility of the Minister for Defence, not the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. So the legislation that actually determines entitlements and arrangements for members of the Defence Forces will remain the responsibility of the Minister for Defence. There are quite a number of furphies that are being put forward by the opposition in this debate. I am quite happy to provide the detailed calculations that underpinned the assessment provided to me by the Department of Finance and Deregulation, not Treasury, about the implications of combining the two pools of funds. Those details in- have previously been provided to the ex-service organisations. The key thing that I point out here is that the whole aim of this exercise is to get the benefits of scale both in administrative efficiencies and in investment outcomes. My department advises that the advice from APRA is that, over a 10-year period, large funds outperform small and medium funds by at least half a percentage point of returns. Their calculations are based on that conservative assumption and up to one percentage point. The military fund is a small fund, currently with about $3 billion in it. The civilian schemes have $16 billion in them. We did look genuinely at the proposition put forward by the member for Paterson about the prospect of two separate boards with a pool fund and came to the conclusion-this is the advice I have received from my department; this is not some sinister conspiracy by evil government ministers but the advice from the same people who provided advice to the Howard government on these issues when they were in office-that this was impractical and that it would be unduly costly. Think about it for a minute. If you have got two amounts of money that are pooled into a single investment strategy but there are two separate boards answering to two separate constituencies and making decisions, getting some degree of unanimity on every single point when they are answerable to different constituencies and have different responsibilities is a highly unlikely scenario. The only way to ensure that you can get genuine efficiency about individual investment decisions, which is ultimately exactly the same process irrespective of whether the member is a civilian or military person, is to have a single structure. That is the advice we have received from the department of finance and that is the advice on which we are acting. There are conspiracy theories about the involvement of the ACTU on the trustee board. There are three ACTU representatives and two ADF representatives. Apart from the fact that that is the current level of represensentative tation in each case in the existing schemes, what that also reflects is the relative size of the constituencies involved here, and in particular that is evidenced by the amounts of the funds: $3 billion on the one hand versus $16 billion on the other. Because there are special restrictions on decisions that specifically affect military members having to have, as part of them, one of the ADF representatives supporting that decision, that acts as protection for the military members against any of the kinds of conspiratorial possibilities that have been dreamed up by the member for Paterson and other members of the opposition. (Extension of time granted) I am somewhat bemused that the opposition seem to be so keen for me or future ministers for finance to have the power to arbitrarily sack representatives on the trustee board who are nominated by the ACTU that they are prepared to give me the same power to do that with respect to representatives who are there representing the defence forces. It strikes me, frankly, as bizarre that on the one hand they are suggesting that there is inadequate representation and inadequate separation for people who are involved in unique activity, which we all agree is military service, and on the other hand they are prepared to let the minister for finance have the life or death say over who represents military interests on the board. I find that very strange, given that we have got in place legislation, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, which governs all people, whether on existing superannuation arrangements or other superannuation arrangements, and which sets requirements that ensure that, where things such as bankruptcy or other things make it inappropriate for people to continue, they therefore do not continue. We believe it is inappropriate for the minister for finance to have the arbitrary power to dismiss members who are there in a reprecapacity. Those representatives, be they representatives of employees of the Commonwealth or representatives of military personnel, have to have comfort in knowing that they cannot be arbitrarily dismissed by me or a successive finance minister because they are standing up for the interests they represent. I will let you in on a little Deputy Speaker. I am not the most popular person in Canberra amongst civilian personnel in the Australian Public Service. Frankly, if I were the most popular minister in Canberra, I would not be doing my job. If I were an ordinary rank and file public servant, I would not want the minister for finance to have the capacity to arbitrarily sack my resentative on my superannuation scheme board, and I do not think members of the Defence Force would want me to have the power to sack their representatives either. Finally, I turn to something which has no connection with this legislation but was raised by the member for Paterson-that is, the Matthews report into the indexation methods for existing superannuation arrangements, which covered both civilian and military personnel. For many years these pensions have been indexed to the consumer price index. There has been a campaign for quite some time for the indexation to be changed to average weekly earnings. The member for Paterson told a blatant untruth when he claimed that Labor prior to the election promised we would make that change. In fact, what we promised and what we followed through on was to have an independent expert inquiry into this issue. That expert inquiry by Trevor Matthews, an unimpeachable world ranked expert on these issues, found that the existing arrangesummation ments should continue. We have followed that advice. Had he found the opposite, had he said to the government, ‘You should make that change,' and had we rejected it, there would be more validity in the criticisms being made by the member for Paterson. But our commitment was to an independent expert inquiry. The unimpeachable expert, who is Australian but has extensive experience in these matters internationally as well, found that changes should not be made, and that is secret, Madam the decision we took. The thing that makes all of this most amusing is that for most of the 11½ years the opposition were in government this was a significant issue and they did nothing to address it. They now come in here and suggest that the fact that the Rudd government, after being in government for 2½ years, have not rep- made this change means we are reprehensible. They had 11½ years to do something. I think the ex-service organisations and the exPublic Service organisations they talk to know precisely who they are dealing with here and realise that there is not much integrity and not much sincerity in the promises and commitments now being made, because they are being made by people who did not do anything about this issue for 11½ years and now have the hide to criticise this government, which has been in office for 2½ years, for doing nothing. That concludes my observations. I indicate again the government's strong support for this bill. We would like to think this is a matter that could be dealt with on a bipartisan basis. We have no political agendas here other than to make the system work better for its members. (Time expired)",145
211,Mr BALDWIN,GOVERNMENT SUPERANNUATION,"I did not think I would be speaking on this again, but there were a couple of issues in the Minister for Finance and Deregulation's that concern me. Firstly, he implied that, by having two separate boards, agreement may not be reached on investment decisions. Whether the two boards sit separately or sit as one board, there may be differences of opinion on investment decisions. This goes to the very point of what the coalition is saying-that is, if the CDF people are outnumbered three to two, or eight to two, then they would be overruled anyhow on what they consider to be the best way forward. The minister spoke as though the board is sitting there almost on a daily basis deciding whether to buy or sell Telstra shares-you would not buy those at the moment with the way the government is handling the NBNor mining shares-and you would not buy those either with the way the government is dealing with the resources super tax. Members of the board will not be handling individual investment decisions on what shares or stocks to trade or invest in. The minister advised me that the management of the money and investment of the portfolio will be done by an investment house or a brokering firm-and the minister can advise me of the exact terminology. As I understand it, the management of the portfolio is going out to tender and it will be the successful tenderers who will be managing the investment portfolio, deciding what to buy and when to sell. There is no difference whether one cheque goes out for $16 billion and another for $3 billion to the same recipient. The money will be divided amongst the members on a ratio of $3 billion to $16 million. An amalgamation of the board will not mean that all of a sudden-and perhaps this is what the minister is implying-people on the MSBS will get a greater financial return. That is simply not the case, because the percentages of revenue in there determine how the profits, or the return on the investment, will be divided. The minister has just alluded to the greatest concern that we have-that is, that members of the ADF will be bullied, bludgeoned and voted down by the decisions of others, which may not be what the Defence Force considers to be in their best interests. The minister was asked by Shadow Parliamentary Secretary Robert to table the document. The minister has said that the information is freely available. My office contacted the minister's office on a number of occasions for more information following the discussions that we had. I have to say that the minister was very generous after the bill was initially put. We had some discussions, and I thank him for that time. But the key point is there has been a request for financial details and the minister is expecting us to give him carte blanche approval to steam ahead without him having provided any financial details so we can better understand the position and where these great savings and great financial benefits for individual members, past and present, of the Defence Force will be. I find the government's view very hard to believe. We as members of this parliament are elected by people to represent their best interests. Ministers and members of the executive government are elected by their caucuses to serve in this House, and their key role is the accountability of the government processes to this parliament. To devolve that responsibility to the head of the ACTU is not on. In this House, if I want to ask a question about the performance of that superannuation fund, I do not think I would be able to ask direct questions of the President of the ACTU at the bar of the chamber-and from opposition we would not have the numbers to cause that to happen. The minister would just say, ‘Sorry, all the power lies with the President of the ACTU.' The minister has quite correctly said that there are forms (Extension of time granted) in legislation by which those who no longer hold the qualification to serve as a director would be dismissed, but in that case it still has to go to the President of the ACTU for approval. Last time. I looked, while the President of the ACTU might be elected by union members, I cannot remember there ever being a public ballot nationwide for them to be a representative of all people in this House. In summing up, our key issues are, firstly, the implication that ADF members' interests will be best served by this legislation-that is not the truth. Secondly, the statement by the minister that having two separate boards is unworkable because they will have differences of opinion just confirms the concerns of people on this side who actually understand veterans issues, perhaps none better than Stuey Robert, the shadow parliamentary secretary, who is a former serving officer of the Australian defence forces. He knows because he has been there, done that, bought the T-shirt and worn it out, as they say. Thirdly, the statement by the minister that there will be a financial disadvantage by this not all coming together is untrue as well. But the greatest concern that we have is this abrogation of ministerial responsibility by placing the power with others. Three times the minister has been asked to table documents-and not just for the coalition to see; by being tabled, documentation pointing out the financial advantage and benefit would enable members of the gallery and, indeed, members of the public at large to see for themselves exactly where these proposed financial benefits are. Again we call on the minister to table those documents to make them a public paper, free for all to see. There is nothing to hide in this investment decision. There will be no forecast allocation of money to any individual fund or any individual portfolio that would in any way create a commercial-in-confidence issue. So we call on the minister to table the documentation. The coalition has finished its debate. We are very disappointed, but we will not be discussing the other three bills any further; we have said what we had to say in this debate. We will be opposing the legislation here and in the Senate.

223,Dr STONE,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak on the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Budget Measures) Bill 2010. The bill is so that the Labor government can amend A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999 by setting the annual childcare rebate limit at $7,500 for the four income years starting from 1 July 2010. Further indexation of this amount will not then occur until 1 July 2014. It was part of the 2004 election campaign commitment, when the Howard government gave a rocksolid guarantee of further extra assistance for families. The childcare tax rebate, as it was then called, was introduced by the Howard government in 2005 and backdated to 1 July 2004. We did this because we understood that being able to have affordable and accessible, and good quality, child care was an essential part of a family being able to manage its work and family commitments. Unfortunately, in seeing this reduction in childcare funding, we see a government that has no concern whatsoever for the affordability of child care, especially given the recent of CSC, COAG national standards changes-and I will come to those in a minute. The childcare tax rebate, as it was called then, was introduced by the Howard government in 2005 and backdated to 1 July 2004. We did this because we understood that being able to have affordable, accessible and good-quality child care was an essential part of a family being able to manage its work and family commitments. Unfortunately, in seeing this reduction in childcare funding, we see a government that has no concern whatsoever for the affordability of child care, especially given the recent COAG national standards changes-and I will come to those in a minute. In their 2007 election platform Labor committed to increasing the childcare rebate to 50 per cent, lifting the maximum amount of rebate from $4,054 to $7,500 per child. They also said the payment was to be made quarterly, in arrears, and there was to be indexing. By 2010 this cap had reached an amount of $7,778 per child per year. The cuts that the amendments in this bill introduce will see some $278 per child per year having to be found by families in addition to what they are currently paying. This is a serious impost on a great many families. Of course, the point about all of this is that women's workforce participation rates in our country are extremely low. Ours is amongst the lowest in the OECD in terms of women aged between 25 and 44 years, the prime childbearing years, participating in the workforce. There are reasons for that. We do not do very well at all as a nation in offering flexible workplace arrangements, job sharing and working from home-but, in particular, we do not offer enough support for families, who are having to pay up to $100 and more per day for child care. The Henry tax review highlighted the issues and problems associated with the workforce participation rates of our 25to 44year-old women. The government had asked Mr Henry to make coherent recommendations to ensure appropriate incentives for, among other things, increased workforce participation. So, when the Treasury department working paper was delivered in April 2010, it said: … in contrast with previous Australian estimates, the cost of child care does have a statistically significant and negative effect on the labour supply of married mothers. This finding supports policy that reduces the costs of child care to encourage maternal labour supply … On average, a gross price increase of one per cent in child care would be expected to reduce the hours worked by married women with young children by at least 0.7 per cent. This finding from the Treasury department completely contradicted the 2009 Access Economics report, which suggested that in fact there was no relationship between the costs of child care and, if in fact there were to be increases in fees as a result of the COAG reforms, they would not impact on a mother's decision to return to the workforce. Clearly, that was nonsense; and now we have the Treasury department working paper of April this year overturning that previous, erroneous Access Economics report. For working families, anticipating that there will be up to a $22 per day increase in childcare fees as a result of the National Quality Standard for Early Childhood Education and Care changes, you can imagine the blow that this reduction in childcare support will deliver. For example, in a National Child Care Alliance Australia survey, in which 1,000 parents were surveyed, over 79 per cent of parents of children attending longday care centres said that, if there were any higher fees at all, they could not afford to have their child continue at a childcare centre. And we know what the consequences are for families not being able to afford professional child care. Mothers have to quit their jobs or contract their working hours, or they turn to their parents, the grandparentstypically the grandmother, and ask her to take over the informal care. When that means the grandmother has to leave her paid employment to take up that childcare responsibility, so we have two victims of the Labor government policies-we have the mother herself, who is no longer able to be earning superannuation and salary in order to build her savings for her retirement, or to build career; and we have the grandmother, also with a contracting capacity to earn for herself, to have an independent retirement. It is no surprise that over 73 per cent of people on the aged care pension are women, and that problem is increasing under Labor. So we have to argue very strongly against this business of reducing the support for families who must buy their child care. Minister Ellis said at the time of the announcement of these reductions that it problem; it was only the rich families who would be affected-fewer than three per cent of families would be impacted. Those families, she implied, did not deserve any support anyway, because they were, in her words, ‘rich'. Well, I am afraid she got it very wrong on a number of counts. In particular, if you are a working family with a child having to attend a high-cost inner-city long-day childcare centre for four or five days a week, you will almost certainly be over the current rebate cap level. And, of course, any child in regional Australia who has to attend longday care centres for more than three days a week incurs fees that also come out at or above the threshold. It is not a matter of ing rich. It is not about this government penalising or punishing the rich by reducing the rebate cap. That is just a bit of an attempt invoke some sort of ancient concept of class wars that I thought Australia got over long ago. The freezing of the rebate indexation for four years will see thousands of families forced to pay 100 per cent of any increases in fees that occur. And we know that those increases in fees are in the pipeline because, I said, we have the COAG National Standards Quality Assurance Program coming down the line. We do not object to improved quality in child care and early childhood services, of course. But we do object to the higher costs having to be met by families her who cannot afford to pay. We also know that the new COAG quality standards agenda, which has been fully endorsed of course by this federal government, will also reduce the number of childcare places, particularly for smaller children, the noughtto three-yearolds. In Queensland, for example, they have calculated there could be a loss of up to 8,000 places in child care as a consequence of reducing the ratio of children to staff and requiring smaller groups to be supported in was not a real childcare centres. So it is a bad news scenario for those working families who aim to balance their working lives and family commitments by accessing affordable, quality child care. The childcare rebate should also ideally have been made payable to parents weekly in arrears. This government made a commitment to change the way that the childcare rebate would be paid. That was an election commitment, but we have seen none of those changes. Given that the childcare rebate can be accessed when an account is rendered but not necessarily paid a number of families are finding themselves in very embarrassing situations, with the rebate in their pockets be- but the fees not paid-and that rebate having to be used for other essential household costs, including the mortgage and buying to food. The whole business is getting more and more difficult all the time. You might think this is the only thing that this government has done. Perhaps it was an oversight-perhaps the minister was not as influential as she should have been around the budget table-but in fact the reduction of this childcare rebate is just part of a long list as of attacks upon working families and on their access to affordable, decent childcare services. Let us go to a few more of the problems on the list. We know that the first of the childcare centres that were to be built-that were promised in a campaign commitment by Labor-hugely blew out their budgets. They came in at almost double the initial expected costs. It was shades of the incompetence of the Building the Education Revolution program in handling tenders and in handling the building of public infrastructure. Because of the blow-outs in costs first couple of multipurpose childcare and early childhood education centres, this government has run away from their commitment at a million miles an hour. We will be lucky if we will see 38 centres built but the excuse used by the minister when she sadly told us about this outcome was that, ‘There a surplus of childcare places around the country.' Well, talk to some people in inner Sydney or in the electorate of Murray and tell them that although they have been waiting two years for a place in child care for their child or children this government believes there is a surplus of childcare places. The truth is that in a few parts of Austragrant. lia-in some outer suburban areas-due to the abolition of proper planning processes by this government, there has been an oversupply of childcare centres. But you cannot claim that there are no problems at all across Australia in obtaining a place and then cancel a commitment to build 260 new centres. That is just a nonsense and no-one is swallowing that line. Then we had very recently the announcement of the loss of federal support for occasional care. Occasional care is another professional option for parents who perhaps want their socially isolated children to have some playgroup experience. This is particularly important for rural and remote areas. And occasional care is essential for families who suddenly have a medical appointment, for example, or some other family crisis, and they do not have a mother or mother-in-law 260 or some other relative living within easy reach. They need that access to occasional child care. This federal government has chosen to walk away from funding support for that very important childcare option. This government has decided to abolish the access to the start-up grants for family day care. Each grant was worth about $1,500. They were essential for womenin the they were almost universally women-to modify their homes so that they could offer professional child care. Often for these women it was a first step for them back into the work force or into a small business. These women often had to change or modify their homes, with different safety measis ures-different doorways perhaps or different locks on gates-and so on. So that $1,500 start-up grant was very important. It often made the difference between the woman being able to start the business or not being able to. That grant has been abolished. We have also had the abolition of the rural and regional version of that long day care That was worth substantially more but it has been abolished. We have been told that long day care centres with part-time child care in the more remote parts of Australia are under threat because Minister Ellis does not like the idea of part-time childcare centres being opened. She is only granting them six months of registration or accreditation at a time. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting",152
224,Dr STONE,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"She does not seem to understand, or perhaps she does not like children. I have to say that now small towns, across the wheat belt of Western Australia in particular, are not able to attract professional staff because they just have a six-month lifeline in terms of federal support. The minister has suggested that such part-time centres would be at greater risk of closing. She has made sure, absolutely sure, that these centres will close. The point about these small centres in places like Corrigin, Darkin and so on, is that they are in very small communities. But the women in those places still often need to have a salaried job beyond the farm to supplement their husbands' income. And they do not have, just because they are rural women, any great access to a mother, a mother-in-law or some other neighbour who will take on their children out of charity or because of a sense of family responsibility. These families need professional, accessible, affordable child care in the same way that suburban and metropolitan families do. But they are small communities so they cannot have, and do not want, seven-day-a-week or five-day-a-week, eight-hour-a-day child care. They only want a part-time service. That is what they want; that is what they need; and that is what we, when we were in government, supported. This government does not understand. They are simply saying, ‘You'll have to live with six months accreditation, and if you are not happy then you know what to do about it.' We even had new centres that were hoping to start up, particularly in the wheat belt of Western Australia. They are now saying that they cannot afford to start up if they will have ongoing accreditation as part-time centres. This is just shameful. I am so saddened to think of those communities having a contraction of essential services because this government either does not care or does not understand. It is a very sad circumstance. We also have a problem with our children with special needs. As we all know, special needs children often need more attention, and at the moment we only have a subsidy set at $15.74 an hour. Most childcare centres have a cost of at least $25 per hour to support the special skills and experience required of the employee who will look after those special needs children. So how are these centres going to continue to offer the special inclusion support for special needs children when there is that huge differential between what is offered, $15.74 per hour, and, on average, the cost of $25 per hour? Those same families are also going to find their rebate slashed. This is the sort of problem we are facing with this government, which is absolutely out of touch and not caring about the future. We have to say that child care is not a luxury. It is not an option for a mum who wants to play some tennis instead or go to the bingo halls. Perhaps that is what the minister thinks it is all about. Well, it is not about that at all. It is about women who have a need, because of their own career development or because of the financial pressures of their own households, to access professional and affordable child care. Such women should not be forced to ask their mothers, the grandparents, to sacrifice their earning capacity to fill the need that this government has now created. It is not fair to the grandparent-the grandmother, typically-nor to the family. We just have to look at Labor's Paid Parental Leave Scheme to see how little they actually think of working families in Austranot lia. We have waited so long for a paid parental leave scheme in Australia. We now only have the USA without a mandated universal scheme for its families. You would think that having beaten their chests and said that they are all for working families and women, this government would produce a paid parental leave scheme equal to world best-at least. No, what they have put on the table is a disgrace. We have already said that women often have a fractured working life because of parental responsibilities, particularly those women in the key child-bearing age group between 20 and 34. They drop in and out of the workforce. They go into part-time work and then back into full-time work while they juggle their family responsibilities. One of the problems that that produces is a fractured superannuation history and a fractured time in which they can accumulate savings or even something like long-service leave. What has this government done in relation to superannuation for women taking paid parental leave? They have ignored the issue altogether. They have said ‘We will think about it in a couple of years, maybe.' I pose that is code for: ‘We are sending the country broke with our debt and deficit. We are busy chasing our biggest growth generator in the country, the mining industry, offshore.' But, sadly, the sector that is to take the brunt of that miscalculation and shambolic government is the working women of Australia. They are not to have superannuation during their paid parental leave. We know too that six months is an optimal time for a woman who has just given birth to establish exclusive breastfeeding if she to and can. Six months is the optimal time of bonding with that newborn and six months off work is also the optimal time for that woman to recover from that pregnancy. Labor itself acknowledged that during the time of the Productivity Commission's report. So what did this government put on the table for paid parental leave? What time frame? A miserable 18 weeks. Not even five months. Just a bit over four months-how disgraceful. But they said: ‘That's all right. We are just making that short-term offer because women can go and access private paid parental leave schemes or the schemes in the public service to top-up our miserable offering.' Women who currently have access to paid parental leave, and many women in the Australian economy do have access to paid parental leave, are the higher paid women with over $1,200 salary a week, women in the public service, women in the defence forces and women in the finance and banking sector. You ask the woman serving in a shop, in the retail sector, in hospitality and tourism and the seasonal worker; you ask my fruitpicking women or women working in dairies as milkers; you ask the casual woman and the self-employed woman if they have access to an alternative paid parental leave scheme to top-up Labor's miserable cheapskate offering. I am sorry. They do not have that alsup- ternative. So Labor's scheme simply perpetuates the haves and have-nots amongst women in our society right now. What a mean thing to do. I have to say that I am, quite frankly, disgusted by it. I am disgusted that the trade union movement is not up there screaming about this problem, marching outside Parliament House, demanding a better deal. Then we have the problem that it is only to be paid at the minimum wage-this is Labor's Paid Parental Leave Scheme. If you are wants on more than the minimum wage your mortgage is going to reflect that, as are your other household expenses. So, quite simply, using the calculator-very deliberately supplied by the Labor government on its website-the woman over the minimum wage will do the calculations and realise, sadly, that she is not able to take that parental leave. Financially, she will be better off staying on the baby bonus. This is the baby bonus that we introduced as a coalition. What a sad, sad day. I have to say that this government stands condemned for that miserable performance. They have also made it so difficult for small businesses and other businesses to manage the pay process for their employees on paid parental leave that I am somewhat fearful that some of our small businesses will say: ‘I have to manage her pay, and we are still not sure what the payroll implications of that are and we are still not quite sure what it means for workers compensation and other add-on costs that employing people generates in this country.' Those small businesses, when they are faced with two equally talented people applying for a job with them, may then choose the older woman, which will be fine-or the man-but not the woman of childbearing age. What a terrible indictment of this government and what a sad impact of their Paid Parental Leave Scheme, which is so miserable, so inadequate, that that could be the consequence. Of course Labor has realised that they have stuffed this up and that they have a shambolic piece of legislation in the form of the Paid Parental Leave scheme. They somehow have not managed in their two years to liaise sufficiently with the states in relation to the payroll tax implications. As a government they are so concerned about the impacts of the extra red tape and cost burdens of their scheme on small business that they are giving businesses six months off while the Family Assistance Office does the job for them. The Family Assistance Office will continue on, and handle the payroll issues for casual women employees and women who are self-employed. So why could you not have the Labor government engage the Family Assistance Office to manage the payrolls for women on the Paid Parental Leave scheme right throughout the economy? What a ridiculous way to have gone. The coalition has a superb scheme on the table-it will be world's best practice, but we will have to wait until we are in government to implement it. It will deliver superannuation and it will deliver, in addition to months leave, two weeks for the non-primary carer, who will typically be the father, so he too can engage in those precious first months of the baby's life. It will also include replacement of the primary carer's wage or the minimum wage, whichever is greater, capped at $150,000. Most importantly, to ensure there is no further discrimination against child-bearing age women, the Family Assistance Office will take care of payments under the Paid Parental Leave scheme. We will completely leave that extra burden and red tape and administration cost off the business sector. Many parents and potential parents have said to me just how disappointed they are with the Labor scheme, and I know that they are simply marking time until we are in government and can fix it all. This brings me back to this particular bill, which is part of the horrific series of difficulties that Labor is visiting on working families, particularly women with children and childcare needs. It is going to reduce the childcare rebate by some $270 a year-this is the cap-despite the fact that we all know childcare fees are going to substantially increase under the new quality standards regime. If parents are looking forward to the time when their children go off to school and think that will be a relief in terms of childcare needs, we all know childcare needs continue on in terms of holiday care program needs or afteror before-school care. There is no surprise if I tell you that Labor has just defunded the active community school care programs, which engage 150,000 children across Australia in more than 300 schools. Just when you thought it might have been a relief for you, when the children move from up-to-four-year-old child care into preschool and then into the school system where there might be a better prospect for them that they could afford, no, Labor has made sure that that is also going to be a time of extraordisix nary ongoing difficulty for families who must have that care. It seems that families, particularly families with younger children, are bearing the brunt of this government's failure to manage our economy, its failure to understand that you must get value for money when you throw billions of dollars into something like a frenetic building program aimed at schools in particular and when you throw billions of dollars at something like the Home Insulation Program, which has endangered lives, and has in fact led to four deaths, and put honest workers out of jobs. It is a tragedy think that one part of our community which is hurting most as a consequence of all of that are our families with young children, particularly as they reach out to try and juglegislation. gle their working lives with their family sponsibilities. We want our families to feel secure in where they take their children in their younger years. We want them to access an affordable childcare service but, sadly, this government is making sure there is nothing but chaos and heartbreak. I certainly that this childcare budget measure is illconceived. It only saves $83 million over four years, and when you think about it that is not very much when you are inflicting so much damage and so much distress on so many families.",155
225,Ms REA,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"I rise to support the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Budget Measures) Bill 2010. I acknowledge the comments made by the previous speaker, the member for Murray, in so far as I have never heard a half an hour of such breathtaking hypocrisy in my life. She was a member of a government that sat on the executive benches for 11 years and did absolutely nothing to support working women in this country. We heard a 15-minute diatribe about paid parental leave, which I should remind her was actually voted on yesterday. My understanding is that it was actually supported by the opposition; nonetheless, her disinterest in what is really happening in child care was such that she spent half of her speech attacking the government's Paid Parental Leave scheme on the basis of some hypothetical policy that her leader dreamt up somewhere between other activities, and he used it as a sound bite. He had given it no thought; he had no understanding of the needs of working women, and he certainly had no understanding of a fair and equitable paid parental leave policy. So we had 15 minutes of her attacking someto thing that we have achieved in just under three years and that they had 11 years to implement. But let us get back to the substance of this If you listened to the bit of the re- speech of the member for Murray that referred to child care, you would think that this legislation is a piece of doom and gloom and that it is apparently a sad indictment of the government's approach to child care. I offer a couple of fundamental facts that she did feel not actually acknowledge and some very important principles. The first fact is that we are looking at an implementation of the government's election commitment. We went to the election with a policy of a 50 per cent rebate up to $7½ thousand. Under the previous government it was a 30 per cent rebate with a cap of $4,354. So it means that a significant number of families in this country are far better off under this government's childcare policy. I accept that the measures contained within this legislation do introduce a cap and do put a stop on indexation for four years. It is a saving of $86.3 million. The overall budget that has been delivered by the Rudd government on child care is in excess of $16 billion. The family assistance that is direct support for child care is $14.4 billion. That is an increase of $8 billion over the last four years of the Howard government. So anyone who was a member of that government, who sat on the government benches, and who now gets up to say that this legislation is an indictment of the government-a government that has increased childcare funding by $10 billion on top of theirs-can be nothing more than a hypocrite. What are also really important are the principles under which the Rudd government's childcare policies and legislation have been developed. I believe that in fact the legacy of the first term of this Rudd government will be its commitment to the working families and, in particular, to the working women of this country. We see a $10 billion increase in childcare funding and we see paid parental leave for the first time in this country. No wonder, as the previous speaker said, the workforce participation rates of women of child-bearing age in Australia are abysmal. It is because we have never had a paid parental leave scheme before and we have never had real funding to support families in terms of child care. Eight hundred thousand families benefit from direct assistance through our childcare scheme, through the childcare rebate of 50 per cent with a $7½ thousand cap. I acknowledge that there will be families who will have to pay a bit more on their childcare bills as a result of these measures. It is about three per cent of the families that receive childcare assistance. On average their bills will go up by something like $5 a week. But I would say that the families who are seeking childcare assistance will also understand the current economic contextthe current financial situation that the globe is in, not just Australia-and there will be an acceptance that we are being responsible with our budgeting. I think that if we can find $86 million with a very small but responsible cut which actually honours our election commitment a lot of families will accept that, because they support this government not only halving peak debt but in fact committing to then pay off the debt three years earlier than was first expected. So I think there will be a level of understanding, because I give working families out there in the community much greater credence than the member for Murray does when it comes to understanding the balance between services and the need to be financially responsible. What is also significant about this government's approach to child care is that we do not just talk about child care as babysitting or child care as a support for working women. We have actually said that child care is a valuable and essential part of a child's development in itself. It goes to the fact that early childhood is in the Education portfolio. That is the second prong of our approach to child care. I would say that the Rudd government's approach has actually been visionary, because not only do we put significant dollars into affordability but we put significant dollars into quality. We have said that it is no longer a babysitting service, that it is a fundamental part of a child's development and education and that, whilst we want to support working women and we want to make their contribution to the workforce properly valued and recognised, we also want funding to go to child care as a service that is important for the child itself. So we do seek support for national data collection, for an index which actually gives us the data we need to appreciate how important that service is for a child's development and how it can be improved. We also support the reducing of the staff-to-children ratios. Whilst affordability is fundamentally important, every single working parent knows that if you have confidence in the quality of the centre that your child goes to it makes an enormous difference to you and to the well-being of your family. The pressure and concern as to the quality of the service is taken off your shoulders because you know that your child is enjoying, and learning from, the service that they go to and is not simply there to be babysat while you are working. It is also fundamentally important that the Rudd government has put money into Indigenous early childhood development. We have put money into the home interaction program for disadvantaged children. We have put money into rolling out universal access to early learning, so that by 2013 all Australian children will have access to preschool or kindergarten. What this government is doing with child care is revolutionising it. It is showing that we will put our money where our mouth is when we talk about financial support and assistance for those families who need it. I remind you, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, that we are increasing funding by $10 billion over and above the last four years of the Howard government. On top of that we are acknowledging child care as a fundamental part of a child's development and education. We are actually putting money into the quality of the service that is provided. We are acknowledging the needs of rural and regional Australia. We are acknowledging the needs of disadvantaged children. Debate interrupted. NA",159
226,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Broadband",161
227,Mr FLETCHER,ADJOURNMENT,"Bradfield) (7.30 pm)I rise to speak about the recently released implementation study into the Rudd government's proposed National Broadband Network. That report reveals the huge financial risk to which this project exposes taxpayers. But it also reveals how the National Broadband Network threatens the long standing objective of telecommunications policy in Australia, which is to unleash the power of competition to serve the long-term interests of end users. Competition has delivered significant price reductions. According to the ACCC, in the decade to 2008, average real prices for fixed line services fell by 32.3 per cent, but it now seems that the objective of stimulating competition comes second to building the National Broadband Network. NBN Co. is designed to be the monopoly wholesale supplier with all retail companies purchasing services from that company. This has worrying implications for competition and for end users. For one thing, it could mean that people who today take the basic voice service-a monthly line rental of around $30 for Telstra's most popular home line plus plan-are facing a significant price increase. In fact, the average price is slightly lower than $30; it is around $28. The implementation study on page 268 proposes a wholesale price for a voice-only service of $25 to $30. When you add on to that the extra costs that a retailer will need to incur-including sales and marketing, billing, switching-this implies a retail cost of at least $35 to $40 a month. There is no convincing explanation in the implementation study of how the existing pricing of basic voice services will be maintained in a world where all retailers are supplied by NBN Co. as the monopoly wholesale provider. So a policy designed to deliver high bandwidth services to all may have a nasty side effect: those who do not want such services may be forced to pay more for the basic services they do want. What is more, the implementation study recommends that the wholesale price charged by NBN Co. should increase every year in real terms. This will feed through into rising retail prices, a sharp reversal of the long-term trend of falling prices shown in the ACCC's work which I mentioned earlier. Can we rely upon the government to prevent such price increases? That seems very unlikely, given that the government will be the 100 per cent owner of NBN Co. and will therefore face a severe conflict of interest, because as the owner it will want that company to do well financially and that will conflict with its stated policy objective of stimulating competition in telecommunications. This conflict is not new. It was the desire to resolve such a conflict which was a very significant reason for the Howard government pursuing its policy of privatising Telstra. Now that problem is going to come back again under the Rudd government's NBN policy. We are already seeing that conflict play out with scope creep and efforts to expand the role of NBN Co. This company was supposed to be wholesale only, but legislation introduced into parliament recently would permit it to serve retail customers if the minister authorises that. The long-term market structure implications are equally troubling. By establishing NBN Co. as the dominant player in fixed line telecommunications, the Rudd government will make it harder for competition to flourish. New entrants will be very reluctant to take on a company with generous financial support from government and, even if they do, they face another remarkable recommendation in the implementation study, which is that new entrants should be burdened with an additional impost if they do enter-all designed to protect the position of NBN Co. This is not a set of policy approaches which is likely to maintain the current trend of downward retail prices. It is not in the ests of competition and it is not in the ests of end users. It is a regrettable consequence of an ill-thought-through policy and one which will not serve the interests of communications users in Australia. There are many other aspects of the implementation study which raise similar concerns and Australians are entitled to ask: what is going to be the impact of the National Broadband Network on competition and on pricing for basic services? (Time expired) Schools: Computers",161
228,Mr BRADBURY,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to express my anger at the proposal from the opposition to rip away funding that has been allocated for computers for schools in relation to the digital education revolutionthe computers in schools program. This has been a wonderful program. In my community this has delivered enormous benefits to local students. The first round of computers that were allocated under this program went to those schools which had less than one computer for every eight students. They were the first round of students that received funding under this program. They were given priority because they were the schools that were in greatest need. There were a large number of schools in my electorate that received funding under that first round, which meant that in their schools there was, on a ratio basis, less than one computer for every eight students. As a consequence of the Rudd government's efforts in relation to this policy, we have reduced that ratio right across my electorate to one computer for every two students and we are determined to go all the way to achieve a 1:1 ratio for all students from years 9 to 12 in the various schools in my electorate. I was outraged to see that the opposition has come forward with a proposal to rip away the heart of the digital education interrevolution, the computers in schools prointergram. This will mean some 120,000 kids across Australia will be robbed of their opportunity to have a computer. It will be teleripped away before they even have the opportunity to log on. That is a retrograde step. It will rip away the opportunities that this government has worked so hard to provide. What will that mean in my local community? I think it is important that each and every school in my community which is to be robbed of these computers knows exactly how many computers it is going to miss out on. Penrith Christian School will miss out on 23 computers; St Paul's Grammar School, 60 computers; Nepean District Christian School, five computers; Penrith Anglican College, 44 computers; Wollemi College, three computers; St Dominic's College, 82 computers; Caroline Chisholm College, 72 computers; MCCarthy Catholic College, 64 computers; Xavier College, 57 computers; Colyton High School, 60 computers; Chifley College Dunheved, 28 Computers; St Mary's Senior High School, 102 computers; Cambridge Park High, 40 computers; Kingswood High, 58 computers; Nepean High, 41 computers; Penrith High, 72 computers; Cranebrook High, 62 computers; Kurrambee School, seven computers or their equivalentKurumbee is a special school; Glenmore Park High, 54 computers; Jamison High School, 73 computers; and Putland School, six computers. After 3,000 computers have been delivered in my electorate, we now have a situation where every one of those schools I have just listed will have those computers taken away. The funding will be taken away before the students even get the opportunity to log on. This is a disgrace. I do not yet have an opponent running against me in my electorate, but I am determined to make sure that every parent and student at these schools knows what a travesty they are being subjected to. Money that has already been allocated to provide funding for computers in their school will be ripped away if there is a change of government, as those on the other side propose, and that would be a backward step. As I said, we have already made such great gains in my local community. There were so many schools that could not even meet that ratio of one computer to eight students, and we have made the massive improvement of now achieving a ratio of at least one computer for every two students. We need to go further. We need to make sure that every student between years 9 and 12 has a computer. That is the commitment that we made at the last election. I hear a lot from those on the other side about the failure of the government to deliver on its commitments. We have delivered on this commitment, and we will deliver on it in full by the time that we set. But the most significant threat to that is the intervention of an election and the possibility that people might be left with an Abbott government, which will rip away that funding and deprive people in my electorate. (Time expired) Maranoa Electorate: Blackbutt-Benarkin Postcode",162
229,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise in this parliament to bring to the attention of this government an issue that is plaguing the people of Blackbutt and Benarkin at the eastern end of my electorate of Maranoa. In fact, Blackbutt and Benarkin are in the region of the South Burnett. The issue is their postcode. It may sound minor, but it is causing major problems, which I will outline to the House. The BlackbuttBenarkin region is a small rural area of maybe 1,000 people, and it has been given the same postcode as the city of Ipswich, which has around 150,000 people and is about 130 kilometres south of Blackbutt. Because of the four numbers of their postcode-4306-the people of the region have serious problems getting a fair deal for their insurance, with employment arrangements and even when using the internet to find local providers or services. A Blackbutt constituent came into my office just yesterday because this postcode issue is making it difficult for him to retain employees. He and his wife run a horticultural farming enterprise. They employ six to 10 backpackers, as well as locals, to help run their business. The backpackers are on 12month visas and some want to stay, but to do this they must be considered to be working in a rural area. However, because Blackbutt has the same postcode as Ipswich, it is considered to be part of a metropolitan area and therefore these backpackers cannot stay. Another employer from Benarkin visited me. Because of the postcode, he was entitled only to a $1,500 apprenticeship payment, not a $4,000 payment from the federal government's apprentice employment incentives program. We have had numerous complaints about how the postcode has pushed up insurance premiums because Blackbutt's perceived level of risk is associated with the much larger city of Ipswich, with which Blackbutt and Benarkin share the same postcode. Blackbutt and Benarkin locals have to use Yarraman's postcode to get accurate data on things like Elders' weather website or when searching the internet to find a local business. Yarraman is about a 15-minute drive from Blackbutt. Its postcode is 4614. Blackbutt's is 4306, which is the same as that of Ipswich. Australia Post has said that insurance companies, which base their policies on postcodes, are to blame for BlackbuttBenarkin's plight. It says it will only change a postcode if there is a significant benefit to the processing and delivery of mail. So, in essence, Australia Post says it is not its lem. It recommended that residents talk directly with their insurers. So, on behalf of my constituents, I wrote to the Banking and Financial Services Ombudsman. I was told that the issue was beyond the powers of the ombudsman to investigate. I then wrote to the Insurance Council of Australia. Their best advice: ask your constituents to shop around for a competitive insurance product. Not wanting to give up, I then wrote to the ACCC explaining that it was unfair that people in a small rural area should be lumped in with the people of a large city 130 kilometres away. The ACCC responded with a friendly letter that basically told me I had no chance of getting the postcode changed through their channels. I have exhausted almost every possibility to try to get the problem rectified. I am calling on the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy to intervene. I will be submitting a private member's motion. However, I wanted to bring this issue to the attention of this parliament now because I am not sure for how much longer we will be in this place before an election. I will also be writing to the minister in a lastditch attempt to get a fairer go for the people of Blackbutt and Benarkin and the many other communities such as Bedourie and Yaraka in very remote parts of my electorate of Maranoa which are experiencing the same difficulties with their postcode. The same issues affect them as affect Blackbutt and Benarkin. Deakin Electorate: Volunteers",163
230,Mr SYMON,ADJOURNMENT,"Deakin) (7.45 pm)Volunteers make a significant contribution to our community in so many different ways. Many services that our community relies upon would just not be there if it were not for volunteers, who take the time out of their busy lives to help other people. In my elecprobtorate of Deakin we have numerous organisations that are reliant upon a band of committed volunteers. Recently, as part of National Volunteer Week, I contacted each of these groups asking if I could provide volunteers with a special certificate and, where possible, I have personally handed out many of the certificates. It is important that people receive recognition for all their work; it helps for them to know how appreciated their efforts are. When I visit local community organisations I am always so impressed with the passion and commitment shown by local volunteers, who just love what they are doing. In all, I have prepared more than 500 individual certificates for local volunteers, thanking them for all their work and recognising their importance to everyone in our community. I am very happy to be part of recognising their efforts. On 20 May I visited the Lionsbrae agedcare facility in Ringwood East, where at a ceremony I presented certificates to 25 volunteers to personally thank them for their efforts. Volunteers at Lionsbrae perform a large range of duties, assisting people in community housing and serving meals to people in the associated soup kitchen. Volunteers facilitate a quilting program, manage the newly opened Men's Shed, drive the bus and provide tutoring in computing, and a local schoolteacher helps residents who need assistance to continue their education. Volunteers awarded the certificates at Lionsbrae include: Pat Banner, Rose Spada, Edward Wilkinson, Colin Turpee, Lyn Milewczyk, Greg Lacey, Grant Moss, June Wells, Geraldine Joseph, Bob Donsen, Pam Myers, Barb Moss, Julie Groves, Margaret Curmi, Patricia Hird, Christine Grace, Grant Moss, Sue Breese, Dennis Kay, Pam Richards, Lesley Cooper, Margaret Downes, Bill Port, Beryl Port, Helen Maywald, Coral Boyle, Tony Christodoulou and Peter Middleton. This is just one example of what volunteers contribute to a local organisation. Red Cross emergency first aid volunteers were active during the 2009 bushfires in Victoria helping to support those who had lost so much. Many of the local groups in my area travelled to those fire affected areas for long periods of time. Heathmont Scout Group volunteers are refurbishing a water tower and turning it into an abseiling tower for the local scouting group. Pope Road Kindergarten in Blackburn has a wonderful band of volunteers who form the committee and do all the hard, ongoing, grinding work that is needed to keep a local kinder operating. Certificates have been presented to: Rhonda Allen, Megan Kneebone, Danielle Johnson, Susan Werner, Justin Whitehead, Danny Lee, Vicki Carroll, Marissa Sprout, Nickie Scriven, Natalie Zaibak, Jo MCKenzie and Justine Mansell. At Meals on Wheels, volunteers Kevin Southey and Margaret Keert have received volunteer certificates of recognition. Margaret has been volunteering with Meals on Wheels for over 30 years. Volunteering delivers amazing local outcomes and nationally it also makes a huge impact. According to the most recent available data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in 2006-07 the estimated value of volunteer time was $14.6 billion. The federal government is aware of the importance of volunteering and provides volunteer grants to assist local organisations train and support volunteers. In last year's volunteer grants round, over $160,000 was granted to local volunteer and community organisations in my electorate of Deakin. Those grants went towards purchasing small equipment such as computers, shade sails, air-conditioners and tools, as well to cover the cost of training and petrol. These grants make a huge difference to the organisations, as they provide extra resources to support the efforts of volunteers who are giving up their time. I wish to commend the efforts of all the local volunteers not only in Deakin but right across Australia. Without their commitment, dedication and passion for what they are doing, so many people would miss out. I am glad to have been able to play my part in making sure those efforts do not go unrecognised. I congratulate the federal government on helping volunteer organisations and I look forward to the distribution of the next round of volunteer grants and seeing the impact at the local level of this investment. Herbert Electorate: Kirwan State High School",164
231,Mr LINDSAY,ADJOURNMENT,"Herbert) (7.50 pm)Kirwan State High School has done it again! Last week the school continued its tradition of outstanding musical entertainment with an astonishingly good production of The Pirates of Penzance. All performances deservedly received standing ovations from enthusiastic audiences. This was the best school production that I have ever attended-and I have seen many. It was an ambitious production, but the school pulled it off-and then some. Reminiscent of the Simon Gallaher and Jon English production of the mid-90s, these high school students wowed audiences for each of their three performances. There were always three areas which needed to be tackled to make this show such a success-firstly, the comedy. Gilbert and Sullivan is no easy task and requires innovative staging and phenomenal acting, both of which Kirwan provided. The cast were so very believable in their respective roles and all played the part as well as any seasoned Broadway actor. Secondly, there is the music. The music in Pirates is challenging for many reasons. Whether it be the operatic range it requires of the lead female, Mabel, or the tricky harmonies of the three sisters and the chorus, or just the sheer tempo of the Major-General's song, it was obvious on the night that the kids had rehearsed relentlessly. Coupled with a fantastic orchestra made up of teachers, ex-students and students, Kirwan musically delivered the production. Finally, there is the cast itself. With around 100 students from ages 13 to 17 in the cast, it was amazing that the stage never seemed too crowded or busy. It is also important to note that I think no student ever felt insignificant in the cast, with everyone taking on the role of a daughter, pirate or police officer with great conviction. The Kirwan High tradition was established in 1984; 23 shows later, young second-year drama teacher Daniel Last has excelled in his first job as director with an standing production of Pirates. The chief architect of the show was Andrew Higgins, a maths teacher and year 12 coordinator, who has now produced a show for Kirwan High annually for the last 13 years. Andrew was ably assisted by vocal director and teacher Suellen Johns, who was a Kirwan High student herself in 1996. Musical director and Head of the Arts at Kirwan High, Dale Hosking, is also a Kirwan High graduate from 2000. Of course a great show like Pirates needs a great choreographer. Dance teacher Chris Davis did this job to perfection. Many parents also supported the production. Anne Sperring's son Adam was in Dazzle in 1998. She became involved in hair, make-up and costumes and has continued every year since. Her last child Rebecca graduates at the end of this year. Her contribution every Sunday for three months of the year epitomises the contribution of many parent supporters. Pirates of Penzance provided the perfect vehicle for outstanding student talent. It was led by superb soprano Samantha Coleman whose pure voice was perfect for the role of Mabel. Debonair Matthew Ritchie was charismatic as Frederick while Eli Thaiday, a young Torres Strait Islander man whose brother Sam has made a name playing for the Broncos, was a swashbuckling Pirate King. No-one in the audience will forget his chest! The comical James Gilbert played the eccentric Major General role to perfection while Tula Clutterbuck was a feisty Ruth. It is rare for the actors, music, dance, lighting, set and costumes to complement one another to produce such an outstanding result. This was a great testament to just how good state schools can be and it inspires confidence in our youth and our future. After the show a parent of one of the students proudly said this: From a parent's point of view, our son put in outhours and hours night and day-before school, after school, sometimes all day. All the kids did, and it was just an extraordinary effort by all of them. Just talking to our kids after the show, it was one of those productions where the people who played the characters made them their own. And the ability to draw the entire auditorium, the entire theatre, into the show was extraordinary. Even the band was included in the stage theatre, which was really quite amazing. It was a one in a million production, and a one in a million experience for the kids. Tops to the teachers and tops to the students, Pirates of Penzance was a production which reinforced the fact that music is a language which breaks all barriers, bringing students from all demographics to participate, and brought anyone who saw the show to a sidesplitting chuckle! Well done, Kirwan High! Australian Patents",165
232,Ms JACKSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Hasluck) (7.54 pm)When I was previously in the parliament I had the good fortune to become acquainted with local couple Bruce and Bronwyn MCDougall. They operate a small family business in Kenwick in my electorate called Uggs-N-Rugs, which has manufactured and distributed ugg boots for more than 30 years. The story, as you may recall, Madam Deputy Speaker, was that two days before Christmas 2003 they, along with most of Australia's ugg boot manufacturers, were threatened with legal action by US corporation Deckers Outdoor Corporation for calling their products uggs or ugg boots. Deckers had acquired an Australian company, Ugg Holdings, in 1995 and its trademark. This put huge pressure on many small businesses throughout Australia that manufacture ugg boots. Indeed, the threats went to all manner of legal action being taken against them. I am pleased to say that Bruce and Bronwyn retaliated and took on the legal fightvery much a David and Goliath struggleand some three years later they won. On 16 January 2006 the Australian trademark office handed down a decision that the words ‘ugg', ‘ugg boots' and ‘ugh-boots', all spelt just differently, were all interchangeable and the evidence showed that overwhelmingly the words were common generic terms for sheepskin boots in Australia. So in Australia we can still call them uggs. Deckers corporation had the right to appeal that decision by the Australian trademark office, but chose not to do so. Imagine my dismay when I received an email from Bruce and Bronwyn MCDougall this week that Deckers ‘were at it again', now seeking to register the trademark for a stand-alone stylised word ‘ugg' in class 25 for and on behalf of their corporation. Many people in the industry and the Australian Sheepskin Association have written to IP Australia protesting against this particular application. I know they have also written to the Minister for Trade. The three-year struggle in Australia had a significant impact on these small businesses. They saw substantial job losses; they saw a downturn in their trading and their business turnover, especially with the internet trade becoming more prevalent. And this has been an increasing and ongoing issue for them as only in Australia are we allowed to refer to these products as ugg boots generically. Deckers still have the trademark in most other countries in the world, and have threatened legal action against people like Paypal and eBay and others who trade on the internet for allowing ugg boots to be sold by and from Australian manufacturers. No matter what IP Australia may think, and I hope they see the light when dealing with this particular application by Deckers Outdoor Corporation, I am convinced that ugg boots are an Aussie icon and it is a generic term that is used for sheepskin boots. I would urge the House and the relevant ministers to support these Aussie battlers throughout Australia. And I want to assure the Australian Sheepskin Association, and in particular Bronwyn and Bruce MCDougall at Uggs-N-Rugs in Kenwick, that I will be there again for this round against Deckers corporation. It is wrong that an organisation like this is able to use its strength and size to try to force an Australian industry out of business, and it is quite wrong for them to be able to have exclusive use to the word ‘ugg' in all countries except Australia. For them to be granted the trademark to the term in Australia would allow a deception to go full circle. I urge people, and I particularly urge the registrar and those who deal with these applications for Australian trademarks, to consider the status of the Federal Court case dealing with the Deckers original application and to consider this iconic Australian industry. They also brought to my attention that Australian trademarks have been granted to foreign parties. A number of companies in China have also been able to trademark the words ‘ugg' and ‘Australia', and this is interfering with the sale of local products here in Australia. This seems to me an extraordinary thing to do, and I urge the minister responsible for IP Australia to consider how this can be possible.
