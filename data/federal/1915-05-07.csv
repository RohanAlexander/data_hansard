1,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It is stated this morning's newspapers that at Executive meeting yesterday it was determined to release certain prisoners were sentenced to terms of penal servitude, by a court martial at Rabaul. Is the newspaper statement' correct, and, if so, will the Acting Prime Minister tell the House why the men are to be released, and lay on the table the papers connected with the case?",4
2,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"An Executive warrant for the release of the persons referred to was granted yesterday. The matter falls within the province of the Minister of Defenco, but I know of no reason why the papers connected with the case should not be laid on the table of the House, and I shall see that that is done.",4
3,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Has the Assistant Minister of Defence seen the statement in today's newspapers that a young man was about to be sentenced for housebreaking when his lawyer asked that he might be allowed to go free, as be intended to join the Defence Forces ? If such a request was made will not the Defence Department raise an indignant protest against anything of the kind being done?",4
4,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,I have not seen the report referred to. It is for the Minister to deal with these matters. I do not think that he will encourage the course suggested.,4
5,Mr WEST,Unknown,"It has been stated in the press that in the case of casualties affecting officers the news would be conveyed to relatives through some suitable channel,, preferably through a clergyman, but that in the case of the rank and file it would be conveyed direct by telegraph or by special messenger. Is it intended to make an invidious distinction between officers and men in the sending of news of casualties to their relatives? If so, will the Assistant Minister say what is the reason for the making of such a distinction J",4
6,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"When the Department receives news of the deaths of officers or of privates the Commandant of the State from which the soldiers came is at once informed, and he ascertains the religious belief of those concerned, and asks the clergyman of the denomination to which they belonged, in the town or district nearest to where the relatives aro living, to inform them of the event, so that the N news may be conveyed to them as considerately as possible. In the case of in wounded men the news is telegraphed an direct to the nearest relative.",4
7,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"In reply to a question who asked by the honourable member for Perth regarding postage on newspapers to members of the Australian Expeditionary Forces in Egypt, I desire to inform the House that I Iiave cabled to the Britisli Postmaster-General asking him to make arrangements with the authorities of Egypt, if possible, so that the same rates of postage on newspapers will apply to Egypt as apply between Australia and the United Kingdom; that is, a ship rate of Id. ner 16 ounces.",4
8,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"There has just been handed to honourable members a printed newspaper slip detailing a statement made by Mr Asquith in the House - of Commons, I presume yesterday, concerning the operations of the Australian and other troops, particularly in the Dardanelles. Would it be possible to obtain similar information for presentation to this House a little earlier than is now the - case ? Twelve days have elapsed since the incidents referred to occurred; and we now learn of them for the first time from the mouth of the Prime Minister in the House of Commons yesterday. I am makiug no sort of complaint, nor do I desire to do anything to interfere with the successful carrying out of strategical operations in that part of the world. It occurs to me, however, that during the twelve days the Minister of Defence might have obtained a similar statement for communication to the House, at least as early as that made in the House of Commons by Mr . Asquith. I suggest that thab might be done in the future, so that we may receivo earlier information as to what is actually taking place.",5
9,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I think I ought to in form the House that yesterday I despatched a cable on behalf of the Government, pointing out how very keenly in terested the Australian public is in the campaign, particularly that part in which the Australians are engaged. I urged, practically in the terms, and for the reasons used by the Leader of the Opposition, thab efforts should be made to have such news sent to us at the earliest possible moment. I pressed the matter very strongly, and I have no doubt the I m perial Governmenb will permit the news to come tlirougli with more expedition. MINISTERIALCRITICISM OF MR . office.",5
10,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I ask the Minister of Home Affairs whether the statements in this morning's Argus are a correct report of utterances concerning Mr Griffin's work made by him to . » representative of that journal ?,5
11,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"As I have not seen this morning's Argus, I do not know what is in it .",5
12,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I shall hand the Minister a copy of the newspaper, so that he may give me a reply later. NEUTRALITY OF BELGIUM. AMERICA'S POSITION .",5
13,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Will the Acting Prime Minister ascertain whether America was a party to the treaty which guaranteed the neutrality of Belgium ? ExPresident Roosevelt and other American public men have made conflicting statements on the subject, which leave us, in Australia, in considerable doubt as to the true position of America in the matter. A statement from the honourable gentleman would have the effect of clearing away any misunderstanding.",5
14,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I shall ascertain the parties to the pact for the maintenance of the neutrality of Belgium and give the information to the House. SHORTAGE OF SUGAR.,5
15,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"As there is likely to be a shortage of sugar in Australia, I ask the Minister of Trade and Customs if the Government has power to act on lines similar to tliose followed by the British Government in purchasing sugar for the nation. If it has not that power, will it get into touch with the Premiers of the States, and co-operate with them in providing sugar at reasonable rates for the inhabitants of Australia?",5
16,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I do not think that we have the same power as the British Government possesses in regard to the purchase and distribution of supplies.,5
17,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Remov e the duty, and there will be plenty of sugar.",5
18,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I do not think that the duty affects the position.,5
19,Sir JOHN FORKEST,Unknown,Exportatio n can be stopped.,5
20,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"It was stopped within twenty-four hours of our coming into  ment purchase the necessary sugar, and allow the Governments of the States to distribute it?",5
21,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I shall have the matter inquired into. Several questions have been asked on the subject.,6
22,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Surely the States can look after their own people.,6
23,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The matter is a diffireflect cult one to deal with. We are all anxious that the. consumer should not be penwhat alized by having to pay too much for sugar, and if anything can be done prevent that this Government will do i",6
24,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"In the event of the Government purchasing black-grown sngar to sell to the people of Australia, w i l see that the white sugar-growers of Ausand tralia are not placed at a disadvantage?",6
25,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The Excise and bounty on sugar having been abolished, there is now no distinction in Australia between black and white-grown sugar. The Excise such action. and bounty were abolished by the Government of which my honourable friend buy the fodder. was Whip.",6
26,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,My question referred importation.,6
27,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"As we do not make any distinction within Australia, difficult to make any outside Australia.",6
28,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Will the Minister Trade and Customs say whether, in his reference to the abolition by the previous Government of the Excise and bounty sugar, he intended to convey a desire to dissociate himself and the present Goof vernment from that action; if so, does he propose to reimpose the duties of Excise and the bounty ?",6
29,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"If the Government had any intention of reimposing any duty is rising ? they would not be so unwise as to give notice of the fact. There is no differenthe tiation in Australia between sugar grown by black and white labour, and the action which the previous Government took, would, I believe, be taken by any other Government. SHORTAG E OF FODDER.",6
30,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"I ask the Acting member desires. Prime Minister if action is being taken at the Premiers' Conference by the Comthing monwealth Government, in concert with the Governments of the States, to deal with the fodder famine that now rages in themselves. Australia. The States are not handling the matter rightly.",6
31,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"If the honourable member will put his question on the notice-paper, I shall endeavour to answer it.",6
32,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,The Conference will have concluded its sittings before that can be done.,6
33,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"1 ought not to be asked to give an answer which might on the action of the States without having an opportunity to inquire the States are doing in this matter.  to of the honourable member for Wannon as t . to the ineffectiveness of the steps taken by some of the State Governments for supplying fodder to the starving stock of l he Australia, will the Minister of Trade and Customs take into consideration the purchasing of fodder for the relief of the agriculturists and pastoralists ?",6
34,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I do not think the Commonwealth has the power to take ,6
35,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"We could buy the fodto der outside Australia and bring it into the Commonwealth, but I do not think the Constitution gives us the power toi t would be deal in the commodity.",6
36,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"The free interchange of of fodder between the various States having been practically prohibited by the actions of the State Governments, will the on Acting Prime Minister confer with the States with a view to the purchase abroad any shortage of fodder and its sale todistressed persons at a rate below the imported price, so that common-sense actionmay be taken to save the stock of the country from dying while the public debt",6
37,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"This matter is one of greatest possible importance, and I will go so far as to promise to communicate with the Prime Minister, who is attending the Premiers' Conference, and ask him to confer with the Premiers in regard to the honourable member's suggestion. In that way more than any other shall we be likely to achieve what the honourable The Commonwealth Government will be very glad to do anywithin their power to assist the pastoralists and others on the land in the very great difficulties in which they find",6
38,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Would I be in order, Mr Speaker, in asking a question of the honourable member for Wannon?",6
39,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"An honourable member can only question another honourable member if his question relates to business before the Chamber. If I were to allow questions to be put from one private member to another private member, I am afraid there would be endless chaos in our proceedings.",6
40,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"My question is this: In view of the honourable member's suggestion regarding the assistance of agriculturists by the importation and sale of fodder by the Commonwealth, will the honourable member for Wannon be prepared to support an amendment of the Constitution to give the Commonwealth power to take such action!",7
41,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! A question of that nature cannot be asked, and I appeal to honourable members not to put such questions to one another. STATE BORROWING .",7
42,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Following on the question yesterday regarding the agreement between the Premiers and the Prime Minister concerning State borrowing, is the Acting Prime Minister now able to make available to honourable members a copy of that agreement, and to have it printed, so that they may' have ready access* to it ?",7
43,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Yesterday I communicated with the Prime Minister on the subject, and have now before me the original memorandum of agreement which was entered into on the 5th November, 1914, between the Prime Minister on behalf of the Commonwealth, and the Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania on behalf of their respective States. By that instrument the Commonweatlh agreed to lend to the States a sum aggregating £18,000,000, and the States engaged not to borrow otherwise during a period of twelve months from the date of the agreement except for renewals of existing loans falling due. It was arranged, however, that the States might sell Treasury bonds over the counter to an amount not exceeding the sales in a normal year. I cannot allow the document to go out of the possession of the Department, but any honourable member may have access to it .",7
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is the document signed ?,7
45,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Certainly ; by Andrew Fisher, W . A . Holman, Alexander Peacock, Henry Peake, J. Scaddan, and J. Owen.",7
46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Evidentl y it is only a "" scrap of paper."" Will the At torney-General have that document printed ?",7
47,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I shall communicate with the Prime Minister, and subject to his approval I shall have the document printed, if the right honourable member wishes that to be done. NA AUSTRALIA .",7
48,Mr BOYD,DREDGER FOR WESTERN,Can the Assistant M in ister of .Defence inform the House what progress the dredger which is being sent from Melbourne to Western Australia has made ?,7
49,Mr JENSEN,DREDGER FOR WESTERN,"So far as I know the vessel referred to is making splendid progress. The last information I received was that the dredger and a steamhopper barge were off Cape Leeuwih,. which is not a great distance from Fremantle. ASSISTANC E TO MAIL . CONTRACTORS.  ment made by the Attorney-General! that the Government are anxious to assist the pastoralists, graziers, and! farmers in connection with the scarcity of fodder, I wish to ask the PostmasterGsneral whether he will reconsider his decision with regard to mail contractors, and either allow them to terminate their contracts and release the sureties, or meet the difficulty by placing on the Estimates' a sum to assist deserving casss ?",7
50,Mr SPENCE,DREDGER FOR WESTERN,"That matter .is under consideration. I am now'getting furtherinformation before coming to a final, decision. NA CAPITAL.",7
51,Mr JH CATTS,WORKS AT THE FEDERAL,"As tliere is aconsiderable amount of dissatisfaction in regard to the slow progress of the works= at the Federal Capital, will the Minisber of Home Affairs make a statement to the House as to the actual works in progressand the number of men employed?",7
52,Mr ARCHIBALD,WORKS AT THE FEDERAL,If the honourable member will place a question on thenotice-paper I will supply the informa tion next week. NA PEDERA L TERRITORY.,7
53,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,LAND RESUMPTION IN TH E,"In view of the fact that during the last month three small land-holders have been forced into ruinous litigation in the High Court in connection with land resumption in the Federal Territory, will the Minister of Home Affairs endeavour to have established some system of arbitration in connection with f u t u r e resumptions?",8
54,Mr ARCHIBALD,LAND RESUMPTION IN TH E,"I should like any question relating to the three cases mentioned to be placed on the. notice paper; but, so far as concerns the general question, I will look into the inatter of establishing a system of arbitration for future resumptions. SEDITIOU SNEWSPAPERARTICLE . cient",8
55,Mr WATT,LAND RESUMPTION IN TH E,"Has the attention of the Attorney-General been directed to the issue of a paper called the Woman Voter, published in this State, and dated the 4th May, in which appeared an article purporting to be signed by a woman by the name of Adela Pankhurst",8
56,Dr MALONEY,LAND RESUMPTION IN TH E,"A lady, if you please!",8
57,Mr WATT,LAND RESUMPTION IN TH E,"A woman. The article is of a very inflammatory and seditious character. If the Attorney-General's attention has not been called to the matter, will he examine the paper with a view to preventing the repetition of any such dangerous nonsense at the present time?",8
58,Mr HUGHES,LAND RESUMPTION IN TH E,"I have not seen the article referred to. I have certainly heard of the name of Pankhurst, but as I have never been struck by the lady, I"" have no knowledge of what she has written or said! If she has written anything to which the honourable member takes exception-and I can quite understand she would- I shall be glad to have my attention drawn to it .",8
59,Mr WATT,LAND RESUMPTION IN TH E,"Would I be in order, Mr Speaker, in directing attention to some passages of the article to which I have referred?",8
60,Mr SPEAKER,LAND RESUMPTION IN TH E,"I am not aware of the nature of the article which the honourable member desires to quote. I desire to assist honourable members as far as possible in eliciting information by way of questions, but if I allow certain newspaper extracts to be read, I do not see how I shall be able to prevent the reading of a whole leading article. I think it would be preferable for the honourable member to submit the article inquestion to the Attorney-General.",8
61,Mr KING OMALLEY,LAND RESUMPTION IN TH E,"Will , the Attorney-General have a Committee of this House appointed to have that "" s is t e r "" investigated?",8
62,Mr HUGHES,LAND RESUMPTION IN TH E,"I can only say that, if I d'o appoint any such Committee, I shall make the' honourable member its. chairman. SMELTING INDUSTRY.",8
63,Mr SAMPSON,LAND RESUMPTION IN TH E,"Has the attention of the Attorney-General been drawn to a statement in the newspaper cables that the British Treasury has refused to allow the Broken, Hill Company to raise sufficapital for the further development of the zinc-smelting industry in Australia? Can the honourable gentleman say whether this refusal, on behalf of the British Government, has any reference to the legislation now before this House in connection with the breaking or otherwise of contracts?",8
64,Mr HUGHES,LAND RESUMPTION IN TH E,"I did notice the ""paragraph, and I apprehend that it has reference to the general prohibition issued some time ago in regard to new flotations. No doubt there is a very excellent reason why there should be some generalized control over newflotations at the present time. It would hardly, I think, be proper for us to protest in. this matter. The question, no doubt, was raised by the measure introduced last evening, but the manner in which capital is to be obtained is a matter with which we are not concerned. In the circumstances, I can hardly think it necessary, or even proper, to take any steps towards communicating iwith the British Government. Mr SAMPSON"" - Perhaps I might be allowed to make my question a little clearer. What I desire to know is whether the Government are in a position to give us any information indicating that this action on the part of the British Government has any reference to impending legislation here in connection with contracts ?",8
65,Mr HUGHES,LAND RESUMPTION IN TH E,"We have no information that this action is other than the effect of the general prohibition in regard to new flotations. We have no special information in reference to the matter. I NTER - STA TE COMMISSION AND STANDING COMMITTEES. PRINTINGA ND CIRCULATION . Mr SPEAKER , - T h o honourable member for Illawarra yesterday asked me whether it would not be possible to have the reports of the Inter-State Commission bound for issue to honourable members. These reports, I may point out, .aro coming in day after day, and to have each one bound separately for each honourable member would involve a considerable expense.",8
66,Mr BURNS,LAND RESUMPTION IN TH E,My suggestion was that the whole of the reports should be bound in one volume.,9
67,Mr SPEAKER,LAND RESUMPTION IN TH E,"Of course, any honourable member who desires can have these reports bound, much in the same way as the Estimates are now bound.",9
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LAND RESUMPTION IN TH E,Would it not possible to have some sort of file provided on which honourable members could keep these reports?,9
69,Mr SPEAKER,LAND RESUMPTION IN TH E,"There is some little difficulty about the filing of Bills and other documents at the present time. A. file of Bills is provided for each honourable member; but I notice that, as a rule, honourable members content themselves with the Bills that are laid upon the table, and scarcely use their files. My own opinion is that it would be better to do away with these Bill files altogether, and rely upon the Bills placed on the table. Th'is would have the advantage, at any rate, of saving considerable trouble .and cost in printing. As to the reports of the Inter-State Commission, I shall see whether some arrangement can be made for their filing. Yesterday the honourable .member for Cook asked me a question concerning the reports laid on the table by the Public Works Committee, and suggested that there were certain plans and other documents that should have been attached to the reports; but even if that - be so, we here officially know nothing about them. It is for the Public Works Gommittee to take the necessary steps - to have such maps and documents made available.",9
70,Mr JH CATTS,LAND RESUMPTION IN TH E,"I should like to know whether, when it is proposed to print a rejjort of the Public Works Committee, it would be in order for an honourable member to examine it before the REPORTS OF House orders it to be printed, and move for the inclusion of any maps or documents that might be necessary to make it intelligible ?",9
71,Mr SPEAKER,LAND RESUMPTION IN TH E,"When a report is submitted by the Public Works Committee, the question is put that it be printed, and on that question there may be debate, in the course of which any honourable member can make what suggestions or complaints he chooses. Indeed, an 1 honourable member could go so fa r as to move that the report be referred back to the Committee.",9
72,Mr WEST,LAND RESUMPTION IN TH E,"As a matter of procedure, I should like to know whether, when it is proposed to refer certain works to the Public Works Committee, an honourable member may discuss the question and raise objections to the works being so referred ? Unless there is liberty of discussion in this regard, works may be quite be - unnecessarily referred to the Committee.",9
73,Mr SPEAKER,LAND RESUMPTION IN TH E,I am afraid the honourable member will have to leave that matter to be decided when the question arises. He is placing a hypothetical case before me on which I cannot express an opinion.,9
74,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LAND RESUMPTION IN TH E,"I should like to have the matter raised by the honourable member for Cook cleared up a little. Do I understand that it is not considered to be obligatory on the part of the Government to p r i nt whatever plans are presented to this House with reports? It can readily be understood that a report, without plans and so for t h, might be quite unintelligible.",9
75,Mr SPEAKER,LAND RESUMPTION IN TH E,"The reports are printed as laid on the table by the Public Works Committee, and we can do no more. If there are other papers connected therewith, we know nothing about them officially. It is for the Public Works Committee to present plans aud so for t h with their reports, and we can p r i nt only those papers that the House orders, to be printed. Mr BRU CE SMITH - Is it not a r u le that the Minister under whose control the Public Works Committee is shall move thab the papers be printed ? Is it not his duty to see that the report he is asking leave to print is a complete report, including plans?",9
76,Mr SPEAKER,LAND RESUMPTION IN TH E,"The - Government have nothing whatever to do with the matter. The Public Works Committee were appointed by this House to inquire. into certain niatters referred to them by tihe House, and when they present a report, and the motion is made that it be printed, I merely put the question. The inatter is then open for debate.",9
77,Mr BRUCE SMITH,LAND RESUMPTION IN TH E,"I can only say that in the case of the New South Wales Government, a Minister alwaj's moves that the report be printed, inasmuch as, while the presenting of the report is a matter for the Committee, the printing of it is a Government matter.",10
78,Mr SPEAKER,LAND RESUMPTION IN TH E,"As a matter of fact, the reports of the Public Works Committee are actually in print before they are presented here, and the motion to prin t is a formal matter.",10
79,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LAND RESUMPTION IN TH E,"I suggest that you, Mr Speaker, should make inquiries and ascertain precisely the procedure that is adopted in the two large States where similar Committees are already in operaMinister, tion.",10
80,Mr SPEAKER,LAND RESUMPTION IN TH E,I shall make inquiries. NA IRREGULARITIES.,10
81,Sir JOHN FORREST,ALLEGEDELECTOR AL,"the Minisprevent ter of Home Affairs, upon notice I. What steps have been taken by the Elecjected toral Department in regard to the 3,405 voters who appear to have voted more than once the general election on 5th September, 1914? 2. In regard to absent voters who voted more than once, bas a comparison of signatures disclosed fraud, and, if so, what action taken? 3. Will ho place any reports that have received on the tablet 4. Does the Chief Electoral Officer, by reply given on 30th ult., intend to infer that there was no intentional double voting? ' Mr ARCHIBALD - The answers to the honourable member's questions are1, 2, and 3. It is not proposed to enter into 200 further inquiries for the reason given in the beingcan report tabled on the 30th ult., and because terfereonly experience shows that such inquiries produce tinued at no practical results. 4. There is no evidence of intentional double voting except in two of the cases referred my reply to the right honourable member on 30th ult. '.rhe number of cases in which names were marked more than once on the certified lists voters used at the 1914 elections is below that which in the light of experience might have been expected to have resulted from error misunderstanding.",10
82,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALLEGEDELECTOR AL,It seems we have the only perfect system.,10
83,Mr ARCHIBALD,ALLEGEDELECTOR AL,We have a remarkably good and clean system. SYDNEY PARCELS OFFICE .,10
84,Mr FENTON,ALLEGEDELECTOR AL,"for Mr CARE) asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice Whether it is a fact that, owing to many officials having gone to the war, the staff at the head parcels office, Sydney, is short banded, and, as a result, the men are overworked and their effectiveness is impaired?",10
85,Mr SPENCE,ALLEGEDELECTOR AL,"The Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, reports that the staff referred to is not short handed, and that the officers are not working overtime; on the contrary they are working undertime EXPEDITIONARY FORCES. MEDICAL INSPECTION.",10
86,Mr ATKINSON,ALLEGEDELECTOR AL,"the Assistant representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. Is it a fact that at the late medical examination of the Forces at Broadmeadows n number of men were rejected for defects that should have been noticed at the examination to which they were subjected when enlisting? 2. If so, is the Minister taking action to a recurrence of such a state of affairs in the future, and to spare those concerned the humiliation and disappointment of being reat the last moment, and save the country from the monetary loss involved in training at men who should never have been allowed to enlist ?",10
87,Mr JENSEN,ALLEGEDELECTOR AL,"The answers to the has been honourable member's questions are1. At present no men have been discharged been as result of medical inspection at Broadmeadows on Saturday, 1st May, 1915. The the examination was a very strict preliminary inspection, and 667 men were referred, as a result of the inspection, to a Medical Board. They found that in many cases-abou t 350the defects were very slight, and such men have been allowed to rejoin their regiments. Of the remainder, it is estimated that abont be treated and made fit-their state temporary. Treatment will not in with their training, which can be conBroadmeadows. Of the remainder, many were found who appeared to have never been medically examined; to in for instance, several who were supposed to the have been measured by members of the Permanent Staff were 2 inches under height, and when questioned as to where they were passed of mentioned the depdt where no medical examination had taken place. Others had very marked and gross conditions, such as large hernia, or bad varicose veins, and deformed feet. In addition to such cases, a considerable number of young recruits showed evidence of fatigue, and it was not considered likely they would stand the strain of active service. 2. Arrangements have beeu made in all States that only the most experienced medical omcers are to examine recruits, nnd that all recruits from country districts are to be re-examined by these omcers before going into camp. Steps have been taken which it is hoped will eliminate as far as possible cases of impersonation. DEFENCE DEPARTMENT: BUSINESS ADMINISTRATIO N.",10
88,Mr BRUCESMITH,ALLEGEDELECTOR AL,"the Assist a n t Minisber, representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. Whether steps are being taken in the Defence Department to alter its business administration in the directions to which Mr R. M . Anderson's recent report has drawn attention ? 2. If there are any portions of that commissioner's suggestions which the Minister does not intend to follow, will Parliament be informed what tliey are, and why tliey are to be disregarded ?",11
89,Mr JENSEN,ALLEGEDELECTOR AL,"T l i e answers to the honourable member's questions are : 1. It is proposed to make such alterations as may be considered advisable in the light of Mr Anderson's report. The great pressure of public business has, however, not enabled the Minister to yet give ful l consideration to the matter to decide what alterations shall be made, and how they are best to be effected. 2. The Minister will, at the proper time, make a statement as to the action to be taken with respect to Mr Anderson's recommendations. MALE TELEPHONISTS.",11
90,Mr JH CATTS,ALLEGEDELECTOR AL,"the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Is it intended by the Department to transfer all male telephonists of twenty-one years of ago to some other position; if this is impracticable, will the Minister make an allowance between the present salary and that to which the Postmaster-General proposes to transfer such officers, until the departmental convenience can bo met by the appointment of additional telephonists to fill their places? 2.

One can understand t h is at t it u d e when one remembers that the externa l t r a d e of the U n it e d 'Kingdo m in 1913-and h a p p i l y it hasbsen affected, comparatively speaking, to only a small e x t e n t by the w a r - to t all e d , 4 0 4 , 1 5 1 , 0 0 0 ; that the t r a d e between A u s t r i a and Germany and the All i e s and A m e r i c at o t all e d about £ 4 2 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , and* that a very large p a r t of that t r a d e wasKNDEAV0US. practicall y commanded by the U n it e d Kingdom. The British E m p i r e has about 26 per cent, of the w o r l d ' s t r a d e . These figures should suggest to us the desirableness of not h u r r i e d l y or, if - I may so put it , b l in d l y in t e r f e r in g w it b contracts t l i at are so d i r e c t ly r e l at ed to our trade that we cannot clearly apprehend all the consequences that must ensue. Let us take another view of the Imperial position. The investors of the United Kingdom receive every year about £200,000,000 from investments abroad of a public or a semi-public character. AVar, of course, does not in terfere with them.",11
95,Mr ARCHIBALD,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,What proportion that amount would come from Germany? Has the honourable member any idea?,12
96,Mr GLYNN,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"I have an idea, but I want to be accurate. I examined the statistics some four or five months ago, and the impression of the larger figures still remains with mc. The Minister of Home Affairs knows that the largest proportion of the export trade to the continent was with Germany. As a matter of fact, before the war, Germany, I think, was one of the best consumers, if not the best consumer, of the manufactured products of the United Kingdom. Tliese figures must give us some idea of the contractual relations which existed at the time of the war, and which would be affected if the Imperial Government and Germany were to adopt the policy that is embodied in this Bill . rupted, I was about to point out that, apart from this rich return from investments abroad of a public or semi-public character, and 96 per cent, of which is uninterrupted by the war, which shows what our Fleet is able to do, the United Kingdom has large investments of a business character abroad. The figures really colossal, but for the moment I cannot recall them. All this trade largelv depends on contracts and agencies, as well as on our system of international clearanoss. Then again, the value of imnorts of British possessions from Germany and Austria before the war was about £108,000,000. This trade, reciprocally speaking, is a beneficial trade on both sides. The figures show that it has been a very beneficial trade. I may mention that the Commonwealth trade with Germany, which, roughly speaking, probably reached the volume of £15,000,000, suggested last night - by the Attorney-General, is one which, on the figures alone, indicates that we reap large benefits from it or did before the' war, since the volume of. our exports to is actually greater than the volume of our imports from , Germany. difference may be explained to some extent by the fact that there is a difference in the method of estimating values and that the final adjustments of this trade are balanced up in the United Kingdom. But, in the light of all these facts, we ought not to act too hurriedly or without a full sense of what will be the Imperial effect of the legislation we are asked to pass. Let us look for a moment at the of particular industry that is touched by this measure, and which, as the Attorney General has said, is the mineral industry. The total volume of mineral production in 1913 was £25,810,000. The whole of this, of course, is not exported. If we take silver and lead, copper, t in and zinc, we find that the value of these products is £10,734,00.0, of which t in represents £1,402,000. The export proportion of these values is not all with belligerent countries. Our mineral exports, no matter to what countries the export may be, represent but a small proportion of our total exports, or, to put it more strongly, of our total production. All these exports are not affected by contracts. I wish that I were able to put the actual figures before the House, but it has been impossible to collate and check When inter- them in the time at our disposal. Broadly speaking, I think it will be found that those which I have given are correct. As a matter of law and fact, I think that the real evil to which the Attorney-General directed his statements is in relation only to contracts entered into before the war, and the operation of which by comare mon law as well as by Statute is suspended during the war. Some local parties to these contracts may have a doubt- I do not say it is more than a doubt, even if it . is a doubt, of any importance-as towhether, if tliey carried on trade, or exported without regard to these contracts,, they would find themselves in a position of difficulty, because of those contracts, at the expiration of the war. It may be also that they wish to be able to enter into new contracts, and these in turn may be a source of other evils. They wish to know whether they may, as a matter of law, disregard any conditions of a contract that would prevent them exporting or selling to otlier than the parties to the contract. I believe they may disregard them now, but they may wish . to know whether, at the end of the war, the suspension of the contract That being at an end, they would not be bound, to the parties to the existing - contract, and the fear of anything of the kind may be hampering their present operations. I think I may say that, so - far as we can assist to free the hands of local contractors in cases of this character, the Opposition will be prepared to help the Attorney-General. But I think that we can show that the Bill goes far beyond that assumed necessity. It is more than a War Bill . It goes beyond the war, because it also in terferes for all time with these huge contracts of the metal and other companies, seeing that it does not abrogate them merely for the purpose of freeing the minds of the contracting parties from all doubt as to their position.",12
97,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,It may cut ways.,13
98,Mr GLYNN,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"Yes , I think that such an effect can be shown; but what I more particularly urge is the need to be cautious in not going beyond the limits of what clearly is necessary, u n t i l our minds are allayed by any facts the Attorney-General can bring forward as showing thab .necessity. Ib is not my place to go into the question of the contracts referred to by the Attorney-General, because I do not know sufficient of them, though the fact that the companies .do not seem to have directed the attention of honourable members to their position is significant. Possibly, and very properly, they have gone to the Attorney-General - direct, seeing that he was the Minister who could give them aid by legislation, but, as a general rule, where grievances are very deep-seated, honourable members hear of them directly. .1 cannot say much upon the question ot - contracts, because we cannot have the opportunity of judging whether the surmises of the Attorney-General, based oh official knowledge, are correct, though - there is evidence that many of these in Xerests are somewhat afraid of the result - of this legislation; but honourable members, such as the honourable member for Balaclava, who has a'more intimate knowledge of the matter, and who has a better opportunity of acquiring it than I have, will throw light upon it during the course of the debate. Nevertheless, I may be excused from showing what, apart from the Bill before us, is the position of these - contracts. The question of enemy contracts is already part of the law relating to trading with the enemy, a contract being merely one instrumentality of trading; and the law books generally deal with enemy contracts under the heading of Enemy Trading. We have already legislated upon the s.ubject of enemy trading. Our Trading with the Enemy Acts provide that imprisonment for seven years may follow conviction on an indictment for trading with the enemy, which is a very effective deterrent to such trading. Trading with the enemy has an exceedingly wide scope. It may include acts so innocuous, as a inatter of fact, that one authority has described the legislation, owing to the penalties that may be imposed, as being to a large extent vindictive, which was never intended to be the case. I do not belieVe that there are in the law books two. four or five cases of prosecutions for trading with the enemy before this war broke out. In fact, I do not know that there are more than two cases. Certainly there have been very few, if any, cases of trading with the enemy of the class defined by our proclamations and Acts, because it was often found' very beneficial by both nations at war to wink at what was going on, and licences to trade with the enemy were freely granted during the Crimean War and the Napoleonic wars-. We already have proclamations supported by our Trading with the Enemy Acts which cover a very wide sphere. I do not intend to go through the matters dealt with, in those proclamations, because honourable members can see them for themselves, but I wish to refer to a proclamation published in the Gazette on the 12th September, 1914, and covering part of the field embraced by the measure before us, seeing that ib declares that it is against the proclamation "" to enter into any commercial, financial, or other contract or obligation with or for the benefit of an enemy."" As I have said, part of the .Bill before us is covered by an existing proclamation. There is also power given under the Trading witli the Enemy Acts to the Executive, by Order in Council, to prohibit trade of any other class than that dealt with in the paragraph which I have just cited, although that trading might be otherwise lawful. Therefore, very wide powers are capable of being exercised under our Trading with the Enemy Acts and proclamations. Let me now deal with the definitions clause. I refer to this matter in order to show the need for caution in drafting. In our definition of "" enemy subject"" we have defined an enemy company in terms of the T r a d in g with the E n e m y Act s , but not , unless the y have been modified, in the terms of the earlier proclamations issued under those Act s . F o r instance, the proclamation of the 12th September, 1914, declares that in the case of incorporated bodies enemy character attaches only to those incorporate d in an enemy c o u n try , w h i c h differs from the d e f in it i o n in the Bill before us. p are n t l y the d r a f t s m a n has departed from the E n g l is h law as l a i d d o wn in a decision given in J a n u a r y last, and t a k e n the definition given by the dissentient J u d g e , ""Lord Justice B u c k l e y. report of an in t e r p r e t at i o n case appearing in the Economist, of 23rd J a n u a r y last, and covering a good m a n y matters, one answer was given by the Court as to companies. The question was: Can a company or corporation, registered in this country, but whose shareholders and directors are chiefly alien enemies resident in the enemy country, sue in these courts to enforce payment of their debts or to enforce other rights, in the same manner as ordinary British subjects can 7 The answer, in effect, wasThis is a difficult question, nnd the Court - were not unanimous. The majority decided that as a company or corporation has a legal - existence apart from its shareholders or corporators, if it carries on business from a registered address here and is nominally British, it is not an alien enemy. Once a corporation has been created in accordance with the requirements of British law, it is British. It was contended that to pay debts to such a cornpuny, if it consisted chiefly of alien enemy shareholders, would be to pay money for the benefit of an enemy, because the shareholders -'-ould make use of the credit thus obtained. The Court decided that this was too farfetched an argument, and as the proclamations - and Acts forbidding trade with the enemy did not recognise such a company as an enemy, it - must be considered according to common law u British company. Lord Justice Buckley dissented, being of opinion that such a company was so impressed with the alien enemy's stamp that the Court ought to look behind the abstract legal person of the oompany to see who composed it, and that the test was not, "" What is the company?"" but "" Of whom does it consist?"" It is the test considered necessary by the dissentient Judg e that we are a p p l y in g to our special legislation. No w , in order to show w h at the position is, l e t me r e f e r to the in t e r p r e t at i o n of these Act s p u b lished some months ago by the I m p e r i a l - Government for the guidance of traders, and to u c h in g on the question of contracts. On the 22nd A u g u s t last the I m p e r i a l O o v e r n m e u t officially made the f o l l o w i ng Mr Glynn. announcement t h r o u g l i the Treasury for the guidance of the p u b l i c : For th*4 purpose of deciding what transactions with foreign traders are permitted, the important thing is to consider where the foreign trader resides and, carries on business, and not the nationality of the foreign trader. Consequently, there is, as a rule, no objection to British firms trading with German or Austrian firms established in neutral or Britisb territory. ApOf course that is subject to t be q u a l if i cation that ib must not be a b l in d to c o m m u n i c at i o n with the enemy. What is prohibited is trade with any - firms According to a established in hostile territory. If a firm with head-quarters in hostile territory has a branch in neutral or Britisb territory, trade with the branch is (apart from prohibitions in special cases) permissible, as lone; as the tra.de is bona tide with the branch, and no transaction with the head office is involved. Commercial contracts entered into before war broke out with firms established in hostile territory cannot bo performed during the war, and payments under them ought not to be made to such firms during the war. Where, however, nothing remains to be done save to pay for goods already delivered or for services already rendered, there is no objection to making the payments. Whether contracts entered into before the war are suspended or terminated is a question of law which may depend on circumstances, and in cases of doubt British firms must consult their own legal advisers.",13
99,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,That bears o u t the p o in t that there is a g r e at state of u n c e r t a in t y. No one knows whether he is bound or f r e e .,14
100,Mr GLYNN,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"I acknowledge that there m a y bo grounds for interference in regar d to some contracts, but I am p o in t in g o u t the in t e r p r e t at i o n of these Act s , and showing that the Bill before us is u n necessary in some respects, because t ho common l a w , as well as o u r Statutes, deals with it , as in d i c at e d by t h is q u o t at i o n alone, a p a r t from w h at 1I have previously said. The common law at Home and the Statutes go to not h in g lik e the e x t e nt we are at t e m p t in g to go here. What is the law ? I shall endeavour to sum it up in some propositions based on an a r t i c l e deali n g with the subject of E n e m y Contracts, and w r it t e n by Leslie Scott in the L a w Q u a r t e r l y Bevie w for J a n u a r y of last year. The effect of an outbreak of war on the power of the citizens of belligerent States to trade with one another depends on the municipal law of their respective States. In some Cases it depends upon a S t at u t e ; in others p u r e l y on the common l a w . ""In England the common law and Statutes both deal with the matter. The general rule of English law is that all - contracts entered into during a war between British citizens and the citizens of a State . which is nt war with Great Britain are illegal und can never be enforced. 'Therefore the provisions of the Bill on that point are really unnecessary.",14
101,Mr FENTON,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,But all these contracts were entered into prior to the war.,15
102,Mr GLYNN,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"I am dealing with each part of the Bill separately, and these -.statements cover all parts of the Bill , and may be useful for referenceThe rules apply to all contracts and not only those in the nature of a trading venture. Contracts made in furtherance of illegal trading, even though not made directly between the citizens of two belligerent States, are illegal and void. The rules that contracts made with belligerents are illegal and void applies to contracts made by citizens of allied States. 'These rules, of course, do not apply where licences to trade have been grantedContracts entered into by the citizens of one belligerent State with citizens of another belligerent State before the outbreak of hostilities between their respective States are not made illegal by the outbreak of war, but rights arising under them, and the right of suit to enforce these rights, are suspended until the war is over. 'On that point the case of Janson v. The Driefontein Consolidated Mining Company Limited, in which the question of - contracts entered into during the war period was introduced, may be referred - to. The report states- c The remedy is indeed suspended. An olien - enemy cannot sue in the courts of either country while the war lasts, but the rights on the - contract are unaffected, and when the war is - over the remedy in the courts of either is restored. The exceptions are where the contracts - come to an enemy's aid and involve dealrings with him and contracts that, from .their character, are incapable of suspension. Such, for instance, as a partner--ship, which would involve continued - dealings. These would generally violate - the common law as well as the Statute. - I would like to give one more quotat i o n from Professor Morgan on this quest i o n of pre-war contracts, because it suggests what I have mentioned-that it is probable that there is nothing to prevent the parties to these contracts here hav-ing outside dealings or disregarding any - provisions that might prevent them, duriing the war period, from selling or exporting to companies or persons other than the parties to the contract. In other words, the provisions with regard to exclusive dealings will be regarded as nugatory during the war. I think, of course, we must help to remove any doubts there may be in the law, and the reason I say that I believe that these contracts are no longer binding during the war, and that no action can be taken in respect to them after the war, is that to impose limits on production here would be against the principle on which trading with the enemy is prevented. It would be really strengthening the enemy by weakening ourselves, and no contract that would weaken our position could be binding for the same reason that trading with the enemy is prohibited. In his book, War; its Conduct and Legal Results, Professor Morgan statesIf a contract has been made prior to the outbreak of war the hostile alien is none the less an alien and unable to sue. The remedy is therefore suspended in principal until he can do so. If a contract has been completely performed, or if a quantum meruit is due upon it, there is no difficulty about this except for a doubt as to whether the Statute of Limitations runs against the hostile creditor. But in other cases where there still remains something more complicated than payment to be done under the contract, it would be going too fnr to assert broadly that all further extension is suspended. All performance which involves ' intercourse with enemy territory certainly is so, and since it would usually be unfair to postpone performance indefinitely, such contracts are necessarily cancelled. But there seems to be no reason to suppose that in other cases the outbreak of war of itself interposes an absolute release. In the great majority it does, but for a further reason. In that majority of cases, performance is not only suspended, but the contract is again cancelled. These cases include(1) those in which the continued existence of the contract is against public policy, e.g., the insurance of enemy ships; and (2) those in which performance cannot be suspended without unfairness or inconsistency with the terms of the contract express or implied (including practically all trading contracts). As a matter of fact, there are very few contracts of an executory character released, which would not be affected so far as covenants such as those with the Metal Company are concerned, by the actual breaking out of war. So much then for the authorities. I may now refer to an article in the January number of the Law Quarterly Review by one of the authors of the book from which I have just quoted, in which, dealing with the question of the fulfilment of contracts and the right to sue in the case of suspended contracts revived on the declaration of peace, it is statedl t is otherwise when the contract requires continual fulfilment. Equity then dictates that it be dissolved by the outbreak of war. Dealing now with the Bill itself, I think I have endeavoured to show that it goes beyond what is necessary, because, in the first, place, the common law now covers many of the matters dealt with in its clauses; and, in the second.place, because its definitions are so wide that, in many cases, it must h it Imperial trading in terests as well as our own local trading interests very severely. Let us look, for instance, at clause 3. Here it is declared that an enemy contract means any . contract to which an enemy subject is a party. It does not imply that the only contracting party on one side must be an enemy subject. It may refer to one of perhaps a dozen parties on one side who is an enemy subject, and according to this clause that would be sufficient to in validate the whole contract. That seems to be the clear effect of this particular clause. I emphasize that it does not mean - necessarily that .a contract should be between two persons, one of whom is an enemy person. It means that if a most diluted interest exists either by the fact' that an enemy subject is n party by signature, or by having an interest in the - contract, the contract is annulled.",15
103,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"If thero were a number of German shareholders in a company, is it the intention of the House that this Bill should invalidate any contract .made by that company? Several HONORABL E MEMBERS - No , Nol",16
104,Mr GLYNN,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"The question is a very pertinent one in its relation to companies, and I am.inclined to think that the honourable member for Parkes is quite right. Clause 3 of - the Bill declares that an enemy contract means any contract which an enemy subject is a party to, or in which an enemy subject has an interest. That, apparently, may include a company in which an enemy subject has an interest, as referred to by the honourable member for Parkes. So that it merely necessary to be a party, or one of several parties on one side. The mere fact that a person has any interest at all, in the opinion of the Attorney-Generalbecausehe has to decide a point to which I will refer laler on-make s the contract an enemy contract. Clause 3 also provides that an enemy contract may mean "" any contract which is, or is likely to be, for the benefit of enemy subjects or of enemy trade."" - It is clear, then, that the matter may require very close investigation. I will now deal with the administration of the Act. The Bill provides, in effect, that an application may be made to the Attorney-General for a declaration that a contract is or is not an enemy contract within, the meaning of the section, and under the Bill it is for the Attorney General himself to decide. Is it right or expedient to leave the decision in such a complex matter as this to the unchallengeable judgment, the decision beyond appeal, of the Attorney-General?",16
105,Sir ROBERT BEST,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,That is already done in the Trust Act in almost equally difficult questions.,16
106,Mr GLYNN,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,I beg the honorabjfe member's pardon; but does the honourable member for Kooyong say that he is prepared to vest this power in the Attorney General ?,16
107,Sir ROBERT BEST,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"I am not saying that,",16
108,Mr GLYNN,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"Then the interjection is irrelevant, if it does not qualify what I am stating; but may I point out, as regards the Trust Act, that the Courts have to decide ? The Attorney-General issues a fiat after the examination of certain submitted contracts. Prosecutions under that Act have to be sanctioned by the certificate of the Attorney-General.' But here the whole matter, without appeal, rests with the Attorney-General. Take, for instance, the Snow case. I do not want to pre-judge it in any way, but it has been .going on for a long time, and it must, .therefore, have involved very close in quiry as to whether the facts justify the declaration that the parties concerned are enemy subjects, or that there has been .trading with the enemy. What would be the position if the Attorney-General himself had to decide the merits of this case? The whole of the relevant facts would have to be brought before him. There is not might not be one-fifth of the facts that have been brought before the Court, but still even such an inquiry would take up a very large proportion of the Attorney General's time. Apart altogether from the wisdom of making the Attorney-General a judge in these matters- I say this without any personal reference-the proceeding is open to objection from many points of view",16
109,Mr SAMPSON,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,Shoul d it not ferred to the Courts?,17
110,Mr GLYNN,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"I think it should be; but I will deal with that later on. I will uow refer to the sub-clauses themselves. These declare, as the common law at present provides, that contracts made during the war are void. Contracts made during the war are invalid and void, but the Bill declares that every enemy contract made before the commencement of the war is to be and to have been null and void as from the commencement of the war, as regards rights and obligations under it , except in relation to goods which have been already delivered, or acts which have been already performed. Why should we depart from the existing law and the existing practice and policy of the United Kingdom, which is far more concerned than we are? Could we not pass a provision covering such cases as it may be necessary to cover to remove doubt? Why should we declare contracts covering all the contractual relations affecting our external trade, and entered into before the war, to be actually void if in the opinion of the Attorney-General they are enemy contracts? That is going too far. Clause 4 is not directed expressly against enemy contracts, although it may include them; it deals with any contract. Either party to a contract to which it applies may by notice in writing to the other party terminate the contract as regards all rights and obligations relating to any future supply or delivery under the contract. The clause declares that a contract to which ib applies is a contract for the sale and delivery of goods, the performance of which is by operation of law or by the terms of the contract suspended during or on account of the present war. We have already declared in sub-clause 5 of clause 3 that all such contracts are void as from the commencement of the war. Therefore, clause 4 seems to be nugatory.",17
111,Mr WATT,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"Shoul d not clause 4 contain the words "" to . which the preceding section applies "" ?",17
112,Mr GLYNN,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"The honourable member has anticipated me. I was going to suggest that the clause should be made auxiliary to clause 3. There may be something to be said for it , and I am not going to suggest amendments, but I think that the Bill should be drafted to deal only with contracts in regard to be rewhich people are in doubt as to whnt their position will be after the war is over. This Parliament has not power to pass a measure which will cover the whole field. The greater part of the field is probably within the jurisdiction of the States, and the Attorney-General has told us that he is asking the States to pass legislation to help us in the matter. All contracts are not of Federal concern. A doubt has been thrown on some of the provisions of our Patent Acts, which give power to suspend or abrogate contracts, as not being matters of patent law. Certain contracts are within our jurisdict i o n : contracts relating to defence or to our specific powers, and a great many contracts relating to foreign, or, subject to section 92' of the Constitution, to Inter-State trade. But in this in stance it is desired to cover a field of jurisdiction of which a great part is under the control of the States, and with which we therefore can deal only in concert with the States. I think that the Bil l should be confined to enemy contracts made before the war, the suspension of which affects production or export, that is, undulv ties the hands of contractors here who may be in doubt as to their position. The provisions of clause 2 and sub-clause 1 of clause 3 go far beyond what is necessary, and should be redrafted. An application might be made to a Judge or to a Judge in chambers. The question arises whether we should not give to the agents of parties who are affected by the contracts the righb to appear and to put their case. It has been decided by the British Courts that when the interest of an enemy subject is affected by an action, he has a right to defend it , a right to be heard. It is open to question that we should allow enemy contracts covering very wide areas to be annulled by the Court or by the Attorney-General without giving the parties other than the applicants the right to be heard; but the effect of the definition of such contracts as enemy contracts would be their annulment. Clause 4 should be altered to make it mainly, or more clearlv if so intended, auxiliary to clause 3. I urge, too, that we should wait in this matter for the advice of the Imperial Government. told last night that the provisions of the measure had been telegraphed to England; but, in view of the fact that Mr . Harcourt appears to disapprove of such legislation, and two months ago declined to give assistance by means of Imperial legislation, it behoves us, considering the tremendous Imperial interests involved, to await the opinion of the Imperial Government regarding the measure. Mr KING O'MALLEY [12.8] - It seems to me that people here, many thousands of miles away from the seat of war, have nearly gone mad about chasing the enemies of the country. have read the Bill with fear and trembling. A f t e r careful study, it appears that if your wife has an uncle who is the grandson of a German born before the Flood, you are trading with the enemy. Every man who wants to be fair and square with the world, and to do justice to all, gets to be thought disloyal when struggles like the present are taking place. Even though the Attorney-General is a Labour man, I cannot regard him as an Egyptian emperor.",17
113,Mr WATT,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"The Bill does not deal with marriage contracts. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Prett y nearly. It deals with matters in which you can get' yourself fastened up before you know it . I was very pleased to hear the speech of the honourable member for Angas. To every question that he touches in this House, he lends a spiritual and moral dignity that exalts it . I have not been well of late, and feel hardly able to tackle such a mighty question as this, but I take the opportunity to make my protest against what is proposed. It seems to me that the Attorney-General has become so saturated with feeling against Germany and the Germans that when he takes a pinch of snuff in Melbourne the Emperor of Germany sneezes in Berlin. Far removed from the field of operations, he is making tremendous efforts to destroy the Germans. On a hundred bloodless fields like this he is trying to win his golden spurs. I wonder if a landlord who has German tenants is to be regarded as trading with the enemy. I suppose that before I know it I.shall be in gaol. Y e t we have not heard a word against the capitalists who have nearly destroyed Great Britain . Why is it that Lord Kitchener is not able to send men to the fron t as rapidly as he ought to i It is not We were of men, but of ammunition that the Allies are short.' I have a relative who went from the United States to Canada to enlist, and he writes to say that he has been marching up and down England until he is like a prizefighter, but tliey have not the ammunition to send him to the front. Why ?",18
114,Dr MALONEY,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,Boodle .,18
115,Mr KING OMALLEY,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"Yes ; boodle. In days gone by you allowed the capital(Darwin) ists of Great Britain and the capitalists of France to organize great trusts for the building of factories in Germany. I propose to prove this statement. Contracts I of this kind exist for fifty years, yet not a word has been said in the House of Commons about breaking them. Why have the Allies to depend on Canada and the United States for the supply of ammunition ? Because the banks of the British Empire have lent money, and organizing trusts have spent it in erecting ammunition factories in Germany. Time after time. I have told the House that Australian gold was being used to build German Dreadnoughts, but I have been laughed at. I have here a copv of the New York American, of the 17th March last, an American newspaper, neither pro-British nor pro-German, though friendly to us. It has an article headed "" German Trusts turn Allies to United! States powder. Companies in great combination, financed partly by French and British money, now working solely to supply Kaiser's army."" Why does not the Attorney-General bring in a Bill to get at the Kaiser directly, and not at a few of his subjects who do not know what to do ? I met a German the other day who said, "" I come here, and I make a leetle home, and now I am starving."" We do not wish to persecute the Germans who are here. That policy would be contrary to the history of the British Empire, which for the last 100 years has been civilized, and has been the great teacher and guide of the whole world. This is what the New York American has to say about the German trustsBritish, German, French, and Belgian manufacturers of explosives have formed a gigantic trust which will control the European output of gunpowder and dynamite until 1950. I now make the suggestion that no private individual ought to be allowed tomanufacture ammunition. If there were not in the world individuals like the D u ponts, of America, and the Krupps, of Germany, manufacturing ammunition, - there would be no necessity for these wars. The wars are created for the purpose of paying dividends to the manufacturers of ammunition. The article continues The trust had its inception with the formation in 1880 of the Nobel Dynamite Trust, which expanded until it included among its members some of the largest English, French, and Belgian companies. Last year, when such a war as the present war seemed an impossibility, the German companies were also taken in, and the name of the trust changed to the Ooneral Kartel of Powder Companies, with head-quarters in Berlin. The Germans seem to run the world, and it is no good saying that we can stop trade. Trade flows ou like the tide of the ocean, ancl it cannot be stopped. 'All we can do is to help our own people by a good Tariff. We have before us the instance of the aniline dyes. Many of the factories in the United Kingdom are being shut up because they .are not able to procure the aniline dyes for the dyeing of their fabrics, and yet the Britishers were the inventors of those dyes. If the Britisb Empire and the English speaking people had shown half the skill, genius, and patriotism in building up their count r y that the Germans have shown in building up Germany, we would not have any of the troubles which confront us today. Let honourable members listen to thisEnemies on the same boardBoodle speaks all languages, including L at in , Greek, Sanskrit, and Assyrian. so that today, with practically all the countries of Europe at war, and using the powder manufactured by this gigantic trust, Herren R.

These German plants, which are now working day and night, furnishing material for the German Army and Navy, were built with British capital. And they are situated within Germany.

132,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"Darling Downs) [12.34]. - This Bill involves a very important principle. International law provides that osrtain executory contracts, or rights under them, are suspended during war; but the Bill lays down the principle that that rule may be annulled by a Dominion of any one of the countries that may be at war. From that poinr, the question before us is very serious. Internationally speaking, th-; Empire is the only legal personality that is known; and we are a portion of oneof the large sovereign States or entities known to international law. We are asked by this Bill to claim as a Dominion, or part of the Empire, the right to pass an Act of Parliament which will abrogate a well-known and settled principle of stated international law. This, of course, is stripping the question of all merit and personal considerations, and strictly stating it as a matter of principle. I am not for a moment saying that the circumstances are not such as would command sympathy, and probably justify the Ministry in their actions. The whole of the facts are known to the 'Ministry. and, with the complete knowledge in their possession, they feel that, under the circumstances, the position, in regard to industries and employment in Australia r is so serious as to justify them' in departing from the well-known principles of international law, and in annulling the contract which has been suspended for the time being. We have the remarkable fact that during the progress not of this great war, at least one of our enemies has practically abrogated all therules of international law, where theserules have conflicted with his personal interests. Some of those rules were framed in councils of nations meeting together at The Hague Convention, for' the special purpose of placing a -''more humanitarian aspect on the cruel operaand tions of war. At the same time, although one of the enemy may be violating the rules of international law, the British Government have never taken up the attitude that this relieved Great Britain from the obligations imposed by the wellfrom known principles of that international law.",20
133,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,Did the honourable member see that Mr Bonar Law has that the treatment of British prisoners in Germany would justify the expropriano tion of all German property in Britain?,21
134,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"I saw that statement; but the British Government have, so far, not fel t it necessary to act on suggestion.

138,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"And I think it is the attitude of the Australian people. A f t e r all, war is only an incident in the development of international relationships, taking the history of the world as a whole. More and more the general tendency of nations has been to lay down rules and principles for their guidance in such relationships; and though those rules, in the absence of sanction and power to enforce them, are not, strictly speaking, rules of law, the influence of The Hague Convention, and of treaties, and alliances has given them an honourable force almost equal to legality.",21

141,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,But is that not the posimance tion now ?,21
142,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"Allo w me first to deal and with general principles. We are now asked to annul one of those principles international law, on the ground, as i m - wealth with power to annul.those plied in the Minister's statement, that the which are mentioned suspension . of contracts is - Jb'aving a serio.us effect on production, industries, [109]- 2 employment in Australia. Further, the honourable gentleman told us, by i m plication, that the Imperial authorities are being consulted and notified of our proposed action, and are practically acquiescing. It would appear, therefore, that an Imperial stand-point this measure is not likely to lead to serious complications. If any action of ours did involve the Empire in serious complications, we said should have to give way to Imperial considerations. But the mere fact that protest has been made implies that our action is not likely to embarrass the I m perial authorities either now or after the war has closed. The self-governing Dothe minions cannot each go its own way and Gotake conflicting action in respect of enemies of the Empire. As an integral atpart of the Empire our action should be uniform with that of all other portions of In War and Alien Enemies, Mr . A r t h ur Page lays down the law as t ; affects personal and trading rights. He says The effect of the outbreak of war upon conmade with alien enemies may be summed up thus :(a) Contracts made during the war without o licence are rendered void. (b) Contracts made and executed before the commencement of war, if lawful per se, nre suspended during the war. The rights and remedies thereunder revive after the war is over (subject to the statute of limitations). (c) Contracts made before the war, but wholly or partly executory at the outbreak of hostilities, nre void either (1) if made for an illegal purpose, as in the case of an insurance of an enemy's goods or vessels against capture by British warships (although, if there is a general clause insuring, against capture, that clause will be construed as not covering capture by a British or probably an Allied warship, and may otherwise be valid); or (2) if the contract is indivisible, nnd might fail in its 'purpose, if performance were to be suspended during the war. On the other hand, an executory contract, otherwise lawful, will be suspended and not rendered void by the outbreak of war, if its object can reasonably be effected by perforafter the war, while, if such a contract be severable, it will be void as to such parts only as are to be performed during the war, its operation will otherwise be suspended. of This Bill seeks to endow the Commoncontracts in the last paramost graph I have quoted, as being suspend-jd. during the war. Trotter, in his Law nf Contracts during War, gives a short mary, in which he says : If the American authorities are taken into account, a more correct statement of the would be the following :An executory contract concluded with alien enemy before the outbreak of war merely suspended during the war ns regards che right to performance and the right action. (Janson v. Driefontein Consolidated Mines Ltd., 1902, A.C. 484.) But such a concontracts tract is either avoided or dissolved by the break of war (1) if it ensures to the aid of the enemy (Furtado v. Rogers, 1802, 3 Bos., P. 191); or (2) if it is in its nature incapable of suspension (Griswold v. Waddington, 1818, L6 Johnson, 438, an American case). A tract will in its nature be incapable of suspension (a) if its proper performance necessitates intercourse with"" the enemy during the war [Esposito v. Bowden, 1857, 7 E. & B. 763; The "" William <6 Ilagaleij,"" 5 Wall, 377, an American case); or (f>) where time is of the essence of the contract I Ne w York Life surance Go. v. Statliam, 1876, 93 United Reports, Supreme Court, 24\; or (c) where parties cannot, on conclusion of peace, be equal, for the doctrine of revival of contracts suspended by war is based on considerations contracts. of equity and justice.",21
143,Mr WEST,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,Does that apply to private mised to do that. contracts ?,22
144,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"Yes , to all private conto tracts. That is a general statement of the law as laid down by these authors. The Bill now before us is, in its scope, exceedingly wide. As a Commonwealth we are purporting to exercise our legispensation lative powers, and consequently the first question which we must ask ourselves "" What are the powers that we profess to exercise in connection with this Bill ?"" presume that the Attorney-General has considered the fact that under section of our Constitution we may enact laws dealing with trade and commerce between the different States, with external affairs, and also with defence. But in this sure we purport to take to ourselves power to annul contracts which fall four classes. There are f o ur classes contracts which the Bill purports affect, looking at it from the point of of the parties to a contract. First, i fesses to deal with all contracts made as to contracts. between Australian subjects and alien contracts enemies or foreigners generally-that is to say, with people outside British Doably minions. Secondly, it seeks to deal with contracts made with Australians and 27th people residing in the British Empirechiefly in the United Kingdom, I supCourt pose. Thirdly, it purports to affect conthe sumtracts made between persons and companies residing in the different Statesthat is to say, Inter-State contracts. And law finally it seeks to deal with contracts made between persons or companies withnn in a State. Now it seems to me clear that is in regard to contracts falling into the of first three of these classes the Commonwealth has jurisdiction. In regard to in the fourth class it is possible outthat the position may be covered by some and power of defence or some reserve power relating to the preservation of the nation in time of war. But , on the face of it , coni t seems to me that the Attorney-General will be well advised if he limits the ap plication'of the Bill to those matters which clearly f all within our legislative powers, 407, especially as he proposes to ask the States Into rely on the powers which they possess States in dealing with contracts made within the the States in the same way as it is promade posed in this measure to deal with other",22
145,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,The States have pro,22
146,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"That being so, in order put the validity of the measure beyond the possibility of dispute, it might be well for us to do what was done in the Seamen's Compensation Act of 1911. It will be recollected that the Seamen's ComA c t of 1910 was adjudged to be invalid, and that a validating measure is, had to be passed the following year.",22
147,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,I hardly think that the I same conditions apply in this case. Ought we to admit that we have not the power 51 which we seek to exercise when there is a reasonable doubt upon the question ?,22
148,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"We would not be admeamittin g that we have not the requisite power. All that we would be saying into would be that we know we have certain of powers, and that we intend to exercise to them. We must recollect that when we view are fighting with alien enemies they are t pronot likely to spare us in litigation The question of entered into by Broken Hill companies is very clearly and dealt with by a writer in the Argus, under the nom de plume of "" L e x , "" on A p r i l last. It appears that one of these contracts has already been before the for its consideration. Consequently matter is ribw public property, so that we can with perfect propriety discuss it here. In the article in question writer says: In the case of the Broken Hill ore contracts, the English Court was asked to say whether enemy subject? or not tlio companies and the German firm had, in terms, agreed to a suspension in the event of war. . . . Seeing, therefore, that many Anglo-German contracts, now temporarily suspended, may revive with the declaration peace, it is natural that Mr Lewis Harcourt should hesitate to break away from the recognised international standards governing isting reciprocal engagements between our own ancl the enemy country. In that case the particular provision which was before the Court for its sideration was clearly set out. . The main contract covered the supply of centrates for a long period, and by clause 17 provided that "" in the event of any strike, volved. look-out, combination of workmen, interference of triide unions, suspension of labour, whether partial, local, or general, and from whatsoever cause arising, floods, storms, lire, stoppage of water supply, washaways of railways, accidents of God, force majeure, or perils of breakdown of machinery, or inability of the Silverton Tramway Company to provide the necessary trucks for carrying away the concenalready trates, or in the event of any cause beyond control of either the sellers or the buyers venting or delaying the carrying out of the agreement, then this agreement shall be suspended during the continuance of any and such disability. The matter was brought before the mary Judge by way of a friendly action in which the Court was asked to decide whether the risk of war was included these contingencies. Mr. JOSEPH Cdoic - Does suspension this case mean suspension of duration operation ?",22
149,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"Neithe r deliveries are made nor can action be taken for nondelivery during the war; but at its termination a resumption of the terms of the contract is expected. That was the determination of the primary Judge. This report continuesHe therefore decided that the contracts were ments take retaliatory measures ? 'merely in suspense until the restoration peace) which meant, necessarily, that the Broken Hill companies could riot, during i iii tics, enter into any fresh engagements perrimient kind for the disposal of their centrates, but must hold their hands, recollecting their liabilities to resume later date. His Lordship accordingly granted an injunction restraining the defendant tors from acting on the assumption that the contracts had been terminated by the war. The question of whether that interpretation of the law was correct Was sent bn to'""the Court of Appeal. the Mr WEST - Was the determination of the question governed by the fact that this was a coutract entered into with an",23
150,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"The point at issue was whether the contract was suspended by virtue of the war. The Court held that of the risk of war was covered, and that the contract was, therefore, suspended pendthe exing the duration of the war.",23

152,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"This report does not conshow who were the parties to the contracts, but we know that they were between the companies and Aaron Hirsch. conI am dealing now with the principle inA s the Attorney-General hat pointed out, these companies were placed in a very awkward position, since at the close of the war they would be called upon to make large deliveries in accordance the sea, with the terms of the contracts.",23
153,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,Some of them have been informed of the intention of the the other parties to demand the resumption preof deliveries at the end of the war.,23
154,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"Quite so. This interevery pretation of the law, if correct, would have a very serious and paralyzing effect upon the industries concerned. The pripolicy which the Government have had to determine, and with which they now ask us to deal, is whether the seriousin position in which the industry in Australia finds itself is sufficient to justify us in is abrogating the well-known principle of or international law in regard to the suspension of contracts.",23
155,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,Anothe r question is whether it would pay us to do so.,23
156,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"That is one consideration. We have to ask ourselves what, from the point of ""view of the Empire as a. whole, would be the effect of our annulling these contracts. If we take such a step will the German and Austrian GovernBy of annulling these contracts may we incite hosthem to take similar action with respect of a to German and Austrian contracts with conpersons and companies throughout tht supplies at a British Empire.

157,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"I am dealing with th< point raised by the Leader of the Opposi tion, and which must not be lost sight of The question has been before the Imperial authorities, and one is led to believe that they are acquiescing in what is proposed to be done here. I gather from the attitude of the Imperial authorities that they do not regard our contemplated action as likely to lead the Empire into serious complications.",23
158,Mr WEST,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,Does not the honourable member think we ought to have some effective legislation to prevent f u t u r e tracts being entered into covering such a long period as do these particular contracts ?,24
159,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"That is quite another matter. Those who are engaged in large industries in which much capital is in vested, and which give employment to a great many men, like to be assured of a continuity of operations, and consequently wish to secure a market for many year3 ahead. Without such an assurance large sums of money would not be invested in such enterprises. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company, I think, was perfectly justified in looking ahead and making a contract covering an extended period.",24
160,Mr WEST,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,Where such contracts are entered into the Government should know of them either by means of our company law or in some other way.,24
161,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,It is for the shareholders of these companies to manage their own business. If we are to i quire into every contract entered into in all branches of industry throughout Australia we shall undertake a big responsibility.,24

165,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,But there are contracts with German firms other than those relating to the supply of metal. dealing now with the principle involved rather than with the particular products. Sitting suspended from. 1 to 2.15 p.m.,24
166,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"We presume that the Government have a knowledge of the whole of the facts and circumstances, as no one on this side has been approached with regard to them, and that they feel it absolutely essential to take this action, which on the face of it is certainly not normal. The very question that we are discussing was raised in November in the House of Commons by a motion moved by Mr Morton for«a new clause in these terms- I am quoting from Hansard, 25th November, . 1914, column 1232Determination of Contracts - Any contract which has been entered into by any British conperson, firm, company, or corporation with an enemy may be determined or suspended by a written order by a Secretary of State or the Board of Trade, which order a Secretary of State or the Board of Trade are hereby empowered to make, so far as any act, thing, or obligation remains to be done or performed under such contract, and any contract for the supply of goods imported from any State for the time being at war with His Majesty, or for goods which are manufactured or partly manufactured in any such State, may also be determined or suspended in like manner : Provided that such determination or suspension under this section shall not determine or suspend any act or thing which has been performed or done under such contract prior to the passing of this Act. Mr Morton explained that they wanted to get r i d of the difficulty in dealing with running contracts made over a series of years, and in his speech saidAccording to my information, which is only second-hand, they have passed the necessary Proclamation or Act, the equivalent to which 1I have embodied in a clause I lower on the Paper, giving to every German subject the n - option or saying whether such contract should be cancelled or postponed until after the war without prejudice to the British subject's right to recover damages for non-fulfrlnient or delay. Thus, although there is a r i g ht in Germany to determine the contract, there seems to be some sort'of remedy left to the contracting party. That amendment, which is in terms similar to one of the provisions of this Bill , was opposed by the Attorney-General in the House' of Commons and withdrawn. That Minister, as reported in column 1238, said I confess for my part I should conceive there was a rooted objection to enacting that settled I am contracts made between, two parties should, in case of the outbreak of war, be voidable at the option of one of the parties. That would be reducing the commercial law of this country to the level of the most disreputable republic in South America. It does not follow that those remarks can be applied to the whole of this Bill . They apply only to the principle of allowing a contract to be determined at the option of one party. 'Clause 4 of this Bill might be modified to meetf that - criticism in some way, but I am not adopting, the criticism as against the principle of the measure.",24
167,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"I do not think the torney-General of the British Government would say that our Bill savoured of - the tactics of a disreputable South American republic. ("" Mr GROOM - I do not say he would, but possibly clause 4 may be amended in such a way that no such criticism could apply to it .",25
168,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"I do not similarity between the section he was looking at and ours. There are two f u n damental distinctions. Ours applies to contracts actually suspended by the war, and Mr Morton's to contracts generally. cases of doubt. Ours applies to contracts other than those with the alien enemy, because those are dealt with in clause 3.",25
169,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,You r clause is wider than his.,25
170,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,It applies to contracts already suspended by the war.,25
171,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"That clause applies - contracts entered into with an enemy. The clause before us applies to those tered into between British subjects. The Attorney-General of England referred the possibility of further inquiries being made, and it is quite possible that since then the Board of Trade have made i quiries, and the British Government may Court would. have to come to the view that such action as we are taking here is justifiable. In conclusion, I wish to draw the tion of the Attorney-General to one fect. Clause 3 deals with executory tracts which are suspended, not with goods which have been delivered, or acts which have been performed, and are not covered by this measure, but with conthe tracts which are to continue and be f filled in the future, and if a person applies to the Attorney-General to declare that any contract is an enemy contract, the Attorney-General may make the declarafendants tion. If a contract is one "" to which enemy subject is a party, or in which enemy subject has an interest, or which or is likely to be for the benefit of subjects, or of enemy trade,"" it is - enemy contract. ^",25
172,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,-The annulment of the - contract is not necessarily dependent - - the statement of the Attorney-General; - it is .void without bhat declaration. (,25
173,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"But the Attorney General must declare it to be so. That is provided in sub-clause 3, which saysAt- If the Attorney-General declares that the contract is an enemy contract, then, upon the publication of his declaration in the Gazette, the contract shall be deemed to be an enemy contract. And as every enemy contract is declared to be null and void, on the Minister's declaration that a contract is an enemy contract, it becomes null and void. I admit, that sub-clause 5 gives a general nulli fication of contracts, but when a party admit any asks for a declaration under sub-clause 2, the Attorney-General must give a decision, if applied to.",25
174,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,The Attorney-General is only made interpreter of contracts in,25
175,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"Onl y contracts which are in doubt will be declared void, because no one will bother the Attorney General about those which the statute shows are null and void; but it is in regard to those which are in doubt that argument should be heard. A settled principle of British law is that no person to shall be condemned unheard, and we should even apply that principle to an enenemy subject, seeing that the British law is no respecter of persons. But this to Bill does not constitute the Attorney General in these matters a Court with power to call witnesses, and swear them n - on oath, and conduct proceedings as a An application may be heard before him in camera in . his own chambers without reporters, or any perattenson present other than those who make dethe application. One of these contracts concame before a Court of primary jurisdiction in Great Britain for the purpose of getting an interpretation. It went from the single Judge in the first instance to Court of Appeal, and the latter itself u l - took the point that no order could properly be made in the action because the interests of German buyers were vitally affected, and they were not joined as dei n the proceedings. This decian sion seemed rather extraordinary at the an time, because there was doubt as to is whether the defendants could be served, enemy but no importance attaches to that point an now, because it appears that the matter has been raised, and it has been shown in England that an enemy defendant can be served, not necessarily in person, but on by the plaintiff taking reasonable steps to notify him that the case is to be heard. If a man desires to get a contract in terpreted in England the Court will now entertain the application, even though an enemy be made party to the action, if the plaintiff can show that he has applied for substituted service of some k in d ; that is to say, if , instead of serving the notice on the defendant in Germany, he has served it on the defendant's agent in London, or on some person in a neutral country, who could communicate to the defendant the fact that the action would come on. The Attorney-General will be following the lines of British justice if he makes provision, so that before taking the action of declaring a contract null and void he enables the other party to the action to be heard.",25
176,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"In a very large number of cases these contracts are not legal, being contracts with an alien enemy.",26
177,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"That is a question of fact which the Attorney-General may have to decide. A contract to which an enemy subject is a party is null and void, but the other party may say that he is not an enemy subject. The Bill should provide some method by whicn that man may be served with notice, and have an opportunity to appear before the Attorney-General, and argue his status before the Attorney-General makes a declaration.",26
178,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"In nine cases out of where that class of person is a British subject he is such for convenience, or for better effecting the German purpose. He takes on British nationality as a cloak.",26
179,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"I am not justifying such a person. A man who takes on the British nationality as a cloak for such a purpose should be exposed; but at the same time. I thinlc that the clause should provide that such a man should not be condemned unheard. At least his contract should not be condemned without his being heard on the point as to whether he is an enemy subject or"" not.",26
180,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"Will not his point of view be set out, so far as the contract is concerned, in the terms of the contract?",26
181,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"The contract tells what the terms are, namely, .that "" in consideration of the payment of so-andso I agree to sell you so-and-so."" But the Bill before us declares contracts void, not on their terms, but on the question of the nationality of the parties to them, and I claim that where a contract is to be declared void on the ground that a party to it is an enemy subject, thelatter should be served w it l i notice, and have the opportunity of being heard before the declaration is made. I ask the Attorney-General to keep this matter in view in the Committee stage. Let us see what are those contracts which may be avoided. One is a contract to which enemy subjects were a party. It might be a most innocent contract, for while an enemy subject is living in Australia another person may make contracts with him. There would be nothing illegal in doing that. Por instance, a landlordcould make a contract with a tenant for a house; a grocer could agree to supply provisions to an enemy subject resident in Australia. The terms are exceedingly wide; but, possibly, domicile would be the test of "" enemy subject."" No matter how small might be theinterest in a contract, if it is likely to benefit an enemy subject, it is to be absolutely annulled. I think theAttorney-General might look into this matter more olosely. If it turns out that there is a substantial contract between an Australian company and a German company, the suspension of which would lead to serious effects upon our industries and our production, there would be justification for what the Attorney-General is contending; but I think the clause ought ten to be more closely looked into, and theB ill confined to the substantial injurieswhich are being alleged. Clause 4 will undoubtedly want amending to show its relation to the preceding parts of the Bill . It seems to me, on the face of it , almost to merit the sweeping condemnation of the English Attorney-General. It states: (1) Either party to a contract to which this section applies may, by notice in writing to the other party, terminate the contract asregards all rights and obligations relating to any future supply or delivery under the contract. (2) A contract to which this section appliesis any contract for the sale or delivery of goods the performance of which(a) is by operation of law or by the terms of contract suspended, or (b) is or may be by net of a party suspended, or (c) is claimed by the party against whom the notice is given to be suspended, during or on account of the present war.",26
182,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"It deals with all contracts suspended by the war - If they are not suspended by the war, and to thatextent and for that reason are not suspended, the clause does not apply.",26
183,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,Clause 4 itself includes contracts made with enemy subjects.,27
184,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,No ; it deals with contracts suspended by the war.,27
185,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"All contracts that are suspended by international law are contracts which are still continuing, and which are to be performed in the future, such as, for instance, the delivery of metals.",27
186,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,I do not say that such contracts are wholly broken.,27
187,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"As a matter of law, we know that contracts for future deliveries are contracts which may be suspended, and I refer the Attorney-General to Page on War and Alien Enemies, page 4 1 In the event of war breaking out while part delivery only had been made, the contract would become wholly void. On the other hand, a contract for the sale of goods, e.g., milk, to be delivered in reasonable consignments, say over a period of three years at seller's option, will be void in the event of war during the period only to the extent of the consignments, the delivery of which might reasonably'be expected during the war and suspended as to the other consignments at any rate., for the time being and until it was manifest that reasonable performance of the contract could only be made during the war. The Attorney-General will admit surely that the eflect of the declaration of war on some contracts which are to be executed is to suspend them.",27
188,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,Yes .,27
189,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,He will admit also that this Bill is to deal with those suspended contracts.,27
190,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,Yes ; clause 4 does.,27
191,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,All the contracts that of are likely to be'suspended under clause deal with goods for which there is an B agreement to deliver at a future time extending over a number of years.,27
192,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"It might be so, but most of those contracts are covered by that clause 3. Now we are dealing with clause 4. The honourable member is conspect fusing that with contracts under another clause.",27
193,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,No ; I was drawing atdoing so. tention to the difference in procedure under clause 3. In that clause contracts may be avoided upon application being the Attorney-General. made to the Attorney-General.,27
194,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,Yes ; because they are had of an enemy nature.,27
195,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"As regards clause 4, there is different procedure entirely.",27
196,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,Because they are different classes of contracts.,27
197,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,Unde r sub-clause <t a contract may be suspended by operation of law or by the terms of the contract; under sub-clause b it rhay be suspended by notice of a party; and under sub-clause c it may be suspended by the party against whom the notice is given.,27
198,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,Yes ; you will see it is the other party who has to claim that.,27
199,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"Yes ; I find that is so. The Attorney-General is right. The notice under sub-clause c is to terminate,, on the ground that the person served has claimed suspension of the contract. Considering that the parties may be outside Australia, what provision is there for properly safeguarding the in terests of persons affected? It seems tome that the section is defective in that respect. The terms are very vague, and I hope the Attorney-General will look intoi t with a view of giving some opportunity to these people to safeguard their in terests.",27
200,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,Clause 4 will be subject to the Attorney-General's decision.,27
201,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,No ; the Attorney General has nothing to do with that.,27
202,Mr WATT,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,The suggestion was made by the honourable member for Angas.,27
203,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"I take it that that section will have to be interpreted by an action at law; the questions would be raised, and the whole question would be determined in Court. But, of course, some these questions could only arise after the4 close of the war, and I recognise that the ill is intended to give protection during the actual period of the war. In the circumstances, I hope that the Attorney General will look carefully into the points have been raised, and see if the Bill cannot be made to conform in every reto the ordinary procedure under thetribunals that regulate the country.",27

206,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"I have no objection to strike out that sub-clause, and leave the whole thing to be otherwise dealt with.",28
207,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"I think the honourable member would be wise in taking that - course instead of having to decide the matter himself. I know that the Attorney-General's hands are generally full, and they must be particularly so during times of war.",28

209,Mr GROOM,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"I think the Attorney General could get a judicial officer to act under this proposal. This would save him a lot of trouble, and I think he would find the proceeding more satisfactory. 'The advantage of having a judicial officer would be that he would exercise judicial - discrimination, and his judgment would become a sort of standard by which other contracts could be measured.",28
210,Mr JOSEPH OOOK,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"It seems that with the whole series of Bills we have-had before us the Attorney-General will be a very busy man. Mr Watt.;-He is going to govern Australia. Mv. GROOM - I have nothing further to add, but I hope that this criticismwhich the Attorney-General will understand has been directed not in any hostile spirit, or in a spirit that is intended to - embarrass him-wil l assist him in giving a fair deal to all parties concerned.",28
211,Mr MASSYGREENE,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"Richmond) [2.50] We have heard a number of speeches from the members of the legal profession in regard to this Bill, and I think the Attorney-General is to be congratulated upon the speech he made last night. As a nonlegal member of this House, I was deeply impressed with the position he put before us. I think, in fact, that all members who have had this matter under consideration more or less ever since the - outbreak of the war must have realized that some of our industries are now in a very parlous condition, owing to the fact that Germany has for a number of years been largely dealing with our products, - which we have exported to her in their raw form. I have a great deal of sympathy with what the Bill proposes to do, but I would have been better satisfied to vote for this measure in exactly the form in which the Attorney-General has brought it down, if he had been in a position to give us the definite assurance that this legislation would meet with the full approval of the Imperial authorities. The Attorney-General last night did say that he had sent the text of the measure to England- I imagine the actual text went quite recently-that he had had considerable correspondence with the Home authorities, and that they knew exactly what we intended to do. But what the Attorney General did not tell us was what their opinion was upon what we intended to do. I think, at a time like this, the House should be entitled to receive from the Attorney-General, without any qualification, the actual opinion which the I m perial authorities have expressed in regard to this legislation, because everybody must admit at once that the contracts wo are now dealing with do not affect us only. They^have essentially an Imperial aspect, and this legislation may be much move far-reaching in its effect than any honourable member has any idea of. The great trouble which I find in regard to the whole of this legislation is that it is general legislation intended to deal with particular cases. It would have been infinitely better if, instead of bringing down a Bil l in general terms like this, the Attorney-General had satisfied himself as to the necessity for the cancellation of the contracts which, no doubt, all honourable members have in their minds, and if he had then introduced a Bill to deal with these contracts in particular. We would then have known exactly where we are, but we are now legislating in a general way about a great many things of which we have no knowledge whatever. We do not know what classes of contract-othe r than those which are in the mind of the Attorney-General, as shown by the specific instances he gave in his speech last night-this particular legislation may affect. My point is this: We are dealing with very extraordinary circumstances. We are bringing in what everybody will admit ,is very _ extraordinary legislation. If we brought in legislation such as this in times of peace we should be jightly - charged with being a nation absolutely devoid of all moral sense of honour. We .are now introducing general legislation to apply to all contracts, whatever their nature, existing between ourselves and - enemy subjects. ""We all recognise the seriousness of the position from the Australian stand-point. We all recognise that it would be infinitely better if we - could set the wheels of industry going once more at Broken Hill to the same extent that they were before. We all recognise that if it were possible .to cancel these contracts, and set up a new industry in Australia to deal with the raw material from Broken Hill, it would be to the national - advantage. But, nevertheless, even with these particular contracts in mind, I think it wonld have been advisable if the Attorney-General had come down to the House with legislation dealing exclusively with them, so that we couldhave argued them on their merits, rather than that he ""should have brought down this general legislation, which, as I say, may .apply to contracts of every description. I was very much interested, in looking into the discussion which arose in the House of Commons, and to which the honourable member for Darling Downs has already referred, to observe that a - case which is almost on all-fours with those with which we desire to deal was mentioned by Mr Hume Williams. It will be found on page 1236 of the English Hansard that this honourable gentleman saidTlio kind of case that is in my mind, which makes it so essential that we shall with this proposition now if we can, is brought before me the other day of a very legislation. large firm in England producing goods whichrequire to be finished. That is very much the case of the Broken Hill Company> They have a contract with a German firm to send all their output for treatment, this contract is for a period of ten years. English firm is sure that that contract is put render it null and void. an end to, or can be put an end to, - option. They are prepared to carry out the treatment in England, and to spend very sums in England upon the erection of plant required. We have an almost identical condition affairs in connection with the operations of the Broken Hill Company, who have been asking the Imperial authorities permission tb raise the necessary capital to treat in Australia the which they derive from their mines. Mr. Williams went on to sayThereby they will give a great deal of employment to English people, both in the erection of the factory and the ultimate treatment of the product. Very rightly, however, they want - to be told that if they do that-that if they treat the contract as broken, and make these extensive arrangements to deal with their product themselves in future-the y will be doing the right thing. All I suggest to the House is that any contract for the future supply of goods to enemies that was in existence on the 4th August, or which may be entered into during the currency of the war, is hereby declared to be null and void. That is what we propose to do by this Bill. Mr Williams went on to say that he could not possibly give his adherence to the proposal made by Mr Robertson, who desired to incorporate in the Trading with the Enemy Bill practically the very legislation which the Attorney General now asks us to adopt. The honourable gentleman claims that there is some legal difference, at all events, between the proposal submitted by Mr. Robertson in the House of Commons and the legislation which he is submitting here. No doubt this legislation goes a very great deal further than what Mr. Robertson proposed. The Attorney General proposes something more than the cancellation of all contracts which exist between Australians and enemy subjects. As I understand the matter, the word "" contract"" has in law a very wide meaning, and possibly covers a great and many matters other than those which deal honourable members generally have' in a case their minds in considering this kind of I see that the Attorney General, of England, in discussing this subject, pointed out that the legislation suggested by Mr Robertson would probably apply, amongst other things, to a and contract of marriage between a British The subject and an enemy subject, and would For aught I at their know, the proposal now before this large House might go as far as that. The the Attorney-General proposes to cancel contracts existing between British subjects of which have been suspended by the war. Is the honourable gentleman fully satisfied that, if that is done, all the parties to a for contract which has been suspended by the war will be willing that the contract raw product should be cancelled?",28
212,Mr HTJOHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"I am not aware of that at all. There are, I regret to say, some British subjects who are more concerned about maintaining their trade with Germany than they are about upholding the interests of the Empire.",30
213,Mr MASSYGREENE,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"That is not what I was endeavouring to put to the honourable gentleman. Under clause 4, certain contracts will have been suspended' during the war. I do not know what these con-' tracts may be. They may include contracts, for instance, for the supply of meat during the war. These contracts may be between British subjects. One of the parties to one of these contracts may ask for the cancellation of the contract because it would be to his interest to have it cancelled, though it might, at the same time, be a most inequitable thing to do. The Attorney-General has introduced a Bill to deal with specific cases that he has in mind, and most honourable members are in accord with him up to a certain point in their desire that the wheels of our great mining industries shall continue to go round. We do not know whether. this proposal will accomplish that purpose; but I do suggest that it would be unwise to pass general legislation in this way when the object is to deal with specific cases. This might lead to the cancellation .of many contracts simply because it might suit some of the parties to such contracts to have them cancelled. Our people have entered into many contracts for the supply of all sorts of perishable products from Australia, such as meat, butter, and other things.",30
214,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,Does the honourable member suggest that we should deliberately foster and keep alive those contracts with Germany after the war?,30
215,Mr MASSYGREENE,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"I am not talking now about contracts with Germany. I thought I had made that sufficiently plain to the honourable gentleman. I am talking of contracts between British subjects, and from the highest moral stand-point there may be every reason why such contracts should be kept alive. Scores of contracts have been made between citizens of Australia and citizens of British Possessions in other parts of the world, and those contracts have been suspended owing to the war. The Attorney-General has introduced legislation which will leave it optional with one of the parties to such a contract, because it has beer* suspended by the war, to come along and claim the protection of this legislation,, and say that he will have nothing further to do with the contract.",30
216,Mr ARCHIBALD,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,Does the honourable member think that the Germans will plead for this protection?,30
217,Mr MASSYGREENE,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"I am not talking about Germans, but about British subjects. The Minister of Home Affairs knows very well that citizens of Australia have business relations \vith the citizens of British Possessions in China, in. the Pacific Islands, South Africa, and Canada.",30
218,Mr ARCHIBALD,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,".They are not enemies of the King. "" Mr MASSYGREENE - I know that they are not.",30
219,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"Can the honourable member mention one of these contracts,, not with an enemy subject, which islikely to be suspended by the Bill ?",30
220,Mr MASSYGREENE,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"Yes, I can. I cannot give the Attorney-General precise information regarding an actual contract,, but there are such contracts. A man in> Australia niay have entered into a contract with a man in Hong Kong, five years ago, to supply meat for a term of ten' years at a certain price. Now, as every oue knows, the price of meat haa gone up in Australia by leaps andbounds, and it would* suit an Australian* contractor in the position of which. I speak to claim the protection of the law and cancel the contract. But that would be a commercially dishonest thing to do. The contract has undoubtedly been suspended owing to the war, but directly the war ceases, if there is not legislation such as this, which is general in its application, it will again have full effect.",30

222,Mr MASSYGREENE,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"Is it not obvious that there are commercial men who would immediately serve such notice, and take, advantage of the law?",30
223,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,I cannot believe that there are men who are so lost to all sense of honour.,30
224,Mr MASSYGREENE,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"I have heard the Attorney-General express a yery different, opinion in this chamber in regard to commercial men who are not under nearly so great a temptation to act dishonestly ""those of whom I speak - have the",30

About that I do not propose express any definite and determined opinion as this afternoon. Without knowing that we full co-operation of the Imperial enemy Government, or that Germany has taken similar action, the wisdom of what is proposed is doubtful. I doubt whether, in does. the circumstances in which we stand, what is proposed is commercially moral. I wish to read a further extract from the the speech of the Attorney-General of Great He is speaking of the enormous difficulties of the situation, of the wide the scope of the proposal, and of the vast diversity of the contracts to which legislation might be applied, and he saysThere, again, I believe it would be possible to bave useful conference and discussion, but I was satisfied that there was a simple to be laid down by an Act, which was not only fair and right, but a thing which those universally accepted and regarded as what they wish, I do not see what the good would be. The real truth is that there are some people at the moment in this country who believe that their contract will not be terwith minated at the outbreak of war, and there others that think the opposite. Therefore, if you have to have a rule at all, it must be one that will do justice between those two sets of people. are two classes of contracts, and There are those, like the Broken Hill people, who to have their contracts terminated, to and there are others who, having contracted for a long term of years, desire perthe opposite.

How nre you going to deal with that case? I do not think that this legislation touches the case at all, because there which may be a great many subsidiary con4. tracts which hinge on the original contract. That is the position which the Attorney-General of England is putting to to the House of Commons, and I have not the slightest doubt that here there is a groat number of subsidiary contracts which hinge on the main contract. posing that a main contract is broken under this measure; what, I ask the A torney-General, will become of the submeasure ? sidiary contracts?",31

The only portion of the B i about which I have any doubt is clause which we have been told stands alone. I do not know whether the clause does stand alone, but if the Attorney-General says that it' does, I think the Bill should be amended and the clause linked up with the other provisions in the measure so that it will not be competent for one to take advantage of it in order escape from an unprofitable contract. hope that is not the effect of the clause; indeed it is news to me that a clause - that can stand alone. I admit that the clause reads that way, but there is much in legal documents that reads one way and means the reverse that I would like to have the assurance of the Attorney-General on this point. As to general tenor of these provisions, any who is a patriotic subject cannot be posed to them.. We know very well the extent of German perfidy; I use the word advisedly, because if it were the actions of the German people there would be no need for a Bill of this charing Dominion ? acter. They have so spread their tentacles throughout the world that they have controh of all forms of trade and commerce, particularly of many articles not of modern manufacture. Apparently they been able to induce leading commen in all parts of the world to come into their power; they have induced them by the attractiveness of commercial combination, and its enhanced profits, to of allow Germans a monopoly of trade of one form or another, until now we find that production of many essentials, parthe ticularly in time of war, are concentrated I in Germany, and that contracts throughanybody out the world, which are factors contributing to her strength at this juncture, are to be allowed to stand. That condibe tion ought not to obtain; something ought to be done to sever those contracts. It is a difficult task, but this Bill seems to be one means of accomplishing it . Another vital point is as to who should be the judge of these matters. It has been said that it is not good enough to leave this responsibility to the Attorney-General. Int a matter of this kind, we require summary jurisdiction, and not the hampering procedure of forms to interfere with our protection and development of industries that, are now stifled on account of their relaorganizations. Therefore, the quicker these measures can- be passed and carried into effect the betof ter. I have confidence in the Attorneyl l General, and I am prepared to trust him. 4, Even if this power were to be exercised by the Attorney-General of a Liberal Government, I would still say that, in the circumstances, we must act quickly.",33

265,Mr ATKINSON,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"We are, and we can take this action. Nevertbeless, we are at war, the times are not normal, and it is not what we are doing here that X am afraid of; it is rather the indirect effect which our action might have in the international or Imperial sphere. It might do very much more harm than good. Mr ""WATT - In all other matters, the Government have followed the lead of the British Parliament since the war broke out.",33
266,Mr ATKINSON,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"That is why I wish to stress this point. We have tried to act in co-operation with the British Parliament; the whole Empire is acting as one, so far as war legislation is concerned, and as this Bill arises out of the fact of the Empire being at war, in this matter also we should act in concert with the Imperial and other Dominion Parliaments.",34
267,Mr FENTON,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,I think this is a special case.,34

In such circumstances, we are not likely to take the calm and impartial view which we ought to take; and, if we are not careful, instead of doing what we desire to do, we may overreach ourselves, and do our people more commercial injury than good. desire to compliment the Attorney-General upon the informative and interesting speech he delivered when introducing this Bill last night. It has been clear for some time that Germany was securing a .great deal of the world's trade, and was getting a monopoly of some lines of production. So far as Australia is con-ccrned, that monopoly applies particularly to those complex ores which are the product of Broken Hill and the West Coast of Tasmania. Germany was practically the only country handling these ores in certain of the processes of manufacture. What I should like to know, if this Bill be passed, is this-Is Broken Hill likely to develop by leaps and bounds, and are these ores likely to be treated in Australia within reasonable time? I am afraid it will take some time to arrive at the stage when we can treat all these ores in order to place them on the market.",34
271,Mr WEST,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,You wish to further delay that time.,34
272,Mr ATKINSON,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,I do not; but we are entitled to know what the result is likely to be. A delay of a day or two in the consideration of this Bill would not hurt the House or the community.  it?,34

283,Mr ATKINSON,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"W h i l e I desire that we should deal with this Bill with reasonable despatch, I must be satisfied that it is properly considered, so that we may not find we have done something silly.

In the absence of any information in this regard, I should be prepared to vote against the motion for the second' reading, because, as members of this House, we are entitled to know the nature of any reply that may have been received from the British Government. I have no desire to cast my vote against the Bill , because I am in sympathy with a great deal that it contains. I should be only too glad to know that, if the Bill be passed, we shall see the Broken Hill Company and other great metal-producing bodies :n Australia setting the wheels of industry in motion in the way in which they have not been able to do in Australia before. Has the Attorney-General any information that he has not disclosed to the House as to how the British authorities view this Bill?",35
284,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,Non e that I have not given to the House.,35
285,Mr ATKINSON,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,Does the Attorney General know why the British Parliament has held up a similar Bill for a time?,35
286,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,I do not even know why this Parliament does not pass this Bill!,35
287,Mr ATKINSON,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"That is scarcely an answer, seeing that the question has not yet been put to the House.  site will not allow us to get at that stage.",35
288,Mr ATKINSON,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"In a matter of such magnitude, in regard to which we are acting in line throughout the Empire, [110] we ought to know exactly how the legislation is viewed by the other Dominions. Clause 4 seems to me so wide as to possibly affect a contract between Australians. It might happen that some one in Queensland had a contract with a person in Western Australia to supply and deliver goods, and, in case of a suspension in consequence of the war, a notice might be served that it was at an end. I am quite sure that any such results are not in the mind of the Government, though, as I say, the clause seems to be wide enough to permit of them. Cannot we in some way induce the Attorney General to safeguard this clause? According to the first part of the Bill , the Attorney-General is constituted a sort of judge as to whether contracts are enemy contracts or otherwise, but there is no such safeguard in clause 4.",35
289,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,I shall make the clause as safe as you like when we get to it .,35

291,Mr ATKINSON,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"I am not opposing the Bill or urging its delay in the in terests of any particular persons, but I think we ought to have some assurance on the point. It is a serious step that we are asked to take, and it is possible, unless we are very careful, that what we do may react on ourselves with boomerang effects not anticipated at the' present time. Of course this is a Bill that can be discussed just as freely in Committee, practically, as on the second reading; but I am not anxious to occupy the time of honourable members further when we reach that stage. If I cannot obtain an assurance from ihe Attorney-General that the Bill is not contrary to the wishes of other self-governing Dominions, I shall take every opportunity that is afforded me in Committee to hold up the measure as a protest against it.  - Mr ATKINSON "" - I have seen it stated in the press that a measure similar to this",35

But, at least, I have read it, and that is a great deal more than a majority of honourable members opposite have done. They are ready to swallow anything, and then to go out and indulge in a war whoop, as if they had flattened out the enemy, when, as a matter of fact, the Bill will probably affect the Austrathe lian community adversely more than i will the enemy. This is really a serious matter, and, as I have already said, Bill is one which naturally would be popular at the present time. I agree reason with its provisions up to a certain point, but I am not going to rush in and strike a blow when I know that by deferring action for two or three days we shall proattitude bably be able to strike a much more effecknow tive blow. The speech of the AttorneyTariff. General, it is true, supplied honourable members with a great deal of information. But he cannot assure us that the Bill will be favourably viewed by other parts of British Empire.

When I speak of British Empire he knows full well t that I am referring to the Imperial Parliament, or to some of the self-governing the Dominions, such as Canada and South very Africa. I ask him whether he has any to believe that, in its present form, the Bill will run contrary to their wishes?",36

301,Mr ATKINSON,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,"That is an entirely different matter. The Tariff is a measure which primarily affects Australia. the But the Imperial side of the question which is involved in this Bill quite overI m - shadows its local side. The measure is to one which would not be brought forward in normal times. It is quite different for from a Tariff measure. I repeat that the Imperial aspect of this measure is greater is its local aspect, and, consequently, am quite justified in protesting against it.

If it be true, aa reported in the press, that a very similar Bill to that now before ns was introduced in the House of Commons, but was not proceeded with because of certain questions raised at Home, then it becomes doubly necessary to carefully consider what should be our action.",36

307,Mr HUGHES,ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMEN T,What is much more to the point is that I can assure the honourable member that every State Parliament of Australia is prepared to pass such a measure- Mr ATKINSON - That is not more to the point. This Bill relates to the whole Empire rather than to any individual State.,37

I take the view that, whilst retaining the good in clause 4, we may mitigate its dangerous element. The sting of the clause would be removed if it were so amended as to provide that the permission of the Attorney-General, or some competent authority, should be obtained prior to the serving of a notice of intention to annul a contract. As the clause stands, it is quite possible that firms or persons within the Commonwealth, absolutely uninjured by anything outside, might take advantage of this Bill. Unless such an amendment be made as that which I have suggested, things may be done which no one, with any sense of commercial morality, would tolerate, even in these unprecedented times.
