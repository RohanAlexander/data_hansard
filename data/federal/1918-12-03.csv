I ask him whether the Government have now arrived at a dotermination on the subject? - Mr Watt - My previous answer was a well-considered one, and it still applies. IMPORTATION OF POTASH. meetings ?",20
3,Mr MACKAY,Unknown,"Doubtless , the Acting Prime Minister is aware that is a great scarcity of potash, from which the fruit-growers have suffered. I should be glad if the honourable gentleman would bring under the notice of the Prime ister (Mr Hughes), or the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook), or the High Commissioner, the advisability of having potash sent to Australia as soon as sible.",20

7,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF ALIE N,"It .has been reported to me that a rumour is in circulation in the Internment Camp - in New South Wales, that all interned alien enemies are to he deported, and there is a sinister suggestion of that kind in publio circulation as well. I should like to know if the Government have any proposal in that direction, and, if so, what its nature is?",20
8,Mr WATT,DEPORTATION OF ALIE N,I had not heard of the. rumour until the honourable gentleman mentioned it. I have indicated beforo that the Dominions will .doubtless think it wise to follow the policy adopted by Great Britain in matters relating to interned enemy subjects. That policy has not yet been determined. This Government will carefully consider the whole question 'before taking action. RACE MEETINGS .,20
9,Mr CHANTER,DEPORTATION OF ALIE N,"Las t week it was stated that the embargo would, be lifted off race meetings. Does that statement apply to both registered and unregistered",20
10,Mr WISE,DEPORTATION OF ALIE N,I understand that it apthere plies to all race meetings. SALE OF COPPER.,20
11,Mr HIGGS,DEPORTATION OF ALIE N,"Oh the 9th October last MinI asked the Acting Prime Minister whether ths Australian copper producers would he allowed to sell tiieir output in the Allied markets in the event of the posBritish Government not purchasing the copper after the '31st December.

I ask the honourable gentleman whether he does not consider that the time has arrived when we should be given a definite answer to the question?",20
12,Mr WATT,DEPORTATION OF ALIE N,"The honourable member, in addressing to me a number of questions about the sale of cooper, because of the interest in the matter in his electorate, appears to think that the subject is an easy one to settle. Bus questiony implythat all we have to do is to offer our copper to Italy,- France, Belgium, or America, and they will buy it . I am making inquiries as to whether it is possible to sell in the All i e d . free world, though I am doubtful whether it would give us any advantage if we could so. sell. I .am not forgetting the matter, because it is one of great moment. T in and copper are held up by reason of the alteration in conditions arising out of the armistice. SCHOONER *' HANDAISLE . "" ",21

14,Mr GREGORY,DEPORTATION OF ALIE N,"Has the Government come to any determination in regard to the holding' of an inquiry as to state of the Barambah before she lef t Australia?

A r e all the the Acting States to he supplied by the Commonwealth with money to carry out repatriation schemes, ""and, if so, can the Treasurer state what amount will be advanced to them ? Mr WA*TT - The Minister for Repatriation has explained on more than one occasion that the Commonwealth has undertaken to finance the States in connection With land settlement. I cannot' say definitely that all the States have come into the arrangement:; I think that Queensland is standing out. The amount, that will be spent cannot 'be stated at this stage. It will be a substantial sum, whether we spend it , or whether the 'States spend it . If the work is to be done, it will cost a lot of money. NA LONDON.",21
17,Mr HIG,COMMONWEALTH MINISTER I N,"GS - Do the Government propose to send a member of the Cabinet to London, to arrive there about the (date of the departure for Australia of the Prime Jitinister and the Minister for the' Navy.

AUSTRALIAN IMPERIA L FORCE. REMISSIO N OF SENTENCES-RE-APPOINT MENT OF RETURNED OFFICERS-FOR FEITURES OF PAY OF DECEASED SOLDIERS AND SAILORS-DEDUCTION S FROM PAY. * Mr MAHONY . asked the Acting Prime Minister,' upon notice In view of the signal service rendered to the Empire by Australian soldiers, and the termination of bostilities, and also the approach of the Christmas season, will the Minister exercise his clemency and grant a free pardon It is a to soldiers of the Australian Imperial Force, who have been imprisoned, and remit all fines and penalties imposed?",22
25,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH MINISTER I N,"The offence of desertion in - is a most serious one,"" and pending the period of demobilization it cannot be lightly regarded by the authorities of the The Defence Department. A f t e r peace has been declared the Government will give consideration to the claims for clemency for those soldiers who are undergoing punishment for being absent without leave, desertion, - and other similar offences while on active service - this",22
26,Mr WISE,COMMONWEALTH MINISTER I N,"On the 15th November the honourable member for New England (Lt - Colonel Abbott) asked the following - question: . In view of the glorious victory of the Allied armies, tb which the members of the Australian Imperial Force have, in large measure, contributed, I desire to ask the Minister representing the Minister for Defence whether he will take into his earliest consideration the question of recommending the remission of sentences and the pardoning of those members of our Forces who have heen found guilty of desertion, of being absent without leave, ancl of other similar charges, while on active .service ? I invite the honourable member's attention to the reply which has just been given by the Acting Prime Minister.",23
27,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH MINISTER I N,"the Assistant Minister for Defence, upon notice» Will the Minister add to the file now in the Library relating to the re-appointment of returned officers in the A.I.F., the cable messages from General Birdwoocl, T.1992 of 1.5th February, 191.8, and also cable T.3172 referred to in the cable message T.32I5, without which the file is apparently incomplete ?",23
28,Mr WISE,COMMONWEALTH MINISTER I N,"Cabl e T.1992 belongs to another file dealing with reduction of battalions in the Australian Imperial Force. In his cable of 20th February, 1918, - referring to the absorption of officers in that Force, General Birdwood referred to cable T. 1992 as an indication that the difficulty of absorbing officers, due'to the shortage of reinforcements, was increasing.' The reference to T.1'992 was explained in a - marginal note, but the precis prepared for the honourable member also contained in the third paragraph a reference to the reduction of battalions. The cable it self is a secret onedealing, with another matter, and it was thought that the marginal note and the reference in the precis were adequate to explain its bearing on the file* Cable T.3172 should read T. 3174, which is on the file.",23
29,Mr LISTER,COMMONWEALTH MINISTER I N,"the Assistant M in - 1917-18? ister for Defence, upon noticeWith reference to the amendment of the Financial Regulation No. 305 [318]- 2 gulation ^.3u, will the Government, having recognised the claim to consideration of dependants who have suffered as a result of forfeiture of pay of deceased sailors or soldiers |as from 1st July, 1918, give further consideration to this matter in the direction of making regulation retrospective to the commencing of hostilities in J914?",23
30,Mr WISE,COMMONWEALTH MINISTER I N,"This matter was full y considered by the Cabinet, which decided that forfeitures would only be remitted in the case of members who died subsequent to 1st July, 1918, and whose accounts had not been finalized.",23
31,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTH MINISTER I N,"the Assistant Minister for Defence, upon notice(1) Is it a fact that a numlber of soldiers' dependants have had deducted from their allotments amounts overpaid to them as separation' allowance, and that much hardship has thus been inflicted on entirely innocent persons? 2. In view of the fact that some of the responsibility for these overpayments rests with the Defence authorities, will the Government consider the advisability and fairness of assuming a proportion of the loss?",23
32,Mr WISE,COMMONWEALTH MINISTER I N,"The answers to the hon- . orable member's questions are as f o l low:1. When overpayments of separation allowance are made to dependants, the amount may bo recovered from the allottee by the reduction of the allotment to two-fifths of the soldier's pay, if payable to a wife only, and three-fifths if to a wife and children, which are the the amounts 'prescribed as the compulsory allotment. The allotment, if payable to a dependant, is never reduced below these amounts. Separation allowance is continued at the full rate. 2. Where it can 'be shown that overpayment is due to negligence on the part of officers of. the Department, the overpayments are not recovered from dependants. Consideration is now being given, to further relief in certain cases, such as where the soldier has died on active service. EEDERAL CAPITA L TERRITORY. REVENUEAND EXPENDITURE .",23
33,Mr MACKAY,COMMONWEALTH MINISTER I N,"the Minister for Home and Territories, upon notice,1. What is'the total amount of (o) salaries, (6) wages, and (c) other expenditure by the Government in the Federal Capital Territory for the financial year ended 30th June, (2) What amount of revenue was received War for the same period, and from what sources (clause 1), Rewas it obtained?",23
34,Mr OLYNN,COMMONWEALTH MINISTER I N,"'Detaile d information, is beingobtained, and the desired lars will be given as soon as inquiries now tion :in progress are completed. DEVONPORT HARBOR.",24
35,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH MINISTER I N,"the Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Is it a fact that a ship coming from a port outside Australia cannot enter the safe and important harbour in the River Mersey, Devonport, Tasmania, because there is no perananent Customs official located there? 2. Is it a fact that, uncier such a condition, the s.s. Wallsend will be prevented' from ing produce from Devonport to New Zealand? *S. l s it a fact that the Mersey Marine .have spent large sums of money upon the said port, with good effect, and that the revenue the Board will suffer as well as the interests of the producers of a large area if this things is allowed to continue, and to remedy the matter will the Minister at once appoint the local postmaster or harbormaster as a Customs official at Devonport?",24
36,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH MINISTER I N,"The - answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. Devouiport is not a Customs port, and vessels from oversea cannot, therefore, make it a first port of call. 2. No. After discharge of her inward cargo at a Customs port, she. can, if so desired, proceed' to Devonport and load an outward cargo there. As a matter of fact, the vessel has, on several recent trips from Adelaide to New Zealand, called, at Devonport for coal.. 3. I am not aware of the extent of ""the expenditure on the port, but presume such was incurred principally in the interests of the trade of the port with other parts of the Commonwealth, which trade is uot, of course, affected by its being closed as a Customs station. * - SEVENTH WAR LOAN.

37,Mr WISE,COMMONWEALTH MINISTER I N,"On * the 27th November the honourable member for Corio (Mr. Lister) asked the following question:Is the Acting Prime Minister aiwaro that returned soldiers employed in the Naval Guard, wliose services have recently been, dispensed with, are given 30s., or an order for that sum, with which to purchase a civilian' suit of clothes; and does he-not think that it is a moatinadequate provision.?. Will he considerthe advisability of increasing it , to enable the men to purchase a decent suit of clothes? I am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following inform-ar tion:"" The policy of the Department of Defence isNo. men on discharge from the oversea Forces are now given an order for a suit or any monetary allowance there for - A suit is supplied to such men as are entitled thereto. Suits are supplied from stock, and are made up from all-wool material, manufactured, at the Government Woollen Cloth. Mills.

Thosedischarged on account of reduction of establishment or disbandment of units, however, are permitted to retain the underclothing issued to them, by the military authorities. QUARANTIN E STATION, - TREATMENT OF SOLDIERS. MT. GREENE - On the 28th ultimo the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr. Finlayson) brought under my notice the following extract from a letter dated 24th idem, said to have been written by a returned soldier, regarding the treatment of soldiers at the Quarantine Station, Sydney, and I promised to have the matter looked into:- r . . . Well, fancy us landed back in Australia again, and in such style. serious, though,' here at North Head, and a good many chaps are pretty crook. ally, I spent moat of my time working my nut to get something to-eat. We had an awful time on the Medic. 'Nearly 200 patients were lying on the dirty troop deck, or in hammocks, whilethe old boat was rolling so - much that the movement made one's head ache worse, while all we had for meals was dry stale bitter hread, cut thick, with a scraping of doubtful butter. We have a good army of about t h i r ty sisters now, and they are doing their best to make our lives happy; but they find it hard to make bread out of stones. I am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following information:It would appear that the writer of the letter received by the honourable member is among, the patients who have been landed at North'Head. The statements relating to the 200 patients on the troop deck evidently refer to the conditions before the arrival of the vessel, concerning which I have not sufficient information, at present to be able to offer any comment. The statement that things are serious at North Head evidently refers to the fact that there were a large number of cases landed, some of which were seriously ill . This, as has already been reported, is a fact. Altogether over 400 patients have been, landed from the Medic, many of. whom had to be classed as seriously ill . The latest report received was to the effect that the Medic patients were improving, and the daily statement shows that this is so. The writer of the letter is evidently a patient, and it is necessary to keep patients on light diet. This might be the reason why he feels that ho is not getting as much as he wants to eat. It is difficult, in the absence of more definite information, to give a very complete answer; but I am confident,, from personal inquiries, that all hospital patients have as much food as is necessary in each particular case. As to the condition of food supply on the Medic, which is referred to in the second paragraph of thequotation, no information is at present available.. ARMISTICE HOLIDA Y AT PERTH. SYDNEY - Mr Webster!-On the 27th ultimo the honourable member for Perth (Mr. Fowler) asked the following questions:1. Was Wednesday, the 13th November, gazetted as a public holiday in Perth? 2. Have the postal officials been docked a day's pay for such holiday? 3. If so, why? I am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following ' information :1. Yes, as a State holiday. 2 and 3. All officers of this Department were Things are either given a holiday on the 12th Novemberthe holiday proclaimed by the Commonwealth Person- in connection with the signing of the armistice - o r received double pay as an equivalent. Similar arrangements were not recognised for the 13th, and any officers who were absent on that day have been granted leave without pay or to be deducted from recreation leave. CADET MIDSHIPMAN RUBLE.  vember, 1918, the honourable memher for Wentworth (Mr Kelly) asked the following question:As there is a lack .of complete arrangement between the doctor of the college, the Board of Surgeons in Sydney, and the Naval Board on the question whether Cadet Midshipman Rubie should - be allowed to return to the Naval College, I ask the Acting Minister for the Navy if he will permit the boy to be examined hy a first class specialist, who will not merely read the reports of the case, but wil l see the boy, with a view to finding out whether he should be returned to the college""? I now desire to inform the honourable member that I have discussed this matter again with the Naval Board, who, while ""sympathizing with the boy and his parents, rely entirely upon the opinion of the Director of Naval Medical Services, based on the report of the surgeon whoactually saw the boy in the fit, and are of opinion that, in the interests of the Navy and the boy himself, he should not be re-appoirited to the college.

He referred par9 6 14 1 ticularly to the expense of carrying water 0 117 18 4 tt 325 16 4 134 15 9 by train from Mordialloc, which is the 0 20 11 3 nearestpoint at which the Yam Yean 5- Nil supply can be tapped, to the railway 2 Nil station at Cribb Point, whence it is dis9 3 3 3 tributed to the Base. The honourable 3 125 1 6 7 140 11 0 member pointed out that sufficient use 0 12 16 7 had not been made of the enormous roof 10 59 18 "" 5 area at the Base, and of the numerous tanks in existence there, in order to sup996 12 U ply the officers who live there, and' the employees who are engaged at the Base from time to time. There is no doubt PAPERS. that for the last two and a half years the roof space at the Base has provided a catchment sufficient to supply the requirements of a largenumber of men. One fact which came under the notice of Committees which visited the Base was that no use was made of an enormous cement tank which had been constructed to hold the oil supplies when vessels of the Fleet are stationed, there. That tank has been full of water for the last two years, the object of keeping it full being, I believe, that the tank is thereby kept in a better state of preservation. But I should think that any ordinary cement tank would not deteriorate in quality if quantities of the water it contains were used, and it seems to rne that the authorities might have drawn water from that tank. At any rate, the vast roof area of the Base buildings should have been utilized in order to reduce the cost of bringing from Mordialloc .by train. I am glad to know, however, that that expenditure will soon cease. The Department will be incurring a new expenditure of something like £4,000 per annum by supplying Base - with water fro m the New Upper Bunyip scheme, but that outlay is amply justified. The officers and cadets at the held responsible. Naval depot at Williamstown will be moved to Plinders in the course of three or four months, and with water laid on from the Upper Bunyip scheme, the at. Flinders will have a very fine supply, independent of Yan Yean and any roof catchment.",25
39,Mr JOWETT,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,I suppose the large to which the honourable member referred was built .in order to allow o i l to thrown on the troubled waters.,27
40,Mr FENTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Where that tank is situated the waters are never very sea. troubled, and I should like at this stage to correct a misapprehension ou the of honourable members when they speak of Hann's Inlet. Their remarks would lead one to believe that they are speakof ing of the whole of Westernport, or, the Naval authorities term it , Port Western. The latter is undoubtedly one of the finest ports in Australia. Hann's Inlet, as its name implies, is only an from the Port, and sometimes there is very little water in it , but it has described by Admiral Henderson as mirably adapted for the accommodation and repair of submarines and destroyers.",27
41,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Where did Admiral Henderson mention-that matter?,27
42,Mr FENTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I understand that did mention it . We are told by experts that at Hann's Inlet we can secure - dredging what is known as still water, which is. absolutely essential for ' marine and destroyer base.",27
43,Mr FOWLER,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"We could get still water in any paddock 'along, the shore that cared to dredge. We might have done .better by going into such a paddock.",27
44,Mr FENTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"But you will not find a splendid port adjacent to such a paddock as there Hann's Inlet. I - am quite in agreegrown ment with the criticism of honourable members and the press in regard to . waste that has occurred at Flinders. It took died. water place largely in the initial stages of the work, but at the present time there is but little waste going on. As to the blame for the waste ..that has occurred, I hold that the Minister who authorized it , and the the Naval Board who recommended the appointment of certain individuals in the initial stages of . these works, should be I am not going to reblame any minor officer. ' I would go to the very top, and place the responsibility upon the Minister who appointed the first Base Director of Naval Works; while to an even greater degree the Naval Board are responsible for the early appointments that were made at both the Flinders and tank Henderson Naval Bases. They are largely responsible for the mistakes that have be been made, and which will cost the people thousands of pounds. The money might just as well have been thrown into the Even at a later date, Ministers have partbeen disposed to approve of ornamental schemes. I have frequently wondered at - the audacity and the. spendthrift capacity the Minister who authorized the creaas tion of an ornamental plantation around the naval reserve at Flinders. ' The reserve was well covered with native trees. These, - however, were cleared away to inlet' the extent of a chain inside the fence, and ornamental trees were planted. Even. been if the work had cost only £ 5 , it would adhave been a waste of money; but the clearing alone must have been an expensive job. Both the responsible M i nister and his officers should have realized that any expenditure"" on ornamental . he work during war-time would be an absolute waste of money. Nothing can justify by the expenditure of even one penny in respect of this ornamental plantation. a sub- - Mr GROOM - When did this treeplanting take place? '",27

51,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,The tree planting took place two or three years ago-lon g before I came into office.,28
52,Mr FENTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I am not blaming the Minister, who has only recently taken charge of his Department. I point to this kind of expenditure in the hope that I shall prevent any recurrence of it . I wish now to draw attention to the expenditure of some £8,000 on the purchase of theFairy Meadow Estate, in New South Wales. So far as I can judge, the property is not worth £8,000. . Mr Riley - Then the honourable memher does not know a good property when he sees one.",28
53,Mr FENTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I am referring to the property acquired in connection with the proposal to establish cement works. When the Public Works Committee reported that it was of value for cement-making purposes, the New South Wales Government and the owners of the property suddenly discovered that it was worth more ' than they had thought. We should have fuller particulars as to the acreage and the nature of the country for which this large sum of money is to be paid. I understand that the construction of the Arsenal has been postponed for the time being. Wherever the Arsenal be . constructed, the steel-works section of it* must be of far-reaching importance to the Commonwealth. Although our views in regard to the requirements of an ordinary .naval and military Arsenal may be considerably changed as the outcome ol the war, there can be no doubt that steel works, owned by the Commonwealth, and conducted on proper business lines, would be of immense value, to the .people of Australia. I had hoped that a great steel works would shortly be established and controlled by the Government, The works at Lithgow and Newcastle are not sufficient for our requirements, and a Commonwealth-owned steel works would be valuable for the construction of girders and steel' plates used, j i o t only in connection with ship building for naval, but also for mercantile purposes, and also, I am satisfied that the Commonwealth could turn out such steel manufactures for much less than private companies are charging today. The time is fast approaching when the Government will need to have large steel ""and engineering works, capable of turning out various manufactures, if only to check the increased prices exacted by manufacturers. Some years ago theTe was a lengthy discussion in this Parliament in regard to the cost of manufacturing harvesters, and the Victorian Government allowed the manager of the Newport Workshops to construct one.",28
54,Mr TUDOR,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"That-wa s at the instance of the Royal Commission which was in-, quiring into the question.",28
55,Mr FENTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"But the State Government had to give their ""consent. I may say that that Royal Commission obtained some most valuable information in regard to this class of machinery; and the manager of the Newport Workshops prepared for the Government an estimate of the cost if he were given an order to turn out a certain number of machines.",28
56,Mr SINCLAIR,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,All this did not reduce the cost of the harvesters ?,28
57,Mr IFENTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Because, unfortunately, we had a succession of Governments whio did not properly grip the question. The rural producers are being charged high prices for machinery and other material they need; and, strong Protectionist as I am, I urge that a curb should be put on manufacturers who endeavour to extract exorbitant profits in this way.",28
58,Mr CONSIDINE,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Why not take over the industry?,28
59,Mr FENTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Where an industry cannot be taken over altogether, it is wellto have such works, so that on the shortest notice different machines may be turned but, and the - cost compared. It is true that in some of the States in dustries have been nationalized with great benefit to the people. The statement by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) has removed some of my objections to this loan schedule. I should have liked to say something about the Murray Waters scheme, and to point out that before - we spend large sums of money, we ought to know that the key of the position has been satisfactorily settled. A newspaper report tells us that the Victorian Government are prepared to accept the advice of their officers and to have the main storage dam on such a part of the Murray as to result in some of the most productive and fertile country in that part of Victoria being flooded - Of course, the assent of the New South Wales experts has to be obtained to this selection of a site, but it certainly seems to be a wrong procedure when some of what should be subsequent work is proceeded with before the site of the main storage dam has been fixed.",28
60,Mr ARCHIBALD,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Victori a has never been' very strong about the scheme at any time.,29
61,Mr FENTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"And we have wondered whether South Australia desires the scheme for irrigation or navigation, though we think it is mostly for the latter. It is , important to know how much water is to be drawn from Victorian streams, and what proportion of water is to be .obtained by Victoria after the scheme is settled. We in Victoria are not so much concerned with navigation as. with the question whether we are to be deprived of waters. At any rate, the main storage scheme has yet to be settled, though the Commonwealth Government are handing money out to the various State Governments concerned. It appears to me that if this money is not - wisely spent, it will be absolutely wasted, in view of the fact that we do not yet know what k in d of scheme is to result.",29

However, I do not wish to raise the question of the rightness or wrongnsss of acts in the past, but merely to state the present position.",29

64,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"At the same time, it is an elementary principle of responsible government that the Cabinet as a whole must take the responsibility for a series of works of the kind, and the Minister must share the responsibility for the corporate acts of his Cabinet. The honourable member's questions were based on a report of a number of statements, some of which are inaccurate, some unfounded,' and some misleading.",29
65,Mr RILEY,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Is there any truth at all in them?,29
66,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I shall presently show the honourable member. The Director of Naval Works, I may say, is' not responsible for all that has been done at this place.",29
67,Mr TUDOR,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Hear , hear !",29
68,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"No r is the present Minister responsible. These works were formerly carried out by the Naval Department under various officers, and the present Director of Naval Works has turned his attention and. energy to secur-: ing economy and efficiency. Honourable members who have sat on various Committees of Inquiry, and have examined that gentleman's work, will agree that he has done his best in the public interests'. In regard to the works referred to in the Age, the officers of the Public Works Department are not responsible, since they carried out by officers of the Naval * Department. The first allegation made r . in the newspaper statement to which the based on honourable member referred isPurely ornamental works, carried out as part of a discarded scheme of "" beautification,"" are returning, or have already returned, to a state of nature. What has been done has not been discarded, and there is an employee down there now looking after the place. The Director of Naval Works reports",29
69,Mr FENTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,What did this work cost ?,30
70,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I have not got the cost.. The Director of Naval Works reportsThe purely ornamental works which - have heen carried out in the past have not heen discarded. They are of a minor character in front of the buildings. They will he enlarged from time to time as the base develops. The newspaper goes on to sayA typical instance of an expensive alteration in the plans originally adopted is furnished in the selection of a site for the infectious diseases hospital, and the construction of a road leading thereto. The road,' ahout a mile and a half long, was formed and made with bluestone and ironstone on top of spawls, at a cost of £1,750, including the cost of attempting to make it previously with unsuitable, materials. Along one side of the road a footpath was partly gravelled, and along the other side a shrubbery was planted. It was then decided that the hospital site was in the wrong place, and the road has been abandoned and the shrubbery is fast becoming scrub. Similarly a "" serpentine road,"" as it has been named, partly, graded, levelled, channelled, metalled, and rolled, and, for no apparent reason, is being allowed to revert to a rabbit warren. To this the Director of Naval Works re-' plies^The present approved site for the general hospital affects only 400 yards length of the road, which has already been formed to the original site of the hospital. The road which is referred to as being one and a half miles long, not only gives access to the hospital, hut also the official residences. Strictly speaking, the greater part of this road is primarily for the residences, and the road to the original site to the hospital was a branch from it. An attempt to make a portion of this road previously with unsuitable material, refers to the trial length of road which was laid with local ironstone gravel obtained on. the site. This ironstone gravel proved after a trial to be unsuitable. Had it proved suitable, a great saving in the construction of the roads would have been effected. The trial was well worthy of the small cost involved. The so-called "" serpentine road,"" refers to the approach road to the official residences, from which the road referred to above branches to the hospital site. "" It is incorrect and altogether misleading to state that this road is being allowed to revert to a rabbit warren. No .labour is being spent on the road, of course; but it is not nnder use. and no harm is being done to the road. A reference is also made to the boundary fence, which is said to be "" a standing joke,"" but, as a matter of fact, the boundary fence of the Naval Base at Flinders is an ordinary post-and-wire fence, and is in good condition. It is incorrect and untrue to state that hundreds of pounds have been thrown away on an 8-mile avenue of trees, as' all the trees planted over the whole 8 miles were, obtained, without cost, from the State Plantation Department, the only cost being involved in the planting. The only trees purchased were special trees for the avenue at the Base, and these were purchased at a total cost of £ 1 7 10s. I am sure that honourable members will not adversely criticise the attempt to ornament the place by the planting of suitable trees.",30
71,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Are they growing?. ,30
72,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Yes. . There is a. man at the Base part of whose duty it is to look after them.,30
73,Mr FENTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,The greatest expense was in the clearing of the scrub for the planting of the ornamental trees.,30
74,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"We have had a long discussion on the question of the water supply. The newspaper paragraph contains the statement-All the fresh water required is brought down from. Mordialloc. . . . There are about thirty buildings, including a drill hall measuring 200 feet by 100 feet, and it is obvious that, except in abnormally dry weather, which is rarely experienced in these parts, tanks attached to the buildings would supply all the present requirements. A number of 1,000-gallon tanks are said to be stowed' away unused. The answer from the Director of Naval Works isThe question of water supply in connection with the commencement of dredging operas tions at the Base wa3 fully considered, and it was found to be cheaper to utilize existing water supply by extending the pipe down to the dredging jetty than to provide tanks, with all their down-pipe connexions, to the existing buildings. With regard to the water supply for the buildings, I have not seen, nor do I now see, any reason for altering the method of obtaining the supply which has been in operation for so long a time, especially in view of the fact that the water supply which is being provided by the State Rivers Commission was expected to be in operation this year. Honourable members are aware that the buildings referred to are scattered over a very large area,, and the wharfs are atsome distance from them. It would involve considerable expense to make the water from the roofs of the buildings available for the dredges. I raised this question myself some months ago, and it was pointed out to me that to obtain the tanks necessary, and guttering, and downpiping to lead into the tanks, and piping for the distribution of the water from the buildings, would involve considerable expense, which would not be justified in view of the fact that we are about to obtain a supply from the State Rivers Commission.",30
75,Mr TUDOR,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Does the Minister say that the buildings are not supplied with guttering and down-piping?,31
76,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"They may be. I do not for a moment undertake to say that I know whether the buildings being constructed by the Works and Railways Department throughout the Commonwealth are all supplied with guttering and down piping. .1 must act upon the reports of the officers of the Department. The Minister who tries to be an expert for every branch of work in his Department will run the country into needless expense, and will probably make a hopeless mess of his job.",31
77,Mr TUDOR,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Does , the Minister say that his officer told him that the buildings were not supplied with, guttering and down piping?",31
78,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"No , I do not say that he did. I refer to the cost of connecting the supply from the roofs with the different places at which the water was required.",31
79,Mr TUDOR,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"The Minister used the word ""guttering.""",31
80,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Perhaps I did, but I am speaking of the cost of distributing the water from the buildings throughout the area. In view of the fact that we will shortly have a water scheme connected with the' State's water, supply, the - director advised that it would not be right to go to expense to make use of the supply from the roofs of the buildings, and I acted upon his advice. With respect to the statement that there are a number of 1,000 gallon tanks stowed away at the Base, I am informed lhat there are not, and that the statement has been made without any foundation. The newspaper article refers to another.complaint in these termsOne of the most serious allegations made is in connection with, the burning of useful tools and material, A few months ago, it is stated, about 150 by no means worn-out shovels and picks, complete with handles, a number of obsolete rifles, and some rubber boots were gathered together in a heap and burned. The Director states that this is an absurd statement. Honourable members know that at the conclusion of every big job there are a lot of tools which have become absolutely useless.  every private, contract.",31
81,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"That is so. The Director saysTlie shovels, picks, &c, were the property of the Navy Department, and were lying there for years awaiting condemnation. These were lately condemned, and, according to the usual policy, destroyed, consideration being given to utilizing any part that could be used. With respect to the allegation that rifles were burned, the Director' informs me that no rifles at all were destroyed. In view of its expressed desire that we should foster and encourage native industries, the next allegation in the newspaper article is of considerable interest. The statement is madeMuch has already been written about the unsuitable suction dredge that was constructed at the Base to assist in the work of dredging a channel through the wharf, which was deliberately built high and dry above the water. The dredge is derisively known among the workmen as "" the jam factory,"" probably because of its ramshackle appearance. The article continues in a similar vein. On this matter the Director reportsAt the beginning of the operation of this dredge, there was some trouble, but it was put to rights at the contractor's expense. The dredge is doing good work now, and is considered a suitable machine. The remarks about anchors being lifted, show want of knowledge of dredging.",31
82,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,What will be done with this dredge when she has finished her work at the Naval Base ?,31
83,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,The honourable member is getting on to another point now.,32
84,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,It is a very i portant point.,32
85,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"It is, h u t the present Director of Naval Works had nothing whatever to do with this matter. If I find that u n fair charges are made against officers of the Department of which I am Minister, it ""is my duty to correct those misleading statements, and give the public fair in formation. This dredge, as a matter of fact, was constructed by a Victorian firm, which has the reputation throughout the Commonwealth for splendid workmanship. This firm previously constructed another dredge, which did its work excellently, and, so far as the acceptance of the contract for this dredge was - concerned, whoever was Minister responsible at the time, was, in my opinion, perfectly justified in accepting the bender of a firm having such a reputation. There was some difficulty in operating the dredge at first, but the trouble was remedied at the cost of the contractors, and the. dredge is now working satisfactorily. So. I say that the newspaper statement on this subject is: misleading and unfair to a great Australian firm,- who are doing their best to give the Australian people the best workmanship possible.",32
86,Sir ROBERT BEST,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,What is the explanation of the wharf which was connot structed on dry land?,32
87,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"That is a matter of history, which has been investigated the Public Works Committee, and there would be no profit at this stage in ing upon a discussion of it . Mr RICHA BD FOSTER - The Minister should make no mistake about that. A p parently every one knows of these things ' but the members of this House.",32
88,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,The honourable member will permit me to say that it is certainly not the f a u l t of the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory)*if the mempossession. bers of this House do not know all about served that matter.,32
89,Mr RICHABTJ FOSTER,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I say that they ""should know it through the Minister in charge of the Department.",32
90,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,The honourable member for Dampier brought this matter before m - the notice of the House long before I took office as Minister for Works and Railways. Mr RICHA BD FOSTER - Why did not the responsible Minister bring the matter before the House?,32
91,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,I am not here to say why Ministers who preceded me did noy do certain things. I am at present answering certain allegations that .have appeared in the press.,32
92,Sir ROBERT BEST,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,This is an important matter.,32
93,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"It is, but it is a matter which has been investigated by the Public Works Committee, and referred to, I think, in its reports.",32
94,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Not the dredging.,32
95,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"No , I was referring now to the construction of the wharf.' I do not say that that can be justified. A mistake was apparently made there. Mr RICHARD FOSTER,-When the M in ister becomes aware of a mistake and keeps the information to himself he is to blame ",32
96,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,I disclaim responsibilit y for that doctrine. This is a matter which was reported to the House long ago. Mr RICHAR D FOSTER - ' Never by a Minister.,32
97,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Whether the honourable member's statement is correct I can say. But I decline to accept responsibilit y for matters which were brought bepast fore Parliament some years ago, and to bywhich it is alleged no answer was then given. Then allegations were made in enterregard to punts and pipes. In reply to these the Director of Naval Works saysGalvanized pipes were bought second-hand. - They were the only pipes procurable at the time, and show - little or no wear. The statements in regard to the punts are not correct. The punts are now working satisfactorily. Then the allegation was made There are two motor launches at the Base, one a hired boat and the other a Government The former is used for towing and other practical work, while the latter is reexclusively for conveying three OT four officials from place to place. Tn reply, the Director states;- . The Government launch is not entirely used' for conveying two or three officials. It is used for necessary 'Official - supervision, towing and .stores, and general utility. The use of the launch .by everyone without authority was stopped, and its nse regulated by proper direction. 'The article f u r the r allegedOpposite the officers' quarters a miniature 'botanical garden has been laid out."" Loads .upon loads of soil have been carted there, ' and .ornamental paths, with a foundation and a surface capable of carrying a ten-ton vdiicle, .have heen made for the officers merely to walk on. In aBply the Director says[These allegations refer to roads and footpaths round single officers' quarters. statements are absurd. The only soil taken has been - from excavation or formations of adjoining roads, which have been utilized for necessary - filling round quarters. Than there is an allegation that.Some time ago icarpenter-s and others were - put on .to construct a "" conservatory"" at the house of one of the officers. The Director saysNo conservatory was ever built. It is also allegedJSear the omcers' quarters a storm-water drain was dug about 8 chains long and 3 feet deep. Earthenware pipes were laid down and jointed, andone day the ganger in charge ordered that the pipes should be broken up and left in the trench, ""Which was subsequently, with great haste, filled in. The drain had ibeen put idown in the wrong place. The Director of Naval Works cannot understand to what storm-water, drain these statements refer. As to the mainsewer, it is allegedVariations of the original orders given to the men on a job are frequently made. In laying the main sewer from the hack of the sailors' quarters to the sea, some of the pipes had been laid and cemented before it was discovered that the trench was not deep enough, unless water could be made to run up hill. In reply the Director saysNo main sewer was .ever deepened because it was laid to run up hill as alleged. Such a .statement is utterly without foundation. The final .allegation wasDuring - a period of about a year practically all work was suspended at the Base, hut the full clerical and official staff was kept on the same as when 500 to 600 men were employed there. In reply the ""Direc tor saysThis statement is entirely without foundation. The staff was reduced from time to time as the works were Teduoed. Before allegations of this kind are published in the press-allegation s which are unfair alike f>o the public and to the offi„ cers concerned-it would be better if in quiries as to their accuracy were made of the Department. - Mr ARCHIBALD - They make good "" copy,"" do they not ?",32

100,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Certainly ; however, I am not dealing with politics justnow. The public are entitled to know the facts, and if inquiries were instituted in respect of matters of this kind, before such allegations - were published, much misunderstanding would be avoided, whilst that course would be much fairer to the officers concerned.",33
101,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Dampier) [ 4 . 5 ] The statement made by the Acting Prime Minister in regard to the work to be carried out under the loan proposals of .the Government came as a great relief to honourable members. In ' connection with all future undertakings, I think we are justified in demanding that we shall be supplied with a complete estimate of their ultimate cost before any expenditure is in curred upon them. It is absolutely u n fair to honourable members that a work, the total cost - of which will be £2,000,000 or £3,000,000, should be initiated on a vote of £20,000 or £30,000. Whenever any new proposal is submitted for our consideration, the Minister in charge of it should be compelled to tell us exactly what are the intentions of the Government in respect of it .",33
102,Sir ROBERT BEST,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,It used to be the practice to set out the ultimate cost of any work in a footnote attached to the Estimates ,33
103,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Yes . Take tii pro- 6 posal to build an Arsenal by way of illustration. I am one of those who believe that the Commonwealth alone should control the manufacture of munitions. When it is known that the ultimate expenditure upon the building of an Arsenal will be something in the vicinity of £3,000,000, the House should be made cognisant of the fact before the - work is started. Some time ago, I brought under the notice of honourable members a statement made by an officer before the Public Works Committee to the effect that it would cost £i,750,000 to accommodate the employees who will be engaged at the Arsenal-to provide them with all the conveniences of a township, such as water supply, sewerage, lighting, &c. Tb-day this would cost £2,500,000. It must be apparent, 'therefore, that the ultimate cost of this undertaking will be approximately £3,000,000. Up to date, there is not one person whohas supplied a report in connection with this proposal who can be classed as an expert. way in which the site for the undertaking has drifted to a point 7 miles south of Canberra is very significant. Honourable members will doubtless recall the occasion when Mr Griffin's Federal Capital design, wasaccepted. A little later, the Works Department built up a plan of its own-a composite plan-which was. founded partly on Mr Griffin's design, and partly on a design of its own. Under Mr Griffin's, design, it will be collected that the civic and business centre of the Capital was to be located on the north side of the artificial lakes, facing the parliamentary buildings. It was, unquestionably, a beautiful site. the Department desired the civic and business centre of the Capital to be situated on the south side of the lakes. Later on, when a proposal to build additions to the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow was being inquired into by the Public Works Committee, the Director of Works told that body, that he could erect a new factory, which would not only house the additional machinery proposed to be purchased for the Lithgow Factory, but also the plant which was already installed there, for less than the additions at Lithgow would cost. It was then suggested that this factory should be established on the south side of the Federal Capital city, a site which, undoubtedly, would tend to create a business centre south of the lakes. Subsequently an Arsenal Mr Gregory. Committee was appointed, which recommended the location of the factory on a site 7 miles south of Canberra. We are justified now in having the best expert advice that it is possible to obtain - before work of that sort is started. I pointed out here, last year, that, when the war is over we shall know exactly what class of munitions we require, and be able to get the best expert advice to aid us. What is more, we shall be able to buy the best and most up-todate machinery that is being scrapped now in all the big factories, for, perhaps, .100 to 200 per cent, less than it would cost us today. There is no urgency requiring us to purchase immediately. I wish honourable members could only realise the blunders that have taken place in the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow. The Years ago, wheu Sir Thomas Ewing was Minister for Defence in this Chamber, he initiated that work, and Admiral (then Captain) Clarkson was sent to the Old Country to report. He was able to visit the factories in Great Britain and America, and obtain special information; but, so far as I can learn, he has never been consulted in any shape or form in regard to the Arsenal project. When the Small Arms Factory was initiated, re- - Captain - Clarkson visited America, and purchased a plant from Messrs. Pratt, Whitney and Company. This was erected' under a special working guarantee, and Parliament was informed that under AusBut tralian conditions we could manufacture rifles for £ 3 9s. l d . each - If overhead charges and interest on capital were added, I am satisfied that £12 or £13 per rifle would not cover the actual cost. I would not care so much for that if , when the money was expended, the output had been up to the mark.",33
104,Mr LYNCH,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Do you mean to say that . the rifles were no good?,34
105,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I do not say that of all of them; but some were so vile that we might as well have sent our boys to the Front with their hands tied behind their backs as armed with some of the rifles turned out from that Factory. When I was in Perth, certain information reached me, and I informed the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams), the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford), and the honprable member for Melbourne. (Dr Maloney), who were there at the time.",34
106,Mr LYNCH,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Is there full proof of that last statement of yours?,35
107,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Yes ; I do not say these things unless I am sure of them. I examined the matter fully.,35

The big majority would not fit the cartridge, and in others the rifling was broken. I saw three with forearms smashed in two like bits of rotten carrot. I saw two with the bolts so loose that you could release the clip any point of its transit. I also heard fifty rifles that went to Claremont, which nineteen were useless.",35

I picked' .up one, and said, "" This . is just as. bad the one I saw."" It s bolt was so loose that you could release the clip at any point of its transit. The Department has since been making excuses by saying it was the bolt out of another, rifle ; but it is very peculiar that this - should occur with a new rifle in the Commandant's own office. I came over here, and put the matter before Senator Pearce. He sent Colonel Dodds over to Perth, who brought back all the parts I have mentioned; at our suggestion, he sent Lieutenant H a r f to Lithgow to pass the rifles before they were sent Afterwards I received a letter from the foreman in the Factory, who had read my remarks in' Hansard, bearing out my statements. Sir Joseph Cook also got an anonymous letter at the same time, which he handed to me, and that also bore out what I said. The writer stated that when Lieutenant H a r t went to the Factory hundreds and hundreds of rifles which were there ready to be sent out had all - been condemned, and ""were then in the in an effort, to I save something frpm. the wreck. That Since even four months after the war started, we On the never sent a rifle out of Australia, and it is only in the last eight months thab of we have made the Mark VII .

We were at Lithgow recently, and of' we saw they hadj a Lewis gun there, but I do not believe they have ever turned out a single machine gun from, The whole - trouble is caused by political interference with If we get a good manager, and give him power, - I have no doubt that the Factory will do good work, but there has been political interference there almost from the jump. II n face of what I have said, it is not . "" right to allow the same Department to something like £3,000,000 in establishing an Arsenal, where we may have the same trouble and chaos as has ocas curred in the Small Arms Factory. I have already said a good deal in this Chamber about the Naval Bases. I told honourable members about the wharf being, built on dry .land at Westernport-ho w the engineers erected a huge wall round the foreshore, built a wharf back from the foreshore on dry land, and then made a huge excavation in which to drive their piles.' - They said they could not drive the piles in the. sand.",35
112,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Is it intended out. for a wharf or an observatory ?,35
113,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I have never heard of a dry wharf before, and was wondering if it was intended for a dry dock. I made a mistake the other night in saying that, after tke matter was pointed out to the engineer, the huge .excavation had been discontinued. The Minister informed me since, as his officers have since been down there,, that that saving was not effected, because the whole . excavation was made, but that it was not made for the full size of the wharf, which is shaped like an L . When I was there I distinctly saw the piles driven through the sand. If engineers are troubled with shifting sand they can get r i d of any difficulties the sand may create by using a water jet. I am convinced that that huge excavation was made for the sole purpose of providing labour. mitted by the Department, in answer to my questions, that the cost of removing that sand, which should have been from ls. 6d."" to ls. 9d. per yard, was actually 9s:. 4d. One member asked one of the men, "" How much a yard is this work costing?"" and he replied, "" I do not know how much a yard it is costing, but -1 can give you a fair idea hpw much it is costing a bally shovelful.""",36
114,Mr LAIEDSMITH,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Who was responsible for all this?,36
115,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I want to get to the point of responsibility for the startMessrs. ing of these works, because the same of thing as has gone on at Westernport high has also happened at Cockburn Sound. appointment. There has been a decided change in the administration of these works during the past two years. . The present Director of Naval Works came out specially fro England, and I believe, - if. he is given the freedom that the present' Minister gives him, he will do really good work for us. One can form a very fair judgupon ment on these matters as - a member of the Public Works The Director has had great experience, and is well able to make re Mr. commendations i'n regard to big works of this sort. I asked when the Naval to Board and the Minister approved of these works, and the reply would lead one to understand that that approval was fixed upby the Minister and the Board after lay-out plans had been approved. before me thesworn evidence of Mr . Settle, where he says there were no working details prepared. He statesI . do not say that no plans at all had been prepared, because Messrs. Coode, MatthewB, Fitzmaurice, and. Wilson had prepared and submitteda scheme to the Naval Board, and l the work that was being carried out at the Henderson Base was generally in accordance with that scheme. It was, however, merely elementary work, such as would form part of any scheme that might be adopted.. That was early last year. If honourable members will consult the Budget figures they will see what is looked upon as. elementary work from a Ministerial point of view. The expenditure on the Henderson Naval Base up to 1917-18-carry ing us up to almost eighteen months ago It was ad- - wa s £580,000. If we subtract from that £100,000 paid for land in the neighbourhood, it leaves a sum of £480,000. We might as well, at the same time, acquaint ourselves afresh, with the figures concerning the Flinders Naval Base. The expenditure up. to June, 1918, was £471,000. Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN. - There was some engineeringthere, but it was political engineering, ",36
116,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Yes . Mr Settle continuesThere .were no working details prepared. King Salter, Swan, and Metcalf and sort Company also prepared and submitted a scheme to the Naval Board while I was on the .seas on my way to take up my.present A f t e r Mr Settle had been appointed Director of Naval Works, Mr K in g m Salrer and Mr Swan were asked to prepare plans for a Naval Base at Westernport, and it was while Mr Settle was on his way out that those gentlemen started the preparation of those plans. In his evidence before the Public Works Committee. Committee, Mr Swan statedIn March, 1016, the Naval Board instructed King Salter .and myself to report on the scheme that had been prepared by Messrs. Coode, Matthews, Fitemaurice and Wilson, and say in what way we considered it might he modified to suit the requirements of the Board and the service generally - Mr King Salter concerned himself principally with the and arrangements of the works in. the dockyard proper, for the docking,, repairing, I have and fitting out of ships.. My part of the work wasto. revise theplansin such a way as to meet, with Mr King Salter's lay-out scheme,, and, further, to propose the form of construction which the works should' take, and generally to revise-the scheme in order to meet Mr. King Salter's requirements. We had very little time to prepare this scheme, as Mr. Settle was due to arrive in about August, and it was expected that we should have"" our report in the hands of the Board before his arrival - We just, managed' to accomplish our task. . . . When Sir MauriceFitzmaurice visited this site hepointed out. there werecertain features upon which he could not give, a definite opinion until further investigations had been made, including such matters as trial test holes. . . . Those gentlemen, in March, 1916, were asked to prepare plans for the Henderson Base. It is absolutely clear, then, that no plan was approved, u n t i l after Mr . Settle came out here; and his plans were then, approved by the Naval Board and afterwards by the Minister. I am mentioning these facts because of the misleading replies given by the Department, and I think members should know more about the details of expenditure, know, when work is started, approximately what it is going to cost. It should be understoodthat it is only since Mr Settle came out; after plans had been prepared by Mr K in g Salter and Mr Swan, and by Mr f e t t l e , that the latter's plans wereapproved by the Naval Board! andby the Minister-; and there are now complete plans to go upon. W it h regard to the Flinders Naval Base, the impression has gained ground that Admira l Henderson desired the establishment of a big Base there. Such was not the case; it was merely a submachinery has been, secured.. Base for destroyers and submarines. Mr Max WELL - Did any of, the necessitate the undoing of any of work which has been already done ? . Mr GREGORY - It would be impossible to find, prior to Mr Settle's arrival, the value for some £70.000 or £80,000 spent. The work done at Cockburn layed. . Sound included a small section of railway of about 2 \ miles, and a large ""number of work-shops and - stores. Some trial holes' had also sunk. I Bhall give honourable members some progressive figures with regard to the expenditure on the Flinders Naval Base. In. 19.1.2-13, £14,:0.00 was spent;, in 1913-14, £ 1 8 ; 0 0 0; 1914-15, nearly £ 3 8 , 0 0 0; 1915-1.6, £11.4,000;. and in H916-17, £143,000^ was spent.. Those figures, represent the annual expenditure .for each of those financial periods. Last year, when the reclamation work was got into full swing, £148,800. was spent. I urge that we should go slow at present. There are already s&me American shovels being used, which have done fairly economic work, but have not been as good as the Director or the Public Works Committee had expected. But there 1I have been other cranes used on the work also. It was costing 3s. 2d, per yard, including all overhead charges, on the day-labour system. At Fremantle Harbor, also under the day-labour system, the Engineer-in-Chief stated to the Public Works Committee that he was doing Wasting under water, dredging, and dumping the material out to sea, all honourable at a cost of2s. 9d -, including overhead charges. There has; been difficulty and in obtaining a sufficient number of the American shovel's, but with these supplied this work should be done at a cost of very little over Is., per yard. I strongly hold that the work should go slow until the machinery is obtainable, so that the Commonwealth may have full value for its outlay upon the Base.",36
117,Mr FENTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,What is the cost with those shovels?,37
118,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"It is about ls. 8d. per yard with the. large steam - navvies. We are justified in asking the Minister (Mr Groom) to go slow u n t i l the best I know that he has dope all. that is possible in plans hastening its arrival. When the scheme the is completed at Fremantle, it will ' cost more than £10,000,000. Of course, we require to find work for a considerable amount of labour, but it. must be remembered that money is not inexhaustible. For that reason I ask that these works be deThere appears to be no regard for economy at Flinders Base, because I have been heard that the Government intend to have a flying school there, notwithstanding that we have already a flying school at Laverton, and I cannot see the necessity for twosuch establishments. It is clearly in tended to have a school at the Flinders Base, because one witness before the Public Works Committee said that it would be rather - dangerous to have overhead wires there on account of the training for aviation .'work. Then, again, when the work was started, I do not believe that it was ever intended that it should be in Hann's Inlet - Admiral Henderson in his report statedNaval Barracks, including Torpedo School, to be erected on the foreshore 'between Sandy Point and Stony Point. That is not in Hann's Inlet, but at the outlet, where there is one pf the finest, harbors in Victoria, where it is possible to get 40 feet of water withi n 200 feet of the shore.",37
119,Mr TUDOR,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Why did not the Government put it there?,38
120,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I do not know. The then Director has gone, and I do not want to say much about that aspect of the matter now, but I believethe work was started at both Bases just before an election, for the purpose of gaining favour, and it has been kept on. I am sorry to say this,- because I did not intend to mention it ; but I say that the Minister responsible for these things should not have an opportunity «f repeating them. In regard to Flinders Base, it wil l be noted that Admiral Henderson stated that only a small wharf should be constructed.",38
121,Mr FENTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Did ' Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice say anything about Hann's Inlet ?,38
122,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I have not his report by me, so I cannot say for certain.",38
123,Mr FENTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I fancy he did favour it . - Mr GREGORY - I believe he did approve of it ,",38
124,Mr FOWLER,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,I think Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice gave his paternal'blessing on all these proposals.,38
125,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"It is hardly fair to say that. ""The work had been started when he was asked to report on the scheme, and probably he did not think fit to condemn it . Dealing with wharfage accommodation, Admiral Henderson said that, if desirable, suitable hulks might be used, but the structures must not be coppered, and we have erected a wharf 1,000 feet long. And referring to torpedo practice, he stated! that the ""Naval 4 authorities should obtain the necessary legal powers to close part of the harbour for the purpose of Whitehead torpedo practice and adjustment.",38
126,Mr FENTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Torped o practice could not be carried out in still waters as at Hann's"" Inlet.",38
127,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Of course, there would not be much submarine practice in a dredged harbour, where the deepest water would be 18 feet. I have mentioned these matters,- because evidently there has been a desire to malee the Flinders sub-Base a much more ambitious proposal than Admiral Henderson intended.  dealing with the aviation training has been added, and it is the most useful.",38
128,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I have heard from Naval officers that it was intended to establish an aviation school there, anc! I think it would be a mistake to have two. aerial training schools in Australia so close together.",38
129,The CHAIRMAN,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY, Order ! The honourable member has reached his time l i m it . Extension of time granted.,38
130,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I thank honourable members: for the privilege, but I am nearing the end of my remarks. So far as these bases aro concerned, the policy for the first three years was largely one .of d r if t and incompetence, but that has been considerably altered of late. Still, there is a danger of a similar policy of d r if t in other quarters. If honourable members will turn to the Budget papers they will notice that enormous sums have been expended at Cockatoo Island Dock in Sydney. The in it i al cost of that great work is something over £1,000,000,' and every year applications are made for a couple of hundred thousand pounds for additions. We ought to cry a halt until we get further information about the whole scheme, and obtain some idea as to how m u c h . it is going to cost. I am not an expert, but in my judgment a grievous mistake was made in endeavouring to establish a dockyard at a place like that. I never saw a workshop so laid out, and I am sure if will cost an enormous sum of money to blast away the rock in order to give the dockyard oflicials reasonable facilities to carry out their work satisfactorily.",38
131,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,It was a rotten deal.,39
132,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Every year enormous sums are being asked for in connection with this dockyard, and although I do not say we should stop this yearthat might cause delay on essential works ' - I think there should be a thorough in vestigation. I am satisfied that the Government made a great mistake when they.. exempted these works from inquiry by the Public ""Works Committee. are those who scoff at. the work of that Comimittee, but I am sure that, although it"" may have cost a few thousand pounds, it has saved the country a hundredfold "" that amount. There has been some circumlocution and overburdening of officers owing to the fact that the Public Accounts and! Public Works Cpmmittee have at times been dealing with the same.subject, but I am satisfied that if the House defined the duties of the two Committees, so as to prevent overlapping for the future, the work of both bodies would be of very great value to Parliament and to the country. Most of the works under the Defence Department have been exempted from inquiry, and I think, that, in regard 'to some of them, this policy is the correct one. For instance, I would not permit information concerning - the dredging of a channel into a harbour or a naval dockyard to be made public in any shape or form.  member mean by that?",39
133,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Thes e are works exempted by Order in Council from examination by the Public Works Committee, no matter what may be their estimate of cost: Naval magazines; oilfuel storage tanks and depots; water supply, and water storage': all works and buildingsi n connection with submarine bases; torpedo stores and workshops; naval barracks; naval training schools; naval stores-buildings; dry-dock pumping stations; electric generating stations; dredging of approved channels to naval bases; and wireless installations  tee examine the.Flinders Naval Base?",39
134,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Onl y the barracks; these exemptions were made later. We found that the day-labour system employed in connection with the building of barracks at Flinders had made the brickwork there cost £ 1 5 8s. 7d. per rod, although the work was worth only about £7 10s. per rod. Buildings which it was estimated would cost £110,000 cost actually £179,000. The increase in cost was due partly to the war, but chiefly to j>he interference of a previous Minister. There If you put a good engineer in charge of works, he will try to get them carried out economically and well; but if , when the officer in charge dismisses a man, and that man goes to his member, 'and the member goes to the Minister, and the Minister issues the instruction that the man is to be put on again, and this happens time after time, the officer in charge begins to let things d r if t , and they get into the wretched condition in which they were at the Flinders Base I again appeal to the Government, in order to make provision for the settling of our soldiers on the land, to push on with the Murray River Waters scheme. 1 .have during the past few years urged . the need for this, although it is not a matter affecting either my electorate or my State. I am aware that because of the heavy rainfall of late years and the consequent flooded state of the Murray , it has been impossible to do the boring ancl other preliminary work necessary to the fixing of sites, but I hope that not a moment will be lost in making a start, and that returned soldiers will have preference in the allotting of blocks in the the areas made available. The Government has promised to do a great deal for the settlement of soldiers on the land. The States mav not be able to finance this work as they would desire, and it is necessary, therefore, that this Government should economize as far as possible. I should like to see economy in the general administration ""of the Departments. The Estimates show many new appointments, and the granting of big increases of salary to men who thought it their duty to remain in Australia ""during the war rather than go to the Front. ' I desire that economy shall be practised, so that there may be more money available for the assistance of our soldiers who have made such great sacrifiecs for their country.",39
135,Mr FINLAYSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Brisbane) [4.45]. - I am in accord with the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) as to the value of the work done by the Public Works Committee and the Committee of Publio Accounts. I had two years' experience as a member of the Public Works Committee, and know that the reports of that body gave much valuable information to Parliament, while its members were able to draw attention in a semi-authoritative way to stances of wasteful expenditure. not the desire of any honourable member to curtail, expenditure on public works. We all wish to have works necessary for the development of the country pushed on as far as possible. Our difficulty .is to determine, during a period of financial stringency such as this, what expenditure should be curtailed, or, perhaps, stopped. Proposals for expenditure on naval and military works demand special consideration, because such expenditure is unreproductive, being in the nature of a premium for an assurance against possible dangers. We must ask ourselves to what extent we can afford to ignore these dangers, or to take the risk of them. I have already expressed the view that the happy conclusion of the recent war assures us protection for some years to come. No one can imagine that any nation, or any two nations, will for many years lightly engage in war. Ordinarily, a nation does not engage in even a defensive war without serious and full consideration, and a war of conquest such as would affect Australia is unthinkable for some time to come. Therefore, expenditure on naval and military works, in addition to being unproductive, seems, at the present time, useless and. wasteful. There is no danger, either immediate or for many years to come; and the promise of an association of nations for the mutual protection of their interests in the Pacific should for long be a sufficient guarantee to Australia. I understand the relief of the members of the Corner party on the Ministerial side when the Acting . Prime Minister made his statement last Friday. Notwithstanding that statement, we are asked to pass a Loan Bill to authorize the borrowing of £1,242,194. The Government ask us to give them the power to borrow the money, and to trust them not to spend it.",40
136,Mr BLAKELEY,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Perhaps the Minister in charge intends to strike out some of the items in the schedule.,40
137,Mr FINLAYSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,We have not been told so.,40
138,Mr LAIKDSMITH,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,What item would the honourable member strike out),40
139,Mr FINLAYSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"On Friday, the in - Acting Prime Minister was very clear as It is to what was going to be done. He said that he was authorized to announce that the Government did not propose to do any more work at the Henderson Naval Base other than was considered protective and necessary, pending report.",40
140,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"He also stated that expenditure had been going on there for practically six months of the' current financial .year. . Mr FINLAYSON - I know that nearly six months of the present financial year have run , and that any curtailment would therefore affect only the expenditure of the next six months. But we have had no statement as to the amount by which it is proposed to reduce the' schedule. On Friday, the Acting Prime Minister said that the Government had been endeavouring for the past fifteen or sixteen months to ascertain whether the Admiralt y was able to advise Australia as to whether the Henderson programme should be modified or retarded. Various cables had been exchanged between the Naval Board and the British Admiralty upon this question, and tentative advice had on several occasions been tendered. That advice had on more than one occasion been to the effect that they should push on with the first stage of the Henderson .Naval Base programme; to postpone at the present time all preparations for the second stage of that Base work; and to continue the Flinders Base, and 1 complete it . It is remarkable how accommodating the Government has become. The Acting Prime Minister says that they have been in correspondence with the Admiralty for about fifteen months; but on the 7th of last month, when I asked the cost of Admiral Henderson'sreport, I was told that it was £ 5 , 8 6 9 , and - when I asked, further, if it were proposed to invitethe - Imperial Government to select a naval expert to visit Australia at an early date to advise the Government as to future work on the Naval Bases, and, if so, to what extent would the Government be financially responsible, the Act said that it was not proposed to invite the Imperial Government to select a naval expert; that the knowledge of the naval officer who was to be appointed as First Naval Member would be at the disposal of the Government, as would be also the advice of the British Admiralty. Ou Friday last, the Actin g Prime Minister told us that the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) now advises the Government to suspend all work at the » Henderson Naval Base exceptprotective work, guard dredging, and salvage work, until the new adviser is able to visit Australia and report. Less than a.month ago, the Government said that they did not propose to obtain the services of an expert; and yet, according to the Acting Prime Minister, for fifteen months they have been in correspondence with the British Government and the Admiralty as to whether work on the Naval Bases shall be proceeded with or postponed. He also told us .that they had communicated with the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook), asking him to find' outwhether the visit of a naval expert could be obtained.",40
141,Mr STOBY,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Has not the war endecl since the honourable member's question was asked ?,41
142,Mr FINLAYSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,What has happened is this: There were sufficient members on the Government benches to join with those who were sitting on this side of the chamber for the purpose of curtailing the expenditure proposed in this Bill if the Government were not prepared to modify it . It was the fear of the consequences of submitting the proposals to a vote that brought about the modifying statement of the Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) . The honourable member for Boothby knows this well.,41
143,Mr STOBY,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"No , I did not. It is news to me.",41
144,Mr FINLAYSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"If it had not been for the opposition of the Ministerial Corner party, there would have been no suggestion by the Acting Prime Minister to modify the Government proposals.",41
145,Mr SAMPSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"In the case of a democratic Government, is it not the right of the party to assert some control over the Bills brought forward?",41
146,Mr FINLAYSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I do not think it is so much a democratic Government as it is an accommodating Government. It appears to be very willing to placate honourable, members of the Corner party when they get a b it noisy. I must say that it seems. to be an easy matter to placate. them. Expenditure on these Naval Bases and on the Arsenal should be discontinued. It is unnecessary and wasteful at such a time as this. I am amused when I see how enthusiastic the Government are in providing for naval expenditure, when a few years ago they were utterly and-absolutely opposed to the idea of having any Australian' Navy, or of making any provision for one.",41
147,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,The honourable member knows that his statement is quite wrong.,41
148,Mr FINLAYSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I thought it would be denied. The Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook), speaking in the Sydney Town H all in 1907, saidOur duty is to offer a Dreadnought and give' a greater subsidy to the Old Country. We are hearing much about "" nailing our colours to the mast."" Well, I nail my flag once and for all to an increased subsidy. However, in 1917 the right honourable gentleman' had made some progress, because he saidThe issue is whether the Commonwealth shall render substantial, assistance to the cause pf English sea supremacy, or whether it should concentrate its resources upon an attempt to build an Australian Navy. . . . It can be conclusively shown that there is no possibility of Australia being able ""to construct and man a navy strong enough to resist even the weakest of the navies of the Powers. Lord Forrest, of happy memory, said in 1903I do not think it advisable that we should have an Australian Navy, and although it ' may come in the future, I do not desire it should come in my time. Yet, afterwards, we had the spectacleof the right honourable gentleman passing Bills authorizing an expenditure of hun-' dreds of thousands of pounds for building the very same Navy to which he had objected.",41
149,Mr ATKINSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,H is remarks referred to a different scheme from that which was adopted in 1909.,42
150,Mr FINLAYSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I knew there would be explanations. Can honourable members explain the - following remarks, which were made in - 1909 by - the present Speaker (Hon. W . Elliot Johnson):Wc should watch very carefully the movement for the development of a purely Australian Navy to be controlled independently of the British fleet in Australian waters, for, apart from the question of the enormous expense involved ancl the certain increase of taxation, there was a certain section ef this community who encouraged this development because they hated and decried the British connection, and cherished the notion that at some distant datethe navy of an Australia""!! Republic would be turned against the British fleet in Australian waters.",42
151,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,I wonder what section he was referring to ?,42
152,Mr FINLAYSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I wonder, also, because the honourable gentleman is now a member of the section which, by all the means in its power, is encouraging the development of this very same Australian Fleet. The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Kelly) saidConcerning the Government policy with regard . to torpedo boat destroyers. . . . The . Prime Minister's proposal springs simply from a desire to euphemistically introduce the Australian Navy project- a project as futile as it would be inefficient. An Australian Navy would be of no service whatever to the people for defence purposes . . . the only means open to us of protecting Australia from invasion overseas is to contribute, and to contribute largely, to the Imperial Navy.",42
153,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Do they say it today ?,42
154,Mr FINLAYSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Of course -""they and honourable members of the Opposido.",42

156,Mr FINLAYSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,I congratulate honourable members on the - progress they have made in the development of Australian national ideas. There are other honourable members opposite who at the same period of political history were talking in a similar strain. There was only one party in Australia far-seeing enough to give us the magnificent results achieved.,42

M i \ SPENCE - Then why is the honourable member opposing the building of Nava l Bases?",42
159,Mr FINLAYSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I object to the expenditure on Naval Bases for two reasons. Firstly, the money is required for more urgent purposes, and at this time"" of financial.stringency we ought to curtail to the most severe limits every possible avenue of expenditure that is not reproductive. Secondly, military or naval expenditure can only be justified by an anticipated danger to Australia, whereas the result of the war has removed for ten years at least any possibility of danger from invasion or local trouble.",42
160,Mr COBSEE,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Furthermore , the cos.t of construction is far greater at the present than it would be in normal times.",42
161,Mr FINLAYSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"F r o m a business point of view, it would be foolish to continue these works at the present time.",42
162,Mr SPENCE,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,But the Government are not proceeding with the works.,42
163,Mr FINLAYSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Before the honourable member entered the Chamber I was pointing out that if it had not been for the opposition shown by honourable members in the Ministerial corner 1 tion, the Government would have gone on with these works, and that they have only been induced to modify their proposals because of the opposition of honourable members. The statement made by the Acting Prime Minister on Friday last - - was a complete justification of the attitude taken up by honourable members on both sides of the Chamber who objected to, expenditure in this direction. I am.pleased that the House has realized how necessary it is to go slowly in these matters.",42

165,Mr FINLAYSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I believe that at the Perth Labour Conference there was a modification of the ""previous attitude to ah extent which I entirely endorse, namely, that before men should be invited to take part in military operations they should have the° privileges of citizenship extended to them.. The two matters are synonymous.",43
166,Mr LYNCH,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"In opposing that principle, did not the honourable member argue for consistency with the party's .manifesto, and was he not told that it was not his duty to be consistent, but that he should take orders from outside?",43
167,Mr FINLAYSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"The honourable - member is evidently referring to something which the Brisbane Worker told me to do. Apparently he has not seen my reply, otherwise he, would have known that I told them that I reserved to myself the right of independent judgment; that when the time came it would be soon enough for them to attempt to dictate to. me as to what my duty ^as; and that in the meantime I was to be the determiner of my own fate. There is another dangerous feature in connection with this expenditure for naval purposes. According to page 70 of the Budget papers, we have spent £5,230,671 out of revenue upon the Australian Fleet. However, last year we abandoned the principle of providing for the Fleet out of revenue and spent upon it £355,397 from Loan Fund for Works; and this year we propose to spend upon it £500,000 from War Loan Fund. When the Estimates come before us this very reprehensible departure should receive the attention of honourable members. The people of Australia have been invited to subscribe money for war loans for the purpose of carrying on the war, and yet £500,000 of the money subscribed is to be devoted, not to the purpose of carrying on the war, but to the Australian Fleet. Altogether the Commonwealth have spent £6,086,068 on the Fleet. The Government have provided for expenditure"" this year on Naval Bases an amount of £2,0.87,800, comprising £1,467,000 out of war loan, and £425,000 and £195,000 out of loan fund for works. Of course, that sum includes £500,000 for the construction of the Fleet. The Government have given no indication as to what will be the reduction in the Loan Bill as a Tesult of the modified scheme which they have announced.",43
168,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,No amount has Been stated; but the Government have stated that a mark-time policy will be adopted.,43
169,Mr FINLAYSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"All that the Acting Prime Minister has said is that there shall be a reduction in the expenditure. - He told us that for fifteen months the Government have been corresponding with the British Admiralty, which had advised them to proceed with and complete the first stage of the Henderson Base. . On that work we have already spent from, £500,000 to £750,000, and a further expenditure of £5,000,000 is required to complete its first stage. The British Admiralty advised' us to complete the first section, complete"" the Flinders Base, complete the Sydney Base, but to stop work on all other Bases. Now the Government say that the latest advice from the Admiralty is to stop work at the Henderson Base, complete the Flinders Base, and entirely suspend all other .operations. That is an eminently satisfactory statement, and is exactly what those of us who have been complaining about Naval Base expenditure have asked for.",43
170,Mr MAXWELL,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"The latest advice was given after, the. recent turn of events.",43
171,Mr FINLAYSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"We asked for a suspension of operations ibefore events took their latest turn. While the war was raging, and when the outlook wasblackest, we suggested that the time was not opportune for proceeding with those works, and that Ave ought to consider how, when the war was over, and its lessons had been, learned, we might develop them along the cheapest ancl most effective lines. I go further, and say that,, now the war is over, we must consider, not only how to make the best use of the lessons it has taught, and buy up machinery cheaper than we could havepurchased it a few years ago,, but also whether there is any urgent need to proceed with'these works at the present time, or, indeed, for the next ten years. A much more statesmanlike proposal than the expenditure of £2,000,000 on naval works in the current financial year would be the utilization of that sum in developing Australia, establishing new industries, and providing employment for the returned soldiers. If we discontinue, that. expenditure we shall, in the next ten years, have an aggregate sum of £20,000,000 to apply to the development of Australian . mdiustries. [Extension of time granted.] It is very evident that, as a result the war, the German Fleet will be available for distribution amongst the Allied nations. Indeed, I have already read in the press references to the number of ships that certain nations are likely to ceive as their share of the German Navy. - I .think it is quite likely that Australia will be regarded as. having some rights in that respect. Indeed, I think the Commonwealth can put forward a very sound claim for consideration; and I do not see any reason why we should propose to continue building war-ships, in view of the possibility that we may get two or three German ships when the distribution amongst the Allies takes place. I mention this matter rather diffidently, because I know that we all stated emphatically that we did not enter the war with the expectation of getting any spoils. But it is certain that the German ships will not be given back to Germany; somebody must get them, and Australia has as much 'claim to a share of them as has any other nation. Therefore, I think that, instead of spending money on the building of ships, we ought to make a claim for a couple of the captured German, vessels.. It would be rather a happy thing for the Australian Fleet if its splendid record during, the war were' capped by the hoisting of the Australian flag over a couple of enemy ships. I hope that the Government will suggest, through the 'Minister for the Navy, who is in England, that we have no obj ection to a couple , of German ships being added to the Australian Fleet.",44
172,Mr SAMPSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Wimmera) [5.18] I join with others in congratulating the Acting Prime Minister on having announced the intention of the Government to suspend some of the important Naval works for a time. That decision will mean the saving of a considerable sum of loan money until further investigation has been made into the Bases. It does not. however? remove the responsibility of: the various Administrations that have been in charge of those works since their commencement. In my opinion, the present Minister - for the Navy ought long agoto have consulted with the British Admiralty as to the advisability of conof. tinuing these works on the lavish scale on which they were started. On© has only to read the history of Naval Base construction in Australia to realise that most of the money has been expended without re- the authorities having any settled plan. In 1911, Admiral Henderson laid down a scheme for - the construction of Naval Bases throughout the Commonwealth in a certain order, and also for the building of war ships. On the basis of that report the then Director of Naval Works laid out a tentative scheme, in accordance with which work was. started at the Henderson Base, at Cockburn Sound. Admiral Henderson recommended, that' there should be two primary Bases, one in Sydney, which was to be put in hand first, and a second at Cockburn Sound. There were to be also a number of subsidiary Bases, and a long way down on the list was a sub-base to be established at Flinders. On the authority of the Naval Board; I believe, the Flinders Base was taken out of its proper order, because of the desire of the Board to remove the Naval dep6t and yards from William stown, and to the proposals recommended by Admiral Henderson were added gunnery and torpedo schools, and other establishments. The construction of the Plinders Base was carried on at atoo rapid rate, with the result that the buildings were completed before the Naval Board was in a position to occupy them. We know that a great deal of wast© took place in connection with the construction of the Base. The Acting Prime Minister intimated on F r i day that, on the advice of the Admiralty, the Government intend to complete the Flinders Base, but I am of opinion that that work, which will cost about £150,000, should not be put in hand u n t i l the fullest investigation has been made by the qualified expert, who is to report broadly on the whole system of Naval Base construction,.and also on the details of the works to be carried out at each Base. To return to the history of the Henderson Base, the Public Works Committee has had an opportunity of studying the whole of the 'circumstances of the Base at Cockburn Sound - In 1913, the Liberal Government secured the services of an eminent engineer, Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice, who, after a thorough mvestigatiion, confirmed broadly the scheme laid down by Admiral Henderson, but recommended a revision of certain details. However, the work continued on the old plan, and nothing was done by the Naval Board to lay out a definite plan of operations, or to prescribe the order in which the works should be completed. It was not until early in 1916 that two officers of the Department, Mr Swan and Mr K in g Salter, were asked to plan a lay-out of the Henderson Base for ship-building, and algo. for the accommodation of the largest vessels in the Australian Fleet. In the same year the present Director of Naval Works; Mr Settle, came to Australia, and, after a study of all the available data, he recommended a revised list of works to be carried out as the first instalment of the Henderson Base. No blame i o r the lack of scheme, system, or -.perspective can be laid at the door of 'the present Director of Naval Works. Upon the basis of Admiral Henderson's scheme, upon which had been superimposed the recommendations of Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice, Mr Settle submitted proposals which were referred to the Public Works Committee for in vestigation. That scheme contemplated an expenditure of about £5,600,000, and although Admiral Henderson's report had been presented as far back as 1911, it was the first scheme that looked ahead, and laid down in a business-like way a series of works to be carried out in their proper order, with due regard to their relative importance. This shows the haphazard and inefficient manner in which this huge expenditure has been carried on. We had to w a it seven years for the presentation of a business-like scheme which enumerated in order of their importance and utilit y the various works that should be constructed. We now learn. that whilst this scheme was before the Public Works Committee, the Naval Board submitted - to the Admiralt y plans and specifications which had been prepared by Messrs. Swan and K in g Salter in connection with instructions issued! prior to the appointment of the ' present Director of Naval Works - It was always intended that these works should, be carried out uncier the advice of the Admiralty, and the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook} immediately upon his-arrival in England should have investigated the whole question of the construction of Naval Bases. He knew that Messrs. Swan and K in g Salter's plans and specifications were in the hands of the Admiralty, and that the present Director of Naval Works, in giving evidence before the Public Works Committee, had.said that, for his own satisfaction, he should like the rival plansthose prepared by himself and those prepared by Mr Swan and Mr K in g Salter- to be submitted to the. Advisory Council of the British Admiralty, from which the best advice. could be obtained. The Minister has been in England for six or seven months, and during that time expenditure has been going on in connection with these works. In my opinion, when he arrived in the Old Country he should have regarded it as his first duty to-consult with the British Admiralty, instead of waiting for the Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) to give him the impetus to the making of an investigation.  Admiralty authorities have said in all their - cable messages that they have not had time to make a full investigation of the plans. . Mr SAMPSON - We now find that the work is to be suspended. Has that decision been arrived at by the Government with or without the advice of the Admiralty ? Throughout the inquiry made by. the Public Works Committee I took, the view that operations should be suspended until we secured the advice of the Admiralty, and, as a member of the Committee, I moved to that effect.  Minister last week read all the cablegrams that had passed between the Admiralt y and the Government.'",44
173,Mr SAMPSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Then it is on the advice of the Admiralty that the work is to be hung up? The question is whether that advice should not have been obtained long since. I have referred to these facts with the object of showing the-extent to which this important work has been carried out without any settled plan, and on ja scale of extravagance foreign to efficiency and to the proper discharge of a great public duty. I hope it will be possible for the Government before the present session closes to bring before us the . Estimates in Chief, so that we may have a furthe r opportunity' to ' discus's public expenditure of the Commonwealth. The Acting Prime Minister has told us that already the provision made on the Estimates for the first five months of the financial ""year has been exhausted. If we are to wait another three months for the Estimates, two'thirds of the financial year will have expired before we shall have had an opportunity to deal further with the expenditure. I hope that the Acting Prime Minister's proposal to bring down a Supply Bill on which we may discuss the public expenditure may not be persisted in , but that we shall have, the Estimates in Chief brought before us without further^delay. If we have an opportunity to review them before it is too late we shall have little difficulty in showing where substantial savings can British be made. In connection with the proposed construction of an arsenal there was another series of Ministerial instructions and votes without any settled plan to go upou. The precis of the cablegrams that hav6 passed between, the Imperial authorities and the Department of Defence show quite plainly that the establishment of the Arsenal was first suggested for war purposes. It was hoped that we should be able with in twelve months to supply shells. It has been difficult, however, for Australia to take its'part with other Dominions in the manufactureof munitions of war, owing to the great distance which separates us from the Old Country. B y the time that specifications reached us from the war authorities at Home the class of shell to which they related might have become obsolete. It has been impossible for us to play that part in the manufacture of munitions of war that countries more contiguous to Great B r it a in have done. The Arsenal, however, was to be established in order that - we might manufacture certain classes of munitions, and this huge expenditure was to be undertaken upon in formation gained by tbje visit of the Arsenal Committee to India. During the war experience of the highest value in regard to munitions was obtainable. Various - developments took place,, but the India, it was thought, was the country to which the Arsenal Committee should go in order .to be able to report upon the best' class of arsenal to establish in Australia. While there are some up-todate arsenals and munition factories in India, we must recognise that at best they could supply only a pre-war standard of manufacture. It was impossible for the Committee to obtain there the up to-date information we could, have secured had we waited a little longer. It is, therefore, gratifying to learn that it has been decided to suspend the Arsenal building operations,'and that when we do proceed with the work we shall have had a visit from the highest British authority on the subject, and will have the be.«t advice for our guidance. I propose now to refer to a work that is closely associated with the project for available for irrigation. the settlement of returned soldiers or. the land. I allude to the locking of the Murray and to the building of additional storages in connection with that river.' I have here a report issued by the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr . Groom), who, I ' believe, is trying to do aU he can to push on with the undertaking; but the results so far achieved are very disappointing. The delay that has occurred in the locking of the Murray and the'construction of certain storage works, is most unfortunate. It was in 1913 that the present Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook), then Prime Minister, made an agreement with the States concerned for a Commonwealth subsidy of £1,000,000 to enable them to build large storages on the Murray, as well as to lock the river and some of its tributaries.  made the work had to be delayed for two years, owing to the flooded country. - Mr SAMPSON - Why have not some of the minor storages been constructed? that work. The Lake Victoria scheme, providing for the storage of 500,000 acre-feet of Water, should have been completed by this time. mit their scheme of works.",46
174,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"That is a 'very big underf taking. The engineers have been carrythe ing outtests aud preparingdesigns, and scheme than upon any other. are only now ready to submit the work the Commission.",47
175,Mr SAMPSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,There should have been a greater driving power behind the If work. Unnecessary delay has taken place. South Australia is the only State in group which has done anything in the way of providing water storage.  with South Australia's work. Because of starting when she did with these the cost has been twice as much as would otherwise have been.,47
176,Mr SAMPSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"There is always the possibility of floods. That is a risk have to face. In the Minister's only two of the twenty pages are devoted to the proposals for constructional works, ments. and nothing is said as to the possibility of an early start being made with this big scheme. We are not told how long it will be - before any storage water is The report is most disappointing. The agreement was made in 1913.",47
177,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"But the Act was not assented to u n t il 15th November, 1915, and until *the Commission was appointed we could not be held responsible.*",47
178,Mr SAMPSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"That does ' not detract fro m my argument. Both the Commonwealth and State 'Parliaments should have passed the necessary legislation without a moment's delay, so that the work might at once be undertaken.",47
179,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,An expert had to be obtained from the United States.,47
180,Mr SAMPSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"It is difficult to say whether it was really necessary to secure the services of an expert from the United States. We have experienced men in Australia. In any case, we find that, although five years have elapsed since - the agreement was made, the site of the scheme for the storage of ""1,000,000 acrefeet of water at the head of the river has state of the barely been selected.",47
181,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,The two. State Governments concerned are now engaged upon,47
182,Mr SAMPSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"They are still being asked by the Central Commission to subThe successu l settlement of our returned soldiers on land depends more largely upon this For the to first time the Commonwealth is taking a hand in this class of settlement and the distribution of the Murray waters, and yet we find continuous delay. the ' States are responsible for the delay, I hope that the Minister the will give us the benefit of any in formation he has regarding it , so that we shall be in a position to ask the people a little later on to amend the Constitution in .the direction of giving us power to works, carry out these important works. Wo it know that before this agreement was come to, land settlement on the Murray and its tributaries had, according to the we Water Commission, reached the maximum report of safety, and it was not quite safe to supply water to new irrigation settleThe urgency of the work has become, more and'more insistent. Would it be possible for the Minister, before this Loan Bill is passed, to give the House an assurance as to when these works are to be undertaken, when we shall be able to draw waters from at least some of the storages, and thus enable soldiers' settlements to be established ? In South Australia, I . believe, it has been found possible to establish new settlements, and in Victoria and New South Wales, where some soldier settlements are being successfully established, there is probably room enough to settle all the soldiers who care to undertake this class of agriculture. If we can only store the water and settle people on the same basis as at Mildura, on the one side, 'and Renmark on the other, we have room for the settlement of half-a-million people under this scheme alone. The Minister, as chairman of the Commission, should impress on the constructing States the necessity of pushing on with these storages, which can be completed at' a very much earlier date than the main storage on the Upper Murray. A driving power is required behind the present Commission to stir it up; and unless something is done, the great areas lying adjacent to the Murray, so suitable for irrigation, and of such proved success-thoug h extension is impossible, because of the insufficient supply of water --wil l not be available for the settlement of any great number of soldiers. The Minister, I think, ought to give some intimation to the House of what works will be undertaken in the first instance, and the general lay-out of the scheme. As a matter of fact, ih regard to this work, we are in the same position that we were in eight or nine years ago in relation to Naval Bases and other works of magnitude. We are asked to vote the whole of this money without any scheme or plan being placed before us as to what the works are, and the order in which they are to be carried out. We have not been told how long it will be before the first supplies from the storages may be drawn for the purpose of irrigating, new settlements. The report before us contains some twenty pages, Mr Sampson the first seven or eight of which are devoted to the history of the question, and then follow about a page and a half on the construction of new works, the remainder being taken up with an elaborate table of gaugings on the various rivers. The main thing that would give the - report any value is absent; that is, a thorough studied and systematized scheme of construction, showing the works and the order in which they are to be carried out, and - informing us as to the earliest moment at which a new supply may be obtained for the purpose of irrigation settlement on the river.  - Estimates are rather belated. We remember how the Treasurer (Mr Watt) had a word to say to the State Treasurers when they came south looking for money. He told them that they would have to "" draw in their horns,"" and see that no great public works were gone on with, because we had to assist in winning the war by curtailing expenditure in certain directions in the different States. Now, in this grave and strenuous time, the Commonwealth Government ask for an enormous sum of money out of loan for the purposes which haye been discussed thisafternoon. If there is one thing more than another that the Governments, State and Federal, should do, it is to provide water in the arid portions of this great continent. Providence has endowed us with plenty of water if we only had the nous to conserve it. I have been a member of the House since the inception of Federation, and during, the whole of that time we have impressed on every successive Government the necessity for conserving the natural waterways in the different States, and thus giving an aid to agriculture and closer settlement. For many years this Murray waters scheme, like a hardy 'annual, has been before us, and each Treasurer and Government has agreed that something should be done. Australia has been federated for a little over seventeen years, and, so far as water conservation is concerned, we are now exactly in the same position that we were in the day Federation was consummated. In that period millions of gallons have flowed under the bridges, and nothing has been done to conserve it. One day the honourable member for 'Wimmera (Mr Sampson) asked a question on the subject, and the Minister for Worksand Railways (Mr Groom) rose with, an air. of eloquence, and, in flowery Deakinese, told! him all about tihe beauties of the country, the smiling fields, and allthat, and wound up with the information that the Government were collaborating Mr GROOM. - It is apretty picture, but I do not remember drawing it.  man did draw it , and I asked him why he did not tell those concerned to get an aeroplane. His retort to that was that there was "" quite enough gas about""; but I reminded him that aeroplanes were ' not driven: by gas, but with another motive power. And motive power is what is required in this House. What is the use of telling a hungry man about beautiful fields of wheat in South Australia, or beautiful bullocks growing up on the Peninsula in Queensland ? It is tucker that the people want, and not painted pictures and town planning.",47
183,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"How do you propose to apply the motive-powerwith, the boot?'  the honourable member. Mr AUSTIN. . CHAPMAN - Will - you help?  help. It is time we stopped fooling the 1 people by telling them' what we intend to do; it is time we did something. We all know that the main thing in the settlement of the arid portions of Australia is water; it is our chief asset. Before there, were artesian wells in Queensland there were, not hundreds, but thousands, ef miles uninhabited. with the artesian flow, this country is what is called in Queensland closely settled.. Pioneers went out, and were assisted by the pastoral financial institutions; and where, thirty years ago, there was not a white man, we find the country not only covered with habitations, but covered with fenced-in big flocks and herds. I look on every hoof in Australia, not as the asset of an individual, but as a national' asset. I am not jealous of any man having big flocks and herds-, because the more stock such men have,, the more: prosperous the country, and the more prosperousthe country the better off the working man.",49
184,Mr ATKINSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"They are part of the real wealth of the country.  every one of us is helping to produce that wealth. It seems most remarkable that the statesmen of Australia shouldalways be in the back ground in regard to the conservation of water. We have some of the best agricultural and grazing lands to be found under the sun, and in close proximity to the great water-ways",49
185,Mr ATKINSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"In most of the oases is this not, as the Constitution stands, a State matter?  English-speaking race, .and we have no foreign Governments to contend against; the boundaries between the Statesare not natural boundaries, but, since Federation, only border lines. If it is for the welfare of the nation, surely we are not such "" State frighters "" as not to alTow either the Federal or the. 'State Governments to do the country a good turn ? If the States will not take action, it behoves the Federal Government to do so. If this scheme * is to make New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia prosperous, I , as a Queenslander, am quite, pa-epared to forward it-to .promote in every possible way the settlement of those immense areas. There is a great cry at the present time about, the need for settling returned soldiers on the land. My experience of the settlement of people on the. land has been that, where the attempt has been made,, the land has settled the people.. The places chosen for such settlements have To-day, been such that, the settlers', required tke heart of a lion and the knowledge of a professor of science, to make their settlement successful..  account.  money lasted the settlers were aH right, but when the money was used upthey left the land. Many years ago the Queensland Government went to a. great deal of trouble to assist the settlement of people on the land, either as individuals oii n groups. They supplied settlers with stock, and material for houses, and permitted them to draw a - certain amount each week from the Public Treasury.",49
186,Mr COKSEB,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,And the bank never suffered any loss.  tale.,50
187,Mr BAMFORD,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"And a very melancholy tale, too  did not lose, because certain people helped the bank out of its difficulty.",50
188,Mr COESER,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I refer to the Queensland Agricultura l Bank.  tempt at group. settlement tried by Sir Horace Tozer before the existence of the State Agricultural Bank. The Government of the day were adverse to the proposed settlement, but they - still did all that it was possible for a Government to do to make it a success, mainly because of the efforts of one man, the Hon. A . H . Barlow, who was a member of the Ministry. His ambition inlife at that time was to induce people to leave the cities and settle upon the land. The Salvation A r m y assisted the settlers, and they stayed on the land so long as there was any money draw. As soon as the money was done, they were done, too, and they went back to the cities. They did not blame themselves; but they did blame every one but themselves. A f t e 1891 strike, a number of young, virile men, of whom I was one, had a grievance against the Queensland Government, and desired to leave Australia. They considered that Australia was not good enough for them, and not big enough for them, and of all places in the world, the place to which they wanted to. go was South America. We were in love with the utopian scheme of co-operative settlement, and honourable members are aware that love is always blind. were prepared to go anywhere to carry out such a scheme. We believed that it would lead to the millennium. into the scheme £ 6 0 that I had worked very hard for, but at the jump-off my wife refused to go with me to South America. She had more sense than 1 had, and I have-not been sorry since that she refused to go .to Paraguay at that time. This idea of settling people cooperatively on the land is not new. A f t e r the 1891 strike in Queensland a co-operative village settlement was started there on the Alice River. If the whole of Western Queensland had been searched for the purpose, a worse place could not have been selected. We would not listen to scientists in Government positions, who condemned the site chosen. Like the old pioneers who blazed the track in the western country, the settlers decided that the settlement should be formed alongside the biggest waterhole in the district. They considered that so long as there was plenty of water they could not fail to be successful. I was working on the railway line at that time, earning 8s. a day, and I put 4s. of that amount into the co-operative settlement, with the idea of finally joining the settlers, ihings went on all right until the first shearing season came round, and then some of their skins began to crack. They found that they had hard work, and that there was no money coming in , though there was plenty of good, rough tucker. At a meeting of the settlers one night it was decided that the to best thing to do was that half the number should leave the settlement and go to work shearing at different sheds, and then come back and the other half would take up the work r the of shearing the next year. The first half left , but, like Noah's dove, they never came back. From that time on the settlers drifted out of the settlement u n t i l there were only seven left. Sir Samuel Griffith, the present Chief Justice of the High Court, was Premier of Queensland at the time, and he did all he could to assist the Alice River settlement. He used to write articles on the subject for a newspaper called The Boomerang, edited by ex-Senator Drake. He was in symWe"" pathy with the movement, and so long as the settlement continued he assisted it in every way he could. He gave the I put; settlers horses, drays, pumping gear, and pipes, and all he got from them from start to finish was abuse. That was my experience of settling people on the land who had not grown up accustomed to the conditions of land settlement. If there is a wrong way to do a thing, honourable members may be sure that a man from the city settled on the land will take that way. Some of tliose who joined the Alice - River settlement thought that the best thing they could do was to enclose the area with a pig-proof fence. An y one with any sense at al l would know that there is more work than anything else in a pig-proof fence, and, besides, there were no pigs to keep out of the settlement.",50
189,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"It was fence.  fence, and it is there today. It was constructed of split gidyea and boree. There was only one thing wanting to make the settlement a real Garden of Eden-and it was a Garden of Eden. until that one thing was supplied, and that was when a woman appeared on the scene.",51
190,Mr MAXWELL,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"On l y one?  of many others; but trouble began in the settlement with the advent of the woman. Notwithstanding all their difficulties, seven men stuck to the settlement until the finish, and I stuck to them. I used my 4s. per day in another direction, and as I was in a position to help them, I stuck to them t ill the last - I believed that they were trying to give effect to right ideas, but they had not the brains to carry them out. Though seven continued at the settlement, they were not happy or contented -- until they secured the freehold of the land they occupied They harassed the soul-case out of me try move the local member to take action in the State Parliament on their behalf. Mr ' POYNTON - We have all had the same experience.  nature. I am only telling honourable members the sort of thing which has happened all over the. world. These men got their freeholds, and the ink was"" not d r y on their deeds before there were plasters on them, and a monkey was perched on each gate going into the settlement. Honourable members can realise what happened from that out. It is all very well to sit down in an office, and write articles to a newspaper to tell people what they shduld do on the land. I remember that one gentleman, a resident of Barcaldine, in every issue of his newspaper said that the western plains of Queensland should be the granary of the world. He used to reprint extracts from American newspapers to show what the Americanswere doing with dry places in the growth of wheat, and used to ask why we could nqt do the same in Central Queensland. One day I went into his office and said, a beautiful "" Look here, Campbell, there is only one' way in which you can prove that what you are always writing in your newspaper is a f a c t . "" He replied, "" What is that?"" I answered, "" Go and do yourself what you advise others to do.. Y o u can get any amount of country from the Government merely by asking for it . You can get good, rich land at a rental of | d . per acre; and in five years you can obtain the freehold for 2s. 6d. per acre."" He acted on my suggestion, and took up a selection. During the first year, he put about 50 acres of it under wheat. We experienced a phenomenal season. Never before had there been such rains in western Queensland, - and never have there been since. The consequence was that Campbell had everybody in the district looking at his beautiful wheatfields in the middle of the bush; and the following year, numbers of men, including station-owners, rushed in with the plough. . But from thevyear that Campbell p ut in his plot, there has never been an acre of wheat grown in western Queensland. In the same way, I fear that our soldiers' settlements will not be the success that many of us wish them to be.""",51

But if I ventured to embark on a business in Melbourne what chance of success would I have? None whatever. ' I realise the troubles which the Government, are encountering in connection with their repatriation efforts. But they are doing their very best, and the country ought to he thankful that we have at the head of the Department a man like Senator Millen. I do not know of another man in Australia who would go into the matter as ""fully as he is doing. He is giving it his undivided attention, but I know that, no matter what he may do, or how he may do it, he will be the best abused individual in the Commonwealth.",51
193,The CHAIRMAN,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY," Order! The honourable member's time has expired. [Extension of time granted].  Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen) is not to prod him as we would prod a lazy bullock or a lazy horse. We must, recollect that he has to carve out his own machinery in the Department, and personally I think that he is doing it all right. In regard to vocational train-, ing, he is accomplishing marvellous work, and the Housing Bill which he intends to introduce will be .a splendid measure. But no matter what he may do, he is sure to be the victim of carping critics. I know of ho case which has been brought under his notice in which relief has not been given. The only thing I am sorry for is that the Department will prove not only his political grave, but the grave of many of his - successors. The Government will be well advised to knock off the works at the Naval Base in Western Australia altogether, because it is of no use to shut our eyes to the - fact that if there is any danger at all for Australia it will come from the East.",52

Many years ago I feared the danger I have referred to, but of later years I have not feared it so much, particularly after the events that have just taken ' place in connection with our .Navy in Home waters. One port I should like to see developed, and on which I would not care how much money was spent, because it is a port that will always be necessary, is Port Stephens, I do not want honourable members to think I am pushing Queensland's barrow in this matter. Apparently nothing is being done, at .Port Stephens at all. If there is one thing more than another that will heed revising in many directions it is our naval defence programme. A man does not need ""to be a statesman or a naval expert to know that the .two principal features in future wars will be - the aeroplane and the submarine-that is, for defensive purposes. The dreadnought and the cruiser will form the big offensive arm in years to come, just as they do today ; but the practical defence of our shores will be carried out by aeroplanes, mine fields, and submarines' . . . . * # * * *. * * We are spending a great deal of - money now on certain Bases, although we know that after the war the whole scheme of naval defence may have to be changed.

The very first thing we should do is to make Australia secure, - and if we spend this money judiciously we shall be doing the right thing. Those of us who have read anything about the war know that most of the big guns and ammunition, and even the smaller field guns, have become practically obsolete during the last four years. Many of the guns with which our forts are manned are obsolete. It is of no use to spend a lot of money on machinery for making obsolete guns at the Arsenal. The biggest change the world has ever seen is going to happen in regard to big armaments and munitions. If we spend all this money on the Arsenal, and then find that the whole scheme has to be scrapped, we .shall be acting very foolishly. At Woolwich Arsenal I have seen machinery put up, and the whole of it taken out and scrapped before two years had passed. That was in peaceful times. If the building must be put up, I say, put it up, but let us not spend large sums on what is called up-to-date machinery, because in twelve months' time the whole lot may be obsolete. know, as a fact, that some of the machinery that has been ordered for the Arsenal is already obsolete.

203,Mr RODGERS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Before commencing a discussion on the items contained in the Bill , I ask the Minister (Mr Groom) if he can give the Committee any idea of the estimated proportion- I would not expect the exact amount-by which the total of £1,242,194 will be reduced as a result of the undertaking given by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) .",53
204,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"It would be quite impossible to give those. figures at this stage. The matter will have to be inquired into by the Director of Works.. I Mr Rodgers - We should be f u r nished with some estimate. It would afford some little satisfaction to those who recognise that the resources of the country should be directed, as far as possible, to increasing production, and lending those direct aids to production and in dustry which do not seem to come from the huge expenditure of Federal moneys. I do not hold that Federal expenditure should be measured by State expenditure; but. looking upon the two sources - together, I am bound to point out that most of the direct services in this country which have a bearing upon production, and upon facilities for production, are rendered by the States. And I point out, further, that we are shortly about to come to an end of the financial .arrangement between the Commonwealth and States, by which the latter will be required to .surrender their per capita grant.",53

206,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Capricornia) [ 7 . 4 9 ] wish to state one or two reasons why the House should not agree to the motion. The other day I drew the attention of the Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) to the position which this measure occupied on the notice-paper. I mentioned that several weeks ago we were asked to pass this Loan Bill as an urgent measure. The Acting Prime Minister said, in reply, "" The honourable member will know that we brought in a Supply Bill , and that that has rendered any urgency in connection with this Bill unnecessary."" But when, by interjection, I reminded the Minister (Mr . Groom), of that this evening, he demurred. If this Bill were urgent-if the Minister could say that its passage was urgently necessary- I would not object to the suspension of the Standing Orders.",54
207,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"The mere fact that the honourable member let us pass the schedule this evening indicates that he himself regards the Bill as urgent. As Leader of the party on his side to-night, the honourable member acquiesced in the whole position, and now that he has helped us to this stage he is blocking the Bill .",54
208,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I am not attempting to block the Bill . The general situation has been entirely altered since this measure was introduced. When the Minister was asked if he could indicate how much of the money to be voted would be required, he could not furnish an answer. He had not the faintest glimmer of an idea whether there would be required the sum of £1,242,194, or whether £500 000 would be sufficient. My object in opposing the suspension of the Standing Orders at this stage is to warn honourable members that it will be a very serious mistake to pass a measure such as. this without paying attention to the altered needs of the situacontribution. There are items, for example, affecting the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook). I want to know why the Minister for the Navy is not here. He Is away in London. I quite agree that there is an excellent substitute on the Ministerial benches, but the misfortune is that that substitute is not permitted to take the position of Minister for the Navy. He is not given the responsibility.",54

210,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"And he hits out very well, too!",54
211,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Yes , but a Royal Commission, which was appointed to go into the administration of the Navy Department, furnished a report, and' recommended certain things. The Commission pointed out a number of matters calling for attention. For example, it recommended that there should be a manager of naval works, and that Mr K in g Salter should be appointed to the position. Cabinet considered that question; but , instead of allowing the Acting Minis cide, the Government said, "" This matter must be deferred until the return of the Minister for the N a v y . "" You, Mr . Speaker, must have seen a letter from the honourable member for Capricornia appearing in the Melbourne Age, entitled "" The I . W . W . Government,"" in which attention was drawn to the fact that the Minister for the Navy was in the Old Country, and that the Government were imitating I . W . W . methods in going slow,_and that they had deferred almost everything of importance in the report of the Commission until the return of the Minister for the Navy. The Navy Department is in a chaotic condition, apparently, yet all these reforms are to be postponed until the return of Sir Joseph Cook.",54

213,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I refuse to be drawn off the track in that manner. I know that the most amicable relations exist between those two honourable gentlemen, for we have been told so by a cable signed "" Hughes and Cook."" And , by the way, the Age now informs' us that it has consulted its correspondent in London, and that in a few days we shall have his version.",54

217,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I apologize, sir; but I am sure that you will agree that it does not matter whether we pass this Bill or not; the Government and Government officials will spend the money. They do not want an Act of Parliament.",55
218,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,If we shortly pass this Bill scores of men will be thrown out of employment.,55
219,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"During the period when this Bill was hung up no men were thrown out of work. That may happen, however, if the Government do the right thing in stopping unnecessary expenditure, and then fail to do the right thing in seeing that people thrown out of work are placed back in employment. As for anything that this House may do, the Government care not a snap of the fingers. They care nothing for newspaper criticism, or for criticism by honourable members. They get their Bill passed. To come forward now with a preposterous motion to sus-' pend the Standing Orders to permit the passage of this Bill without delay forces one to ask-Where is the urgency?",55
220,Mr FENTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,The Government delayed it. themselves for weeks.,55
221,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"That is so; and it was only brought forward a few evenings ago to conciliate the honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd) and a few others who were kicking up a row about the War Precautions Act and its regulations, and the War-time Profits Bill . The Government wanted to prevent the "" little Amen corner"" over there from getting out of hand-the "" Win-the-war Bolsheviki."" [319]- 2",55

224,Mr CONSIDINE,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,I do object. The Bolsheviks have enough to carry without to. that.,55
225,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Nothin g that the M in ister for Works and Railways has said in favour of the motion to suspend the Standing Orders should weigh with honourable members for a single moment. But I do not remember that he said anything, though I presume he has reasons, audi at other times - he is loquacious enough. Indeed, I think I once described him as a "" Vicar of B r a y , "" and I was not very far wrong. do not Mr GROOM - And you have been braying ever since.",55
226,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"The Minister, at all events, did not bray very much when he moved! the suspension of the Standing Orders; and I want to know the reasons in support of the motion. Is he anxious to get this Bill through without delay in order that we may discuss the W a r Precautions Bill ; or is he desirous that we should hear the statement, promised to us by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr . W at t ), after consultation, as the Argus puts it , to express the views of the honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd) ?",55
227,Mr BOYD,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Does the Argus put it that way?,55
228,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Well , just prior to elections, articles appearing in the Argus are usually described as having been written, after consultation, to express the views of the Argus, by David He w i tt M a l in g ; though, if I may 'be permitted to remark, articles written by Francis W . Lydiard, and characterizing members of the Labour party as Sinn Feiners, Bolsheviks, pro-Germans and German agents, are not thus described.",55
229,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,What section of the Bill is the honourable member referring to now?,55
230,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Does the Minister desire to get this Bill through in order that we may discuss the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill? If he does, I venture to say that that measure should not be considered by us u n t i l we have had an. opportunity to go into all those letters written to the Sydney Daily Telegraph, the Sydney Morning Herald, the Melbourne Argus, andl the Age. Is the Treasurer (Mr Watt) anxious to get along with the War Loan Subscriptions Bill? he is, that is not necessary., because I hope we are not going to raise another loan for, at least, six months j and, even if we do., I submit we ought not to pass that Bill . Or, again, are the Government .anxious to get on with the Defence Bill and the Naval Defence that they should ask the House to agree - to ibhis - extraordinary motion to suspend the Standing 'Orders ? We know that the Caucus of the Cabinet met today, and decided not to go on with those proposals.",56
231,Mr GROOM,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Unfortunately , Cabinet did not meet today.",56
232,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"The Minister, I understand, is not always taken into the confidence of the Cabinet .Caucus. We do know, of course, .that there is a Caucus within the Cabinet, and that the Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) has his favorites. I can quite imagine, judging by his speeches, that he would first confer with the more Conservative members of the Cabinet, that .is, if there is any possible choice between the Conservatives and Liberals in the Ministry-thoug h I should think, from the benign appearance of the Postmaster-General (Mr . Webster) that he still has some Democratic tendencies. I cannot see a single item in the schedule to justif y the motion; but at this stage I do not desire to emulate the example of a member in another place, who, on the motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders in regard to a certain Bill , read .the whole measure for the information of senators. Nor do I in tend to take the items one by one, and ask the Minister whether there is anything in - any of them to justify the ;maotion.

246,Mr WATT,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Yes .,57
247,Mr TUDOR,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"That means that dredging work and the construction of retaining walls must be kept up, so as to prevent damage to the whole scheme.",57
248,Mr WATT,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Salvage works only for the. Henderson Base will be continued.,57
249,Mr TUDOR,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Wit h regard to the expenditure on land for quarantine requirements, and land for lighthouse purposes, when the measure was before us it was stated' the land for lighthouse purposes was in the, large cities, to enable the Department controlling lighthouses to do its own work.. I take no exception to that; nor do. I . take exception to expenditure on land for quarantine purposes, because I . think that the Quarantine Department deserves the greatest praise from the people of. Australia for having kept this country practically free of the terrible epidemic Q£>. Spanish influenza. We can quite understand, what thisdiscipline meant,, especially to the ANZACs: returning to Australia-, after four yearsof service,, and it is very gratifying indeed to know that the measures designed to protect Australia from the scourge have been so successful'.. We all earnestly hope that the back of the epidemic will soon be broken in other countries, so that the risk to Australia in the future will not be so great as it has been during the past few weeks. With regard, to the conservation of the Murray waters, a matter which I raised when the Bill was last before us, I agree with the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton), that it is necessary to complete the head works instead of proceeding with the work down the river. It has been estimated that the Murray works will bring, over 1,000,000 acres under irrigation, but we have to consider the use to which such land might be put. The popular product of Murray irrigation settlement, at least so far as Victoria is concerned, is dried fruit at M'ldura, and soft'fruits in the Goulburn - Valley. Mr Fenton„-A . lot of the land is under lucerne, also.",57
250,Mr TUDOR,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I am aware that a substantial area is under lucerne, but the bulk of the land is used for fruit-growing, and L know that, the people engaged in this industry complain that the value of the product.today is only about half what it was in pre-war time, owing to the sugar difficulty. Prior to the war they were able to get from £17 to £18"" a ton for their apricots.",57
251,Mr RODGERS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,They can get that now.,57
252,Mr TUDOR,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Yes , but owing, to the heavy frosts in the Goulburn Valley, Tatura,. Lancaster.,. Kyabram, Shepparton, and other places, the apricot crop is only about one-tenth of what was expected two months ago. In pre-war times growerscould get thefull amount of this sugar rebate in Eegard to all. jam.' exported, and in my opinion they are entitled tothefull rebate"" today.",57
253,Mr RODGERS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Can you tell us what is the causeof the sugar difficulty?,57
254,Mr TUDOR,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"There should be no difficulty whatever. I am not saying one word against the sugar, industry. The people of Australia acted wisely, I think, when they decided to keep Australiawhite.",57
255,Mr SINCLAIR,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,But they do not want to pay for it.,57
256,Mr TUDOR,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"They have a right to - pay for it inside Australia in order to protect those engaged in the industry; but those who manufacture jam for. export should receive, the full amount, of rebate, as in pre-war times, so ihat the growers may get fair, value for tlieir products. The sugar content of"" jam is easily ascertainable. The Customs, authorities know exactly the amount, of sugar in a certain quantity of jam. This year the apricot, crop will be about one-tenthof the normal crop, and the quantity of strawberries that will be gathered will be small, the dry weather having prejudiced crops in districts where the land is not irrigated, and frost having done damage ih the irrigated dis1 tricts:",57
257,Mr FENTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"What is the. difficulty in the way of giving a rebate? - Mr TUDOR - I do not know. Eor some years past-the arrangement dates back to when I was a Minister-the Government has been the sole importer of sugar, and handles the Queensland crop.",57
258,Mr WEST,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,It controls the price of sugar.,58
259,Mr TUDOR,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Yes . The jam manufacturer at the present time pays £ 2 7 per ton for sugar, and gets no rebate. New Zealand is not a big fruit-producing country, and does not compete with us in the matter of jam, but South Africa and other places are likely to be competithe tors of Australia as manufacturers of jam. Our jam-makers cannot pay fair prices for f r u it if they cannot get bate on their sugar. An article, appeared in the F r u it World of 1st vember, shows how the prices of our irrigation, various f r u it s have steadily declined, the original rebate on sugar has been pend gradually reduced from £ 6 a ton to the vanishing point. The locking of Murray is being undertaken to make land available for farming, especially intense culture under irrigation, but without a rebate on the sugar used for of jam it is doubtful whether it will be profitable to grow f r u it for jam-making, and f r u it is the chief crop of an irrigation settlement. When we adopted our White Australia policy, full y 75 per of the population was in favour of it . sugar producers of Queensland. The adoption of that polioy affected chiefly the sugar industry, and that in dustry had consequently to be helped. Nevertheless, we should not bave discontinued the rebate that was allowed to certain users of sugar. I believe that this year we shall have to import about 50,000 tons of sugar, our normal annual conthe sumption being about 260,000 tons. Manufacturers who use imported mafor terials are permitted to manufacture i bond, and I do not see why jam should not be manufactured in bond when i m ported sugar is used, a rebate being given when local sugar is used.",58
260,Mr COBSEB,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,In every other part the world but New Zealand sugar is protected dearer than it is here.,58
261,Mr ATKINSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"The question is, our"" jam manufacturers being charged a fair price?",58
262,Mr TUDOR,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I do not think that they are, and unless the Government acts wisely in this matter, the money expended on the locking of the Murray to provide irrigated areas for the growing of f r u it for jam-making will be largely thrown away.  represent a constituency which produces a large quantity of f r u it , and the feeling is growing there that the fruit-growers are suffering from the action of the Government in refusing to allow a rebate on sugar used by the manufacturers of jam for export. I expect that great good will result from the locking of the Murray . a reI t has been the policy of both Victoria which and New South Wales to encourage the Noproduction of f r u it by the extension of and the success of our attempt as lo settle our soldiers on the land will delargely on the f r u it industry. Consequently any action tending to discourthe age the production of f r u it will prejudice the success of our irrigation works. The value of irrigated land will seriously decrease if one industry is bolstered up at the making the expense of another.",58
263,Mr COBSEB,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Would the honourable member interfere with a Queensland in dustry to expand a Victorian industry?  cent, being bled white in the interest of the The artificial conditions attached to the pro- duction of sugar are destined to k ill the jam-making industry. We will have to consider seriously how far we are justified in allowing one State of the Commonwealth to benefit at the expense of other States. What purpose can be achieved by voting a large sum of money the purpose of locking the Murray n River and increasing irrigable areas if we adopt a policy which will render irrigation a failure from a fruit-growing point of view? An acre of f r u it trees should bear four tons of f r u it , and four tons of sugar are required to manufacture four of tons of jam. Before the war sugar was by a Tariff of £6 per ton. No w it is not allowed to be imported, and the are price is £26 per ton. Before the war, the cost of sugar for export jam was £12 per ton. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) says that there is no cheaper sugar to be found in any creased in 1916-17. other part of the - world than is creased to £10 per ton. to be found in Australia! Suppose we admit, for the sake of argument, that his at work. statement is correct; what is the objection to allowing a return of the pre-war conditions, when sugar could be imported for the purpose of jam making, and a reis bate of the duty was allowed on the exsimilar circumstances, ported jam?",58

270,Mr KELLY,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Wentworth) [8.40] if a. I should like to express m y hearty 1 with which the honourable  succeeded in connecting up with this B if f canthe price of sugar and the fostering of the jam industry. Whenever there isa rumpus in connection with f r u it the first person attacked by the f r u it industry is He thereupon the sugar industry of Queensland, which in turn memorializes the CommonParliament. As regards all these malefactors it is very hard for to arrive at a definite conclusion; as a humble observer of this question, by the and a consumer of ""fruit in moderation,- I to find that one can go 10 miles into the of country in a motor car and get from the orchardist f r u it at such prices that one almost, falls dead when on goingto purchase similar f r u it over the counter in acity shop he is asked a price four times as high. It may be that, the difficulty of the orchardist is due to some inefficiency inr distribution,, and not altogether to the malefactions of the. jam manufacturers, or the sugar combine, or the Commonwealth Government.. I wish to refer to an economy which, if it had been effected in the ordinary revenue of the country, would undoubtedly havemade this Bill less heavy than it is. The. matteris one of considerable interest to art students,, and possibly to some historians; It is well known to those who have perused the press recently that some comment 'has been aroused in the public  Mr Speaker, in their capacity as Chairman and sub-Chairman respectively of a Committee' of A r t , in having theirportraits reproduced for the benefit ofpos terity and the admiration of the world.

278,Mr KELLY,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I desire-to refer to the Government's actioninvery properly excluding fromthis Loan Bill a number of works which can best be deferred, u n t i l the war is completed. I would have preferred, if it were possible, to see the Plinders B'ase also excluded, but I understand that it is quite impossible to do that at t&is. stage. I think that the Admiral who made recommendations as to the estaMisfement of Naval Bases near the commercial ports of Australia had no policy placed before him by the Government, and no intimation as to what, in their opinion,, was the danger against which Australia might in futur e have to contend. He was asked merely what he would suggest in regard to. providing bases andorganization for a fleet to. be established,., and what the. size , of the fleet should be. Of. course,, that is> obviously the wrong way toset. aboutbuilding up any defence force, which is only thearm of foreign policy, and subject thereto. Admiral' Henderson had beenretired. Possibly he had reached' a time of l if e when me would be leas likely than ai younger man to consider new problems in the light of new conditions, and any man of M s &ge, - having served honourably and with distinction in the British Navy, u n t i l retired from it by reason of his age,. would naturally say to himself, "" We1 w i ll do in Australia as we do in England' rrr similar conditions.''' In England , 1 however, there is no commercial port big enough to take in both the commercial' shipping using it and the Navy wanting to use it. at the same time. The result of the sizei of theBritish Navy, the smallness of the: British commercial ports, and tke very heatvy use of such ports by mereamtile shipping,, is that, everywhere along the coast, where there is a mercantile centre like Southampton there is. neari t a naval' base: like. Ports : mouth. The orally deviation from this has been in the bigbases established within the last ten or fifteen years In Scotland' as a direct answer to the German naval menace. But as far as the natural centres of distribution and mo-"" bilizationare concerned, the commercial! ports available can hardly - accommodate the commercial shipping using it , and new naval ports are, therefore, provided alongside. We are extraordinarily fortunate in the size of our ports. We have in Port Phillip a bay capable of almost unlimited use by shipping.",61
279,Mr ARCHIBALD,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,How would the naval vessels get in at the Heads ? What depth of water would they have to draw ?,62
280,Mr KELLY,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"That is the kind of question with which we are constantly met in Australia. If nature has not done everything for us, we say, "" How can we get over the difficulty?"" We can get over it just as it is overcome elsewhere. Let us consider the very point raised by the honourable member when he asks, "" How could these vessels enter the Head's?"" How does the Navy Department expect its vessels to get into the new naval port at Plinders? One could afmost walk dry shod across the new naval port at Flinders before the present works were carried out. The naval authorities have been dredging out the mud there, and have literally been making a port. The tide in the fairway was so great that for the kind of vessels to be accommodated a special place had to be created where still water could be obtained. W it h that, indomitable determination which is the glory of our race, we have not only surmounted this difficulty, but we have gone out to look for it ! And this with a great harbour immediately available capable of accommodating, with some adjustments, not only all the mercantile shipping of Australia, but all the Navy Australia is ever likeiy to possess. I do not say that the Ministry can do more than they have promised to do in connection with this Loan Bill . They cannot. They have gone at Flinders; but I would like them earnestly to look into my suggestion that this difficulty with regard to the creation of new naval bases close to commercial ports is due to the process of slavishly following in the footsteps of England, where the practice has . been brought into existence, first of all, by the impossibility of-the two services using the same port, and, secondly, by reason of the proximity of foreign naval fleets making the constant night use of the military port a matter of essential urgency. I should like the Ministry to look into that side of the question. If they do, and if they refer it to the adviser, who is afterwards to be established here, they may find grounds for effecting considerable economy.",62
281,Mr FINLAYSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Brisbane) [8.52], - The position put by the honourable  gard to the Murray waters proposal would , be fairly acceptable if honourable members could only realise that it is only a one-sided view, and I venture to occupy a few moments in putting before the House the other side, so that we shall be able to arrive at a decision from a national, and not from a local standpoint. The honourable member would lead one to believe that the only industry in Australia deserving encouragement and consideration is that of f r u it production.  is not entitled to make such an assertion.",62
282,Mr FINLAYSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"The honourable member may bully the honourable member for Wide Bay, who is a mild individual, but he will not bully me. In regard to his suggestion as to the sugar in dustry, I should be very much surprised if the honourable member, or those who think with him, proposed that we should go back to conditions that obtained in the production of sugar in the earlier days. It is only within the last very few years that the production of sugar in Australia has been equal to the local consumption. We have just now, and through exceptionally good seasons, been able to reach that happy condition. That has been brought about to the advantage of. Australia by the introduction of a system entoo far abling white labour to be employed in the production of sugar-a n experiment never before tried in any country, and one that has proved surprisingly successf u l . Even the strongest and most vigorous supporters of t i e employment of white labour in the sugar fields scarcely anticipated that it would be so phenomenally successful as it has proved to be. There we find white labour employed in the tropics in a class of work that, in every other country, is carried out by coloured labour, and it is being carried out more successfully from a financial, and every other stand-point, than in the countries where coloured labour is used. That, of itself, however, would not be sufficient. What is more, is that this policy has meant the populating of a large - fringe of coastal territory in Queensland, which otherwise would not have been occupied, but would have been today a roaming ground for blacks. This development of the sugar industry in Australia has resulted in the settlement of quite large areasin Queensland, and those areas are continually expanding to the advantage of the whole Commonwealth. The sugar industry has only received that encouragement towards its development which, in the fiscal - policy of the Government, is recognised as the legitimate protection necessary for its expansion. That same policy of Protection which guided us in the establishment of the sugar industry, will guide us also in the establishment of other industries. The honourable member forEchuca (Mr. Palmer) desires Protection for the jam industry, even though other industries go without. If the honourable member desired Protection for the fruit-growers, I should be inclined to support him to an extent; but the expenditure of this money on the locking pf the Murray will, it is hoped, lead to the irrigation of large areas eminently suitable for frui t culture. It is not at all wise to suggest that the production of fruit is dependent on jam-making for its success. I have had the pleasure of visiting Mildura,and Renmark, and know what those places are capable of producing. They can grow fruit of a quality .not surpassed by that of any imported fruit. I suppose the honourable member would be the last to . suggest that we should withdraw the fiscal protection we give to dried f r u it ; yet I could put up a good case as to why we should do so.",62
283,Mr ATKINSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"To what part of the Loan Bill is the honourable member referring ? Mr FINLAYSON"" - The honourable member is not Chairman of Committees just now. I had the honour to be a member of a Fruit Commission which visited the districts to which I have referred to inquire into the production and distribution of dried fruits. We found very attractive country producing very fine qualities of f r u it that is appreciated wherever known; but we also found that the prices were not settled by the man who grew it, but by a combine of men who marketed it.",63
284,Mr ATKINSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,The same people both grow and market the fruit from Mildura.,63
285,Mr FINLAYSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,They are not all the same people.,63
286,Mr RIOHAED FOSTER,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Nine-tenth s of them, at least, both grow and market the fruit.",63
287,Mr FINLAYSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"The honourable member must not speak too quickly. We had it on sworn evidence, which is available to honourable members in the records, from the President of the Fruit growers Association in the Angaston district, in South Australia, that the people there could grow currants of the best quality, and, supplying them at 3d. per lb., make a good living. Wte asked what the price of currants was at that time, and we were told that it was 5£d. per lb. to the wholesale houses.",63
288,Mr SPEAKER,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY," Althoug h I allowed the hon considerable latitude, I had no idea that the debate would develop on linea altogether foreign to the Bill. I remind honourable members that we are discussing the third reading of the Loan Bill, and to go into all these matters of detail is not strictly regular.",63
289,Mr FINLAYSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"What I have in my mind is that, by this Loan Bill, we are providing a certain amount of money for the locking of the Murray, directly in order to provide water for irrigation of certain areas suitable for frui t culture. This expenditure is meant-and I support it for that reason-to assist Australia in the production of frui t of kinds eminently required here. So far from the honourable member for Echuca (Mr. Palmer) being correct in saying that thisirrigation scheme will producesuch enormous quantities of frui t that there would he no market for it, unless it be made into jam, I point out to. him that Australia today is not consuming one-fourth of the fruit, either green,, dried, or preserved, that it would if the prices were at areasonable level. Mr SINCLAIR.:-Are - not largequanti- protect. ties of spirits made out of the Mildura fruit? »",63
290,Mr FINLAYSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Yes , and it is most disgraceful that the best.of grapes and the finest of fruits should be put into, vats to be made into poison. This is a most unfortunate fact, butone which, I think, we shall get rid of in time. There is not a single variety of fruit grown in Australia today that is not at. least twice as dear as it ought to be to the consumer.. If the expenditure of this money on. the. locking of the Murray is going, to produce such enormous quantities of fruitthat the public will be able to get it cheaper, that will be worth the expenditure twice over.",64
291,Mr SAMPSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,It is not the growing but the distribution that requires regulating-.,64
292,Mr FINLAYSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"But the fruit must be. grown first. There is no industry that more deserves encouragement than the production of fruit suitable to this country. Australian people are fond of fruit, but they cannot get it at a reasonable price:, and the reason is not so much that there is over-production, or under-production, as that there is. enormous waste in distribution. only need's more effective distribution, and' the fruit-growers of Australia could produce unlimited quantities and find a satisfactory market. I suppose there is not a business in the country in which the overhead chargesare higher than in the fruit business.",64

I merely wish to point out that the matter is really a very serious one to the Commonwealth. Apparently, however, the Government, for reasons of their own, profess not so to regard it . They desire the. Minister for the Navy to remain in London, and. they have actually asked the Prime Minister to stay there, notwithstanding that these two gentlemen, if they were discharging tlieir proper duties, would be here to see that these recommendations by the Royal Commission were given effect to as soon as possible. The Government are asking for a vote of some hundreds of thousands of pounds for the Navy. I find here a proposal that Mr Tracey, a paymaster, should be appointed finance member of the Naval Board.",67
332,Mr WATT,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,What is the date of the document from which the honourable member is quoting ? We have altered that.,67
333,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Has the Acting Prime Minister paid' so littl e attention to the Royal Commission's report on the Navy Department that he does not know the date of it * We all recollect that he said Surely he "" had read the report in a cursory way."" What has become of his close attention to duty ? This report was presented to the House on 4th October, and considered by the Cabinet on the 1st October. When I Mr SAMPSON - Does the honourable member agree with the recommendations made by the Commission?",67
334,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,I agree with a great number of them.,67
335,Mr SAMPSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Does the honourable member agree with the recommendation that the administration of the Department should be handed over to an independent Board, free from political control?",67
336,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"No . Doubtless the Commission found such a deplorable condition of affairs in the Department that its members were forced to the conclusion that, politicians having made such a mess of things, it would be better to hand over the administration to a Board of business men.",67
337,Mr SAMPSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,That is the chief recommendation of the Commission.,67
338,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Yes ; but there are a number of other recommendations. One can excuse the Royal Commission for having a poor opinion of politicians, because it is impossible to pick up a newspaper without reading something in disparagement of them. When I was a young man, there was a certain amount of honour and prestige attached to the position of a member of Parliament. PAit bo-day there is neither. When one presents his pass at a railway station, the people look at him in disdain, because of the poor repute in which politicians are held. I do not know of any single press organ which does not imagine that its editor could govern the country much better than can politicians. In such circumstances I do not wonder that the Commission which inquired into the administration of the Navy Department desires to take that administration out »f the hands of politicians and put it into the hands of a Business Board: The Acting Prime Minister has been good enough to say that he has altered things since 1st - October. In what way has he altered them ? I find that the consideration of nearly all the recommendations of the Commission has been deferred t ill the return of the Minister for the Navy. There is, for 'example, a recommendation that the clerical section of the administration should be thoroughly re-organized. Mr .POYNTON - That has already been done.",67
339,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Has it been done since .some honourable members drew attention to the matteri n this House ?  within a week of the receipt of the Commission's report.,68
340,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Then the 'Government do - not know their own mind, because on the 1st October- ",68
341,Mr WATT,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"If the honourable member would ask for information, he would get it-informatio n which would throw light even into his dark mind.",68
342,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I find great difficulty in getting very much information from the Acting Prime Minister. In stead, I get from him only a number of side-stepping replies or attempts to be humorous at my expense. Take the question of copper as an example.",68
343,Mr WATT,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Hav e I been humorous on copper ?,68
344,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,I do not know where we are today in regard to our copper producers. Mr Watt. - No r do we.,68
345,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Doubtles s that is because . the Government have sent cable after cable to the Prime Minister without obtaining any reply ,68
346,Mr SPEAKER,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY, Order ! I can see nothing in this Bill relating to copper.,68
347,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"The Hill has a good dealing, to do wdth it , inasmuch as it provides for - the laying down of randerground copper «ondi'uits - out of order. Are we to understand from the Acting Prime Minister that, since the Cabinet decision to defer action until after .the - return of the Minister for the Navy, a staff committee to control all clerical appointments has been - constituted ? If so, we must understand that the Government have no mind of their own. In this connection their conduct resembles the tactics they are pursuing in regard to the Corangamite election. They are afraid to nominate .a candidate or to in dorse one.",68
348,Mr WATT,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,We will do that in our own way. Mr HIGGS;-The Government are trying to sneak in Lt - Colonel Knox Iby sending the Minister for Defence (Senator Peaece) to speak at Colac.,68
349,Mr SPEAKER,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,I do not see in this decided Bill anything even remotely relating to that matter. Mr MATHEWS. - You have not told us about the. London Office.,68
350,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I am reminded, that there is a large sum on the schedule for the London Office. We appointed a High Commissioner., at a large salary, surrounded him with a big staff, and have spent nearly £1,000,000 on a palatial building to house him . We understand that the Honourable Andrew Eisher's duties are, to some extent, social; but they are also of a business character. The proposal to spend another £25,000 on this palatial building in London, for the purpose of providing an office for a H i gh Commissioner whose duties are of a business character, surely entitles me to review the position. Why is not the Honourable Andrew Eisher permitted to deal with matters of business concern, such as the sale of our wheat and metals? Mr Watt. - What did you spend on the same building when you were Treasurer ? This vote is merely cleaning qn^p your work. Several honourable members interrupt",68
351,Mr SPEAKER,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Order ! An audible discussion is developing which is quite,68
352,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"The disorderly interruptions of the Acting Prime Minister disconcert me for a moment. * If /the Higih Commissioner is not to take up his posianswer tion as a business representative of tralia, it is of no use to spend money Australia House. If the Prime Minister is to deal with metals, wheat, copper, ships, and other things, there is for a High Commissioner. We know there is about Mr Fisher, as there about Sir Joseph Cook, a dignity that commends him for distinction in that reEchuca gard; but I sometimes wonder whether and the Prime Minister, who is staying so long in London, proposes to stay there until within six months of the termination of Mr Fisher's appointment, whereupon Mr Fisher will be given a six months' holiday, and Mr Hughes will be made High Commissioner. If that is the protions. gramme, we can understand why the Acting Prime Minister wants Mr Hughes to remain in London, and why he is pared to spend this money on Australia House.",68
353,Mr WATT,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,I do not want him to remain in London.,69
354,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"If not, why did the vernment ask him to stay?",69
355,Mr WATT,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Because we thought the peace conditions demanded should stay. Personally, we should him out here. He would deal with you pretty promptly.",69
356,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I only wish he would come. I am waiting to tell a story, when I can get him here, to which he will be unable to reply, because I have the documents.",69
357,Mr FINLAYSON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,It would be a strange story that he could not reply to.,69
358,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"There are some things to which he cannot reply satisfactorily. I said some time ago that he would probably stay in London until the end of the war. The war is now ended, and he probably stay a long time yet. He is certainly not dealing satisfactorily with the sale of our copper. The Acting Prime Minister and his colcan leagues are treating this Loan Bill i very flippant manner, and Ministerial lowers are neglecting their opportunitieo. If they pass the Bill authorizing the penditure by way of loan of £1,242.194. they will have no reason to complain i the Government spend the whole sum. Tn that case I should like to know what [320] they will make to their constituAusents. We on this side are small in numon bers, and do our best, but we cannot do more than utter a protest. When we have uttered it , I presume we may be no need held to have done our duty. I find here a number of items that is would allow me to deal with questions reraised by the honourable member for  f r u it . There is, for instance, the expenditure of money on the Murray Waters Scheme. I was, very much surprised that the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr . Corser), who knows the sugar question from A to Z, did not deem it his duty to reply to the honourable member's asserI t was left to the honourable mem- ber for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) to defend the sugar industry. However, I preshall not defend it at this stage. There are other items which might allow me, if I were presumptuous enough, to refer to the money which is being spent on the settlement of soldiers, but I do Gonot think it is of any use. The Government intend to go to their doom, and will carry the "" Win-the-war "" party with that he them, so I suppose we had better let like them commit political suicide. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. WAB PRECAUTIONS BILL . SECOND READING . Debate resumed from 27th November (vide page 8450) on motion by Mr . GROOMThat this Bill be now read a second time.",69
359,Mr ARCHIBALD,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Hindmarsh) [9.33]. - Some honourable members consider this measure entirely unnecessary. Many will think that, as the armistice has been signed, and hostilities have ceased, peace has arrived; but, according to legal definitions that have been read to us, peace be considered properly finalized only n a when the peace terms are signed and crefoldentials exchanged. There are many reasons why a measure of this character exshould be passed, but I am not surprised at the protests from some quarters. T f give jplace to nobody in the desire to see personal freedom restored in Australia ai it was established throughout the Empir* in pre-war times, but some one has said that we i u Australia lack imagination, and I think there is some truth in the remark. We fail to realise the gigantic struggle that we have gone through, and in which all those Australians of ours who fought for. freedom and the Empire on the other side of the world played such a great part. It is felt by the Governments in all portions of the British Empire that it is impossible to step from a state of war into a state of peace, after a tremendous and exhausting struggle such as that which has just ceased, in a few hours, or even a few days. There are some people in Australia who assume that, now that hostilities have ceased, it is an easy matter to restore pre-war conditions. One requires to carefully look into the situation today, and to weigh the tremendous issues involved. We should realise the great difficulties which stand in the way of getting back into our normal stride. Many of Australia's industries have been thrown sadly out of gear. It may be urged that the war has not hurt Australia very much. True, we have not felt the pinch of hunger. Even the very.war loans have had a tendency to circulate money, and there is actually a general state of prosperity throughout the land. Nevertheless a state of war virtually still exists, and we, as representatives of the people, have our responsibilities. One does not expect much from an Opposition. It has no responsibility,and does not care. But there is a responsibility thrown upon the Government, and on those who support the Government, That responsibility is to squarely face the great difficulties which must now arise in the transition of our country from war to peace. The honourable member for Henty Boyd) referred, the other evening, to the desire of the Chamber of Commerce speedily to see business where return to normal The suggestion is that the Government should leave trade and commerce alone now, and let the people run things for themselves once more. I am reminded that private interests are not necessarily national interests. We should be guided by national interests, as far as possible, in these difficult times. In this Bill the Bolsheviks. Mr Archibald. Government are only asking for the retention of necessary powers for a further period of six months. That should ho ample, and I question if it would be wise to accept and put into operation yet the views of the Chamber of Commerce. The British authorities have not seen fit to abolish the control of food and food prices. The whole situation is still regarded in England as serious-seriou s enough, at any rate, to warrant the continuance of full control. . If it is correct to say that the war will not have ceased until the terms of peace have been signed, there is justification for the Commonwealth Government in carrying on its control of a great many of those matters affected by War Precautions Regulations. I believe in the Government fixing prices, and I say unhesitatingly that we are not going to achieve industrial peace upon a sound basis uuless it be on a prin ciple that when the worker has earned his wages he should be protected from plunder. It is a difficult job to afford such protection, but it is the job of this Parliament and of this; Government, and it is one which must be fearlessly undertaken. As a people and a Parliament we are not generally frightened of difficulties. I have no doubt but that we shall safely return to an era of industrial peace, because there is too much common sense in the Australian people to tolerate things otherwise for long. The argument of the Government that six months' extension, as proposed under the Bill , will be sufficient,- should find favour from a sound business view-point. W it h regard to the moratorium, for example, while it may not so much affect big interests, those people who would be released from pro(Mr tection should be given reasonable time to look forward to that period when they must meet their obligations. Six months every- would not be too long a term. Without conditions. doubt, the end of the war came as a surprise. Nobody believed it would be possible for hostilities to cease with such dramatic suddenness, and just when they did. It all turned on the mild weather which existed at the Front at the time.",69
360,Mr CONSIDINE,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,It all turned on the,70
361,Mr ARCHIBALD,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I will deal with the Bolsehviks and all your tribe. It is desirable that the Government should exercise the power of censorship for some time to come. The good sense of the Government will induce them to move in the proper direction at the right time. At present we are not under normal conditions. We hear complaints ahout the rising price of all commodities, and I point out that the chief cause is the appreciation of gold, due to the fact that Australia, in common with every other Allied country, has been forced by war conditions to enlarge the paper currency. But for the alliance between the great banking institutions and the Governments of the various countries it would not have been possible for Great Britain and her Allies to come through this war so successfully. Bolshevism can do nothing in the way of finance. sia it has reduced the price of the rouble to about 6d., and if the Bolsheviks had their way here, we would have the value of the pound sterling down to about 3d. When the people of this country realise the danger ahead of them under any phase of Bolshevism, they will speak in no uncertain voice. It is possible that the Government will require further loans for repatriation purposes, and it is essential, in my view, that they should retain the power under our War Precautions Regulations to prevent anybody from attempting in any way to impair the financial stability of this country. There must be no preaching of repudiation from any quarter. Anything in that direction must be stamped out at once by regulation. The safety of this community is more i m portant than the "" skiting "" of any lowdown politicians. There is no doubt about that, but unfortunately there is a class of politician abroad now so lost to any sense of honour that their only purpose is to keep a seat in Parliament even at the dictates of the wildest and most extreme section of the community. There is one important fact concerning the stability of our currency which I think honourable members opposite would do well to realise, and that is that any interference with .the currency affects, first, the working people of any community, so that the greatest enemies the workers can have are those who attempt to tamper with the currency. They only seek to lead the people down a blind, alley while they themselves sneak away with the plunder. Therefore, it is absolutely essential that during the next six months, and until we get back to normal conditions, the Government should take every measure, by means of regulations, to safeguard our financial stability. An y Government failing to do that ought to be impeached. I could give many other reasons in support of the proposal to extend the operations of the W a r Precautions Act . I might refer to the position with regard to wool and metals, the control of which has been very beneficial to this country. In the Old Country the British Government, when confronted with extraordinary warI n Rustime difficulties, appealed to the patriotism of the ablest men in the land to assist them in solving the difficulties. Much the same course was adopted in Australia, and this country has been well served. I have no desire to lose the freedom that we have hitherto enjoyed, but we must realise that the Government are confronted with tremendous responsibilities, and, like intelligent men, we must face the situation and not dream. dreams. I have already referred to the need of censorship in relation to finance in order to safeguard our position and prevent any talk of repudiation.",71
362,Mr BRENNAN,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Se e that all the moneylenders are protected.,71
363,Mr ARCHIBALD,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,And the honourable member will see that the Sinn Feiners are protected.,71
364,Mr BRENNAN,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,I thought that the British Labour party were protecting them.,71
365,Mr ARCHIBALD,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"There is another reason why the Government should hold the powers they at present possess. I refer to the industrial conditions under which we are living. It would not be out. of place to review the situation as I see it from an industrial point of view. It is not one that the Government should treat lightly. I do not mean to say that there is any need for alarm, because I believe that the great majority of the workers are actuated by shrewd common-sense; but somehow or other the war seems to have upset many things, and I think militant industrialism should he carefully watched from a Government point of view in the interests of good government.",71
366,Mr CONSIDINE,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,That is why you want the War Precautions Act continued ?,72
367,Mr ARCHIBALD,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Yes . Make no mistake about that. I want it continued for one reason.,72
368,Mr MATHEWS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"To "" g e t "" the honourable member for Barrier.",72
369,Mr ARCHIBALD,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"No; he is not worth powder and shot. tant industrials and red-raggers are working on three lines. Their first aim is to destroy our present form of government, and to substitute for it a Bolshevik Government. The one big union proposal has nothing industrial in it ; it is a masked battery, intended to force the revolution to which I refer.  not bring about a revolution in Australia.",72
370,Mr ARCHIBALD,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,They can - have a good try.,72
371,Mr WALLACE,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,They will bring about a revolution in Hindmarsh at the next election.,72
372,Mr ARCHIBALD,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"They were not successful there at the last election. In that division the majority of the electors are not in sympathy with the red-raggers and cut-throat revolutionaries. The leaders and philosophers of honourable members opposite are declaring that the old Labour crowd is played out. They are working the Labour movement for the benefit of the young men. At all the meetings that have taken place during the past three years it is young men have been conspicuous, and it is young misuse. men of the red-rag type who are getting control of the unions. What reform would they bring about? Australia will be a good country to get out of if ever their kind of Democracy is imposed on the country. They would extend the franchise to lads and lasses between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one years. We know how light-headed and somewhat giddy persons of that age are. We know how their votes would go. The proposed extension of the franchise would put the extremists, the red-raggers, the revolutionaries, in power for ever. Even the Bolsheviks, who are now making so much trouble in Germany-if they ate each other I should not trouble much; it would be the best thing that could happeneven they do not propose such an extension of the franchise. In Germany one cannot vote until he has reached the age of twenty-four.",72
373,Mr CONSIDINE,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"In England, before the war, there were 9,000,000 persons The mili- who could not vote.",72
374,Mr ARCHIBALD,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"We need not worry about the position in England. The English trade unions will not swallow the rubbish that the extremists in Australia are talking. I recognise the common sense and intelligence of the great mass of the unionists here. Those who know something of the inner workings of unionism are aware that the sober, steady section of unionists do not go near the meetings. When they do turn up at a meeting, the extreme militant industrialists win only by. the skin of their teeth, after protracted debates lasting for hours. Part of their game for years has been to keep discussion going as long as they can. But the Government should be on its guard to see that the extremists do nothing to jeopardize the safety of the country, and until we get back to the industrial conditions that existed before the war-that is, in six months or twelve months' time-Minister s must have the powers that aTe given to them by the War Precautions Act. . A great deal has been said about the misuse of these powers; but I who have not seen any evidence of such I have known a Ministerial supporter to be pelted with stones by supporters of our friends opposite. That is an illustration of their Democracy. Powers like those given by the War Precautions Act should not be exercised by a Government in ordinary times; and they should be intrusted only to Ministers in whom the people have confidence - shrew d men, who will not lose their heads. The present Ministers are of that stamp. If they were different, I would not give them these powers. The AmeriYet can people, who are as free as any in the world, have practically made theiT Presisigned. dent a dictator; and in the times of our fathers, Pitt, who said that he could his country through, and did so, was trusted with powers which he could not have exercised in normal times. The prewill sent are not normal times, and I am prepared to let the powers given hy the War Precautions Act Temain with Ministers until the times become normal. MrCHARLTON (Hunter) [10.5] When the War Precautions Act was purpose passed there may have been a necessity for it in certain directions, but honourable members never dreamt that it would be used to the extent it has been. We were told that it would be used chiefly to with aliens, and with matters arising of the war, and that it' would have no interference with their liberties. considerable importance upon the doAct mestic life of Australia. On that necessary in our everyday life. account many of us gave support business to what was undoubtedly the most drastic legislation that has ever been passed this Parliament. I do not say is not necessary for a Government to have large powers in time of war, but maintain that the sooner we get back to normal conditions the better; and now that an armistice has been signed, and we anticipate the early demobilization our troops, no one will contend that we ought not to revert to the normal condimuch lower. tions that existed prior to 1914. As deliberative legislative body we have practically no power. Ministers can govern Australia.by the War Precautions pealed. Regulations, and need not consult Parfact liament at all - We have had that form of government for a considerable time past, and we are now asked to continue until six months after peace is declared. - The cablegrams inform us that at the forthcoming Peace Conference it is hoped that the way will be paved to a further Conference in February next, and that is hoped that that Conference'will be to lay down a general guiding policy, the details of which will be completed at later period. No one has the slightest idea when that later period will be. I may be from two to six years hence. duction we are asked to expend this Act until six months after peace is actually It is unreasonable for a Government to ask Parliament to give it the pull right to control Australia by means of in the War Precautions Regulations until som© time in the far distant future. It not tend to the good of the country. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Archibald) thinks that it is necessary to* give the Government this power, but wherever I go I meet people who were favourable to the passing of the Act, now holding the view that the for which it was passed having disappeared with the cessation of hostilities, there is no necessity to allow a measure which is not giving satisfaction to the people to continue in force. The deal press condemn the censorship; business out men and the general public condemn the The interferes with everything that is' The man is interfered with, the public are interfered with, the pr.ss are inby terfered with, and no benefit accrues to that it the general body of the people. The honourable member for Hindmarsh I contends that it is necessary to extend the Act in order to regulate prices, and other honourable members have claimed that the Act is necessary for the purpose of of controlling prices. Tf the measure were repealed the cost of living would he The cost of every coma modity is abnormal, and there appears to be no chance of getting prices back to the normal unless this legislation is reThat this is so is due to the that we have Boards dealing with everything we consume, and an analysis of the personnel of those Boards discloses it that they consist of persons who are interested in the particular commodities? they control. It has been said that it is part of the policy of the Labour party to have Boards to distribute goods proi t duced in Australia to the people, and able thus cut out the middleman. We certainly believe in the introduction of coa operation, and that the producers should get the full benefit of their labour, but t the present method of dealing with prois just the reverse of that policy. Departments which have heen set up for the purpose of dealing with different products have really taken control of legislation. Parliament counts for nothing. It can do nothing for the welfare of the people while this Act continues in force. The Wheat Board consists of persons who are interested in wheat. The' same thing applies to the Wool Board.",72
375,Mr JOWETT,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Who has been injured by the Wool Board?,74
376,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"If the honourable member goes to the Newcastle district he will find who has been injured by the Wool Board. Ever since the Board was ap pointed the people in that district have been agitating to get the wool which comes from the North-Western District of New South Wales dealt with at Newcastle. There are sheds there which could have - accommodated a large quantity of wool, probably the whole of the output of the district, hut they have remained empty, while the Wool Board has built new sheds in Sydney at great cost to the country for the purpose of dealing with the wool that should have gone to' Newcastle, and in order to obviate the necessity for sending an appraiser there.",74
377,Mr JOWETT,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Did they ever sell wool at' Newcastle before?,74
378,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Yes .,74
379,Mr JOWETT,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,They have not done so for thirty years.,74
380,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,They have sold wool in Newcastle.,74
381,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"At any rate, there is a difference between appraising wool and selling it .",74
382,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"E x a c t l y ; and in these times, when we are practising economy in all directions and in every Department, it would have been easier to send an appraiser to Newcastle at a cost of train fares, than to build new sheds at Sydney and drag the wool 100 miles past empty sheds at Newcastle. The honourable member asks, "" Who has been injured?"" I tell him to go to Newcastle. The Chamber of Commerce has met there, and wool-growers from every part of the North-Western District of New South Wales have met there, and they have roundly condemned the Wool Board for its action. The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr .Watkins) has raised the question in this House time after time, and he has interviewed Ministers in regard to the matter.",74
383,Mr JOWETT,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,I asked if any one had been in j u r e d : I did not ask if there were any complaints.,74
384,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"The country has been injured. It is injured when thousands of pounds are spent unnecessarily on the building of sheds in Sydney, and in dragging the wool 100 miles past Newcastle. .",74
385,Mr JOWETT,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,That was done before the war.,74
386,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Eve n so, the Board was not justified in continuing that policy. It was appointed to economize and to improve conditions. The fact that we may have been moving along in a groove, and were not doing what was in the best interests of the country, was no reason why a Board specially created by this Commonwealth should continue on the same lines. During the war period an endeavour should have been made to save-every possible penny in order to relieve the burden on the people.",74
387,Mr JOWETT,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,The growers ' never sold their wool at Newcastle.,74
388,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"It is a strange fact that the wool-growers, who are directly interested, should have sent representatives to a conference which I attended at Newcastle, and that they should have expressed the unanimous opinion of the growers of the north and north-west against the carrying of wool for appraisement past Newcastle. The conference carried a resolution, which was supported by the growers' representatives, that the Commonwealth Government should bo asked to use their in fluence with the Wool Board to have wool appraised at Newcastle. Those facts are well known to some honourable members who were invited to the conference. Nobody can claim that, in this matter, the best course has been followed. A good deal more cost than was necessary was caused by that policy of centralization. I turn now to the fixation of the price of meat. It would have been much better if the Government had never interfered - with the price of meat. Their action in that regard was a huge blunder. Acting under the War Precautions Act they decided to fix the price at which meat should be sold to the carcass butchers, losing sight of the fact that the carcass butchers operate only in the capital cities. People outside of the metropolitan areas were not helped by that regulation. Immediately the regulation was issued, butchers outside the metropolitan area, and the consumers, had to pay a higher price. Butchers were-delivering meat in the Newcastle district at from l d . to 2d. per lib. below prices fixed by the Government, but they were obliged to immediately increase their prices because they had to pay for their stock a price equivalent to that fixed for the carcass butcher. They did not ask for the price to be fixed; the growers did not desire it , and the consequence was that th* regulation benefited nobody. Yet we are asked to continue an Act which will permit the Government to repeat blunders of that kind, and give them all the powers they have had during the four and a half years of war. What is the feeling of the people in regard to the War Precautions Act? Many things have been done which should never have been permitted. Cartoons and articles which were offensive to a large section of the community were permitted to be published in certain sections, of the press. During the time of war, the endeavour of the Government should Have been to maintain good feeling amongst the people, but they permitted Mr Critchley Parker to issue cartoons which had the very opposite effect, and, instead of helping, retarded Australia in playing its part in the war, Why did the censor permit such offensive matter to be published, whilst preventing the circulation of legitimate information regarding the war.",74
389,Mr MCGRATH,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Were those cartoons published for political purposes?,75
390,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I do not know; I am asking. The publication of that matter was permitted without any interference; yet we are told that the continuance of the War Precautions Act is necessary for the purpose of bringing about concord, and conserving the in terests of the people. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Archibald) referred to the workers, and said that it was necessary that the Aet should continue u n t i l such time as the clamour of the extreme section had died down. The honourable member never made a greater mistake in his life. If we. continue legislation of this kind, which takes away the liberty of the people, we shall merely increase that extreme feeling, because reasonable the people are opposed to the War Precautions Act . It interferes with their rights too much. In very many places, people have not the right which they had before the war, to address a public meeting. I assure honourable members that, instead of the continuance of this Act tending to bring about a better feeling in the community, it will produce quite the opposite effect. We cannot hope to create better feeling if we cause the people to think that their liberties are being curbed, regardless of whether the country is at war or not.' For all practical purposes, the war has . ceased; but the War Precautions Act will continue until peace is signed. That will be long enough, without asking for its extension for a further six months. The Government would be well advised if they decided to allow this Bill to remain in abeyance for a few months. By the time the House resumes its sittings in the new year, we shall be in a better position' to deal with this question, for we shall have an idea of the period within which peace is likely to be signed, and of whether the Peace Conference has decided on the broad lines of a settlement, leaving the details to be arranged later. W it h that information in our possession, we should be better able to judge of the necessity for a continuance of the Act. There may be some activities which it is necessary to regulate, but the Bill makes no specific mention of anything. The Government are simply asking for a continuance of their existing power to deal with, anything and everything ; and when we have regard to the fact that under the powers conferred by this Act, prices have been regulated in such a way as to compel the working people to pay more for the necessaries of life than they paid prior to the war, we may expect a big outcry against the extension of an Act which has been responsible for making the cost of living 40 or 50 per cent, higher than it should be. How are we to return to normal conditions? So far as I am aware, only one commodity has not risen in price during the war.",75
391,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Suga r has been stationary at 3Jd. per l b.,76
392,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I had overlooked that item. All other commodities have increased in price with the exception of bricks in New South Wales. The price of them was not advanced, because the State Oovernment control brickyards, and have been selling to the public the 40,000 bricks per day produced in excess of the requirements of the State. In 1911, the price of bricks was £ 2 5s. per thousand, and it has continued at that figure throughout the war. That was due to the fact that the production of the State brickworks prevented private producers from combining and increasing their chargefa. Everything 'else used in the building trade is much dearer than it used to be. The price of timber, we know, has increased to a remarkable degree, and the price of galvanized iron, under the War Precautions Act , went up by leaps and bounds. , Mr HIGGS - It went per ton.",76
393,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Quite so; . but within a very short time after the signing of the armistice it dropped £ 2 7 per ton. That fall was not due to newly-arrived importations. There may be a. further fal l before a consignment reaches Australia, and I venture to say that as soon as a cargo of galvanized iron is landed in Australia the price will come down to almost the pre-war level. Under this Act the Government have the power to protect consumers. then, do they permit individuals to make huge profits at the expense of the general community? I could understand the Government saying to the House, "" There are two or three specific matters which we must have power to control under the War Precautions Act for some time to come, but, generally speaking, with regard to the domestic life of this country we are prepared to repeal so much of the Act as affects it . "" Such a proposal would meet with the approval of the people. They would consider that they were about to get a fair deal, that competition would be what it was before the war, and that the purchasing power of the sovereign would get back to something like what it then was. The sovereign today will purchase only what could have been bought for l is . or 12s. in the pre-war period. The Government, huwever, are asking Parliament to prolong the life of the Act for six months after the war. None but those directly interested will support such a proposal. The press of Australia is almost unanimous in decrying the continuation of the Act,- let alone any extension of it . Most of the newspapers urge that it should not be continued for a day longer, except for some specific object in respect of which its continuance might be justified. Notwithstanding this attitude on the part of the press, and its contention that under the Act it has been deprived of the p r i v i leges it enjoyed prior to the war of conveying news to the people, the Government are asking that the Act shall be continued for six months after the expiration of the war. No one can say how long we shall have to live under this form of Government if that request be up to nearly £ 1 0 0 agreed to.",76
394,Mr BAMFORD,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,Judgin g by what is going on outside it is very oppressive!,76
395,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,If the honourable member had to go to the country tomorrow he would find that the people regard it as being distinctly' oppressive. He would find it impossible to get a public meeting to support this proposal. Every one recognises that the Act has outlived its usefulness.  from a man on the honourable member's Why T side asking that on some lines the Act should be continued for another four years.,76
396,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"1I have pointed out that there may be some specific matters in respect - of which the continuance of the Act oould be justi- fied, but its general application caning not be supported on ' any ground. Every one has been expecting its soldiers' immediate repeal. If this. Bill passed, we shall have public meetings, all over the country-meeting s promoted, not by any one political party, but represen900 tative of every section of the community.",76
397,Mr BAMFORD,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,To-night' s meeting was fairly one-sided 1,77
398,Mr OHARLTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"I know nothing to that, but the honourable member will hear before long of meetings convened all over Australia to protest against such legislation.",77
399,Mr WISE,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,If the Act were allowed to expire tomorrow we should have requests from all over the country for the enactment of much of it .,77
400,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,I haye just said that there may be some specific matters in respect of which its continuance could be justified.,77
401,Mr WISE,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"The trouble is that every one wants, it to apply to a different of specific matters.",77
402,Mr OHARLTON,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"What justification can there be for the anxiety vernment to carry this Bill at once? We shall meet, after the Christmas adjournment, in February. The peace terms will not have been signed by that time. It may be two 'or three years before they are signed'. I hope it will not be; the Act is to remain in force until six months after the close of the war. Why should it be continued after the signing of the peace terms.?. In any event, might, be allowed to remain in abeyance until we are recalled in the earlier of next year. I ask leave to continue remarks at a later date. ' Leave granted; debate adjourned..

406,Mr HIGGS,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Capricornia). [10.35]- At the risk of being deemed importunate, I desire to ask the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) if he will renew his efforts but to. secure for the copper producers of Australia some satisfaction with regard to the - question I addressed to him some time ago? I then urged that if the it British Government would not continue the present contract for the purchase part of our. copper after the 31st instant, my copper producers here should be allowed to. deal with the matter through their own agentB in other countries. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt), said this afternoon that he would endeavour to find, out whether the Australian, copper producers could sell to other countries: but he will pardon, me if. I suggest, that if. he could'get permission for the. copper producersto sell their copper, theAus-. tralian; copper sellers wilL look, after ths matter very satisfactorily.  ter for th© Navy) [10.36] - On the 14th November, the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) asked whether I would arrange that all officers and sailors of the Navy shall receive a Bpecial medal to show that they have been on active service, similar to the medal issued to the Australian Imperial Force. I am now able to inform the honourable member that arrangements are being made to issue such a badge to discharged members of the Royal Australian Navy.",77
407,Mr WATT,ELECTORAL SERVICES BY,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [10.37] - I do not, of course, in the badinage that I pass across the table at different times, accuse the honourable - member for Capricornia '(Mr Higgs) of being unduly importunate in regard to the copper situation. I know how pressing the matter is in many centres, and I am well aware that there is a big copper-producing industry in his electorate; and if he were not mindful of the interests of the men employed, and of the capital engaged in the industry, I quite acknowledge he would be unworthy of his position as a representative of the people. I ask him, however,- to accept my word that the Government have left no stone unturned to attend to this position. It is not by any means an easy position, and we are not masters of the situation. Our proportion of the world's copper production is relatively small. The American market dominates the situation largely, and in view of the metal situation generally, and the copper situation in particular, apart altogether from the termination of hostilities, I can assure the honourable gentleman that it is not easy for us, or for the British Government, to see a way out. I am - anxious not only to see that the temporary financial arrangements I have referred to on previous occasions are properly observed, in order to give the industry a chance of continuing into the new year, but to find - an open door, if not through Britain, by tvhich the interest of thoee concerned may be protected. I can assure my honourable friend that I am not unmindful at all of the gravity of the situation. We have, in addition, the tin situation, which has closed around us pretty quickly and seriously; and these two concatenated at the termination of the war. It means, of course, that we shall have to finance, or arrange to finance, for a portion of the time during which we shall conduct further negotiations. We hope to have more definite information in regard to both within a week. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.39 p.m.",78
