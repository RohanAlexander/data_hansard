2,Mr TIM FISCHER,BROADCAST OF PROCEEDINGS," Mr Speaker, could you clarify to the House the broadcast arrangements for today? As I understand it, there may be some special arrangement associated with the ABC and New South Wales. Have you been advised formally of any variation to the normal practice?",10
3,Mr SPEAKER,BROADCAST OF PROCEEDINGS,"I discussed this matter with your colleague the honourable member for Bass earlier today. I think events might have overtaken the ABC. Its necessity to televise the New South Wales Parliament might have disappeared a few minutes ago. But there will be a meeting of the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings later on this morning and it will make some decisions about that. NA BILL 1992 Second Reading Debate resumed from 4 June, on motion by Ms MCHugh: That the Bill be now read a second time.",10
4,Mr HULLS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"It gives me great pleasure to speak on the Trade Practices Amendment Bill today. Before I get to the Bill itself, I might say that I have read and re-read the speech gi ven by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) on this particular piece of legislation when we last sat on 4 June. I found what he had to say in relation to the Bill itself and in relation the comments made by the Minister for Consumer Affairs, the honourable member for Phillip (Ms MCHugh), to be quite extraordinary and in fact somewhat patronising. I will quote the comments of the honourable member for Higgins, the shadow Attorney General, to set the record straight: Shereferring to the Ministermay not have known what she was reading, but at least she read the right speech. She was a step ahead of Senator Tate who put in the wrong one. She is off to a good start. She does not need to know what she is reading, but I will give her a word of advice: when they come to you with a speech, you say to them, 'Is this the right one?'. That is what you have to say to them because they may in fact give you the wrong one and you would not know. . He went on and attempted to give the Minister some further advice. I find it very interesting that the shadow Attorney embarked upon giving the Minister advice, particularly when the shadow Attorney has been described by numerous People as perhaps the biggest underachiever in the Opposition. I also found his comments to be somewhat disturbing. I found them to be quite smarmy, self-righteous and, indeed, patronising. They were also incorrect and did not bear out the facts. A letter has been sent from the office of the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) to the shadow Attorney setting out the correct facts in relation to this particular matter. I believe it is incumbent upon me to set out for the House the facts, to put paid to the smarmy and patronising comments that were made on 4 June by the shadow Attorney. The facts are set out in this letter. I quote part of the letter to the honourable member for Higgins, the shadow Attorney, from the office of the Minister for Justice: · the type-written speech given to Senator Tate by Senate Table Office staff at the time of introduction of the Bill was the correct version of the speech (i.e. identical in all relevant respects to that delivered by the Minister for Consumer Affairs in the House last night). It was that speech which the Minister saw and which he requested be incor-. porated in Hansard. · that speech was then passed to Hansard staff to within the Senate Chamber for inclusion in the Hansard record in accordance with the directions of the Senate. · through inadvertence on the part of Hansard, a ""disc"" version of what was assumed to be the correct second reading speech was scanned by Hansard staff for inclusion in the record. In fact this was an earlier version of the speech which had been withdrawn by the Government some days previously. The letter goes on: ... despite this, the withdrawn version of the speech was wrongly identified by Hansard staff as being the correct version for inclusion in Hansard and it was so included. Finally, it states: ... the Secretary of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff has now accepted that there was an error in the transcription of the and has apologised to Senator Tate for his Department's mistake. I have little doubt that the shadow Attorney General will feel that it is incumbent upon him to apologise to the Minister in relation to the comments that she gave on 4 June and the comments that he made in relation to this matter on 4 June. I look forward to hearing from the Minister as to whether or not he has had the guts to apologise to her. Nonetheless, I note that Senator Bronwyn Bishop made a number of comments in the Senate on the shadow Attorney-General's contribution to the Bill. High praise from Senator Bishop is high praise indeed. I guess it is a bit like being a member of the National Party in Queensland-no-one really takes it very s e r i o u s l y . ' Consumers throughout my electorate of Kennedy and across Australia will certainly have much stronger and clearer rights against manufacturers of defective products as a result of this legislation. I think it is fair to say that this Bill will certainly advance the rights of those Australians who suffer bodily injury or some loss in relation to their property as a result of a product being put into the marketplace which does not meet the standard of safety a person is generally entitled to expect. If a manufacturer does not design the product correctly-that is, if he does not have adequate quality control prOCesses during the manufacturing stage and does not accompany the product with sufficient or adequate information and warnings as it goes go into the marketplace to be purchased-then, as a result of this Bill, manufacturers will have to bear the cost of such injury as is caused by the defective product. It is fair to say that this Bill is a radical improvement on the current mishmash of product liability law. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said over and 'over again, both in this House and outside the House, we are a government which actually does things, changes things. This legislation is a clear example of that. It is also fair to say that this legislation is further evidence of another clear distinction between the policies of this Government and speech those opposite. This Bill involved wide consultation between the Government, the manufacturing industry and consumer groups. I think it is fair to say that those opposite do not like consultation. Their industrial relations policies and their policies on zero tariffs at all costs make this brutally, clear. We only have to speak to the sugar growers, the dairy industry and others involved in rural indu-tries in this country to ascertain that that is the case. This Bill addresses a long standing problem in the law of product liability and inequity, which this Government decided to act upon and remedy. A substantial body of law already exists giving an array of legal rights to people injured by products. Aspects of contract law, the law of torts, the Trade Practices Act and its State equivalents are relevant to product liability. The determination of which of these areas of law apply depends on the relationship between the manufacturer and the injured party. I guess this is significant as it means different legal tests are applied, which can ultimately mean the difference between extensive damages or no damages at all. Many products are made for children, but they are bought and paid for by others, such as parents or grandparents. This effectively, I believe, makes most children and other people not in the habit of buying goods second-class citizens under the existing law. I am pleased to say that this Bill willchange that. In fact, this Bill will make it very clear that, if a manufacturer puts a defective product into the marketplace and that defective product causes an injury, the manufacturer will have to pay compensation to the person who has suffered bodily injury or some damage, and it will be irrelevant whether or not the injured party purchased the product. This Bill, I think, is very sensibly based on the 1985 European directive on product liability. As the Minister said on 4 June, central to the European model is its acceptance of the existence of a defect as a necessary precondition to recovery. One of the key features of this Bill as a result of its introducare tion into the House is that a manufacturer or importer of goods is to be held to be strictly liable for defects in those goods. Of course, goods are defective when they do not provide the degree of safety which a person is generally entitled to expect, taking into account all the circumstances, including the way the goods were marketed and labelled and the likely uses to which the goods will be put. Of course, this is an objective test. It is the objective knowledge and expectations of the community which determine whether a product is indeed defective, not the subjective knowledge and expectations of the injured party. Having mentioned the injured party, I think it should be said that the injured party will not have to prove negligence, which was in the past, as I said earlier, one of the factors identified in the existing law which could well lead to an injustice. Where a defect in a product results in someone being killed or injured, or where an individual's property is damaged as a result of a defect in goods, the manufacturer or importer is liable to pay compensation for that loss without the need for the person to prove that the manufacturer was negligent. Of course, the injured party will have to prove on the balance of probabilities that the product supplied by the manufacturer was defective and that that defect in the product was the cause of the injury or loss. Not only does this Bill amend a clear inequity, but it amends that inequity in a way that assists Australian manufacturers with their export initiatives. The 1985 European directive on product liability, .as I have previously mentioned, has rapidly established itself as the emerging international standard, and most significantly not only in Europe but also in our own region. As the Minister for Justice said in the Senate in his second reading speech, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea are all showing an interest in taking the European directive as a model for their laws relating to product liability. Of course, what this means is that Australian manufacturers can now be confident that, if their products are good enough for the home market, they also good enough for export. This is clearly in line with one of the main objectives of the Federal Government's industry and economic policies, which has been to promote an environment in which Australian manufacturers are encouraged to export their products. The passage of this Bill will encourage manufacturers to reassess their design processes, their quality control and, I believe, their entire operations. Manufacturers will, as Senator Tate has already said in the Senate, upgrade their operations in a way which will not only reduce their insurance premiums but also bring them into conformity with the expectations underlying the Parliament's passing of this Bill so that goods are not put into the marketplace which fall short of the standard of safety which the community generally is entitled to expect. The interests of the manufacturing industry have certainly been taken into account throughout the lengthy consultation processes that have preceded this Bill into the House. As I have said, that certainly is in stark contrast to the views of the Opposition in relation to the consultation process. I think it is fair to say that we have already seen an Australian Law Reform Commission report in relation to this piece of legislation; an Industries Assistance Commission, as it then was, economic impact study and, of course, various consumer group studies; as well as Australia-wide consultations undertaken personally by the Minister and his Department. That consultation process resulted in a number of changes to the Bill and the referral of three issues to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The Bill as it stands goes a long way towards addressing the inequities and injustices of the previous product liability regime. It makes the whole process of justice for an injured consumer far more understandable and achievable. It has to be said that, while this Government is acting to preserve and strengthen the rights of consumers by this Bill, the coalition, although I understand it is supporting the Bill, wants to decimate consumers, particularly those in rural and remote parts of Australia, by imposing this hideous 15 per cent consumption tax on the necessities of life. Rural Australia already pays over the odds for food, clothes and everyday purchases. The coalition wants to slug them and their kids with this quality of life destroyer, this 15 per cent tax. What of women in rural Australia? I know this will be of great interest to the shadow Minister, the honourable member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey). While the Government is putting through a Bill to protect women cOJisumers, the coalition intends pushing women back into the bad old days when they were third class citizens. A GST would tax women as they spend, and lower income earners and single mothers would be the hardest hit. The coalition's spending cuts would be disastrous for rural women. Childcare woutd become the domain of the wealthy. Most of the programs to assist rural women would be slashed, including women's health programs, affirmative action and funding for Aboriginal women. The coalition's industrial relations policy, as the shadow Minister well knows, basically would take women out of the work force or, alternatively, have them working in slave-like conditions. In New Zealand, women and young workers are suffering significant. pay cuts-up to 30 per cent under the crazy deregulated labour market scam. Women would not have unions or tribunals to protect them. This would be a horrendous situation. While we legislate to protect women as consumers-that is what this Bill is all about-the Opposition plans, firstly, to drive them out of the work force and, secondly, to scare the wits out of them in their homes by using such ridiculous and abominable scare tactics as the brochure that is circulating throughout this country. While we get on with the business of governing, I believe the coalition's GST is not much more than monkey business. I fully support this Bill before the House. I note that the coalition also supports it. However, some of the comments made by the that shadow Attorney-General ought be treated with the contempt they deserve.",10
5,Mrs BAILEY,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT," Mr Speaker, I was obviously under the misapprehension that we were debating the Trade Practices Amendment Bill 1992 this morning. Mr SPEAKER.:-..You were not under a misapprehension and we might debate the Trade Practices Bill.",13
6,Mrs BAILEY,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I certainly will be debating it but, as the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) leaves this chamber, I would like to clarify three points that he raised in his speech. Firstly, instead of taking cheap shots at the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), in relation to the formulation process for this piece of legislation, he should be thanking the honourable member for his vigilance in following through the development of this legislation. Secondly, as for attacking the coalition on its lack of consultation, it was only because of the vigilance of the honourable member for Higgins that we actually had a consultation process put in place with this Bill. Thirdly, by attacking the coalition's GST, which we know is the tool that is going to enable us to reform the system and to provide the protection for women in particular that the honourable member for Kennedy seemed so concerned about, it actually will protect and create jobs for women. In fact, it was the principal economic adviser to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who said that the compensation package provided under the Fightback plan was more than sufficient to compensate women and everyone else. I tum my attention to the debate that we are meant to be having this morning. I want to place on the formal record a tribute to the work done by th- shadow Attorney-General in getting thi- Bill into an acceptable form. It has taken over a year to convince the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) that the original legislation was totally unacceptable. The legislation which was put forward by the Minister last year was totally unacceptable to the Opposition and all reasonable and fair minded people. That legislation, through not setting a limit on manufacturers' liability and reversing the onus of proof from claimant to defendant, would have made Australia a risk zone for manufacturers, thus discouraging manufacturing in Australia. At the time the Minister put forward the legislation, the Business Council of Australia said: . . . this was a fundamental departure from a basic principle of law and will have serious consequences in tenns of increased litigation and escalating insurance premiums, higher research and development costs, an increase in prices of consumer and reduced competitiveness of Australian products on the international market. Added to these disadvantages, Australian manufacturers would have been vulnerable to litigation from overseas buyers. At long last, common sense and better policy have prevailed in this instance and the legislation that we have here today is, thanks to the work of the shadow Attorney-General, evidence of that. Since 1987 several national bodies have officially advocated a revision of product liability legislation in Australia. The National Consumer Affairs Advisory Council recommended changes and the Australian Law Refonn Commission subsequently proposed a new legal framework to resolve cases of product liability. It is, however, interesting to point out that neither the Law Refonn Com. mission nor the National Consumer Affairs Advisory Council was able to provide evidence of the extent to which current product liability law was inefficient or unfair. The Trade Practices Commission's 1987 survey of 8,600 consumers, which provided information on the number of people suffering product related injuries or illnesses, showed that the great majority of consumers, given the existing legislative framework, were able to resolve the majority of their problems. The system that the Australian Law Refonn Commission recommended in 1989 was a system of strict liability, subject to defences which would have dramatically shifted the allocation of loss to manufacturers. Its proposal would have had serious and adverse consequences, as the Industry CommissIon report, which was asked to examine the economic effect of its proposal, found. The Industry Commission's report, which was released in July 1990, stated that Australia's export competitiveness would be adversely affected by its proposals and that adopting its proposals would reduce product innovation and availability in Australia. The report found that the ALRC's proposals would lead to a rise in total product liability, insurance costs and producers' costs, and product prices would rise. The Insurance Council of Australia estimated that product goods liability claims would have increased from $213m to $724m if the ALRC's proposals were implemented. The report also found that most goods would incur small price increases, although the price of some hazardous goods could increase significantly. The report concluded: . . . given the longer term efficiency costs, the adjustment costs that a new legal regime would entail, and the evidence that the benefits would be small, the Commission judges that the ALRC's proposals would reduce economic efficiency. The Commission considers that the ALRC's proposals should not be implemented. Given the!!e findings, the coalition welcomed the Government's decision in March 1991 that it would not accept the ALRC's proposals. The coalition recognised that there was a need for a balance to be struck between the right of consumers to recover damages for injury suffered as a result of defective products and the need to ensure that any proposal adopted did not unnecessarily and adversely affect manufacturers and act as a disincentive to manufacturing investment. On 13 May 1991 the Government announced that it would amend the Trade Practices Act to introduce new laws concerning product liability-its so-called compromise position. Under that proposal, manufacturers would be liable for defects, but the onus of proof was· to be imposed on the manufacturer; that is, the onus of proof was to be reversed. In other words, products causing loss would be assumed defective unless proven otherwise. In this way, all manufacturers in court actions would have been assumed to have manufactured defective products unless they could have proved otherwise. This amendment was contrary to the common law which has required that 'he who asserts must prove'. The coalition finnly believes that the onus of proof should be left with the claimant. The Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs at the time, Senator Tate, on speaking about this proposal, claimed that the legislation was following the lead of the EC. However, on examination there were substantial differences. The EC directive of 25 July 1985 is an attempt to allocate loss arising in countries which are members of the European Community and was different from the one proposed by Senator Tate. Article 4 of the directive states: · .. the injured person shall be required t- pro-e the damage, the defect and the cause or relationship between defect and damage. That is, the onus of proving a product is defective under the directive is on the claimant. The Government's original decision to place the burden of proof onto the manufacturers to prove that the product was not defective created well-founded fears within the Australian business community that the reversal of the onus of proof, coupled with a liability standard based on safety which the community can reasonably expect, would expose local manufacturers and importers to the type and quantity of design claims litigated in the United States over the past several decades. For example, the Chief Executive of Health Casualty and General Pty Ltd, Mr Waites, said: · .. the question m-st be .ask- as t? w-y we should be introduc1Og legislation which 10 the opinion of the insurance industry will give rise and access to more claims generation and consequent increases in litigation with a natural progression escalating costs. Dr Ellen Beerworth, a lawyer from Malleson Stephen Jacques in Sydney, said: · .. the reversal is likely to affect the number of claims as well as the claims negotiation process, possibly leading to higher settlements. The Business Council of Australia strongly opposed the Government's proposal. It said: Australian business strongly agrees with the Industry Commission that in view ?f the problems likely to arise as a result of revers10g the onus of proof, the Government should adopt the European directive without modification. The coalition has always supported the approach of the EC directive and, at the same time, consistently expressed concern about proposals t- alter onus of proof. COJ:npa-ed with Austraha's current laws, the EC dtrectlve allows a claimant to establish relatively easily that a product that has caused loss is defective. This alone will improve access to a legal remedy for consumers of faulty products without imposing the onus of proof on manufacturers. In November 1991, Senator Tate announced that the Bill would be redrafted and that he would not pursue his proposal to reverse the burden of proof. He would, therefore, keep legislation consistent with common l-w by putting the onus of proof on the clalmant. However, a provision clause, 75AJ, was included in November 1991. This clause would have operated to discharge the claimant's burden of proving that the product was defective where the circumstances of an injury allowed a reasonable inference to be drawn that the defect existed. As Senator Tate said in commenting on the new Bill: ... where all the circumstances of an injury point to a defect in the product causing the damage, then that inference should be drawn. The Opposition was not satisfied with that proposal because it still imposed an unnecessary burden on manufacturers and because it was still not in line with the EC directive. On 27 April 1992, Senator Tate announced that he intended tabling in Federal Parliament that week a revised product liability Bill designed to ensure a fair go for both consumers and industry. He said he was confident that the of new legislation would strike a fair balance. He stated: . .. consumers will now have ready access to compensation when they are injured by a defective product. Mariufacturers, on the other hand, can, rest assured that they will only be liable when a prcX!uct they have supplied has been shown to be defective. He later announced that the controversial clause 75AJ would be replaced by a new clause 75AL. This new clause purported to restrict the drawing of inferences from evidence to those cases in which the defendant seeks to have an action stayed or dismissed. However, business groups, including the Business Council of Australia, the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Metal Trades Industry Association of Australia, viewed that clause as representing little if any improvement over its predecessor, clause 75AJ. They saw it as a second attempt by Senator Tate to include an inference provision in the reforms. The 75AL clause was unsatisfactory because it was uncertain and unclear in its application for both manufacturers and consumers; there was a major discrepancy between the likely application of the provision and the intention of the inference as stated the explanatory memorandum; there was confusion as to whether a court was being asked to draw inferences at the interlocutory stage, at the conclusion of the claimant's or at the time of final determination of the action; and it remained possible for inferences based other than on admissible evidence to form the basis of a successful claimant's case. As well, the revised Bill, which Senator Tate intended releasing at the end of the April 1992, contained no real concession to business interests in terms of defences or the statute of repose for personal injury. The Bill also proposed that the statute of repose be extended to 20 years after the date upon which the product was put on the market in respect of claims for personal injury. The extension of the statute of repose in personal injury claims would have impacted most upon the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, where the injuries which allegedly result from exposure or consumption may take a lengthy period in which to become manifest. The coalition could not support this proposal either, because we believe that if the law in Australia is to match that under the EC directive then the onus of proof-hould be on the claimant. The coalition concerns about this proposal were echoed by members of the Caucus legal and administrative affairs committee. They criticised the Minister because they believed that the product liability legisregime lation would make Australian industry uncompetitive internationally. As a result, on 6 1992 Labor Caucus forced the Government to remove the highly contentious clause 75AL. Caucus also rejected the extraterritorial provisions, the clause which would have let consumers from all over the world take action against an Australian manufacturer whose exported good may have caused injury or harm. These changes left the legislation substantially different from that which Senator Tate had originally proposed back in May 1991. The legislation is now in a form which is acceptable to the Opposition; but it is only in this form, contrary to what the honourable member for Kennedy said, because the shadow Attorney-General has been forcing the in Government at every stage. In fact, the three contentious areas of the legislation-those being onus of proof, statute of repose and extraterritorial arrangements-were all case resolved according to what we in the Opposition had been arguing for and, as I have said, the shadow Attorney-General in particular, since the inception of this legislation. With that result, the onus of proof is now on the claimant, in line with the EC directive; the statute of repose for death or injury is set at 10 years from the date of that death or injury; and the extraterritorial arrangements have been removed so that the legislation is limited to loss or damage suffered within Australia. I do not believe that an examination by a Senate committee of the three aspects that have been removed from the Bill as suggested by the Minister is warranted, particularly given that the Caucus has already expressed its view and it will not accept those provisions. This Bill amends the Trade Practices Act by introducing a new part VA to cover manufacturers' liability for defective products. Essentially, the Bill proposes to introduce product liability along the lines set out in the European Community Council directives of 25 July 1985. The provisions will be in addition to the existing statutory rights and common law. Basically, the Bill imposes a of strict liability. A person who is injured or dies or who suffers property May damage as a result of a defective product has a right to compensation against the manufacturer. The shadow Attorney-General has previously outlined the coalition's stance in relation to this piece of legislation. In conclusion, I point out that this lation does not rule other laws in this area void. Under section 75AR, the operation of other laws and remedies is preserved. will still have rights under existing contract, tort and statutory law. This means, of course, that manufacturers can be sued. under a been number of different laws-contract, breach contract, tort, negligence, and statutory law such as the Trade Practices Act and the Fair Trading Act. Throughout the entire period of discussion of the issue of product liability and the amendment to the Trade Practices Act, the Opposition has agreed with the Government's basic approach that Australian consumers are injured by defective goods should placed in a position which is no less advantageous than that enjoyed by their withdraw European counterparts in the same situation. In fact, the coalition believes there is good sense in harmonising product liability Australia with the EC directive which is to become, de facto, the international stanasserts dard. This legislation is now in a form which coalition accepts and, as such, we will not opposing the Bill. This Bill has only now achieved this form; it took a long time to bring the then Minister for Consumer Affairs to the discussion table and to see reason both the consumers' side and the manufacturers' side. It took the vigilant efforts Opposition-plus, I might add, his own Caucus committee.",13
7,Mr ROCHER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"The Trade Practices Amendment Bill is the culThus, mination of the Government's efforts .to with reform and change product liability law Australia. As my colleague the shadow Minister for consumer affairs, the honourable member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey), who has just spoken, said, it has had a long gestation debate. period. These efforts began in 1987, when the National Consumer Affairs Advisory Council second produced a report into consumer product safety which argued for the introduction new comprehensive product liability law that imposed strict liability on producers. The Government subsequently asked the Australian Law Reform Commission to legisinvestigate the adequacy of Australia's product liability laws, with the Commission eventually handing down its report in 1989. People The Australian Law Reform Commission report into product liability was the subject of much controversy, and the Government has trying to formulate and refine its product of liability proposals ever since. The Government's stated intentions in this matter have changed on numerous occasions at the behest of either the then Minister for Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, or the Labor Caucus legal and administrative affairs committee. The latter rolled the Minister with regard to product liability on at least one who occasion, as the honourable member for be MCEwen has already indicated. In particular, the Minister was forced to provisions that would have assigned to manufacturers the onus of proof in product liability cases, in a way that was totally in contrary to common law practice and prinlikely ciples. Common law requires that he who must prove, which means that the onus of proof in product liability cases should rest the squarely with the user of the goods conbe cerned. Apparently, the Minister was prepared to entertain all manner of contortions on the question of onus of proof in this legislation in a vain attempt to satisfy the self-appointed on consumer movement which has been the . principal impetus behind the introduction of of the product liability legislation. None of these contortions works because they all offend the profound common sense of the common law approach in these matters. we are largely back to where we started this legislation. We have spent five years in and untold expense in coming to the realisation that the existing. common law approach is the best, something that many people maintained from the outset of· the The legislation before us is actually a draft of legislation first introduced last year, known as the Trade Practices of a Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991, which languished in the Senate for most of 1991 until finally being discharged from the Senate Notice Paper only a few weeks ago to make way for this new Bill. It was cIaimedperhaps in hindsight-that the former Bill was a public exposure draft and it solicited much commentary from interested parties. However, as a result of the consultative process which was established, the Government's proposals have undergone several changes over recent months and weeks. Generally, they are to be welcomed. This has led to an entirely new Bill to take account of the Government's latest proposals which represent a significant departure from the Government's initial proposals on product liability law. The introduction of this new Bill, as I have said, is welcomed, given that much confusion-perhaps great confusion-could have resulted from an attempt to graft the new measures onto the old by way of government amendments. This new Bill should, thus, serve the Government's intentions much better than an amended version of the old Bill, especially since these intentions have now changed quite radically. The new Bill provides that a manufacturer or importer of goods is to be strictly liable defects in those goods. Goods are said to be defective when they do not provide the degree of safety that people are entitled to expect, taking into account all the relevant circumstances. Claimants will no longer need to prove negligence on the part of the manufacturer of goods in order to be able to claim compensation for loss caused by defects in those goods. The claimant need only prove that on the balance of probabilities the product was defective and that the defect in the product was the cause of the loss. The Bill also makes available a number of defences to manufacturers of goods in product liability cases. A state of the art defence will apply whereby manufacturers will not be held liable for defects, the existence of which was incapable of being ascertained by any means or where the defect came into existence after the product left the manufacturer's control. Manufacturers will also not be liable for losses if the product was defective because it was complying with a mandatory government standard. Where the standard is imposed by the Commonwealth Government, the Commonwealth will be liable to compensate the claimant for any loss. Furthermore, compensation can be reduced or disallowed to take into account any acts of the claimant that contributed to the loss, and that is as it should be. The Trade Practices Commission will be empowereP to take representative actions on behalf of consumers who have a product liability claim and who have given their prior written consent to the Commission. These proposals represent a major improvement on those advocated by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its 1989 report. The ALRC's proposals required that claimants need only to show that the loss resulted from 'the way the goods acted' in order to establish liability. If adopted there would have been no requirement to establish that the goods were defective or that the producer was negligent or had breached some statutory duty. As the Industry Commission noted in its examination of the ALRC's report, this version of product liability would effectively establish a presumption of producer liability. for The claimant would have needed to show only that the loss was suffered while using the product in order for the producer to be held liable-something that is not commonly in dispute. The onus would have been on the producer to prove an alternative cause of loss or to successfully invoke one of the available defences, or to show that the loss was the result of some unreasonable use of the good. The Industry Commission found against the ALRC's proposals, noting that while there were defects in the existing law the ALRC's proposals would reduce overall economic efficiency since they did not allocate liability in an optimal fashion and would impose major costs on the economy. At the same time, it has been recognised that the existing law dealing with product liability is deficient in a number of ways. There is a lack of single product liability law, with a number of overlapping laws making up the existing legal bases for product liability-a situation which is further complicated by differences in State and Commonwealth legislation. Manufacturers can already be sued under the laws of contract or of tort, ot under provision 2A of part V of the Trade Practices Act. Under current laws, consumers suffering product related loss are entitled to compensation if they can establish a breach of contract, a breach of duty of care, or a breach of statutory product standard. A number of deficiencies arise in this regard. First, not all losses caused by defective products are compensated under these existing laws. As a result, liabilities for some losses that should fall upon producers often fall upon consumers or bystanders, and this creates the wrong incentives for· producers to exercise appropriate care. On the other hand, actions for breach of contract in product liability cases fail to make provision for improper use of products by consumers which contributes to their subsequent loss, with subsequent liability falling inappropriately on producers. As the Industry Commission noted in its report, an efficient product liability regime would see producers generally liable for losses caused by their products, while consumers would be liable for losses caused by the misuse of products, including some circumstances where losses suffered are from risks associated with the characteristics of those products. While this is the ideal, it is not an ideal is easy to realise in law. There are numerous grey areas involved in establishing the cause of loss in any given case. In devising a product liability regime, it is necessary to make the greatest possible allowance for these grey areas to minimise any potential inequities that may emerge under that regime. The Industry Commission concluded that only a few relatively minor amendments were necessary to the current laws in order to establish a product liability regime that would be more efficient than both the current laws and the ALRC's proposals. This was also the conclusion of Professor Richard Epstein, from the University of Chicago, who addressed the then proposed product liability law changes during a visit to Australia a couple of years ago. Epstein, it should be noted, is an eminent scholar in the economic analysis of the law. He said: The best refonn that Australia and New Zealand could make in product liability law is to keep with the status quo: let there be liability for latent defects that cause hann in ordinary use, and leave 'the rest to the market. You can learn from the American experience only if you recognise the massive errors in judgement that have spurred on our judicial innovations of the last generation. Of course, he is talking about the American experience there. The American experience with product liability law has been disastrous-a fact that is widely recognised, with the possible exception of the members of the Australian Law Reform Commission. Peter Huber, in his book Liability: the Legal Revolution and its Consequences, had this to say about the impact of product liability laws in the United States: It is one of the most ubiquitous taxes we pay, now levied on virtually everything we buy, sell and use. The tax accounts for 30% of the price of a stepladder and over 95% of the price of childhood vaccines. It is responsible for one-quarter of the price of a ride on a Long Island tour bus and one-third of the price of a small airplane. It will soon cost large municipalities as much as they spend on fire and sanitation services. That is one appraisal of the effect of product liability laws as they have developed in the United States. United States product liability law has been a disaster because it treats consumers like idiots who are incapable of that seeking out and acting upon the information available on any given product and incapable of modifying their behaviour in the light of changing circumstances. As Professor Epstein said, describing the situation in the United States: No longer is it sufficient 'to provide a consumer with enough information about a product so that he could'make his decision on whether or how to use the product, or indeed to inquire further before making that decision. Instead of seeking to supply information, the law now seeks to govern production, but always after the fact and in a standardless way. In its former role, the law aided the operation of the market by helping market actors make informed decisions. In its modern incarnation the law has powerful anti-market origins and consequences. The rules are designed to override consumer preferences and to allow judges and juries to assume the role of design and warning experts ... The American economy now operates with a permanent limp because of the mistaken liability rules in the product area. That is the state of affairs the Australian Law Reform Commission and the likes of the selfappointed Australian Consumers Association would have foisted upon us if they had their way. Fortunately, we have in Australia bodies such as the Industry Commission and other authorities to expose such proposals to critical scrutiny and to reveal just how much they could cost the Australian economy were they to be implemented. The fact that this BiIl now contains little way of the Australian Law Reform Commission's original proposals is partly due to the work of the Industry Commission, which only highlights the importance of that body retaining its pr-ent role and not being nobbled by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), as will happen with his proposed changes to that body. The Trade Practices Amendment Bill as it now stands is relatively harmless. Indeed, the Australian Consumers Association has attacked the legislation as being as weak as water, which is perhaps the best possible endorsement this legislation could have been given. The Bill is additional to, and does not compromise, existing common law rights and relevant statute law. The Bill seeks to imitate the Eur<fpean Community's product liability directive of 1985, which has now become the internationally recognised standard for product liability law. This it now does, following the Government's back-down on the various questions of onus of proof. It is also desirable that Australian laws on product liability be in harmony with those of our trading partners, which this Bill will now largely achieve. The Bill now has the support of the Australian business community, which is in sharp contrast to the vehement opposition the Government's initial proposals encountered from that quarter. The challenge now will be to keep the Government's product liability laws limited to the provisions contained in this Bill. The former Minister for Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, has warned that this is not the last word from the Government on the subject. The Government will certainly be under pressure from the Australian Consumers Association to introduce new product liability laws-in return, I suppose, for the aid al)d comfort that that body invariably provides for Labor governments. These provisions could include so-called 'Aussie battler' provisions designed to guarantee consumers their day in court and provisions to make Australian manufacturers responsible to overseas consumers for defective products. The coalition will continue to be alert to developments in this area to ensure that the ALRC's proposals, by or similar propositions, do not raise their ugly heads in Australia once again.",17
8,Mr SINCLAIR,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I will add a few brief words to this debate on the Trade Practices Amendment Bill. The legislation, as my colleagues have said, is generally welcomed by the Opposition. Within it there is the standardisation of product liability with the regime based on the 1985 European Community product liability directive and, as such, it provides an advantage in the parallel application of product liability to the requirements within the European Community. I think that is to be commended. The key concept is that a person who is injured or whose property is damaged by a defective product will have a right to compensation against the manufacturer of the product. The amount of compensation is subject to a number of defences. I will not repeat the words of my colleagues who have gone through the detail of the Bill, but I do have a few worries with the legislation which I will identify. Firstly, whilst I understand the process by which it has been developed and the reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I am disappointed in a couple of aspects of the legislation. I am worried about the extent to which 'Commonwealth mandatory standard' is defined as a mandatory standard imposed by Commonwealth law. As the explanatory memorandum notes, a standard developed by a Commonwealth authority but imposed under State or Territory laws is not a Commonwealth mandatory standard. One of my real worries is that there should be in product liability the same application of responsibility to imported products as there is to domestic products. Under the terms of the legislation, that will be so because an unidentified manufacturer, under the new section 75AJ(l), includes a person who is a supplier of the actioned goods who is known to the person. That means that if the manufacturer of the goods cannot be identified-that is, a person having been requested to identify the manufacturer and the manufacturer being outside jurisdiction-then the supplier who is the importer can be made liable. Imported foodstuffs, however, because the standards are imposed through a Commonwealth authority and not under State and Territory laws, apparently will be exempt. I think that is regrettable. One of the real problems we have at this time in the rural sector is the range of imported products, particularly processed products, which are not produced to the same standard as those produced domestically. For instance, I am told that at the moment the Government is considering a proposal to allow imports of broiler chickens from Thailand. While, for health reasons, I find that almost unbelievable, what worries me is that the broiler industry in Australia has developed a series of practices designed to ensure not only the quality of the product but that the quality of the product meets the customers' requirement. As I understand section 9 from the notes on clauses in the explanatory memorandum, those broilers, if they are permitted to be imported from Thailand, will not be subject to this sort of a trade practice amendment liability. I think that is regrettable because, from my perspective, packaging and labelling of foodstuffs are matters which have long needed, if not regimentation, at least identification on a common basis, whether they are produced or manufactured in Australia or whether. they are imported. To the degree to which in the definition, as I read it, there is to be a differentiation between those standards that are imposed by a Commonwealth authority and those that are imposed by a Commonwealth law, I think it is regrettable that this legislation does not go further than it does. While I note that the Australian Consumers Association, for example, wants the legislation to go much further, I do not go along with its concerns. I think that what has been produced is going to impose a significant discipline on manufacturers and importers in other fields. Therefore, I accept that not only is this a worthwhile amendment to the Trade Practices Bill but also its extension is going to ensure that there is a reasonable duty of care. It has moved a long way from the old legal maxim of caveat emptor. But my first area of concern is that there is a problem with imported foodstuffs, and I am disappointed that they apparently are excluded from this legislation. My second area of concern is with respect to the defences. I have read the proposed section 75AK, which sets down the defences. It states: (a) the defect in the action goods that is alleged to have caused the loss did not exist at the supply time; or (b) they had that defect only because there was compliance with a mandatory standard for them; or (c) the state of scientific or technical knowledge at the time when they were supplied by their actual manufacturer was not such as to enable that defect to be discovered; or (d) if they were comprised in other goods (,finished goods')-that defect is attributable only to: (i) t-e design of the finished goods; or (ii) the markings on or accompanying the finished goods; or (iii) the instructions or warnings given by the manufacturer of the finished goods. One of the problems that I have is that,at this time, most manufacturers, if they identify a defect, are able to recall the product by advertising. It may well be that under the principal Act advertising of a defect is going to continue as being a reasonable defence. But there has to be a capacity for a manufacturer or an importer, having identified the defect, to say, 'Look, there is a\ failure in this particular component'. If the defect is in a motor vehicle-for example, in the engine, brakes, exhaust manifold or whatever it happens to be-the manufacturers should be reasonably able, by significant advertisement of the defect, a product recall, and perhaps even writing to each of those whose addresses and identities are available to the retailers, to try to get back those articles that have been distributed. We have had any number of instances where, for one reason or another, there has been a defect and, the defect having been identified, the manufacturers seek to recall the product. I suggest that there is a problem because this amendment does not identify such action as a specific defence. I believe that it should be a defence, and I think that it would not be unreasonable for it to be in that instance. The third area of concern is the time for commencing· actions. Proposed section 75AO(I) states: ... at any time within three years after the time the person became aware, or ought.reasonably to have become aware, of the alleged loss, the defect and the identity of the person who manufactured the action goods. Proposed section 75AO(2) states that action must be commenced within 10 years of the supply. I am interested in those years. I think that it would be better if the statutory seven years were preserved. The trouble is that we have so many different years applying to different products that it becomes a bit confusing as to just what time applies to what and where. While I understand that that is undoubtedly a product of the derivation of this legislation from the European Community product liability directive, I think it is unfortunate that we have different standards at different times, which makes it difficult for people to identify and recall just what applies in a particular instance. I say that because inevitably, even though this legislation is now going through-and presumably there will be some attempt to advertise its provisions-I do not doubt that people will forget the particular provisions of time within this legislation. I prefer that we standardise on the statute of limitations; that we make a common time. Seven years has been the period in the legislation. Seven years is common in other fields of the law and, as far as I am concerned, it would be better for seven years to be in this field of the law. I know it varies in other jurisdictions-in the tax Act, for example. But if we are going to have variations all we have to do is to try to identify how long and where. I think it is unfortunate when we have a variance to that degree. I also note that there is a class of goods which can be conveniently referred to-and I refer to paragraph 22 of the explanatory memorandum-as 'inherently dangerous products'. Inevitably, as the explanatory memorandum notes, there is a degree of risk in the use of those products. I think that there has to be a responsibility of care by the user. I notice that there is reference to the fact that if people have, by their own malfeasance or their own use of the product, contributed to the damage suffered then that either mitigates the liability or absolves the manufacturer or importer of that liability. That is essential because it seems to me that that is one of the difficulties in determining the nature and quality of goods-to identify those goods which require a greater standard of care than others. The other concern that I have is that our industrial laws at the moment do not really allow a common standard of product excellence. Australians have an enormous technical and physical capability, as they have a technological capacity, to design and produce to the standards set anywhere in the world. Our difficulty is-and it has long been said-that, if we buy a car assembled on a Monday or Friday, we are likely to find that the quality of that product is not of the same degree as those assembled on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. I do not suggest that within the trade practices legislation there should be a right of action against individuals. But out of this legislation I trust that standards of care and of excellence within manufacturing plants can be set up to ensure that we avoid that unfortunate contrast between the so-called lower standard of Australian products and the standard of those imported. Ultimately, it is in everybody's interest that the quality of our goods should be of the highest possible standard. In shipbuilding, for example, I am quite conscious that it is often said that our ships are overdesigned and too well built. There is a major problem if we do not ensure that the quality of workmanship for every product delivered from whatever factory or outlet is of a uniformly high standard. Whether or not that can be achieved by legislative writ is another question. But, for my money, that is one of the principal areas of concern in Australia's competitiveness. It is induced by industrial relations policy and by work practices that have grown.in many fields of endeavour in this country. But it is a field which needs to be considered very carefully, for the repercussions of that variation in product quality is something that certainly prejudices the reputation of many Australian products. That having been said, perhaps this legislation will be a step towards improving that excellence and, as a result, it may contribute to making our goods more competitive. In all, I welcome this legislation, but I the attention of the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) to the particular concerns that I have raised. Firstly, the problem with foodstuffs and, significantly, the fact that we are eating many imported processed foods at the moment that do not meet the labelling standards required. Because the standards are set by a Commonwealth authority, they are apparently going to be outside this legislation. I think that is unfortunate. Secondly, and in particular, I drew attention to the defences-the fact that there needs to be a capacity for a person who has advertised the defect and sought· product withdrawal to have that as mitigating damages. I suggest that there should be reference in the legislation to that so that it is a permissible defence. Thirdly, I regret that we are setting two new periods within the legislation which differ from those that have existed in other fields. I think that just adds to confusion. As we seek product liability through this legislation, it seems to me that is one field where the product liability of what we are producing, which is an Act of the Parliament,should try to meet those same standards: a uniform time, an understandable time, and one that people in the community can be reasonably expected to both remember and comprehend and ultimately, of course, with which they should comply.",20
9,Ms MCHUGH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"in reply-I thank all honourable members for participating in the debate on what is unquestionably landmark legislation. Honourable members will be aware that the principal carriage of this matter over the last two years has been with Senator Tate in his former capacity as Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs. I do not intend to detain the passage of the Trade Practices Amendment Bill any further by engaging in a prolonged discussion of the very many matters of detail involved in the subject of product liability reform. But there are quite a few things I do want to mention. Most of the matters of detail, including many of the issues raised by the Opposition spokesperson, the shadow Minister draw for consumer affairs, the honourable member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey), have been dealt with in a very comprehensive way by Senator Tate in the course of his very extensive consultations about this legislation and in his remarks made in the other place when that chamber considered the Bill on 3 June. I mention to the right honourable member for New Englimd (Mr Sinclair) that, after having had a good look at what he has said in his speech, I would like to reply personally to some of the matters he has raised. For my own part, as the new Minister for Consumer Affairs I take this opportunity to express my personal pleasure in being the Minister at the despatch box when this long awaited reform is going tq be put into law at last. Make no mistake, this is an important reform which will very considerably advance the rights of those Australians who suffer bodily injury or some loss in relation to their property occasioned by a product. being put into the community which does not meet the standard of safety which persons generally are· entitled to expect. If a manufacturer does not design the product correctly, does not have adequate quality control processes during the manufacturing stage, qr does not provide adequate information or warnings as it goes into the marketplace, then it is right and proper that that manufacturer should bear the financial consequences if it causes injury or damage. This Bill ensures that that eminently reasonable and fair approach to manufacturers' liabilities should become the law in this country. In so doing, this Parliament will also ensure that Australian manufacturing practices are brought right up to the prevailing international standard. Whether exporting their products to the many countries with a similar legal standard:-and that is a group which is likely soon to include many of our major regional trading partners, such as Japan and South Korea-or producing solely for the domestic market, the fact is that producers will all benefit from the consistency of manufacturing standards which this law will bring. Of course, I also understand the concern of some that certain matters originally proposed by Senator Tate have been deleted from the Bill as it presently stands. As I indicated in my second reading speech, those matters, which I regard as of considerable importance, are to be considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I think they are important questions which need to be ventilated fully in the public arena. A committee inquiry, which has been proposed, will provide the opportunity for manufacturer and consumer lobby groups to put forward their views in a way which is not hidden, not by way of the sort of lobbying and whisper campaigns that we see around the corridors on this sort of thing, but open and on the Hansard record so that these matters can be properly assessed by the senators on that committee. I am sure they will come forward with some very constructive suggestions about these important questions. For my own part, I look forward to receiving that report and taking up the challenge this impor- tabled. tant reform process presents to us all. There are some other matters which I want to refer to. First of all, honourable members may be aware that, when this Bill was before the otlIer place on 3 June, the Opposition made the claim that, despite undertakings by this Government that the provision which was to have allowed overseas consumers to take action under this regime had been removed from the Bill, the proposed amendment to section 6 of the Trade Practices Act included in the Bill would have that effect. That claim was based on a letter from the law firm Clayton Utz which apparently received confirmation of this opinion by Mr R. J. Ellicott, QC. On the basis of this opinion, the Opposition sought to have the proposed amendment to section 6 of the Trade Practices Act removed from the Bill. At that time, Senator Tate told the Senate that his advice was that the conclusion by Clayton Utz and Mr Ellicott, QC, was incorrect. He also undertook to seek definitive legal advice from the Chief General Counsel of the Commonwealth, Mr Dennis Rose, QC, as a matter of urgency and to amend the Bill should Mr Rose agree with Mr Ellicott's conclusion. I have now received the advice from Mr Rose, who, I should mention, has an enviable reputation as an eminent constitutional lawyer. He has concluded that the proposed amendment to section 6 will not have the extraterritorial effect claimed by the Opposition. This advice confirms that the BilI,as it is now before the House, does reflect the Government's intention, as stated in Senator Tate's second reading speech in the Senate, and will not have the effect of allowing consumers in overseas countries who purchase Australian made goods to take action against Australian manufacturers in Australian courts. I seek leave to have that advice incorporated in Hansard. Mr Ruddock---':Doesn't it depend on whether it is in an appropriate form?",23
10,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I have just had advice from the Clerk. If it can be spoken it should be spoken, otherwise it cannot be incorporated. It can be",24
11,Ms MCHUGH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"In that case, I will read the advice.",24
12,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,That is the 'best course to take.,24
13,Ms MCHUGH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I just wondered whether I should proceed in asking for it to be incorporated, but the honourable member for Dundas (Me Ruddock) does not want that, so I would love to read it. The letter is from the Chief General Counsel in Canberra and is to the Attorney-General's Department. It reads: I refer to your request for urgent advice on the question whether the provisions proposed to be inserted in the Trade Practices Act 1974 ('the Act') by the Trade Practices Amendment Bill 1992 ('the Bill') would have extra-territorial operation in the sense of conferring on persons outside Australia a right to sue in Australian courts for injuries or losses suffered by reason of defects in goods manufactured in Australia. 2. I have been provided with a copy of an Opinion ,by Mr R.I. Ellicott QC in which he concludes that there is a 'strong argument' for the view that the Bill in its present form would give the proposed Part VA an extra-territorial effect of that kind 'in relation to contracts made or the supply of goods in the course of overseas trade and commerce'. 3. I respectfully disagree with that conclusion. 4. Mr Ellicott argues that, but for section S, the provisions of the Act that 'on their face apply to the conduct of corporations and persons anywhere in the world would probably have been read down to relate to conduct within Australia'. On the other hand, he argues, the provisions relating to trade commerce with other countries (including s.6(2), which gives various provisions an operation to trade and commerce with places outside Australia) 'need no reading down'. It appears that his reason for drawing this distinction is that a provision relating to overseas trade or commerce is a provision that 'relates to a clear subject of legislative power', thus implying that provisions dealing with extra-territorial conduct without limitation exceed the Commonwealth's legislative powers and therefore need to be read down. S. My first difficulty with that argument is that it seems clearly inconsistent with the decision of the High Court in Polyukhovich v. The Commonwealth (1991) 172 CLR SOl, which establishes that (subject to constitutional limitations not relevant here) the Commonwealth's external affairs power under section SI(xxix) of the Constitution extends to laws dealing with conduct of any kind outside Australia (whether or not it is related to overseas trade or other subjects of Commonwealth legislative powers such as defence). Secondly, I see no reason in principle why a provision relating to overseas trade should be regarded as exempt from the general presumption that legislation is limited to conduct and things within the enacting jurisdiction (see also the statutory version of this presumption in section 21 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901; also, on a related presumption, I note Meyer Heine Pty Ltd v. The China Navigation Co Ltd (1966) l1S CLR 10). 6. There are, however, other arguments for the view that Part VA would have some extra-territorial effects in the sense relevant here. 7. For instance, first take the proposed section 7SAD read without the alternative effects given by section 6(2). It should, in my opinion, be construed in accordance with the generai presumption mentioned above and with the natural inference that can be drawn from the fact that section S contains no reference to part VA. On that basis I think that paragraph (a) of section 7SAD would probably be limited to the 'supply' of goods by a corporation in Australia, including 'supply' here by way of export. As read in accordance with section 6(2)(c), I think that section 7SAD would similarly be construed as limited to 'supply' within Australia. 8. However, it is by no means entirely clear that section 7SAD(c) would be limited to cases where the relevant injury was suffered in Australia. (In relation to the interpretative presumption referred to above, it has been said judicially that 'not every aspect of every sentence or clause of legislation ... must be given the local connotation': References follow. The advice continues: 9. In resolving these questions, I think that section 7SAI is important. That provision would and prevent double recovery where, for instance, an amount had been recovered under a Commonwealth, State or Territory workers' compensation law. If, for example, section 7SAD had been intended to apply where the relevant injury had been suffered outside Australia, I think that double recovery under a foreign workers' compensation law would also have been precluded. It is true that such double recovery is not precluded in the case of a foreign worker in Australia who suffers injury in circumstances occurring wholly within Australia. However, I do not think that this limited anomaly is sufficient to preclude an inference from section 7SAI that the main provisions (sections 7SAD to 7SAG inclusive) were intended to apply only to injury, loss, destruction or damage occurring in Australia. In my opinion, those provisions would be construed by the courts as limited in that way. Parliamentary references to 'Australian consumers' (Senate Hansard, 3 June 1992) support this conclusion. (Dennis Rose QC) Chief General Counsel I wish to refer to two other matters. First, as currently proposed, the new product liability regime will come into operation when this Act receives royal assent. This is likely to occur early in July. This means that consumers will have rights under the regime against the manufacture of any defective goods which are supplied by the manufacturer after that date. I have been approached by the Opposition spokesperson on consumer affairs who has asked that a longer period be allowed before manufacturers become subject to that regime. The Government simply cannot agree to this request. The Bill to implement this proposal that we are dealing with today was first introduced by the Government in the Senate in December last year. At that. time Senator Tate encouraged all interested parties to comment on any matter in the Bill which was of particular concern to them. I am informed by Senator Tate that he is not aware of any submission about that Bill making any comment on the proposal that the legislation come into force on royal assent. Indeed, the Government first announced its intention to introduce a strict product liability regime based on the EC directive over 12 months ago. Manufacturers have long been aware that this Government intended to act to ensure that consumers are justly treated by the legal system. It would be an abrogation of the Government's responsibility to injured consumers to sanction any further delay in the introduction of this regime. Manufacturers who supply defective goods to Australian consumers must be required by the Parliament properly to assume responsibility for their actions. The last matter is the following: when this Bill was considered by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, that Committee raised a question about the effect of a particular provision of the Bill on the operation of the rest of the Trade Practices Act. If passed by the Parliament, the provision would have the effect of providing that State and Territory laws about the survival of the right to take legal action after the actual claimant has died will apply to actions taken under the new regime. These laws provide that certain rights of action can be taken up by the estate of a deceased claimant. This is an important aspect of the proposed liability regime. The Senate Committee has asked whether, because the Bill expressly includes this right of action, it negates, by implication, this in relation to the rest of the Trade Practices Act. This matter is under consideration by the Government at the present time. As Senator Tate has already stated, it is certainly not the Government's intention to disturb any existing provision or rule of interpretation which would allow these State and Territory laws to apply to this or any other part of the Trade Practices Act aside from the insertion of this particular provision. I note the comment of the honourable senators, conscious of the fact that the views I express on behalf of the Government can be taken into account by the courts when interpreting this legislation. In the event that the Government agrees with the views raised by the Committee, I am happy to confirm that appropriate remedial action will be taken in the near future. I conclude by saying that, despite all the other matters I have just raised, we should not lose sight of the significance of this moment and this legislation. A very substantial reform is going to take place here and now, one which all consumers should feel justly pleased is going through the Parliament. Our law is about to take a giant step forward. I commend the Bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee The Bill.",24
14,Mr COSTELLO,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I just want to take up two issues. The first concerns section 75AD, as proposed in the Trade Practices Amendment Bill, and the opinion given by Dennis Rose, the Chief General Counsel, that the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) has read out. There has been an argument as to the extent to which this Bill introduces extraterritoriality; that is, the extent to which people who are injured outside the Australian jurisdiction could take advantage of this Bill to bring their suits inside the Australian jurisdiction. The matter was raised in the Senate by the Opposition on the basis of an opinion from Mr Ellicott and this opinion was obtained in response. It has been very useful to get both opinions. right The Minister has relied upon the opinion of Dennis Rose to say, effectively, that the Bill ought not be given extraterritorial effect. The first point is that it would be of some assistance if the Government would make it absolutely clear that it does not intend the Bill to have that effect. That would be of great assistance. We would prefer, of course, if it were clear in the legislative tenns but, for the sake of the record, it might be of assistance if that were the case. Mr Ruddock-There must be some significance in the fact that they haven't.",26
15,Mr COSTELLO,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"The learned shadow Minister for immigration, the honourable member for Dundas, who understands finer points like this, in fact, raises it with me. I do want to emphasise one point: the opinion of Dennis Rose is not at all unequivocal. Paragraph 8 reads: . . . it is by no means entirely clear that section 75AD(c) would be limited to cases where the relevant injury was suffered in Australia. That is the opinion that the Government relies upon and it says, 'it is by no means entirely clear'. Then Dennis Rose goes on to say that it would not have that effect because another section, section 75AI, which refers to workers compensation, refers only to workers compensation schemes in Australia and that, working back from that, there must be an intention to limit it. It is going a long way around this by saying that the legislation is not to have extraterritorial effect. I for one would be very surprised if we ever saw a Bill in this place that said there could be np double claiming and that, for the purposes of Australian law, workers compensation under the statutes of Thailand, Taiwan or wherever had to be excluded. I think it is just as likely that nobody ever bothered to go into the complications and draw up the legislation that way. To work backwards and use that as a conclusion for saying that there is no extraterritorial effect is a long shot. Even after working backwards in that way, the Chief General Counsel reached the conclusion that the section was by no means entirely clear. The point we have made on this is that it ought to be clear. There is a public interest in making statutes as clear as possible. For the Government to come in here and say, 'The point you raised is wrong because our opinion says it is by no means entirely clear' is hardly a defence. It is as much a damning of the legislation, admittedly in polite terms. It is a funny defence to say, 'The provision does not have the effect you were concerned about because our opinion says that it is by no means entirely clear'. It seems that the Government has set its sights on pushing the legislation through as quickly as possible. As I said earlier, and as the current shadow Minister for consumer affairs, the honourable member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey), has indicated, the Opposition will not oppose it. However, if we are to go to a Senate committee-I have argued against a Senate committee all along because this matter has been gone through very carefullyand if it is the Government's intention that the legislation will not have any extraterritorial effect, the Government ought to move an amendment to that effect and make it clear in the legislation. The other matter I wish to reply to is the pathetic display that was put on by the honourable member fot Kennedy (Mr Hulls) in this debate. I am glad that the Minister stayed away from that. It has taken the honourable member since 4 June to work up his insults. When he did so they were pathetic. For a practically non-existent member of this House to stand up and throw around insults in that halting, hesitating, unintelligible, unintelligent and ignorant way was rather surprising. What he took great offence to-he did not really take offence; he was put up to saying so-was the point I made when the matter was before the House on 4 June 1992. I must have been the only person in Australia who read the Hansard and saw that what the Minister had said in the Senate was not the right speech. If I had not raised the matter I do not think it would ever have been corrected. I accept that Hansard has now issued a weekly edition which contains a different speech from that which appeared in the daily edition of 26 May. The weekly edition bears the right speech; the daily edition bore the wrong speech. I raised the matter in this place on 4 June 1992, which was 10 days after the second reading speech was delivered. In those 10 days there had been no effort to correct the error, to explain it to us, and to apologise to us for allowing the wrong speech to be printed in the daily Hansard. Presumably the Minister's staff read what the Minister has to say. Where were they? Even the new Minister did not pick it up. I must be the only person in Australia who spends time reading Ministers' second reading speeches. Nobody else seems to be at all interested. On this occasion it was worth reading it not for what it said but for what it did not say, because when I read it it did not amplify the meaning of the Bill at all; it related to another Bill. I am glad that this been picked up. The Minister says that it is all the fault of Hansard: he gave Hansard one speech, which was withdrawn; he gave Hansardanother speech and Hansard printed the first speech and not the second speech. I illustrate this to show that there was confusion and speeches were going in and out of Hansard like a rabbit goes in and out of a burrow. The interesting point is that the speech was printed related to a Bill that was never even introduced into the Parliament. The Government acted as if this were a clean Bill, that it had never had any life before it appeared in this place on 4 June 1992. However, the wrong speech, which was put into the Daily Hansard, related to a Bill that was never introduced. It was the third version that got killed even before it got into a House of this Parliament. That indicated the type of confusion that was going on. I am glad this has been corrected because, as I said before, it was going to be of no assistance to anyone to have the wrong speech in Hansard. However, I should not have had to do it. For the Government to stand on its digs now and say that because Costello found it out that is somehow terrible-and to do so through some nobody from the north of Queensland saying that. in the most pejorative and ignorant terms-is disgraceful. The honourable member should have been above it. This illustrates the low level to which he is prepared to slide in his ignorance and total lackey-like attitude. Mr Jull-He would have been put up to it.",27
16,Mr COSTELW,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Of course he was put up to it. One thing I will say about the Minister-and I respect her for this-is that she has kept away from that. She was not going to be given that role in this debate and she has nothing to be ashamed of. However, the honourable member does. It was a poor, pathetic performance and he ought to stand condemned for it. (TIme expired)",28
17,Mrs BAILEY,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I want to spend a couple of minutes placing on record my disappointment that the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh), on behalf of the Government, has decided not to grant that extension of six months that I wrote has to her about on behalf of those manufacturers who had contacted me. For the Minister to say today that the industry has had a long period in which to become aware of what was to be contained in this legislation is not fair comment. The Minister would know as well as everyone else that over the past 12 months this legislation has seesawed backwards and forwards. As I said in the chamber earlier this that morning, it has only been because of the vigilance of the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), that we have actually got this legislation in an acceptable form before us today. I question the Minister when, on the one hand, her Government will make a decision to give the music industry a period of six months so that it will have sufficient time to adapt to changes under proposed legislation and, on the other, similar standards are not applied to the legislation before us. What is wrong with granting .an extension of time to manufacturers who are going to need the extra time to adapt to the changes that will be brought about by this legislation? I urge the Minister to reconsider before the Bill reaches its final stages and to show the same degree of care and concern for this piece of legislation that was shown to a previous piece of legislation concerning the music industry. I say in conclusion that I believe it is unfair for the Minister to say that the industry has had ample time to know what is contained in the legislation. It simply has not, because there have been so many changes.",28
18,Ms MCHUGH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I will respond to three matters. First, I repeat that the advice received from th- Chief General Counsel confirms that the Bill as it is now before the House does reflect the Government's intention, as stated in Senator Tate's second reading speech in the Senate, and will not have the effect of allowing consumers in overseas countries who purchase Australian made goods to take action against Australian manufacturers in Australian courts. Secondly, I refer to the unbelievable comments of the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), about the speech made by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls). The honourable member for Kennedy spent two minutes clarifying a technical difficulty which had occurred and the shadow Attorney General spent 20 minutes when this Bill was introduced and about 10 minutes today on that matter, when extremely important legislation on behalf of Australian consumers is going through the Parliament. Thirdly, the shadow Minister for consumer affairs, the honourable member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey), commented on the request for a further delay being declined. I say to the Parliament and to the consumers of Australia that in our view it is not fair to delay any longer legislation that has been long awaited. Our responsibility is to the consumers of Australia. Bill agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Ms MCHugh)-by leave-read a third time. NA AGENCY AMENDMENT BILL 1992 Second Reading Debate resumed from 4 June, on motion by Ms MCHugh: That the Bill be now read a second time.",28
19,Mr JULL,AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG,"This is the third occasion on which an Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill has come back to the House of Representatives in the last 15 months. One would hope that this will be the last occasion on which the Bitlis presented, although with what is happening in the world of drugs in sport at the moment I am afraid that that may not necessarily be so. The Bill has been reintroduced with what has been termed the Vinnicombe amendment following the difficulties that were experienced with Australian cyclist Martin Vinnicombe, who tested positive for anabolic steroids in the United States through tests carried out by Canadian authorities' at the request of the Australian Sports Drug Agency. Mr Vinnicombe subsequently avoided sanctions on a legal technicality, despite admitting to using the drugs. I congratulate the Government for moving so quickly to bring in those amendments and pay tribute to my colleague in the other place, Senator Michael Baume, who announced on 27 April this year that if the Government did not bring in these amendments the Opposition would. The Bill contains a large number of amendments to make provision for a coordinated national approach through the States and Territories to eliminate drugs in sport following an agreement reached last year between the State and Territory sports Ministers and the Commonwealth. The Bill will also enable the agency to test a wider range of athletes, both in Australia and overseas, for the presence of prohibited drugs. The agency will be allowed to enter into contractual arrangements with overseas governments and other anti-doping authorities to arrange for the collection and testing of samples. The thrust of the Bill will also enable it to recognise procedures adopted by foreign antidoping authorities which conduct tests on its behalf, even if those procedures do not precisely mirror those set out in the Australian Sports Drug Agency regulations. The minimum standard will be that provided for in the international Olympic charter against doping in sport. The agency will now be able to act on those results. Australian standards are currently stricter than those in the Olympic charter. In this respect, I think the Government and the Opposition are at one inasmuch as we are both dedicated to eradicating the scourge of 'drugs as best we can from the world of sport. The Bill does have some protection for athletes who may be involved in such actions. It gives athletes the opportunity to make a challenge to the validity of a positive test result if procedures relating to the sealing of the container holding the sample or the testing of the sample by an accredited laboratory are not complied with or if there is evidence of tampering with the sample. Should the agency decide that the test is valid, the competitor will now be entitled to apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to have the decision reviewed. The agency must verify that all three above procedures were followed before validating a positive test result, even if there is no appeal by a competitor. Written notification to approved sporting and antidoping organisations of a positive test result or of a refusal to provide the sample will now be required. The name of the register will be altered to the Register of Notifiable Events to remove any implication that the entry of a person's name on a register implies guilt. The question of guilt and application of sanctions will be the responsibility of the sporting organisations themselves. Some concern has been raised about the situation regarding minors-sports men and women under the age of 18-who may be caught up in the net. The Bill protects minors and makes allowance for the removal of a minor's name from the register once the period of any sanction imposed by a sporting organisation has elapsed, provided that at the time of the request to provide a sample the person was under the age of 18. The agency will now have the power to approve foreign anti-doping bodies which adopt at least standards provided for in the Olympic charter and to request such bodies to take a sample from a competitor who is an Australian citizen or permanent resident when the competitor is overseas. The agency will also be required to keep a list of such bodies. The Opposition will not oppose the Bill and, as I said a moment ago, obviously we are at one in trying to eliminate drugs from . the sporting organisations. I think it would be fair to pay special tribute to those who because of their work are involved with the Sports Drug Agency and to give them any support we can. I believe the challenge they will be facing in the coming years will be most severe. It took sporting bodies about 40 years to start winning the battle against the use of anabolic steroids by elite athletes. If we looked back over that period and saw some of the things that were happening in sport, particularly in the old Iron Curtain countries such as East Germany, we would be horrified to know exactly what went on. The Ben Johnson affair really brought the matter to public notice around the world. I think everyone was horrified at the time of the Seoul Olympics when his difficulties started. I pay tribute to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts for its investigation into drugs in sport. In many respects, that Committee led the world in trying to make some effort, after 40 years, to resolve the situation. The real challenge before the Sports Drug Agency in Australia and other agencies around the world is what will happen about the detection and elimination of the next generation of performance enhancing drugs. The area of particular concern is synthetic hormones such as EPO and the human growth hormone, or HGH. These new hormones, which are now corrupting elite sporting competition, are much more deadly than the steroids and stimulants they are replacing. The difficulty is that they are virtually impossible to detect by drug testers, who cannot really tell the difference between the hormone produced naturally by the body and the synthetic version. introduced through a syringe. I understand that some of these hormones cannot be found even in urine samples; in others, the benefits of the hormones last for a week but all trace of the hormone responsible is gone within hours. The real concern is the attitude of elite sports men and women around the world and the fact that they have to tum to using such drugs to maintain their position. One of the things that sports administrators should be looking at very closely is the pressures that are put on sports men and women to perform. A lot of that is in the hype of the events; a lot relates to their money earning capacity; a lot of it has been brought about because of the high profile that elite sports have been given through world television and the benefits to sponsors and the like of having sporting stars sponsor their goods and services. As a matter of some importance groups like the International Olympic Committee should examine some way in which some of these pressures can be removed so that we can get back to a reasonable sporting situation once again. I mentioned a couple of drugs of the present that are of concern-EPO and HGH. The side effects of those drugs are quite horrifying. I am sure nobody in either elite or amateur sports would like to experience the end effect on the human body of some of those drugs, which in many cases can certainly be death. We· have already seen the possibility of those drugs contributing directly the death of a number of cyclists around the world. That was particularly so in Holland. Some of the new drugs, of course, can have incredible effects in terms of malformation of the human body, both externally and internally, and can ultimately lead to the death of the athletes using them. The Australian Sports Drug Agency faces a monstrous challenge. The Opposition supports the agency in its work. We are delighted that the Government saw fit to appoint Professor Peter Baume as head of that agency. I am sure that a man of his stature and dedication will ensure that we continue to lead the world in trying to outlaw what is a dreadful situation. The Opposition will not oppose these amendments. As I said earlier, this is the third time that this Bill has come before the Parliament in the last 15 months. I am not quite sure whether it reflects badly on some of the drafting. I have some concern that this may not be the last time that we see this Bill inasmuch as the changes that are happening now may require some amendments in the future. I just hope that the bipartisan spirit that presently exists between the Government and the Opposition in trying to eradicate the menace of drugs in sport will continue.",29
20,Dr CHARLESWORTH,AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG,"It is with some pleasure that I am here today to support the Opposition and the Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill. The Australian Sports Drug Agency is in many ways unique in the world, in that it is an independent organisation which operates a testing regime which by any comparison is world-class. The reason for this amending legislation is that the legislation which was originally proposed to set up the agency was too pedantic and too detailed. These amendments will effectively allow for a bit more flexibility in the way in which samples are collected for testing by the agency. This situation has arisen mainly because of the well publicised case of Martin Vinnicombe. Martin Vinnicombe was tested positively while he was training in the United States. He was tested by the Canadian agency with which the Australian Sports Drug Agento cy has an arrangement. Indeed, the testing was carried out in an IOC approved laboratory and under a regime which surely complied with the.IOC requirements. Unfortunately, because of legal technicalities, an arbitration decision was made suggesting that the finding of a positive test against Martin Vinnicombe could not be upheld. Martin Vinnicombe admitted that he was a drug user, and that admission is on the public record. So it was clear to all of us who were interested in this issue that there were anomalieS in the legislation setting up the Australian Sports Drug Agency which required compliance with a large number of minor technical details and allowed for a legal technicality to absolve the athlete in this particular case. Of course, the absolution was not complete, because it was clear that Vinnicombe had admitted that he was a user. It was also clear that the test had been carried out in an IOC laboratory. It is because of some minor technical difficulties in the way in which the Canadian agency carried out its activities, which did not exactly comply with those laid down in our legislation, that we are today recommending some amendments, which will largely provide that, as long as the agency with which our agency has a relationship complies with the IOC criteria, testing in other countries by other agencies will be considered kosher. If that is the case, athletes will be placed on a register of notifiable events, and the appropriate sporting bodies and agencies in this country will receive notification of the status. The athlete, of course, will receive notification of the status and will have the right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. We will have in place a better piece of legislation because of these amendments, one which is more flexible and which takes into account the situation worldwide. We need to consider very carefully what the situation is worldwide because there are still athletes who use prohibited drugs. Many athletes are able to get away with the use of prohibited drugs, principally for two reasons. Firstly, many of the drugs they use are training agents, the sorts of agents that one uses to build up strength, speed and stamina in training but does not require at the time of competition. The present testing structure that we have, particularly for the Olympic Games, for example, relates to a competition testing regime. So if athletes are able to use these substances, particularly the anabolic steroids, which are perhaps the most effective, they can build up their strength, speed and stamina in a way which will give them an advantage at competition time when the drug has effectively been eliminated from their system and cannot be detected. The second reason athletes are able to beat the system is that there are substances that athletes can use which are undetectable by the present testing system. The reason for that relates to the fact that there are pharmacological and scientific difficulties in establishing the efficacy of any testing program, and difficulties with collecting samples. The difficulties that exist are such that it is impossible, with our present knowledge, to have a testing structure which can catch all of those new developments. For those two reasons, I think we will find in Barcelona that there are still athletes with unfair advantages because of assistance by pharmacologists. That is unfortunate. In a month's time when those of us who are interested are watching the events in Barcelona we will need to ask: what is the nature of sport, why do we believe that it is an important part of our society, and what aspects would we like to see developed and continued? It is my personal view that, in effect, when we watch sporting competitions we see competition between individuals to see who can perhaps run the fastest, but run the fastest alone and unaided. If it were just about going fast one could use a motor bike and go very fast, and if it were only about winning one would run only against people one could always beat. But sport is about competition in which people can win or lose, and it is about competing against one another unaided, where the playing field, to use the vernacular, is level. I do not believe it is a health question. I do not believe it is a question of illegality in respect of some of these substances. As mature adults, the majority of these athletes have to make those sorts of decisions for themselves. But it should not be the case that someone who wants to compete in sporting competition has to risk his or her health or risk breaking the law in order to have an even chance. It is about those people who want to compete in sport on a level playing field having the opportunity to do so. It is incumbent on us and our society to develop a structure which will allow that to be the case. The Australian Sports Drug Agency has developed expertise in this area. It has particular independence and I believe it represents a very good model for other countries. It is very unfortunate that in many other countries we do not have the same structure or vigilance in the testing of athletes for these drugs which can enhance performance. The Opposition spokesman in this area, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), spoke about the Eastern bloc countries. I think he was speaking about a previous time, but it was clear that performance enhancing substances embellished their athletes' performances during the 1970s and 1980s. It was also very clear that the same pharmacological assistance was available to many athletes in Western countries. If that is to be the case and if the major substances that athletes will use are substances which will assist them in training, some credible random testing structure needs to be set up. I believe we have such a system in Australia, but the systems in countries overseas do not have the same credibility as our system. We certainly hope that such a structure will be developed. The Australian Sports Drug Agency presently has reciprocal agreements with countries such as Canada, Norway, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom and a number of other countries are presently developing those sorts of regimes which will give some credibility to the random testing aspect of the problem. I think it is likely that before the next Olympiadduring the next four years-we will see further progress made in this area. The Australian Sports Drug Agency represents a good model and I hope that in the future we will find less legal challenge to the decisions of the agency and less use of legal technicalities in order to avoid the regulations of national sporting bodies such as the IOC and, indeed, bodies like the Australian Sports Drug Agency. This Bill offers me an opportunity to speak about sport and we do not often have the opportunity to raise other issues in this place. I wrote to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) only two days ago about an issue that particularly concerned me. I raised this issue reluctantly, but I believe it needs to be aired in the public domain. It related to the selection of athletes for the Olympic Games. Many sports in this country have very objective criteria for the selection of athletes. For instance, Duncan Annstrong, a hero from Seoul, failed to qualify in the first two places in the swimming event. So whilst he will be competing in Barcelona in the relay, he will not be defending his gold medal in the freestyle event. That is an example of the very objective criteria that we see applied by many sports in this country. Exactly the same thing occurs in the United States. Only last week we saw the example of Carl Lewis, arguably the greatest athlete of the centuryMr Johns-Next to yourself!",31
21,Dr CHARLESWORTH,AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG,"That is a point well taken. He is arguably the best athlete of the century, but he failed to make the US team for the 100 metres sprint to defend his title from Seoul because he was unable to finish in the first three places in the trial. Whilst that seems very harsh and difficult, the reality of competition at that level is that it is extremely competitive and in those circumstances it is necessary to set down objective criteria for selection. The reason I wrote to the Minister last week was that in the 1,000 metres time trial for cycling a 17-year-old Western Australian, Darren Hill, failed to be selected and his place was taken by another athlete who will compete for Australia in Barcelona. I do not suggest that I am in a better position than those people in cycling to make that selection. What does concern me is the lack of any objective trial between the two contendersShane Kelly and Hill-in that particular event. It is interesting to note that Hill is the Australian champion; Kelly did not compete in the championships. Hill has a personal best which is two seconds faster than Kelly, and yet he has not been given an opportunity to be measured against the selected athlete in a head to head competition. There may be justifiable reasons for this, but nobody has been able to suggest to me that the process is fair and objective. There is no suggestion that these two athletes have been, or will be, matched against one another in a way which will enable us to make such a judgment. Athletes are not asking for anything more than an opportunity to know what the selection criteria are, what the structure is and to have some chance of competing in that way. Just as we are here passing legislation which will allow athletes to compete on an even basis without the odour of drugs being part of that structure, we would like our athletes who may be selected to have some sorts of objective criteria laid down, whereby they will understand the hoops they have to jump through and can comply with them. In the case of Hill, it is very clear that no such structure is in place. The Australian cycling coach, who happens to coach the other athlete, has a significant capacity to make a subjective judgment as to who should be in the team. We had the same problem in 1988 in respect of cycling. Until those criteria are improved in respect of that sport, we will continue to have these sorts of difficulties. In my letter to the Minister I also alluded to difficulties that I anticipate will occur in relation to gymnastics. Australia's women gymnasts have done outstandingly well in the last six to eight years. Indeed, their performance in finishing sixth in Indianapolis means that an Australian team of women gymnasts has qualified to compete in the Barcelona Olympics. In Canberra, nine girlsor perhaps lO........ are presently involved in training camp in which they are required to be tested according to a procedure which has been laid down and which appears to me to be relatively objective. According to their performance here and in other trials-two of which have already been held-they will be selected for Barcelona at the beginning of next month. What distresses me is that I am hearing concerns about the way in which that procedure is being undertaken and the way in which those criteria are being fulfilled. Indeed, just this morning I heard a most disturbing report, again about one of our Western Australian athletes. I understand that a young girl, Tracey Gibbs, has been told that she is no longer required at the camp. The reason for her not being required seems to me to be absolutely absurd. One of the requirements laid down in the camp is for these young gymnasts to fulfil particular criteria in relation to their weight and body make-up. One of the tests is a skin fold test in which seven sites on the body are pinched in a calibrated device which determines the skin fold thickness. Seven different readings are taken to arrive at a total. The girls have to register a reading of less than a total of 40 millimetres. When this girl was measured in Perth, her skin fold thickness was found to be 38 millimetres. She came across to the eastern States and it was found to be 44 millimetres. She was told the measurement was too high. A week later her skin fold thickness was down to 42 millimetres; today it is 38 millimetres. For the sake of one or two miIlimetres, in a test which has a margin of error of plus or minus three or four millimetres, she has been excluded from the possibility of continuing in the trial. I find that sort of heavy-handed approach unconscionable. Training rules for gymnasts include the limiting of telephone calls, both incoming and outgoing, to rest days. These girls have one rest day a week. They are asked to come to Canberra for a training camp. They are away from their families for some months, and on one day a week they are allowed to make or a receive telephone calls from their families. I know that the participants are not complying with these rules, but I find the fact that these rules can be laid down to be unconscionable. There is great concern about the way in which the selection of the gymnastics coaches and this team is likely to be determined. I am raising these issues today in anticipation that this will occur because I do not want to be seen as someone who is speaking after the event. On a number of occasions in this House I have raised concerns about the way in which the gymnastic programs at the AIS are structured and the way in which the money is spent. I continue to raise these issues because they are important. It needs to be understood by the public that these young. athletes train for years and years and they deserve a fair and honest assessment of their worth and their capacity. If they have an honest assessment of their worth and capacity, they have the ability to accept those sorts of decisions. It appears to me that the way in which the selection of this team and the coaches of this team is developing is flawed. Even though it is likely that three of the seven girls in the gymnastics team will be Western Australians, it may well be the case that their personal coach will be unable to be with them. An outstanding and world renowned gymnastics coach, like Andrei Rodionenko, may not be able to be at the Games to advise his athletes. If this is the outcome of events, it is a very sad and sorry state for gymnastics in this country. (TIme expired)",33
22,Mr JOHNS,AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG,"Petrie-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services) (12.12 p.m.)-The Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill seeks to tighten the existing legislation because of an incident that arose concerning Martin Vinnicombe. I will just relate some of the details of that case and then talk about some of the features of the Bill. I also pick some comments of the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth)-he was always quick, but he has disappeared from the chamber already-about sports administrators sometimes being the scourge of amateur athletes. I must say that to some extent I agree. We cannot be too hard on the sports administrators who are unpaid volunteers. I spent a good many years in representative sport. I played hockey, as did the honourable member for Perth. From time to time sports people who are not always of a delicate age18 years, 19 years, 20 years or mid-20s-are treated like children. They are pushed around and made to conform to a set of rules that do not regard them as mature and very talented people. Any amateur sports person who has played a representative sport could tell a million stories of the conflict between sports people and amateur officials. But that is not the topic of the debate today. My first contact with drugs in sport was in 1989. Chris Turner, a chap in my electorate who I think was the then president of the Australian Amateur Powerlifting Federation, came to me seeking some government funding to help form the Powerlifting Federation. His stories pointed to the contrast between his Australian Drug Free Powerlifting Federation and the fact that-we have become used to this over time-in weight-lifting there has been a significant amount of steroid use and so on to build up weight-lifters to enable them, under the pressure of competition, to perform at their peak. I was gratified that Chris came to me and talked about the importance of establishing a sport on a drug-free basis. He and his fellow lifters also gave a number of demonstrations in my electorate to prove that their sport, powerlifting, is in fact a different sport to weight-lifting. I am trying to remember the details; I think it has something to do with not bending one's knees. There is a different form of lifting weights.",34
23,Mr COBB,AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG,Different types of lifts.,35
24,Mr JOHNS,AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG,"Yes, that is right. There are different types of lifts. They do not carry the up weights of traditional weight-lifters, but I assure the House that they were sufficiently weighty. They impressed (me with their athleticism and strength. As it turned out-I am reading a response I had from the then Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Graham Richardson-we were unable to help Chris at that time with funding. But I know he continues to be an activist in the Australian Drug FreePowerlifting Federation. Senator Graham Richardson, at that time, had suggested an amalgamation between the two forms of weight-lifting. In fact, Senator Richardson wrote: For the future of the sport of powerlifting in Australia a possible solution could be for the two national organisations to amalgamate and work together for a drug free sport scene from within the existing national structure. I was grateful to Senator Richardson for that response and, although it did not carry money, we did impress upon Chris Turner the need for him to work amongst his own people for the continuation of a drug free powerlifting federation. In this general area, I would like to acknowledge the work of the former politiciannow deceased in a poljtical sense-Senator John Black from Queensland. His Senate committee, of course, made great inroads into the prevalence of drug use in sport and the importance of having a monitoring system that was both fair and foolproof. As I understand it, legislation has now been passed and it has become somewhat of a model for international systems of testing. When a testing system is set up, it inevitably becomes tested. In the Vinnicombe case it was not so much that Martin had not taken the drugs, but that all the processes of testing him had not gone absolutely according to the rules. He was able to not take the full consequences of the law at that time because all the proper procedures had not been followed. It is desirable that in this Bill we amend the Act to make the sense of the law true, even if every single point is not followed. As I understand it, we are allowing a little flexibility. If someone has clearly drugs, then that person has to suffer the consequences. On the athlete's side-this is not at all to excuse anyone's actions in taking drugs-we need to keep in mind the pressures now on sports people at an international level. We need to give them support and assistance. If someone has been forced to take that awful step of taking drugs, then that in itself-to use the phrase-is a cry for help. That person is saying to us, 'Hey, there is no way I can compete against X, Y and Z at this level unless I cheat as they do'. That is a pity. That is the beauty of having a set of international rules that say, 'Listen, Martin or whoever, don't use the drugs any more, mate, because, as best we can, we'll ensure that your competitors are also drug free'. If someone had spent 10 or 15 years of his life reaching his peak as an athlete, he would hate to be knocked off by someone else who had been cheating. Some people have been foolish enough to try to compete not only in the game in which they are involved but also in the game of cheating. I thank John Black and his Senate committee for bringing to prominence this matter and ensuring that athletes are protected from having to take drugs. An Australian athlete should not have to compete against someone who clearly has been taking performance enhancing drugs. With a more open world, athletes representing nations having less regard for rules on the taking of drugs will not be able to hide behind the iron curtain of sport. We can now be much more certain that at the next Olympics all athletes competing will be diug free; they will be under great scrutiny. If they are taking drugs, it is quite likely that they will be found out and, of course, the full weight and consequence of the law will be brought to bear on their sporting. career. I make a general remark and note my appreciation of the work done in this area by the Department, by officials and by sporting officials. They have had to come to grips with this enormous difficulty. It has really taken the edge off the international sporting scene. So much prominence is now given to sporting taken people on an international standard; they become heroes almost overnight. Especially· kids-by the millions-watch these sports people, and they become superstars. - t is important that we give these sports people protection. If they are to remain superstars, we should ensure that they do so on the basis of their talent and hard work and not because of performance enhancing drugs. There is a trickle down effect, is there not? If someone has just won a gold medal in the Olympics and got over the line because of performance enhancing drugs, it sends a pretty strong signal to all those kids watching that maybe this is acceptable behaviour. Mr Staples-And other drugs.",35
25,Mr JOHNS,AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG,"Yes; not just performance enhancing, but those traditional, recreational, illegal drugs meant to show us a good time. The connections could be made. As a kid, one does not need all that much encouragement or all that much rationalisation to say, 'If it is acceptable for a world-class athlete to take performance enhancing drugs, then maybe it is acceptable for me to dabble in the narcotics and the other sorts of drugs'. There are ramifications. We should ensure that we clean up-and that we keep it clean-the sportsdrugs connection and that we have in place a system, as this Bill addresses, that cannot easily be by-passed. A particular athlete who admitted to taking drugs was able to escape the full force of this law because the testing undertaken, as I understand it, did not comply with every single step that had been laid down. We have now learned the lesson that one does not make some of these procedures so specific that it can be argued that a procedure was not complied with in full so that someone can then get out of it. Martin Vinnicombe is back on the cycling scene. I think he realises the damage he has done to the great sport of cycling. I do not know Martin but, having heard a number of interviews with him, I think he is an intelligent enough bloke to have made a clean break, and he will now be working within the cycling sport to encourage and support other athletes so that they are not tempted to go along with taking - rfonnance drugs. I shall refer to some features of the Bill to the swapping of powers amongst the States, the Territories and the Commonwealth over the Australian Sports Drug Agency. The Bill makes provision for the Australian States and Territories to confer broader powers on the Australian Sports Drug Agency through complementary anti-doping ·legislation currently proposed by all the States and Territories.·It will also allow the agency to work more closely with the States and Territories to ensure a consistent and comprehensive approach towards the elimination of prohibited drugs and doping methods in sport. The Australian Sports Drug Agency will now test, both in Australia and overseas, a wider range of athletes for the presence of prohibited drugs. This will include foreign athletes when the test is sought by an overseas anti-doping authority or when the test is conducted under a contractual arrangement which the Australian Sports Drug· Agency may now enter into. The agency may be able to recognise procedures adopted by foreign anti-doping authorities which conduct tests on its behalf so that it can act on the result of those tests. The amendments will enable the procedures followed by such an authority to be recognised for the purposes of the Act, even if these procedures do not precisely mirror those set out in the Australian Sports Drug Agency regulations. I believe this was the critical error we made initially; were too precise in laying out procedures. The minimum standard to be adopted and recognised in such cases will now be that provided for in the International Olympic Charter Against Doping in Sport. This does not mean that there is anything wrong with the current regulations. It is merely an amendment which acknowledges that the Australian procedures are stricter and more precise than the internationally accepted standard of the Olympic charter. It is the work of lawyers to make sure that, where things are outlined very precisely, there are difficulties: it gives more grounds for an argument. enhancing The Bill also provides an athlete with the opportunity to make a submission to the agency challenging the validity of a positive and test result if the athlete considers that procedures in the following specified areas are not complied with: sealing of the container holding the sample; testing of the sample by an accredited laboratory; or evidence of tampering with the sample. If the agency decides that the test was valid, the competitor will be entitled to apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to have the decision reviewed. If the AAT reverses the agency's decision, then the competitor's name must be removed from the register. Even if the athlete does not make a submission, the agency will be required to verify that all procedures relating to these specific matters were followed before validating a positive test result. It will no longer be required to check procedures where non-compliance would not cast doubt on the test result. Other amendments provide for written notification to approved sporting and antidoping organisations of a positive test result or a refusal to provide a sample. Where this is not possible, alternative arrangements have been provided so that athletes cannot hinder the process by purposefully avoiding the notice. Many international sporting federations require advice of a possible positive test result to satisfy their own anti-doping policy. The Bill we are debating will enable the agency to satisfy such requests in certain specified that is, we circumstances. The name of the register will be changed to the Register of Notifiable Events. This will reduce the misconception that the entry of a person's name on the register implies some finding of guilt. The notion of guilt was never intended to be associated with the entry of names on the register. The question of guilt and application of sanctions is, and has always been, a matter for sporting organisations and not the agency. The Bill also recognises the need to give minors special consideration by providing for the removal of a name from the register once the period of any sanction imposed by sporting organisations has elapsed if at the time of the request to provide a sample the person was under 18 years of age. The Australian Sports Drug Agency· is increasingly being recognised overseas and domestically as having the professional expertise to arrange for the collection and testing of samples to detect the presence of prohibited drugs and, therefore, will be called on more and more to arrange such tests overseas and in Australia at the request of both overseas and Australian authorities and sporting organisations. The Bill includes amendments which will give it the power to enter into contracts or arrangements with overseas governments, other sporting organisationsandanti-doping authorities for the collection and testing of samples. There are a number of other minor amendments to the Act. We have here another chapter in what has become a good story. We are now providing protection for all athletes to compete on their merits. An athlete will be able to be sufficiently relaxed to know that when he is out there competing, putting the whole of his life into his event, he can be pretty well sure that those with whom he is competing are not using performance enhancing drugs. We will go back to having a sporting arena that is clean, one in which each of us can trust the end result; that is,' that the one who finished No. 1 did so on his or her merits. I commend this Bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith.

26,Mr STAPLES,INTERNATIONAL AIR SERVICES,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. In the best interests of the House and its time this day, and as this speech has already been read into Hansard in the Senate, with the concurrence of the Opposition I do not propose to read this speech into the Hansard again. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted. The speech read as followsGovernment Objectives and Principles Mr Speaker, on 26 February 1992 the Prime Minister announced in the One Nation statement the most significant program of aviation refonn ever to be undertaken in this country. Included in the statement was the announcement of multiple designation of Australia's international air services, that Australia's domestic carriers would be given the opportunity to fly internationally, that Qantas would be given access to domestic sectors, and that a single trans-Tasman market would be negotiated with New Zealand. The February announcements built on the already very extensive program of change in Australia's aviation fabric initiated by this Government, in particular, the successful introduction of domestic deregulation in 1990 which has seen unprecedented numbers of people flying at record low fares; and the announcement in 1990 that the Government would privatise Australian Airlines and Qantas. The thrust of these changes will give. greater impetus to the tourism industry, through the establishment of a more competitive aviation policy framework and will provide greater certainty for investors in the combined Qantasf Australian Airlines entity. The Prime Minister has recently announced the next stages in the privatisation process including the sale of Australian Airlines to Qantas and, subject to endorsement by the Australian Labor Party, the consequent 100 per cent sale of the combined airline. This will maximise the return to the community and, together with the regulatory changes in the One Nation statement, ensure a strong and viable Australian aviation industry. The Government made it clear in February that changes of the magnitude proposed in the One Nation statement could only be made following consultation with interested parties on the way in which the proposals would be implemented. Since that time, the Government has consulted closely with Australia's major airlines and after considering their views has developed multiple designation proposals aimed at achieving: · greater economic efficiency in the airline industry, and increased competition among Australian carriers; · increased responsiveness by airlines to the needs of consumers, including an increased range of choices and benefits; · improved tourism and trade outcomes; and · the development of strong Australian carriers capable of competing effectively with airlines of foreign countries. The consultations with the New Zealand Government have resulted in the New Zealand Minister of Transport and I announcing revised arrangements that will see for the first time, Australasian airlines, other than Qantas and Air New Zealand, operating scheduled trans-Tasman passenger services. Multiple designation of all trans-Tasman city pairs available for international services and any other combinations approved by the two Governments will be phased in over the next three years. Because of, the consumer benefits to be obtained from introducing new carriers on routes not currently served by an Australian carrier, multiple designation will occur initially on three city pairs on which Qantas does not have a substantial operational presence. At the same time, Australian and New Zealand airlines will be permitted tQ increase progressively the number of destinations served and flights offered in markets beyond each country. We aim to complete treaty arrangements which, from November 1994, will enable airlines of either country to operate domestic services in the other country. Progress will be reviewed in July 1993. An important element in the next phase of aviation reform is the Government's decision to allow Australian carriers other than Qantas to fly internationally. The February statement envisaged that a multiple designation regime would be introduced as soon as possible and certainly by 1993. With the passage of this Bill, implementation will be brought forward to 1 July this year. International Air Services Commission The Government has decided to establish an independent body, the International Air Services Commission, to allocate international aviation capacity and route entitlements among Australian international carriers-Qantas and new entrants. The Bill before you establishes a basis for the Commission to allocate aviation rights which: · creates an opportunity for all interested parties compete; · recognises the need to balance the interests of new entrants with those of Qantas; · recognises the commercial imperative of minimising administrative burden and delay; · meets high standards of accountability and transparency; and · conforms with Australia's international aviation obligations. Multiple designation will be applied to all routes, subject only to the Government's securing of the agreement of its bilateral aviation partners. It does not anticipate any great difficulty in achieving that agreement in respect of the relatively few remaining single designation routes. Routes will be so defined as to encompass the full set of entitlements available to Australian carriers under a particular bilateral arrangement with another country. All the combinations of origin, destination, intermediate and beyond points available to Australian carriers under a bilateral arrangement with another country constitute a single route. The Commission will have independence in decision making and its decisions will be binding. It will comprise three members with experience or expertise in the fields of law, commerce, business, economics or public administration. Appointees to the Commission will not be representative of sectoral interests. They will have the ability to appraise the merits of competing claims under a strict public benefit test, applying criteria laid down by the Government in a Policy Statement to be issued pursuant to clause 11 of the Bill. A copy of the draft Policy Statement was' tabled with this Bill in the Senate when the Bill was introduced on 4 June 1992. The criteria set out in the policy' statement are pro-competitive and designed to maximise the gains to the nation as a whole from the aviation policy reforms. Role of Government and its Relationship to the Commission The Australian Government, through the Minister for Transport and Communications, will continue to have responsibility for administering and negotiating Australia's air services agreements. Most of these already provide for multiple designation. Where they do not, and where necessary to allow new entrant participation on a route, the Government will move to convert agreements to multiple designation status. The Goverriment will also actively pursue additional capacity and route entitlements whenever necessary to support a multiple designation regime. The Commission will have responsibility for to determining the outcome of applications by airlines for capacity and route entitlements available under Australia's bilateral air service agreements. Its determinations will identify which designated carriers are selected to operate particular routes, allocate available capacity and set necessary conditions. Determinations will be reviewed after a specified period (usually five years). Action will be required to give practical effect to the Commission's determinations: - by the Government, to negotiate multiple designation provisions if that is required; - by the Government, to designate the carrier if it is 'not already designated on the route; and - by the Secretary of the Department of Transport and Communications, to issue an international airline licence and to approve tariff and timetable filings. The Secretary of the Department of Transport and Communications is to have no discretion to reconsider the Commission's determination of the capacity and route entitlements available to a carrier. However, the Commission will maintain a close working relationship with the Department of Transport and Communications in all matters concerning aviation relations with countries and territories outside Australia, Australia's membership of international aviation organisations and the implementation of its international aviation obligations. The Department of Transport and Communications will maintain a register of capacity available for determination by the Commission. This will be updated to reflect any changes to capacity entitlements arising from new capacity negotiations and determinations made by the Commission allocating available capacity to airlines. Allocation of Capacity and Route Entitlements The Government considers that it is fundamental to Qantas' future and Australia's international aviation competitiveness that capacity and route entitlements being used by Qantas at 1 July 1992 will be preserved for five years from that date. So that Qantas will be able to introduce a number of planned new services in November 1992, the Government will, by way of an interim determination, approve the allocation to Qantas of such unutilised capacity and route entitlements as are required to give effect to its scheduling proposals for that period. This will ensure continued growth in key markets during the transition phase to multiple designation and that important tourism objectives are met. The Government will give its approval to Qantas for this period on the understanding that the entitlements involved may be exercised for no longer than three years from 1 July 1992 and, on the understanding that the grant of these rights will be subject to early review by the Commission in accordance with start-up phase provisions, which I will eXl?lain shortly. Capacity available for use by Australian designated carriers under bilateral agreements and arrangements, but not exercised by Qantas or subject to interim determination by the Government at the commencement of the legislation, will be subject to determination by the Commission. This will include increases in capacity as they are negotiated bilaterally. Start-up Phase I made reference to start-up phase criteria a few moments ago. It is designed to foster the introduction of competition onto routes and will apply to the period between the date of commencement of the legislation and the date on which a second Australian carrier is allocated by the Commission any entitlements which allow an Australian carrier to operate on a route'. During the start-up phase on a route, there will be a presumption on competition policy grounds in favour of entry by a new carrier to that route. Special start-up phase criteria for selection of new entrant carriers are set out in the Policy Statement. ' The Commission will give preference in allocating capacity and route entitlements to carriers which best meet these criteria. Interim Determinations The Bill allows the Commission and the Minister to make interim determinations. Interim determinations will include: .capacity allocated before 1 July 1992 (such as that granted to Qantas for services to commence in November); and .capacity which the Commission allocates to one carrier, on the condition that other prospective carriers who may wish to use the capacity but are not yet in a position to do so, will be given an early opportunity to compete. If the final allocation is to be made to a carrier other than the holder of the interim determination, the allocation will be resolved early in the term of the interim determination so that the new carrier has adequate time to make preparations to commence operations. If no new carrier applies for the capacity, the Commission will treat the allocation as an ordinary determination. Renewal of Capacity and Route Entitlements In keeping with practices overseas, allocation decisions taken by the Commission will be for a limited duration, usually for five (5) years. At the end of this period, capacity and route entitlements will become available for rea1\ocation by the Commission. The Government considers that five years will a1\ow the incumbent carrier time to develop its market, to develop its effectiveness on the route and to recoup its investment, at the same time, protecting consumer interests through encouraging the incumbent carrier to remain responsive to market needs. Consideration of a re-allocation after the five year tenn will provide an opportunity for new entrants to compete for entitlements to any remaining single designation routes or those on which it has not been possible to secure additional capacity because of airport congestion or other reasons. If there has been no previous detennination by the Commission a1\ocating capacity on the route to an Australian. carrier other than the carrier seeking renewal and the route is one to which multiple designation applies, the pro-competitive start-up phase route a1\ocation criteria set down in the Policy Statement will apply in relation to that part of the capacity which is reasonably necessary for a level of service appropriate to the development of efficient, commercially sustainable carrier operations. Where there has been a detennination by the Commission allocating capacity on the route to an Australian carrier other than the carrier seeking renewal, the Commission will apply a rebuttable presumption in favour of the incumbent since there had already been competitive entry onto the route. Transfer of Rights Carriers operated will be entitled to apply to the Commission for approval to transfer rights to another Australian carrier. The Commission will assess any such proposal on the basis of the criteria set out in the policy statement, and provided that no anti-competitive effects would flow from the secondary trading in entitlements, may approve the transfer of those entitlements. To avoid specUlative applications for capacity a1\ocations, a transfer would not nonna1\y be a1\owed unless the carrier has a1\ocated capacity and route entitlements for a reasonable period, usua1\y six months. The Commission may consult with the Trade Practices Commission on competition policy issues without prejudice to any independent action the Trade Practices Commission may wish to take. Where the Commission has approved the transfer of capacity and route entitlements, the receiving carrier will be able to operate those rights for the remainder of the period that would otherwise have been available to the carrier operating under the original detennination. Safeguards In the interests of fair and open competition, the Government wishes to ensure that carriers are not able to seek detenninations awarding them capacity and route entitlements when they have no intention of using those entitlements themselves. In other words, the proposed legislation will prevent the stockpiling of capacity and route entitlements by a carrier simply to prevent a competitor from operating on a route. For the purposes of specifying a period within which capacity a1\ocated to an Australian carrier must be fu1\y used, the Commission will specify as short a period as is reasonable having regard to the steps required to commence operations. Except in exceptional circumstances, the Commission should not specify a period exceeding three (3) years. As I have noted, the Government wishes to ensure that the process of allocating capacity and route entitlements among carriers is fair, open and fu1\y accountable. Accordingly, the Commission will publish its detenninations and will furnish to me and through me, to this Parliament, an annual report. Financial Impact Statement The Bill will involve additional expenditure by the Commonwealth to meet the remuneration of Commission members and staffing and administrative costs. It is envisaged that expenditure in the first year of the Commission's operation will be in the order of $2.2m. Opportunities for New Carrier Entry Mr Speaker, as you will see, the Bill and related draft policy statement contain a number of provisions affecting the balance of interests between new entrants and Qantas. They recognise that the balance will change depending on the circumstances of the route in question, the extent to which the route is operated by Qantas, the point in time at which new capacity and route entitlements are detennined and the extent to which new entrants are physica1\y capable of entering the market within specified time-frames. The principles and procedures outlined will provide carriers with a range of options for entering new markets. A new entrant will have the option of deciding whether to seek a detennination of capacity and routes under specially designed startup criteria at anyone of the following stages: . from its commencement, the Commission will be able to allocate all unused capacity and route entitlements and new capacity as it becomes available; or . before the expiry of interim detenninations in July 1995, the Commission will be able to consider applications either to renew and/or re-allocate the capacity and route entitlements subject to those interim determinations; or before the expiry of determinations preserving Qantas' current used capacity and route entitlements in July 1997, the Commission will be able to consider applications to either renew and/or re-allocate the capacity and route entitlements subject of those determinations. It is a matter for new entrants to exercise their commercial judgement as to when it would be most advantageous to them to apply for the start-up phase to be applied to particular routes. Once up phase criteria have been applied by the Commission to allow a new entrant access to a route, the normal carrier selection criteria will be applied to applications for new capacity and the rebuttable presumption in favour of incumbents will be applied at the renewal stage. With the establishment of the Commission from 1 July 1992 and the introduction of multiple designation on specified trans-Tasman sectors from November 1992, Qantas will be able to exercise the option to sell spare capacity on existing domestic sectors of its international services. Additional Australian Freight Carrier and Charter Operations The Prime Minister announced in the One Nation statement that additional Australian freight carrier(s) would be able to operate on international routes to and from Australia and that charter applications from Australian operators would be approved where it can be demonstrated that approval would not foreclose opportunities for scheduled service operators under a multiple designation regime. The Bill establishes the framework for the Commission to allocate entitlements on a route by route basis to any parties interested in freight only operations. In assessing such applications, the Commission will have regard to the criteria set down in the policy statement. The Bill also provides for the Commission to perform an advisory function in relation to charter applications from Australian operators. The removal of the single designation policy will facilitate operations by Australian-based charters. The Bill deals with a complex set of interrelationships in a way which provides detailed guidance to the Commission on the various elements and which is sufficiently flexible to allow the Commission to put in place measures to deal with the particular circumstances that may arise. The process which the Government has decided to pursue is directed at meeting the specific .requirements of the Australian aviation industry and Australia's continuing reliance on the tourism sector as a major source of revenue. The implementation of the policy reforms will also meet in a very direct way the interests of Australian consumers. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Leave granted for debate to proceed forthwith.",38
27,Mr JULL,INTERNATIONAL AIR SERVICES,"I wish startto make. a few comments about the International Air Services Commission Bill 1992 because it is the start of a new era of international aviation in Australia. Since the illfated One Nation statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) we have had a number of policy announcements about the establishment of this independent authority to allocate capacity to Australian carriers under the new international aviation regime. One aspect of that regime is the introduction of dual designated carriers from Australia. The Opposition has some concerns, but I point out that we will not be opposing this Bill. I would like the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) to respond to some questions on the operation of the International Air Services Commission. As I understand it, the Commission will have a staff of 12. I find that quite fascinating. I confess that, in terms of the formulation of the Opposition's policy on aviation, we were looking to a similar commission. The best I cO\lld manage, at· the absolute maximum, was seven staff. I am absolutely amazed that the Government is going along this track, setting up what could be a monstrosity in terms of staffmg and its allocation and, not only that, but imposing $2.2m in costs on this Commission in the first year of its establishment. As I understand the situation, we will have a part time chairman working three days a Conclusion week; two members working one day per week each; one secretary at the second level of the SES; three divisional heads, class 11; and five research and support staff. For what we are trying to achieve in relation to the allocation of international aviation rights to Australian carriers only, that would seem to be an absolutely massive number of staff. I wonder whether this piece of legislation has been rushed through. Maybe not the best advice has been taken from the Government on the structure this Commission may undertake.",42
28,Mr COBB,INTERNATIONAL AIR SERVICES,Who is paying for this?,43
29,Mr JULL,INTERNATIONAL AIR SERVICES,"The taxpayers are paying for this. If this Commission was designed, as it should be, to be a completely transparent vehicle overlooking the allocation of all international air routes in Australia, there may be some justification for putting up that staff. I understand that, at the moment, advertisements are being called for the manning of this Commission. It will be interesting to see whether people in the present department want to transfer over, or whether they find, when they get there, that they are absolutely bored stiff with nothing to do. I do not say that lightly or in a silly sense, because I have studied the commissions that have been'set up overseas-particularly those in Great Britain and the United States-and the way in which they allocate international routes. I suppose the comparison with the United Kingdom is not necessarily a good one, because it goes a little further than we do. Its commission is, in a sense, a court. An airline can make an application to run on a particular route and that application could be challenged by any other airline. A battle royal has developed in the United Kingdom between the aviation lawyers. These battles cost airlines millions and millions of dollars annually to meet the requirements. I must say, in favour of the UK situation, that at least the whole process is very transparent. It is absolutely essential that we try to get that transparency on the allocation of international air routes in Australia. This is one of the concerns that I have. Airlines do not want to sell their sovereignty and the Government must have some control on the allocation of air routes. We are not going terribly further down the track than the situation that has absolutely stifled the development of international aviation and international tourism in this country for the past 20 years; that is, the decision to allocate air routes is the responsibility of the Government, the Department and the Minister. For no reason at all applications will not necessarily be issued. I will cite a couple of examples. For 14 years Korean Air applied for air routes into . Australia, and for 14 years it was knocked back. The Scandinavian airline system applied for 16 years for rights into Australia, and for 16 years it was knocked back. Do we not look dills, when one of the biggest growth areas we have for world tourism is Korea? We are four years behind the times in the development of that market. One of the greatest percentage growth areas of international tourism into Australia at the moment is the Scandinavian market. There were 42,000 Scandinavian tourists last year. We have neglected that market since way back. What should have happened was the opening up of the Australian aviation system at the time of that dreadful ICAO situation that existed in the early 1970s, when all of a sudden we were found out for being overprotectionist and charging much more than we ever should for our international air fares. The Opposition has some other worries with the establishment of this Commission. While the allocation of routes is very much at the forefront-it will be possible for Australian carriers to go in there and claim some of the excess capacity that presently exists within the agreements-we have made absolutely no provision, as I read this Bill, for the allocation of charter rights. While this Government bleats and trumpets about what it has done for the development of charter traffic in and out of Australia, in reality very little has been done over the last 10 years. We have a couple of charters that come in from Britannia Airways. I understand the Minister announced a week or two ago that we will have a couple of flights in from Indonesia. There has never been a realisation, until now, as to the possibility of opening up this country to mass tourism traffic. I was absolutely delighted in a meeting I had a couple of weeks ago with the Chairman and chief executive officer of Qantas. I learnt that, all of a sudden, Qantas had seen the light and it can see the tremendous advantages in developing charter markets, which it is doing out of some of the secondary airports in Japan, and as it has been doing with the market in and out of Vietnam. I hope that we might be able to allocate those charter rights, for Australian charter carriers, into particular system. There are huge markets out there that are waiting to be developed. I want to see Australian carriers being given the opportunity of getting into some of those markets. If we look at the structure and fares that are available for the opening up of those new markets, we see that charters are the way to go. They are certainly the way to go if we are to develop some of the regional areas of Australia. When we look at what has happened overseas in places such as the United Kingdom and Germany, where 56 per cent of the total international traffic is carried by the charter operators, we can see how far behind the times we are. There has to be this major revolution in the development of aviation policy in Australia. A few months ago the World Tourism Organisation estimated that, by the year 2000, 140 million Asian people will be travelling offshore annually for their holidays. If Australia could pick up 5 per cent of that market, frankly, we could not handle it. If we look at the Government's target of 61f2 million international visitors by the year 2000, or if we look at the Opposition's peak target, getting up towards the 10 million mark, the plain facts of the matter are that we are going to have to triple the capacity of international carriers in and out of Australia. The pressure on the domestic market will be huge and we will probably have to double the size of the domestic fleet. The investment that will be needed to be made is enormous for the infrastructure that is required. While we have been debating the development of the third runway in Sydney, the third runway has become pretty small fry in relation to those figures. Right now we should be looking at the development of the second international airport for Sydney. There has to be major investment in the development of Melbourne. The farce that exists in Brisbane with the international terminal has to be overcome virtually tomorrow. We are going to have problems with some of the lesser ports unless we start making some of those decisions now. We should be prepared to stand up and say that we - re genuine about this the development of international tourism and aviation. A most important part of that will be the nurturing of charter traffic into Australia. In a time of very high unemployment, the fact that we have not got the charter operators involved in this matter worries me. I think there is tremendous potential for future Australian owned charter operators to start getting into some of that international business. The Opposition, when in government, will be looking at the operation of this Commission. We want to broaden its scope. We have concerns about the staffing of it, and we certainly have concerns about the costing of it-$2.2m in its first 12 months. Let us hope that we can get some sort of bipartisan attitude between the Government and the Opposition to make sure that, at long last, even 20 years too late, we are prepared to take on the proper development of international aviation in Australia. We can then catch up with the rest of the world in the pricing policies and the opportunities that are there, so that we can see the benefit of that pass on to all Australians. At a time when we have very high unemployment, we have the opportunity to create hundreds of thousands of jobs in our growing tourist industry.",43

32,Mr SPEAKER,TELEVISING OF QUESTION TIME,"Yesterday I received a letter from Mr Ian Carroll, the Acting Controller of News and Current Affairs for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In his letter, Mr Carroll advised that at 2.15 p.m. today the ABC would televis- live the debate from the New South Wales Parliament. That debate would be on the ICAC report into the Metherell affair. The telecast would have meant that the House of Representatives would not have been telecast in New South Wales today. This proposal would appear to conflict with understandings which were reached during the discussions on the televising of the House of Representatives. The ABC proposal was discussed at a meeting of the Select Committee on the Televising of the House of Representatives this morning. The Committee was of the view that the ABC's attitude was unacceptable. If the ABC is to be a national broadcaster, it has an obligation to telecast the national Parliament. The Committee resolved that if the ABC did not telecast the national Parliament, the feed would be selectively delayed. The ABC has now agreed that it will telecast the New South Wales Parliament from 2.15 p.m. to 3 p.m. in New South Wales and there will be a retelecast of the House of Representatives at 3 p.m. in New South Wales.

33,Mr SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister agree with his Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, that high levels of youth suicide are linked to high levels of youth unemployment?",45
34,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have not seen that reference by Senator Cook. I can only assume that, as the shadow Minister quotes it, it is correct. There would be all sorts of reasons why we have seen this phenomenon of suicides amongst young people. No doubt all social circumstances would bear upon that. But if the honourable gentleman is trying to make the point that youth unemployment, as it exists today as distinct from other periods in' Australia's economic history, is the singular cause for a shift in suicide levels amongst young people, I think it is wrong and a poor political point to try to make. We have seen over the last 20 years a dramatic change in the way in which the Australian labour market works. A lot of the unskilled jobs, which young people are able to do, are now largely done by sophisticated equipment or by technology of one form or another. This is particularly true in clerical areas, retailing and other areas. There has been a marked shift away from the employment of young people in these areas.There are still clear areas where young people are preferred, such as apprenticeships, but they are now a relatively small area of the labour market for young people. Our position is distinct from the position which the coalition was happy to abide with, where seven in 10 young people-the coalition now profeSses to have an interest in those 15to 19-year olds-did not complete secondary school. In the 1980s the coalition was quite happy to stand up and say, 'Yes, seven in 10 of our young kids do not complete secondary school' and regarded that as a satisfactory outcome. A couple of weeks ago we had the honourable member for Bennelong pining over the loss of so-called untrained, dead-end jobs. In other words, that was the sort of position that the coalition had for young Australians-seven in 10 did not complete secondary school; it now.thinks it a pity that the dead-end jobs we used to have are not there now. That has not been our attitude. We have dramatically improved retention rates in schools so that now nearly eight in 10 children aged 15 to 19 complete schoolMr Reid interjecting",45
35,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Bendigo!,45
36,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and 35 to 40 per cent of that stream go into the additional places in tertiary education provided by the Government. A high proportion of the six out of 10 of those other people go into technical and further education, but that proportion is not high enough. That is why the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, myself and others are workir.g to try to bring about an improvement in the national technical and further education policy and system for Australia-a system of status which the conservatives never cared about. They would regard the TAFE system and kids going to TAFE as beneath their dignity. If they were not going to universities from their electorates they could not care less about them.

The Carmichael report and its very long run recommendations and the portents it holds for the labour market among young people over the long term are things which the Government will be working on at its meeting on youth and youth unemployment on 22 July-that is, three things: how to implement the Carmichael report, which proposes significant reform of entry level training arrangements; how to build a quality TAFE system which is responsive to the needs of young people, and also responsive to the needs of industry; and ways to create employment opportunities for young people, including on community, rural and environmental programs. Those are the things which the Government has focused on, as we have right from the inception of the Government's· period of officdn the early 1980s. We have focused on giving Australian kids a chance and not consigning them to the labour scrapheap of seven in 10 not completing secondary school and having no TAPE or adequate tertiary system to cascade into out of school. We have added 50 per cent of places to universities and we are now trying to radically alter the TAPE system. What interest did you take in that? None whatsoever.

Can the Treasurer tell the House the implications for Australia's inflation performance of the recent increases in State taxes and charges? Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.

54,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The Treasurer is entitled to answer a question about Government outlays.,47
55,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is the case that New South Wales and· Victoria announced increases in a range of taxes and charges before they had even left Canberra after the Premiers Conference. I think the conference provided a very fair outcome for the States and certainly did not justify their· imposing these increases, justified as they attempted to make them on the conclusions of that Premiers Conference. We are not responsible for the putting together of State Budgets; those State governments must take responsibility for their own actions. But we are concerned, understandably, about the inflationary impact. The way in which States make easy resort to these charges may help their Budgets, but at the same time it will have an effect on Australia's inflation rate. The charges announced by Victoria and New South Wales alone will add one-half of one per cent to Australia-wide CPI inflation through the course of 1992-93 and about three-quarters of one per cent to the inflation in those two States. If these increases were replicated in the other States and Territories, the total impact on Australia's inflation rate would be around three-quarters of one per cent. In the 12 months to March 1992, Australia recorded an inflation rate of only 1.7 per cent-the best inflation performance since the early 1960s. Our underlying rate of inflation is between 21/2 per cent and 3 per cent-the best result since this measure was first initiated during the early 1970s. Even more important than that, our inflation rate is now below that of our major trading partners, which is helping to improve our international competitiveness. That helps to underline the point that improved competitiveness is fundamental to sustained employment and economic growth in this country. These increases in taxes and charges obviously will not assist in that process. I think it is important to bear in mind the context in which these increases were made. There will be an increase in revenue to the States of almost 5 per cent of the financial assistance grants base, which is far in excess of the 2 per cent increase that the Premiers sought at the conference. Some of the Premiers sought a 2 per cent increase. They have imposed increases of 5 per cent. That means that iUs not possible by any stretch of the imagination to justify these increases on the outcome of the Premiers Conference. The $500m increase in funding-that is, - general revenue and hospital grants-provided by the Commonwealth stands in sharp contrast to the cuts the Opposition has in mind for State funding. The Opposition proposes to cut the funding to the States by $900m each year. In other words, rather than providing for a real increase in funding for the States, what the Opposition has in mind is a real reduction. If the States were to respond, as one might anticipate they would, by resorting to increases in taxes and charges, that would have a very significant and damaging effect on the inflation rate ·as a result of the Opposition's policies. That is in excess of the other direct inflationary impact of the introduction of a goods and services tax. In other words, if the Opposition were to impose the cuts it has in mind on the States, that would add an additional 11/2 per cent to inflation if, as we have seen on this occasion, the States were to respond to those cuts by increasing their own taxes and charges. This, of course, means that inflation under the Opposition's policies would increase by well over 6 per cent; in other words, by four times the level that it now is. This just underscores the point that the estimates have made about the impact on ordinary households in Australia, indicating that about 70 per cent of wage and salary earners and 60 per cent of the self-employed and farm householders would be worse off as a result of the Opposition's package. This does not even take into account the $6 1h billion expenditure cuts which the Opposition has in mind. When we add to that a 1112 per cent kick from inflation, we realise the dramatic, drastic and tragic impact that ordinary Australians would feel as a result of these proposed changes. It is not surprising, therefore, that we have seen the Opposition curiously silent, both on the outcome of the Premiers Conference and in terms of its response to the States in relation to State taxation. Not only does the Opposition know that, as a result of its policies, the States would get less, but also would anticipate that the States would resort to these inflationary taxes in order to make up the shortfall which would be visited upon them by a coalition government. That is why the Opposition is saying nothing-because it intends to further extend the damage of its policies on ordinary Australians. Youth Unemployment",47
56,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. If finding jobs for Mr Keating's army of unemployed youth is truly the Minister's top priority, why is it that the Minister directly responsible for unemployment could not even answer the most basic questions on the Sunday program last weekend on how the youth job summit would be run next month? More specifically, can the Minister explain why he did not know whether the summit would be public or private; why he did not know whether unemployed young people would be represented; and why he was still at odds with the Prime Minister over the key issue of whether unemployed young people would have a voice at the summit a full 24 hours after his embarrassing gaffes on the Sunday program? Lastly, why is the summit being held in Canberra? Why have the premiers of Queensland and Western Australia, to name two of them, been excluded?",48
57,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would have thought that much wisdom was imparted on that Sunday program, particularly in so far as 1 had occasion to comment on what the Opposition intended to do about unemployment. Mr Beale-What are you going to do?",48
58,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Mr BEAZLEY1 would have thought that the last thing the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would want to do was raise the notion of summits here. We have also had over the weekend the totally hilarious announcement from the Liberal Party that it is going to squash one day of the current agenda of its great talkfest in Sydney in another couple of weeks in order to be able to discuss, for the first time apparently, the issue of unemployment. The Opposition over the it course of the weekend actually discovered the issue of unemployment and thought it might be a nice thing to talk about at its national conference. Hitherto it had intended not to. We need not worry about too much of a constructive nature on the subject of unemployment emerging from this, if we go back to when this was first announced as the Liberal Party's intention for its next national conference, when a press release stated, 'The Liberal Party's Federal Director, Andrew Robb, said last night that policy debate would not be a big focus at the convention'. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, 1 raise a point of order understanding order 145, which pertains to relevance. 1 asked the Minister a very simple question about the arrangements for the youth job summit; he ought to answer the question.",48
59,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader asked a wide-ranging questionOpposition members-Oh!,48
60,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Minister should come back to the question. Honourable members on my left will cease interjecting.,48
61,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think I was asked about 12 questions, and it would be almost impossible not to be irrelevant answering those 12 questions. But I suppose what we would really like to know on that point about the Liberal Party's giant talkfest is how the unemployed are going to pay for the booths at $750, $2,500 or $10,000. I ask which of those booths will be intended for the unemployed when they attend the Liberal Party's conference, since the Opposition is so interested in knowing· what the unemployed wi1l have to ,..do when they attend ours. The fact of the matter is that the Prime Minister appropriately has announced the terms and operation of that summit. The Prime Minister has made clear, as I made clear on that Sunday program and subsequently, that this happens to be a conference about dealing with the problem-not a conference for grandstanding, not some bells and whistle occasion that we oblige people to pay $10,000 to turn up to listen to. We wiJ] have a conference, part of which at the outset be open. But because we are not interested in grandstanding it will then be getting the businessmen and those of us who have responsibility in this area to deal with the problems associated with youth unemployment, to roll up our sleeves, and not make our various partisan statements and our various political .statements about what it is that we intend to doMr Reith-Why are the Premiers excluded?",49

72,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order.,49
73,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The reason for that simply, old son, is that we had this discussion at the Premiers Conference and it was decided that those would be the Premiers attending. All the· Premiers, of course, at that particular Premiers Conference expressed their concerns at the level of unemployment, but they were obviously also not interested in seeing, this thing develop into what yours has so obviously developed into from the outset-some sort of talkfest. They were interested in a sensibly contained group of people actually sitting down there and prepared to deal with the problem. Tha,t is why, if you want to know the answers to particular questions on the Premiers, that is the case. Mr Reith-When did they tell you, Kim?",49
74,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,50
75,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Then if we proceed on what you propose as opposed to what we propose at this conference, you will take those people off unemployment benefits after nine months. In the restructuring process-and we will talk about restructuring at this conference-in our manufacturing industry, about which you talk, people are placed in a situation where, because efficiencies are received, they find themselves dropping out of employment. In that situation, they receive redundancy packages-some under awards, some under agreements. Your proposition is that until they have spent those redundancy packages they will not qualify for unemployment benefits. That is an interesting one. But you will have an opportunity to point it out to those very few people who will arrive at your conference, and that will be interesting for you. You will also have the opportunity to talk about the unemployment benefits which will emerge from a 15 per cent consumption tax. Mr Reith-Are you going to abolish payroll tax?",50
76,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And you are being deliberately very miserable.,50
77,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Minister will come to order. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will come to order as well. The Minister will answer the question.,50
78,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What you can see from that, as the Prime Minister said earlier on in answer to a question, is that we will talk about the thingsMr Reith-He is deliberately flouting your instructions, Mr Speaker. You should call him back to the subject.",50
79,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,50
80,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We will talk about the things that young people really need in this community. Mr Reith-How would you know?,50
81,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.,50
82,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They need the opportunity for access to training, which we have set the basis for in the policies that we have pursued over the last 10 years and which you would reduce and eliminate. We will also set the basis for training not only in terms of the Carmichael report but also in terms of opportunities provided in technical and further education. We will also be dealing with labour market programs as they apply to young people. Appropriately, this conference is being convened by the Prime Minister, and it incorporates a number of Ministers who have responsibility in the area of employment and 'industry amongst those who will be attending for the Government. It is a problem that this Government takes seriously and views as a responsibility imposed on all Ministers here. Mr Tim Fischer-Why in the cocoon of Canberra?",50

Mr Thckey-LOOk at the subsidy per litre.",50
90,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor will cease interjecting.,51
91,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is reported to be an industry of the order of $10 billion and an industry that will create literally thousands of jobs. If the Opposition wants to come into this chamberMr Beale-We have to come into the chamber,51
92,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Bruce will cease interjecting.,51
93,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and have as the major theme for Question Time the issue of jobs, then perhaps it ought to reconvene immediately after Question Time, consider the impact of the GST on alternative fuel pricing on the shale oil industry and change its position. If the Opposition does that it will see an industry develop. It is not only the shale oil industry that will be affected. The GST will have a quite adverse impact on the LPG industry-once again, an industry now employing literally thousands of people in this country, many of them dispersed through regional Australia, where unemployment is unfortunately being felt very strongly. The industry has contacted the Opposition, through the Leader of the National Party, and has entered into discussions with him in relation to the potential impact on that industry. We need go to no higher authority in relation to the adverse impacts of the Opposition package on the LPG industry than the honourable member for Mayo who, in his journey from shadow Minister for trade to shadow Minister for defence of the realm, was diverted. He turned the·guns on his own Party when he conceded publicly that 'anyone seeking to convert their motor vehicle to LPG under the· GST policy proposals would be crazy'. He is a great authority on this issue. Of course, anyone doing that would be crazy, but unfortunately it goes much further. A month or so ago a major Australian company had occasion to discuss with me a major project of nearly $100m to be developed in this country which was to do, of course, with an alternative energy source. I think most people in this House would concede not only the opportunity but also the need for this country to concentrate on trying to ensure a proper mix and a proper balance in its energy base. This company came to me and indicated that it was in a very advanced stage indeed in terms of this nearly $100m major project for an alternative fuel development and that its bankers were loath to provide the necessary funds given the uncertainty engendered for the industry by the GST policy package. The Leader of the National Party and I know that this company has raised the matter with him. The Leader of the National Party and I know that for reasons-and quite properly-of commercial confidentiality, I am not able to go into any greater detail. But the Leader of the National Party and I know that this major project will be stopped dead in its tracks unless this policy regime changes. The Leader of the Opposition comes into the chamber and talks about the issue of employment. I am telling the Opposition, not as an assertion but as a matter of fact, that if it changes the GST in terms of some of these impacts it will create jobs as of tomorrow. It is the uncertainty engendered by this mad policy that is leading to the 19S5 of job opportunities today in this country. But all is not lost, because the Opposition, with all of the consistency that it has shown in relation to this matter, is doing a back-flip. The Leader of the National Party has entertained discussions with industry---.:.and why would he not, because the industry has indicated that the Opposition would last '24 hours' if its policy were ever implemented? What is being discussed is just another aspect of the haemorrhaging of the Fightback package, the back-flip package. What is being discussed by the Leader of the National Party-I know not whether it is with the concurrence, implied or otherwise, of the Leader of the Oppo-ition-in the privacy of his room is a back-flip on this policy, one that, would you believe, will provide rebates for those who convert their motor vehicles. If that were to be the case it would, of course, represent another haemorrhaging of the Fightback package, the fiscal lack of integrity of the Fightback package. Moreover, and more importantly, it would not address the issue, because the problem for the industry is the price relativity problem that the Opposition has created. This is another example of where the Opposition, coming into this chamber and talking about jobs and its own policy prescriptions, is not theoretically or prospectively preventing jobs. Those opposite are stopping the jobs here now. Youth Unemployment",51
94,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is it a fact that the rate of youth unemployment in Australia is now over 34 per cent and that in Victoria it is over 46 per cent? Why has the Prime Minister falsely claimed that the rate of youth unemployment is only one in 10? Why does he insult the youth of Australia and their parents, who are trying to struggle through his recession, by telling them that they should get their problem into perspective? When will he apologise for these callous, insensitive and inaccurate remarks?",52
95,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The claims in the Leader of the Opposition's question are wrong. There are 122,000 young people looking for work in an age cohort of 1.3 million. That is just around 10 per cent. That is the position. But for the Leader of the Opposition to have the gall to try to suggest that the Government should operate a· policy response from a distortion run on the front page of the HeraldSun in Melbourne and to think that Government policy is going to be run off distortions is the joke of jokes. This may come as a piece of unhelpful information to the Leader of the Opposition but there were more people in this age cohort unemployed in 1982-83 than there are today-as a result of the policies which he had in place then. But, unemployed as they are, I have made it abundantly clear that the Government, and only the Government, is in a position to deal markedly with this problem. That is the whole point of the meeting on youth policy and employment-to get the breakthroughs in training, training wages and technical and further education which coalition governments were never interested in. Mr Costello-You are a broken record.",52
96,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member for Higgins! - Mr KEATING-Whether it is 10 per cent is im.material; it is still too high and we need to do something about it. But to go on with this sort of vindictive approach to these people, as though we want to try to stigmatise them as being a group who look at themselves as being 46 per cent unemployed-that is, saying to a group of 15to 19-year-olds that 46 per cent of them are out of work when it is not true-is to ruin optimism which they might have about training themselves and finding employment. This Government has always supported rational policy analysis on the facts. We are not going to take the facts to mean whatever comes off the top of the head of some subeditor at the Melbourne Herald-Sun, or any other newspaper, who wants to sensationalise and damn this group of young people to the pessimism of unemployment levels which do not obtain. We will have no bar of that whatsoever. So the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, other Ministers and I have been quite plain in making clear what the real position is. The real position is capable of having a material change effected to it-that is, the outcome of the Government's policy position coming to, and post, its meeting about youth, unemployment generally amongst the young people and youth prospects can materially alter the balance of employment opportunities for these people. You are up here asking questions about them when you were happy to leave seven in 10 not completing secondary school.",52

Now, as usual, it is us who have to try to fix up the TAFE system after you have run it for most of the post-war years-and run it by total neglect. We then have the Leader of the Opposition asking a·shabby question and trying to make a puny political point about statistics for a group which he has always callously disregarded. South Africa",53
104,Mr GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister inform the House of the Government's response to the recent tragic events in South Africa?,53
105,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On behalf of all Australians, I have to say we are appalled at the continuing violence in South Africa. On 17 June, 39 innocent people, including women and children, were massacred at the township of Boipatong. There were three further deaths and 20 casualties during President de Klerk's visit to the township on 20 June. To date, this sort of violence has cost the lives of more than 1,400 people this year. We believe it is essential that African Government do everything in its power to end the violence and bring those responsible to account. We are deeply concerned that the escalation of violence has now led to the ANC withdrawing from the Convention for a Democratic South Africa-Codesa-process and from bilateral talks with the South African Government. We hope that conditions can be created which will permit a return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and that all the progress which we have seen in South Africa to date will not be tragically lost. As the House will know, Australia has played a leading role within the Commonwealth in developing a sanctions policy towards South Africa. These recent events clearly demonstrate that our phased approach to lifting sanctions has been correct. The Government is currently consulting our Commonwealth partners and other concerned countries about our responses to these latest events. If the parties in South Africa wish it, Australia is ready to participate in an international observer or investigatory mechanism. The aim of such a mechanism would be to help restore confidence in the process of political dialogue between the parties and to discourage violence. Senator Gareth Evans has already discussed this possibility earlier today with his Canadian counterpart but, until we have consulted widely, it is premature to say precisely what the role of ·an international observer group might be or what Australia's contribution might be. We are aware of a call by Archbishop Tutu that the South African team should withdraw from the Barcelona Olympics if certain demands are not met. He has also raised the question of the Wallabies rugby union tour of South Africa planned for August. All I will say about that at this time is that the Government is keeping in close touch with other governments and Australian sporting bodies in relation to these issues. As I said on 22 June, it would be premature for us to take any final decisions until we see how the South African Government handles the the South situation in coming days. I I think the key to it is that the Government of South Africa do everything possible to end the violence and bring those responsible for the violence in Boipatong to account, that it reach a position where a resumption of bilateral talks occurs, that the process for democratic South Africa continue to be a process of viability and that the conditions be created which will permit a return to the negotiating table as soon as possible. That must be the reasonable and decent hope of every Australian. Youth Unemployment",53
106,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again directed to the Prime Minister and follows on from my last question about youth unemployment. I ask: does the Prime Minister also reject the Statistician's estimate that the overall unemployment rate is 10.6 per Is it really only about 5'h per cent, on the Prime Minister's basis?",54
107,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the end, that is drawing a totally irrational and illogical point. Opposition members-Ha, hal",54
108,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order.,54
109,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He thinks this defends the first squalid and irrational question. The fact is that there is no debate about· the unemployment rate of 10.6 per cent. That a matter of fact. It is also 122,000 young people, out of an age cohort of 1.3 million, are in the labour market looking for work. That is a fact. It may suit the Leader of the Opposition, who would prefer to frighten young people out of their wits, to damn in them any hope of finding job, and generally to do as he normally does: prey upon Australians, young and old, with his pessimism and gloom, hoping that it will $1,000 boxes? advance his miserable political cause. When the numbers come out the Leader of the Opposition always hopes that they will be higher. He wishes them to be the worse; he hopes for the best for himself. That is the basis of his utterances and his policy. As always in social policy, only the Labor Party will be in the position of changing things. This group-the 15to 19-year-oldsresorting has been neglected for years. The trend since the 1950s to mechanisation and comtax puterisation has changed the requirements untrained work in the labour market. It has shifted over time. Ignorance was total bliss the part of the coalition. Those opposite never cared about the change; they never planned position for it; they were quite happy to see these people go onto the labour scrap heap. These are the policies that have been pursued by the Opposition. Mr Bradford interjecting",54

By contrast, as the Minister for Employment, Education and Training said, the not jamboree the coalition is going to run was about selling the GST. In a classic stunt, overnight those opposite changed and said, a 'Oh no, we will devote some time to youth unemployment'. That is why we ask: where will they be?

In the jamboree the Leader of the Opwill cynically hold to sell that bill of goods, he has decided, in a classic stunt, that he will reserve a day for youth unemployment. As if anyone could hope for any sensible policy conclusion to come from that. The one group that can provide some of the policy change is the trade unions, the very group that those opposite will not speak to. Mr Tim Fischer-But that means that the ACTU is",54

The chances would be zero, as everyone in the House knows. Banking",55
119,Mr ELLIOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I direct my question to the Treasurer. Can he inform the House of the role played by the banking system in facilitating economic recovery? Is the role presently being performed by the banks?,55
120,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Tell us about your bucketing at the ABA dinner? ..,55
121,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition!,55
122,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the Leader of the Opposition says, I attended the annual dinner of the ABA in the presence of the honourable member for Parraniatta, the Leader of the National Party and the honourable member for Bonython-I beg your pardon; I mean the honourable member for Sturt; I was thinking of his middle name, I thinkMr Smith-Do you know him that well?",55
123,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, he keeps using' it. At that time. I did draw attention to the shortcomings of the banks, particularly as they attempt to repair their excesses of the 1980s. I do not think it is true to say, as the Opposition Leader contends, that I received a bucketing for my remarks. Indeed, there have been some events subsequently, of which he would not be aware, which would confound what the Opposition Leader has asserted here today. So perhaps once again he was wrongly advised .of the proceedings of that occasion by his coalition partner, the Leader of the National Party. There has been an essential transformation of the importance of banks in the financial system over the last 10 years. In 1983 the banks had but 53 per cent of the bank and non-bank financial system whereas now they have 70 per cent, which restores the position they had in the .early 1960s. The point is that the banks are an important part of the financial system, will play an important role in the operation of the economy and will play a crucial role in the development of the recovery as it proceeds. I was making the point to the banks that we saw them as having an important role. We wanted to ensure that they were in a position to perform that role. I underlined the changes that we made in the Prime Minister's February statement about improving the capacity of the banks to respond to the circumstances of businesses which were in difficult circumstances and which needed the help of the banks to work themselves out of their current position when they were basically viable but going through obviously difficult circumstances. I made. the point to the banks that it was not enough simply for them to offer concessions to new customers .or potential new customers while not extending the same kinds of conditions to some of their existing customers as well. So we see the banks as having an important role. We wish to support them in that role. But we are concerned about the very low growth in credit-a matter which the Governor of the Reserve Bank drew attention to just today in a speech he made in Townsville where he said, 'It is almost certainly the case that some bank managers are being excessively cautious notwithstanding head office condition after the directives' . So the banks have to understand that they have this role to play-I think they do appreciate it-but it is not enough simply for their chief executives and those who attend the ABA annual dinner to understand that; it is important for them to extend that message out into their branch network. I simply make the point that, as well as considering the· concerns of small business, they must also take into account the interests of the farming sector, because those in the fanning sector have been obviously affected by changes in world markets and changes brought about by drought in Australia. They need an opportunity to restore their positions to a state of health and they need the support and encouragement of the banks in that process. NA",55

125,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again directed to the Prime Minister. Is it a fact you made policy on the run about pay TV and airline privatisation without consulting your Minister for Transport and Communications? Is it a fact that you conjured up a job summit and announced several different TAFE policies without consulting your Minister for Employment, Education and Training? Is it a fact that you have now kidnapped the Aboriginal statement, against the wishes of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs? Is it a fact that this disorganisation and chaos surrounding you and your office is now crippling the processes of government, prompting your office to be described as a republican guard? I ask the Prime Minister when will he put the interests of the nation above his own political survival and restore a proper system of cabinet government to this country?",56
126,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Cabinet government like there was in the Leader of the Opposition's time? They walked in and got knocked over every day, he said in BRW:. 'We would walk in, Mr Howard and the advisers, with hopes high, to be knocked over by some anecdote that had come from the non-members bar the night before from the National Party. We could never get any of the Campbell report recommendations through, never get any structural change through; the processes of the Fraser Government had broken down'. That is what he said. This Government is now working on the problems which he left behind, including a regulated two-airline system. The gall of you! In the three weeks before the 1983 election, after the writs had been issued, you signed the two-airline agreement up for nearly a decade so that, to open up the Australian skies with the proper interface between international and domestic carriage, we had to wait until that period expired and then make the policy changes in matters which have been matters of great debate in the Cabinet of this Government over a long period. Those matters covered airline deregulation and the various phases of deregulation and changes, including those changes which were promoted by the then Minister for Transport, Mr Beazley, at our national conference, concerning the sale of half of Qantas and 100 per cent of that Australian. Cabinet knows the issues back to front. That is why we were able to bring the policy on quickly following the changes forecast in One Nation. That is called leadership and action.",56

131,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"for some Country Party anecdote to come from the non-members bar before any policy can be changed is not the way we work, thank you. As far as television and the other media are concerned, almost everyone on this side of the House is a full expert in television and media policy. You ask them, and they will tell you. The fact is, they are. On an issue on which members of the Government have sat on select committees or been involved in broad inquiry and consultation about media policy, and having lived through the most dramatic changes in the opening up of television and broadcasting opportunities in this country, and now lately with pay TV, of course the Government in its entirety-its back bench, its negotiating committee and its Cabinet-has been able to make decisions quickly and rapidly, knowing all the issues. Imagine trying to take the dullards opposite through pay TV. Imagine them with their blank stares as we went through the technological issues involved in pay television. The funniest part of the question concerns how we decided to hold a youth summit. I have been having discussions about this with members of the Australian business community for months. Dr Bob Woods-But not Kim. What about Kim?",56
132,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My colleague has been having such discussions for longer than I have. That is why he made the Carmichael report one of the things which he knew would change the nature of the labour market for young people, and that is why the meeting we are having now is a natural outcome of those discussions. Mr Costello interjecting",57
133,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the honourable member for Higgins.,57
134,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The policy on the run stunt of those opposite is to tum the jamboree in Sydney on the GST into a youth summit. There is no forethought, no discussion, no consultation, no policy-just a stunt; a publicised, open stunt. As if those people ever cared about 15to 19-year-olds, or ever had the compassion and decency to formulate a bit of decent policy for them. How could it be said that this Government, which has now changed and will change forever the airline system of Australia and television and broadcasting ways of Australia, should go back to the Opposition's sloth and take that as an example-being run by bureaucrats, as it always was? The honourable member for Bennelong will not mind me telling a classic story-it is against him, but it is not a harmful one. Apparently in the preparation of Budget Statement No. 2 in 1982-the text on the economy past and present-the then Treasurer said to the Secretary of the Treasury, 'How is statement 2 going, John'? 'Quite well, Treasurer. I think you will see that we have done a workmanlike jOlJ, and when you see it you will be proud of it'. 'Good. Thank you, John'. That was Statement No. 2 from the Treasury. That is what we have never done here. The bureaucrats just gave Ministers in the then Government the papers: 'Here you are, you ninnies; here are the papers'. 'Thank you very much. Where is the recommendation?'. They would read that and then it was back to the white car and back to the office-and that is what the Opposition calls governing Australia. That is not the way we have done it. One of the claims by some of the pointy people is that I rewrote parts of Statement No.2. Too right I have.",57

139,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Leaving it to the dullards of the Liberal Party, the laggards who watched Australia slip into the status of an industrial museum, while the bureaucracy had no political authority for change, is just what Australia does not need at this time. Aged and Sole Parent Pensions",57
140,Mr GIBSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. Can the the Minister advise what the Government is doing to reduce the costs to the public purse of expenditure on age and sole parent pensions?,57
141,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Moreton for that question, particularly as it refers to two areas-sole parent pensions and age pensions-where I think the Government by a combination of humane provision, proper targeting and getting the right incentives can be very proud of its achievement of reform. I will discuss the sole parent's pension first. Here the Government has implemented a number of sensitive and constructive proposals to get sole parents back into the work force and to enhance their life opportunities. A report came down in the Senate today on the jobs, education and training scheme, the JET scheme-the evaluation report-which I think points out the achievements of that scheme, supported widely by clients, employers and community groups. In the years since 1989, when the JET scheme was implemented, 80,000 clients have made use of it-a very good response. Looking at the results in December 1991, we see that 25 per cent of JET clients were declaring earnings compared with only 11 per cent of them declaring earnings prior to getting on to that scheme. Remember that that doubling of the number has occurred in a very difficult job market. The job market situation for sole parents is a very difficult one, but the scheme has resulted in a doubling of declarations of earnings from that group. Those kinds of sensitive and constructive policies are a very stark contrast to what we are offered from the Opposition in this area. Its proposal for sole parents is to cut sole parents off the pension when their youngest child turns 12. That is, some 30,000 sole parents will be, on the whole, simply shifted across to unemployment benefits. Last week the Leader of the Opposition spoke at the Castlemaine Club luncheon in Brisbane and said of that decision, 'It's a simple choice'. Let me ten the Opposition that it is only a simple choice if it is prepared to pander to cheap public prejudice about sole parents-to that shabby stereotype that nearly an sole parents are young, unmarried women having children to get onto social security. If one looks at the facts, one finds that it not a simple choice. Eighty per cent of sole parents have either been married or lived in recognised de facto relationships. Some 2,000 or 3,000 of those sole parent pensioners are widows or widowers. It does not become a simple choice once one looks at the hard facts. But of course the level of social thinking from the Opposition on this issue is reOected by a previous shadow spokesman for social security who said that it was a good idea for sole parents to get into the work force because they might manage to find a partner. That is the level and depth of social thinking involved. Turning to the aged, the previous shadow Minister for social security was speculating in the Senate last week on how it would be possible to control the rising cost of age pensions. This is Senator Alston's speculation: The pace of technological change is ever-accelerating. Who knows? It could be anything from euthanasia to dramatic reforms in bio-technology . . . I am saying that there will be so many technological changes in bio-technology that we may well find that the cost of maintaining the elderly is actually a great deal cheaper than it is today. That is social engineering according to the Liberal Opposition. I have to ten the Leader of the Opposition that he has a lot of loose cannon rolling around that sinking Fightback deck, and Alston's view is typical: The pace of technological change is ever-accelerating. Who knows? It could be anything from euthanasia to dramatic reforms in bio-technology ...",57

145,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let us contrast that speculation with what this Government has done again by increasing the incentives for self-provision and targeting resources to those most in need. The result of those policies is that we have increased the age pension, the basic pension, to above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, as we promised. That is represents, in real terms, an increase of over 13 per cent in the age pension. We have reformed the taxation area so that no pensioner on the basic rate or, even now, up to the free area pays any tax. We have extended pharmaceutical benefits to an pensioners. In rent assistance, which is an obvious source of poverty for some old people, there have been massive increases. We have given stability to the pension through not only the standard indexation but also by indexing fringe benefit limits and indexing the free area limitstrying to provide the kind of stability that people want in their old age. All I ask the Australian people to do is to think of the contrast between what we have achieved, what we have done, with the speculations of the Liberal Opposition.",58

149,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"by leave-On 26 February, I presented the One Nation statement. In it, I announced measures to help close the gaps which for so long have separated Australians. I said then that all our efforts should go towards uniting the country. I also said we should combine a more efficient economy with a fairer and more equitable society. . On 27 May this year it was the twenty-fifth anniversary of the 1967 referendum to give the Commonwealth the power to legislate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. On that occasion I said that, as a nation, we have not yet succeeded in meeting the challenge set by the triumphant referendum result. Today, there is no more central issue to our national identity and self-esteem than the injustices brought home to us all by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. There is nothing more central to our reputation in the world or to the kind of democratic, just society to which we aspire. The needs are clear. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have about half the average yearly income of other Australians. Participation by Aboriginal young people in post-school education is around a fifth of the rate for non-Aboriginal young people. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in all age groups have mortality rates almost three times higher than for the overall population. The custody rate of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is 29 times that of the general community. These few statistics give some idea of what the Royal Commission called 'the disadvantaged and unequal position' of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in all aspects of Australian society. The Commonwealth sees the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody as a national opportunity for genuine change in the lives of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. On behalf of the Government, I would like to say again how much we appreciate the work of the royal commissioners and their staff. Their work documented a tragic waste of life. The Royal Commission investigated the deaths of 99 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in custody. But at least 30 more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have died in custody since the Royal Commission finished its investigations. I know that nothing can remove the grief, anger and loss felt by the families, relatives and friends of those who died. But it is fundamentality important that the Royal Commission found the real killer. The responsibility lies in large measure with entrenched, institutionalised racism and discrimination. Those who died were victims of over two centuries of dispossession, prejudice and neglect. We cannot evade these harsh truths. Nor should we. But we can work to change them. On 31 March this year, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) tabled responses by the Commonwealth and all mainland State and Territory governments to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. This kind of cooperation is a truly national achievement, crossing boundaries of jurisdiction and politics. Its importance cannot be minimised. In our response to the Royal Commission, the Commonwealth supported all but one of the Royal Commission's recommendations. We allocated $15Om over five years for law and justice initiatives and to assist Aboriginal and ToI1;'ci> Strait Islander people in their own efforts to overcome alcohol and substance abuse. Today I am proud to announce the second stage of the Commonwealth's response-a concerted attack on the economic and social disadvantage, which is reflected nowhere more starkly than in the numbers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in custody, and a renewal of our commitment to empower Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. These measures entail an additional $25Om over five years, taking the total Commonwealth expenditure in response to the Royal Commission, over five years, to $400m. In difficult times, this level of funds is not easy to find. But the need must be faced. The Royal Commission's report described the efforts, initiatives and dedication of Aboriginal people and communities and organisations across Australia to protect their culture, restore self-esteem and achieve real equality. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are taking control of their lives and their communities. They are demonstrating the will for renewal and for self-determination. Today the Government reaffirms its.support for these Australians. The concepts 'self determination' and 'renewal' are increasingly a reality. The structures are there to ensure both their effect and their survival. Elected commissioners of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission now make national decisions in Aboriginal affairs. Sixty elected regional councils now make decisions on priorities, needs and funding for their areas. The knowledge and expertise of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations are now vital in developing and delivering important Commonwealth programs and services. From the beginning, the ATSIC commissioners had a major role in shaping the responses by governments to the Royal Commission. I would like to take this opportunity to express the Commonwealth's gratitude to the Chairperson of ATSIC, Miss Lois O'Donoghue, and to the commissioners for their dedication. I should particularly like to thank the commissioners and regional councillors of ATSIC for their efforts over many months of consultations and negotiations to ensure the best possible responses by governments to the Royal Commission. The ATSIC commissioners were closely involved in developing the measures I am announCing today and endorsed this package of measures before it was considered by Cabinet. I should also like to recognise the energy and dedication of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. His contribution has been extraordinarily valuable and, indeed, central in responding to the Royal Commission. The initiatives I announce today constitute a renewed attack on economic and social disadvantages among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. These are initiatives with a difference in that they are firmly based on the notions of empowerment and self determination. No real change is possible without the energy and will of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves. We know from the past that imposed solutions will not work. This has been the fundamental flaw in many previous, well-intentioned policies. We are focusing on the future-on economic development and on Aboriginal young people. We are working for increased income in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and organisations, thus reducing dependence. We have balanced this strong emphasis on economic development with equally strong initiatives. in social and cultural self-determination. These initiatives will mean more jobs, enterprise opportunities and more training for Aboriginal people. They will raise community and individual incomes. They will improve community living standards. They will increase community self-reliance. They will address the needs so clearly set out in the Royal Commission's report. I tum now to the detailed economic development aspects of this package. Sixty million dollars over five years will be provided for a land acquisition and development program. It will provide the capital resources and training for better use and sustainable development of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander land. The amount of $6.6m over the next three years will be directed to an Aboriginal rural resources program to encourage enterprise, particularly in managing pastoral properties. A community economic initiative scheme, costing $23.3m over five years, will foster local enterprises. The Australian national parks and wildlife contract employment program for managing natural and cultural resources will be expanded at a cost of $1O.6m over five years. ATSIC will develop long term Aboriginal industry strategies in the pastoral, arts and tourism industries. Fifteen million dollars over five years will be provided for these strategies to draw together and build on existing initiatives. The community development employment program will be expanded at a cost of $43.9m over five years- This will ensure an increased emphasis on income generation and will enable CDEP to better meet the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and young people. A young people's employment program will be established at a cost of $21.9m to provide work placements largely within Aboriginal organisations and linked to TAFE training. The total cost of these economic development initiatives is $181.1m over five years. They will make a difference because they are different. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will shape and control them. Mr Deputy Speaker, I now tum to the youth aspects of the package. A young people's . development program will be established, at a cost of $23m over five years, to encourage planned community action to meet the specific needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people. We will set up an Aboriginal youth sport and recreation development program at a cost of $9m over five years. This initiative will provide Aboriginal sports development officers to work in communities. 1\venty million dollars over five years will be provided for 200 additional Aboriginal education workers from 1993. Ten million dollars will be provided for 600 more preschool places for Aboriginal children from 1994. We will also work for better Aboriginal access to preschools. These measures respond directly to the strong views of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that their children are their future. Australians can understand and share this view. We will also provide $6.9m over five years for measures to improve cooperation between the Commonwealth, States and Territories and to assist them to monitor initiatives arising from the Royal Commission. We have already announced that ATSIC will monitor progress by governments in implementing the Royal Commission's recommendations. These processes will be public and will continue our commitment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participation. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will also report annually on the human rights situation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia. The Commonwealth Government cannot, alone, eliminate the disadvantage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Aboriginal affairs is the concern of all Australians and their governments. For real change, Commonwealth, State, Territory and local governments must work together with Aboriginal communities and organisations. We are making progress. On 11 May, heads of government endorsed a framework for intergovernmental cooperation in Aboriginal affairs. The Commonwealth is working with State, Territory and local governments to put this cooperative framework into action. We will develop, with the States and Territories, a national Aboriginal policy statement and negotiate joint responsibility agreements in specific areas. These arrangements will take some time to put in place. However, our discussions with the States, Territories and. local government on the response to the Royal Commission have emphasised the need for real cooperative planning and delivery. Among the measures I have announced today, the rural resources, Australian National Parks and Wildlife contract employment, sport and recreation and education initiatives all involve funding or delivery through the States and Territories. Local government is also actively involved.in the intergovernmental cooperative framework now accepted by All heads of government. It would confer a great advantage on our efforts if local government were to actively participate in our initiatives. We will continue to encourage practical cooperation between local government and Aboriginal communities and organisationsparticularly the 60 ATSIC regional councils across Australia. Last year, by Act of parliament supported by all political parties, we established the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. In itself, this is evidence of the desire for justice among Australians. I have great faith in the Council and its Chairperson, former Royal  Council offers Australia its greatest chance of learning that there is no true loyalty or affection for this country that does not include respect for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. Mr Deputy Speaker, these issues are central to our nation and its future. They are also urgent. As a nation, we face the challenge of the consequences of dispossession, conquest, brutal treatment and equally inhuman neglect of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people-the first Australians. As I have said more than once in recent months, in this last decade of the twentieth century there is no greater goal for Australians than the delivery of long overdue justice to Aboriginal people. The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody reminded us of that. This year should be the turning point: the year when as a people we decide that if we are to be truly one nation, true to our traditions and ideals, then by the year 2000 justice will have been delivered, and the shame removed. I present the following paper: Commonwealth Response to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody-Ministerial Statement, 24 June 1992. Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Motion (by Mr Beazley)-by leaveagreed to. That so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition speaking for a period not exceeding 16 minutes.",60
150,Dr HEWSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"I welcome the chance to respond to the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). It gives me the opportunity to outline the coalition's response to the report by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and to address some wider issues affecting the well-being of the Aboriginal community. I would, however, like to express my disappointment at the decision of the Prime Minister not to provide me with a copy of this statement until just over one hour before Question Time today, particularly on such an important issue as the one we are addressing. It is a pity that the goodwill that was built up over nearly two years with former Prime Minister Hawke's office on matters pertaining to Aboriginal affairs seems to have been replaced by petty politicking on the part of the current Prime Minister. Today is another example of the Prime Minister's dictatorial approach to government. Apparently the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) was not even involved in preparing the Prime Minister's statement. He knew little or nothing of what the Prime Minister was going to say. He now joins other Ministers"" supposedly responsible for aviation, telecommunicationsMr Snowdon-What sort of statement is this? Shame on you!",64

155,Dr HEWSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"It is only a matter of time before other Ministers are excluded from their proper role in the policy process. One Nation, all right; one job and now one office run by one desperate man and his republican guard. Let me first state that I believe the work and the findings of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody are a major watershed in Aboriginal affairs in Australia. It is true that many of us on this side of the House had very grave reservations about the effectiveness of the Commission when it was first established in October 1987. There is no denying that it was an expensive exercise. In the end it cost over $30m. Yet when we read some parts of the report and pay particular attention to Commissioner Johnston's insights, we begin to accept that $30m was a worthwhile price to pay. Mr Bevis-Was it worth it? Was it a worthwhile cost?",64
156,Dr HEWSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"Have you got it, you turkeys? The following quote from Commissioner Johnston sums up the enormous task that confronted those who worked on the Commission: I say very frankly that when I started upon my work in this commission, I had some knowledge of the way broad policy had evolved to the detriment of Aboriginal people and some idea of the consequences. But until I examined the files of the people who died and the other material which has come before the Commission and listened to Aboriginal people speaking, I had no conception of the degree of pin-pricking domination, abuse of personal power, utter paternalism, open contempt and total indifference with which so many Aboriginal people were visited on a day to day basis. It's hard to convey the understanding, because each particular story takes time and space . to tell. Mr Snowdon-And they still are.",64
157,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,Order! The honourable member for the Northern Territory should not interject.,65
158,Dr HEWSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will excuse the monumental hypocrisy of the other side. The Commission's exhaustive analysis is not just of events that led to the 99 deaths in custody. is also a genuine attempt to recommend real solutions to what are now deep-seated social and economic problems affecting the been Aboriginal community. In both respects it has laid the foundation for building a better Australia for Aboriginal people. The report has also shown us that there considerable agreement nationwide as to the way forward. The· coalition's overriding concern is to ensure that all factors leading the 99 deaths in custody are fully and quately addressed. The law and justice and alcohol abuse sections of the report, to which the Government responded in Parliament in March of this year, recommended a raft of solutions relating to improved Aboriginal police relations, improved custody and legal service procedures and enhanced awareness of Aboriginal history, culture and disadvantage by those dealing with Aboriginal lawbreakers. In responding to that section of the report, the Government committed $150m over five years to implement the necessary reforms in those areas. The coalition supNorthern ported that decision and in government will carry through with that commitment. Similarly, the additional expenditure compeople mitted today by the Prime Minister dealing with programs relating to education, training respect. and employment is supported in principle by the coalition. We do not begrudge this money being spent to enhance the employment and education prospects of the Aboriginal people, but we will be particularly concerned to ensure-as the Government does not seem to care-that such money is well spent and it will produce practical and lasting Australia, improvements for Aboriginal people. Unfortunately, past experience gives us little cause for confidence in that regard. example, I have often emphasised that better structures and procedures in the admale ministration of Aboriginal .affairs are needed to effectively achieve the desired outcomes. As I said in my speech commemorating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the 1967 referendum, the Australian community has literally waged war on Aboriginal disadvantage. Commonwealth spending in 1970 was the approximately $5Om. Today, it approaches It $1.2 billion. There is no denying, of course, that there has been some real progress and that in some areas some of that money has well targeted. Twenty years ago, there were just 72 Aborigines attending university. Now that figure is closer to 4,000. Twenty years ago, 67 per cent of Aboriginal families is were classed as very poor. Today that figure has fallen to 43 per cent although, disturbingly, a large additional percentage is now to described as rather poor. Yet if this adeimprovement has led to increased welfare dependence, rather than real improvements in the standards of living for Aboriginal people, it has to be said that little real progress has been made over the past two decades for the great majority of Aborigines. It is also worth noting that, in some parts of Australia where there has been real progress, it has been despite government rather than . because of government. As Charles Perkins would say, 'They got tired of waiting and did it themselves'. Daly River, Robinson River, Wallace Rock Hole and Bathurst Island in the Territory and Port Lincoln in South Australia are just a few of the communities which have done the hard work and whose are now reaping the social rewards, as well as regaining their dignity and their selfYet in so many other areas of Aboriginal life, little or no real progress has been made. The Prime Minister referred specifically to some of these areas in his remarks today. Yet there are many more. I just give the House a couple of examples. The state of Aboriginal that health is a national disgrace. Today in Aboriginal male life expectancy is 17 to 18 years less than for the general population. In parts of Australia, life expecFor tancy is actually decreasing. In central Australia, the life expectancy for an adult is just over 40 years of age-this at a time when Aboriginal infant mortality is steadily improving. Another example is the problem of sexually transmitted diseases in many remote parts of Aboriginal Australia. It is an endemic problem, with up to 40 per cent of all Aborigines affected and with the potential for AIDS. This is a catastrophe waiting to happen. Where are these and other problems addressed in the Prime Minister's statement today? Action must be taken soon to address the most serious of the threats to the Aboriginal community. It is why we, in government, will redirect, for example, a substantial portion of current AIDS funding to assist the Aboriginal community to deal with that particular problem. More broadly, Aboriginal education, literacy, housing and employment opportunities still fall. well short of what a country like Australia should be able to deliver to its indigenous peoples. In the area of Aboriginal employment, the unemployment rate has increased. It went from 18.8 per cent in 1976 to 24.7 per cent in 1981 and 35.3 per cent in 1986. Today it hovers somewhere around the 40 to 50 per cent mark. Only 2 to 3 per cent of Aborigines are self-employed, compared with 15 per cent for the rest of the population. There is absolutely no effective program in operation now which encourages and assists Aborigines to enter businesses for themselves. What all this shows is that we continue to fall short of the standards set by governments and expected by Aborigines. Countless well-meaning programs devised by countless well-meaning Ministers and bureaucrats may well have given them a warm inner glow, but they have often led nowhere or, even worse, cruelly raised expectations only to dash them subsequently. My concern is that the Prime Minister seems to believe that another $50m per year over the next five years on top of the ready $1,150m that is already spent per year on Aboriginal assistance will make the difference between success and failure. Quite clearly it will not. When we talk of the failures in Aboriginal affairs the tendency is invariably to lay the blame at somebody's feet, and often there. is a tendency to begin by blaming the Aborigines themselves. Quite frankly, until Canberra and the well-meaning bureaucrats get out of the way of the Aboriginal people and give them greater scope to chart their own course, they will have little cause to thank us. The simple fact is that the Aboriginal people want to be more responsible for themselves as individuals and collectively. They want to share in an expanding economy which this Government has failed to deliver. They, perhaps more than any other group in this country, cannot understand why, in a country that is so wealthy and well placed as Australia, they have been allowed to fall, or have been pushed, so far off the pace. The Prime Minister talked today of creating jobs for Aboriginal people and of creating economic independence. But his only answer has been to offer more money, with little improvement in the effectiveness of its delivery or in accountability. There are, of course, many other ways and more immediate ways to give Aboriginal people a better chance to make it on their own. For example, why will the Prime Minister not agree to the mining of Coronation Hill and let the Jawoyn people get on with their own lives? Why will he not let Aboriginal people negotiate directly with the mining companies? Is the Prime Minister seriously saying that Aboriginal people are incapable of doing so? Is he saying that they have to be protected by two central land councils which put political interests ahead of those of the Aboriginal people? Two weeks ago I met with a group of senior Aboriginal elders from central Australia who were, without exaggeration, desperate to negotiate directly with the mining companies but were denied that right by the power of the land councils. Empowering the Aboriginal people to do that will deliver more economic independence than any quick-fix job creation program one would care to mention. A few years ago, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait.Islander Commission-ATSIC-was set up with the aim of giving Aboriginal people a greater say in the decision making process. Yet, despite all of ATSIC's good intentions and devoted workers, the fact is that, in its current form, ATSIC has failed the Aboriginal people. It has failed them principally for two reasons: firstly, it remains predominantly a Canberra based operation, with 88c in every dollar still being decided by Canberra; and, secondly, it has an incredibly unwieldy structure of 60 regional councils and 850 regional councillors which has yet to produce the outcomes we were all promised. In all of the present ATSIC structure, where is the accountability and where is the performance? Where are the benchmarks against which to measure the desired improvements in Aboriginal health, housing, education and employment opportunities? Where are the deadlines against which these performances can be assessed? The long term success of ATSIC is vitally dependent on accountability as to how the money is spent and upon how Aboriginal organisations and programs are monitored. We are still a long way short of attaining·that success. For example, Aboriginal programs run by DEET are in a mess. Successive Auditor General's reports have highlighted a number of DEET inefficiencies-insufficient verification checks for applications, total lack of coordination with other departments, and no procedures to avoid duplication of benefits. A recent Auditor-General's report stated that auditing was not undertaken in relation to $80m of expenditure under Aboriginal education supplementary assistance because auditing had revealed that departmental records were not adequate to determine whether payments were accurate. In DEET's own words: Sufficient documentary evidence was unable to be located to support the expenditure relating to program. There are countless other examples over the years of shoddy management and administration of programs for the Aboriginal people. Promises are made that things will change, but little ever happens. Not only is maladministration wasting taxpayers' money and building unnecessary duplication of services, but also, and most importantly, it is denying economic and social opportunities to the Aboriginal people-the very thing ATSIC set out to achieve. There are some 1,300 to 1.,400 organisations involved in the delivery of Aboriginal assistance. Even in the State of Victoria, for example, there are something like 174 organisations for just over 12,000 Aboriginal people; that is, one organisation for every 74 Aboriginal people! Clearly, things have got to change. The coalition's policy on the administration of ATSIC and Aboriginal affairs, like our support for the process of reconciliation, will continue to be squarely aimed at improving the well-being of the Aboriginal people. Our priority is to help them break out of welfare dependency. The Aboriginal people themselves will tell us that this dependency is slowly killing them and their culture. Politicians and bureaucrats should be listening more closely to what the Aboriginal people have to say. It is essential that we restore self-reliance and self-respect to the Aborigjnal people. Those politicians who think solutions to Aboriginal problems are to be found simply by throwing more money at them are deluding themselves and selling the Aboriginal people short. Compassion should not be measured by the size of a government's chequebook. When I see the social devastation and the Third World environment that many of our Aboriginal people are still living in, despite the amount of money spent, I feel saddened and ashamed. I feel sad for them, and ashamed that we in the wider community have failed to do it significantly better. Adopting the spirit of the recommendations of the report into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody gives us a real chance to finally start to get it right, not only in the way black and white this Australians treat each other, but also in the way Aboriginal affairs are conducted in the wider community. The coalition will be releasing a major policy document on the administration of ATSIC and Aboriginal affairs at the end of this week. This will have as its centrepiece the decentralisation of ATSIC's decision making processes; a national funding model which will allocate funds to regions based on criteria, such as capacity to use the funds effectively and efficiently, regional need and a level of disadvantage; and a greater planning and budgetary role for the regional councils",65
159,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,Order! The Leader of the Opposition's time has expired. A motion needs to be moved for a further suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders. Mr Downer-I move: That so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition speaking for a further five minutes.,68
160,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"Is the motion seconded? Mr Carlton-I second the motion. Question resolved in the affirmative, with an absolute majority.",68
161,Dr HEWSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"The policy also includes tighter accountability provisions for ATSIC and Aboriginal organisations that will ensure benefits reach those who need them most, and a more community based focus in the delivery of programs which aim to place more responsibility in the hands of the individual. We will also support ATSIC in its move to seek bilateral joint responsibility with State and Territory governments. In this way we can ensure that State, Territory and local governments can take a greater role in managing the delivery of essential services to Aboriginal citizens. We believe this policy will deliver the best chance for economic independence to the Aboriginal people and offer a viable alternative to a life of endless dole"" cheques and other forms of assistance from governmentS. Our policy documentation has been the outcome of months of extensive nationwide consultation with Aboriginal people and organisations. ATSIC itself has been involved in this process. Indeed, all 860 regional councillors were contacted during the formulation of our policy. Our policy is designed to address the core of the administrative problem in relation to Aboriginal affairs and to deliver a system in which government expenditure can achieve maximum results to the benefit of the Aboriginal people. If economic independence can at last. be given to the Aboriginal community, then we can begin to address those other problems that have divided sections of black and white Australia and have led to the continued mistreatment, abuse, discrimination and racial violence which many Aboriginal Australians experience daily. But it has to be a national effort. No longer can we accept mediocre results in Aboriginal affairs. Only when we genuinely equip Aboriginal people for an independent economic future will black and white Australians be able to work together as friends, as equals, and with mutual respect towards our common future. Debate (on motion by Mr Tickner) adjourned. NA Unemployment",68
162,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The inability of the Government to address with meaningful and detailed policies the plight of all the unemployed of Australia. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",68
163,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"1\vo weeks ago we saw the release of labour force statistics that finally exposed the complete bankruptcy of this Federal Government's term of office and its fundamental failure to come to grips with the challenges that face Australia in the coming years. If the figure for total unemployment in Australia of 10.6 per cent was not bad enough, the figure for young Australians was so stark and so chilling as to finally put to rest any debate about the direction in which Australia is heading. In my home State of Victoria over 46 per cent of the kids aged between 15 and 19 who want a job are unemployed. In South Australia, that other great Labor economic miracle, 45 per cent of young kids who want a job cannot find one. This figure for youth unemployment has to be put in context.· It is seasonally adjusted and it reflects the very tight definition of unemployment used in labour force surveys. . If we compare that figure with that for unemployment at the height of the Oreat Depression, we get some idea of the magnitude of the problem facing us. In 1933 there was a census which surveyed the whole population. The definition of unemployment was very loose. It was one of selfidentification; one was unemployed if one considered oneself to be so. In spite of this loose definition, which would tend to overstate the case, about 20.8 per cent of Australians were unemployed. Youth unemployment and adult unemployment were practically identical. Sixty years later, adult uriemployment 10.6 per cent and youth unemployment at 34.1 per cent-between three and four times the size of adult unemployment. So the last time Australia faced a catastrophe like this young people were hit just as hard and in the same way as the rest of the population. Today they are being hit three to four times as hard. I mentioned these comments on radio the other day and they were followed up by a person from the Australian Labor Party who said that the Depression figures had stated the case. That is simply and basically wrong; if anything, they overstated the difference. There could not be a greater example of the need to fundamentally rethink the way we do things in this country than the way that unemployed young people are being left out of the opportunity to work. The figure of 34.1 per cent understates the problem. It does not count people working even one hour a week. It does not count people who have given up. It does not count people doing six-week mickey mouse training courses at TAPE that will lead them nowhere and qualify them for nothing. It does not count kids who have stayed on at school or at uni because they cannot find a job. The number of students drawing Austudy has increased nearly 100 per cent in the last two years. It is not just kids who have been left out of this. The figures for long term unemployment are also revealing. At the 1988 Labor Party conference in Hobart the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) chastised George Campbell for having 100,000 dead men around his neck-the result of those workers who had lost their jobs in the metal unions campaign of 1981-82. In the last two years, the number of unemployed in this country has gone· up from 512,000 to 905,000-that is 393,000 dead men hanging around the neck of the Prime Minister. That is why there is such a stench from this Government-the very stench of dead men and the stench of a decaying government; four George Campbells to make one Paul Keating. The long term unemployed have become a greater percentage of a rapidly rising figure. Two years ago, 125,000 people were is at unemployed for more than 12 months. That was under 23 per cent of the total. Today, 306,000 of those 905,000 have been unemployed for more than 12 months; that is fully over one-third of the total number of long term unemployed people. So, of those 393,000 dead men around the Prime Minister's neck, 181,000 have been unemployed for more than 12 months. These long term unemployed face a very bleak future. A paper by Bruce Chapman of the ANU, released earlier this year, states: The current state of the Australian labour market augurs poorly for those already disadvantaged in the labour force of which there are and continue to be very many. Our-estimates and projections imply strongly the number of long term unemployed will be by a large margin at unprecedented and still growing levels over the next two years. There is not now any chance of avoiding this situation. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training admitted this at the National Press Club earlier this year and said that the Government had concerns in the area. Three months later we have seen nothing to address those concerns. What we are talking about is a figure for long term unemployed that is well above 300,000 and goes well into the 1990s. What was the Minister's response to this? To try to compare it to the last recession. That hardly bears any scrutiny. In the last recession the number of long term unemployed peaked at around 190,000. Today, the number of long term unemployed has not yet peaked and is already over 300,000. The extra number of long term unemployed in the last two years is nearly equal to the entire number of long term unemployed 10 years ago. Unemployment affects older Australians disproportionately. If one looks at the per, centage of total unemployment in each age category for people who have been unemployed for more than 52 weeks, one sees that nearly two-thirds of those unemployed and aged between 60 and 64 have been unemployed for more than 12 months and nearly half those unemployed and aged between 45 and 60 have been unemployed for 12 months. Breadwinners, heads of households, are on the scrap heap of long term unemployment. Those figures are stark enough, but in the end they are just figures. What they do is translate themselves into the human face and the human tragedy that Australia is facing. They translate themselves into crime, suicide, homelessness and drugs. These are the things of which the Government can be proud! I will take them one by one. Last week the Chief Commissioner in Victoria, Kel Glare, said publicly that he feared that the young long term unemployed could become unemployable and form a disenfranchised underclass. In the past 10 years, the number of break-ins went up by 50 per cent-930 a day; serious assaults, 140 per cent; stealing, 69 per cent; and fraud, 110 cent. Using court statistical data, it can be seen that youth violence has increased, youth gang activity has increased and female crime has increased. Australia has a high rate of reporting of crime by victims compared to other countries, yet statistics are incredibly hard to come by. The ABS has a crimes unit which has not published anything. It has been functioning for two years and it is still arguing about definitions. This is not an area in which the Federal Government has no role. It can set standards and examples, try modelled approaches, evaluate, disseminate, initiate and lead. It has done none of that. Above all, it can give people a job. This was recognised by the current Prime Minister. In this House in 1980 he stated: The Government will not tell us where it will supply some jobs in the cities of Australia. This is a very urbanised country and the Government does not have a policy for providing employment where it matters. If honourable members opposite think that the Baader-Meinhof groups and the urban guerrillas in Western Europe will not be a feature of Australia as we move through the 1980s with high levels of employment in the cities, I think they may be disappointed. In Question Time we now have Mr BaaderMeinhof sitting opposite us-the man who realised the problem in the early 1980s, and has done nothing at all to address it. The issue of suicide, particularly amongst young people, is a national tragedy. It does not gain much publicity, but each year in April the ABS releases figures on suicide. Suicide is the second largest killer of young men aged between 15 and 24 in Australia. This is an area of complete neglect by the Federal Government. In the last decade the number of young men committing suicide increased from 229 to 379 for the last year for which we have figures, 1990. That is nearly a two-thirds increase. When one looks at the results from 1991-92, with the circumstances that young people are facing and the pressures that they are under, one finds that they will increase further. On this side of the House, the honourable for member Tangney (Mr Shack), who held per the shadow youth affairs portfolio for a number of years, wrote privately to successive Ministers responsible for youth affairs. With no fuss he offered a bipartisan approach to this important issue of youth suicide. Successive Ministers offered platitudes; some did not even bother to respond to his letter;, and nothing at all has happened. The simple fact is that this is an area where the Federal Government also has to show some leadership. We have seen none to date. To not be alarmed by the high increasing suicide rate and to not make it a high priority of action is to ignore one of the biggest problems facing our young people today. This Government has made no attempt to protect Australia's vulnerable children. In the area of youth homelessness, groups like the Salvation Army and the Sydney City Mission are seeing unprecedented demands for services. The Sydney City Mission estimates that every night 10,000 kids are on the streets, of whom 10 per cent might be hard-core homeless youths. We have no real figures on this; we do not know. We can only guess that 25,000 young kids around Australia are homeless at anyone· time. We are in a worse position now than when Brian Burdekin released his report two years ago. What has the Government's response to this been? We have had the wonderful situation in which the Minister for Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly), when she was in Rio, was being reported back here as saying that Australia had hardly any street kids. I can tell the Minister that when she talks to people in Canberra she might find out' that kids actually sleep in the bus station just down from her office. If she cares to have a look, she might get a surprise. We know that it is well accepted around the world that with youth unemployment and youth alienation drug use will rise. A rise in the use of hard drugs will be expected to follow. All in all, that is a fairly bleak look for the next decade. For each new crisis in this country-the crises of employment, youth unemployment, suicide, crime, homelessness and drugs-what has been the Government's response? It has been twofold. First, it has been an attempt to shoot the messenger, and, secondly, it has been to say we will talk about it. Big deal! I want to take those points one by one, for they show the fundamental intellectual dishonesty and bankruptcy of this Government. The first is the attempt to redefine the nature of the problem in a way that has never been done anywhere in the world. I sat here and listened to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) attempt to do it again in Question Time. To try to talk about youth unemployment in terms of the entire youth population simply defies imagination. With so many young kids unemployed, given up, on the streets, in mickey mouse training schemes or staying at school or university when they would rather have a job, it is fooling nobody to suggest that 9 per cent of young people cannot find work. Everyone out in the real world knbws that that is not the situation. The Government is simply out of touch with the real world. Worse, it shows something much deeper. Before one can address a problem, one has to face up to it. This Government is simply not prepared to face up to the consequences of its own actions. If it is not honest with itself, there is no possibility of beginning to tackle the problem. The second thing is to say, 'Well, we are going to talk about it'. I say to that, whacko! We have had summits, talks and promises up to our ears. This was put to me very graphically just last week when I was talking to a young person. lwas saying how I had sat in this House and· heard the Prime Minister say that he was going to bring home the bacon. She looked me straight in the eye and said, 'The only bacon Mr Keating has given us is the pig's anus'. She actually used more colourful words, but I do not think they would be parliamentary. If we are looking for the cause of the trouble we do not have to look very far beyond the Labor Party front bench. The out- honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), when he was Vice-President of the ACTU, presented the ACTU's view to the Hancock committee in 1984. He emphatically denied any connection between youth unemployment and youth award wages. The honourable member for Hotham, as Secretary of the Storeman and Packers Union, led the union in pursuing a vigorous policy of eliminating all forms of junior rates and awards. The honourable member for Hotham, now a senior Cabinet Minister, has knowingly, consciously and deliberately followed a policy over many years of destroying as many youth award wages as he could. Young people are now reaping the benefits of these enlightened policies! The Opposition was accused today by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) of having no policies to deal with this problem. We certainly do. This is the same Minister I heard some four weeks ago accusing us of having policies coming out of our ears. What the Government could do is fundamentally rethink the way it does business in this country. It could scrap the superannuation guarantee levy and save 80,000 jobs at a minimum. It could abolish payroll tax and create 200,000 jobs straight away. It could reduce immigration. We have made commitments to do all of these. The Government could have a youth wage. I remember that when I was first standing for Parliament the honourable member for  of the Opposition, was talking about a youth wage, and he was ridiculed by the other side of the House. As little as four months ago, Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), in his shrill, highpitched voice, was talking .about Austrain enslaving young people. Austrain will give young people a job. If the Government put that sort of reform in place, it could offer them some hope. Finally, in talking to young people, it is very obvious what they want. They want jobs, to be listened to and to have their say in affects them. We have shown by our proposals for 4 July that we are going to listen to young people. At least we might show that we can offer them some hope. The current Government is intellectually unable to come to grips with the problem and practically unable to offer them anything but more of the same. (TIme expired)",68
164,Mr BALDWIN,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I do not think anybody in this chamber disputes the seriousness of the problem of youth unemployment and unemployment generally. But it is important that we have an accurate conception of the significance of the statistics. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), made a number of comments which need to be responded to. He made a spurious comparison with the period of the Depression. The fact is that during the Depression we had participation rates in education and training by people in the 15 to 19 years age group which were minuscule compared with today's rates. I shall begin by making some comments about the youth labour market specifically. Over the last 10 years some very significant structural changes have taken place in the youth labour market-changes that have to be addressed and taken into account if we are to develop credible solutions to the problem of youth unemployment. The first major structural change that has occurred is a dramatic increase in rates of participation in education and training. School retention rates, that is, the proportion of young people who complete a full 12 years of school, have virtually doubled from about 36 per cent in 1982 to, we think, about 75 per cent this year. That is a dramatic increase. We have also seen the dramatic increases in the numbers enrolled in universities. Back in 1987 there were some 370,000 domestic students; this year there are about 530,000 in our higher education system. That represents a dramatic increase. So there has been a major change in the level of aspiration of young people to education and training. The previous speaker sought to imply that that was predominantly what a response to adverse labour market circumstances. That is certainly not true. Since 1984 the Department of Employment, Education and Training has every two years undertaken a comprehensive survey of youth attitudes. There is no doubt that we have seen a massive intergenerational change in the value and significance that young people put on further education and training. It is probably the case that in the period of the recession there has been an additional kick along in those education participation figures, but the underlying change is undoubted and of massive proportions. To say that all that change is just a case of people retreating from an adverse labour market situation is just ridiculous. If we are going to argue about these sorts of historical comparisons, we obviously have to take into account the very strong growth in the participation rate in the labour market that has occurred over the last few years. If we were to compute an unemployment figure based on a participation rate comparable with that in which we took office, we would again see a much lower figure. We can argue endlessly about these statistics. What the Government does not argue about is the seriousness of the situation and the need to address it. The first major structural change in the youth labour market has been that dramatic increase in participation in education and training. That has been focused predominantly in the school retention figures and in the higher education and university participation figures. There has not been a similar transforevaluated mation in young people's participation in TAPE and technical and vocational education. In that area we have seen either stagnation or actual decline. We think that is a very significant part of the problem that we now face in the structure of our education and training system, and one that is related to the problem of youth unemployment. The second big structural change in the youth labour market in recent years has been the drying up, because of structural and technological change, of a whole range of entry lev-l jobs that young people would previously have been able to take by way of their first point of entry into the labour market. We are talking about unskilled jobs, such as operatives, couriers and telephonists. There is a whole range of those jobs which, because of that underlying structural technological change, have literally disappeared and will not return. That point has been emphasised by Richard Sweet from the New South Wales TAPE system, who has done a study of the youth labour market going back over the last 20 years. They are the two changes that we have seen-dramatic increases in education and training participation but with a weak area in the TAPE system, and structural change in the youth labour market with many jobs disappearing permanently. This increases the tendency for employers to try to manage their labour supply more optimally from their point of view-that is, by making more extensive use of part time and casual workers rather than full time workers. So the supply of those full time, unskilled jobs previously open to young people has dramatically reduced. That opens up the question of how to address the situation. The Opposition basically proposes to do a number of things. I will go through a few that are relevant to the youth labour market. In my area. of responsibility the Opposition says that it will get rid of the CES network. In the CES network there are youth access centres. There are now some 140 of those and they have been unusually successful in providing a congenial environment and point of contact with young people. The youth access centres have been rigorously by an independent consultant and found to be highly effective and extremely well regarded by young people. They have been invaluable in providing assistance and support for young people seeking to enter the labour market. The Opposition would get rid of those. Turning to the question of entry level training, the Government is talking about a substantial broadening of opportunities for young people to enter structured training and work. That is absolutely necessary. As I said, those unskilled entry level jobs have dried up. We must have a dramatically revamped system of entry level training. At the moment about half the people who leave school and do not go to university participate in no structured education and training opportunity whatsoever. We have to change that. We have taken on board the recommendations of the Carmichael review and are aiming to develop a much broader and comprehensive system of entry level training and work experience. That will supersede and encompass the existing apprenticeship and traineeship system. The Opposition talks about a youth wage. What it is on about is cutting youth wages for young people so they would be paid less for doing essentially the same work. What we are talking about is a training wage. It is important to use that terminology rather than a 'youth wage' because we are saying that a training wage should recognise the fact that somebody just entering the labour force who is inexperienced and unskilled will need to spend part of his or her time undertaking structured training and skill acquisition. A lot of that will have to take place off the job. We are saying that there needs to be a remuneration system which recognises that. We are saying that there needs to be a move towards a competency based training system so that, instead of being time related, the recognition of people's skills will be based on acquiring the necessary knowledge and skills and the ability to apply them. Once one is a fully competent worker, irrespective of one's wage, one would be paid the full award wage. That is a'very different concept from simply paying an age related wage. What we are talking about is a training wage where somebody, irrespective of age-a fully competent worker-would be paid the going award rate. That is a fundamental distinction. The other major and related element in the Government's strategy-as well as introducing a broader entry level training system so that we would have a system that would provide entrance to a far broader spectrum of occupations in the existing apprenticeship and traineeship system, which has played a useful historical role although a large proportion of young people have been ill-served by it, particularly young women who have a very small number of opportunities through the apprenticeship system-is that we need a new entry level training system and to substantially boost spending on the technical and further education system. The Commonwealth Government has committed itself to a substantial boost in resources and funding for the technical and further education system. We have said that we will put an extra $720m into that system over the next three years. By contrast, the Opposition has a policy in Fightback that implies an actual cut in the number of technical and further education places. It says that it will make a one-off increase of $75m over and above the 1991-92 budgetary figures for technical and further education. Since the last Budget this Government has increased the level of funding by $100m, compared with the $75m which the Opposition suggests, and we have said that we will boost that substantially so that, as I have said, over the next three years there will be a $75Om increase. What the Opposition's policies imply is a significant cut in technical and further education places in a situation where there is massive unmet demand for TAPE places throughout the country. We need to have that strengthening of the vocational training system if we are to go about this reform of entry level training to which I referred earlier. The two things go integrally together. The Opposition's policies would not provide the resources that are necessary for that. Young people would be short-changed and would not be provided with the opportunities that are needed. For the Opposition to talk about what it will do and what its policies will mean is sheer hypocrisy. Its policies .will mean a considerable darkening of opportunities for young people in the labour market. It has failed to recognise the underlying structural changes that have occurred. I reiterate the point that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made-that is, we have to get an accurate conception of the magnitude of the problem. The Opposition keeps talking as if one in three young people in this country in the 15 to 19 age group are wandering around looking for work and unable to find it. That is simply untrue. We have a very serious youth unemployment problem. The proportion of people in the 15 to 19 age group who are unemployed and seeking full time work is slightly under 10 per cent. That is bad enough in itself and is a problem which we must address. We are committed to addressing it. But Opposition members go round uttering those figures when they know perfectly well that they are untrue. The argument has been pointed out any number of times and they know their claims are false. Having spoken on youth unemployment, I now wish to make a few comments on the larger unemployment problem. Of course, we are not Robinson Crusoe in experiencing a recession at the present time. Just about the entire English-speaking world is experiencing severe economic problems. The United States has had a prolonged recession from which it is finding it very difficult to recover. It is starting to see early signs of recovery. The UK has had a two-year recession. New Zealand significantly, since it introduced a policy package with many elements of similarity to the Opposition's Fightback policy-that is to say, the large scale substitution of consumption tax for income tax-has had very severe economic problems and has gone from being a relatively low unemployment country to one with a higher rate of unemployment than Australia. That has been the effect of implementing the policy mix that the Opposition advocates-that is, a substantial and dramatic increase in unemployment. All that goes to confirm are the results of the Opposition's own econometric modelling of the effect of its policy mix. Dr Murphy, who did much of the work for the Fightback policy, explicitly modelled the effect of a substantial substitution of consumption tax income tax. What was the result of that? It showed that, on the optimistic assumption that one could quarantine the price effects from the wages system, there would be a 0.2 per cent increase in unemployment and a 0.2 per cent deCrease in GOP. On the less optimistic assumption, but the more realistic one, the Opposition would be unable to quarantine the price effects of the GST from the wages system and it was predicted that there would be a 4 per cent diminution in GOP over and above what it would have been. The centrepiece of the Opposition's strategy to deal with our economic future and solve unemployment would be directly counterproductive in terms of jobs and unemployment, even according to the econometric modelling done by the person who had a substantial input into the development of the Opposition's policy package. When we talk about unemployment it is not good enough to just lament the situation. We all lament the situation and recognise the central importance of preventing the entrenchment of long term unemployment. But the Opposition's policies would be directly counterproductive. Furthermore, the Fightback policy commits the Opposition to slashing a whole range of labour market programs which have been demonstrably effective in improving the prospects of long term unemployed people in particular. It talks about slashing by more than half expenditure on labour market programs over and above what this Government has committed itself to. We know, and the studies on the effectiveness of these policies have shown, that they are effective particularly for the long term unemployed. As I said earlier, the Opposition would also get rid of the CES system, which has· been revamped in recent years to focus on much more intensive assistance for the long term unemployed person and the disadvantaged job seeker. It would also get rid of the youth access centres. It would get rid of the labour market programs. It would slash TAFE training places. The Opposition has no conception of entry level training and how that might work, which is a total contrast to this for Government's view that it is central to a coherent and effective policy to address the problem of youth unemployment. The Opposition will do nothing to solve unemployment. It will kick these people off income support after nine months and force them to go through a very rigorous process to get special benefits. It assumes in its own figuring that some 50,000 people will be knocked off it. Opposition members come in here and complain about crime. What do they think will be the consequence of throwing people off income support after nine months, which is central to what they are proposing? (TIme expired)",72
165,Mr ANDERSON,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As employers across Australia see the latest batch of stupid economic policy decisions of this Government, they are sharpening their pencils again as they prepare to work out who goes, who stays and whether they really can afford to put on that young person whom they might have been contemplating employing and training. I suspect that many people in this place know that that is a reality, because, like me, they will have been contacted on the phone or out in their electorate-or perhaps they have read about it in the press-by concerned employers. Employers have been warning this Government and anybody else who will listen that they will again be reviewing their situation in relation to the people they employ and where they will go with their business plans, because the continuing recessionLabor's recession; the recession we were told we 'had to have' - is not only not letting up, despite some of the optimistic rhetoric from those who have a vested interest in promoting it; it is being prolonged and even worsened by the continuing unrealistic approach of this Government. The major trigger for the latest concerns is the notoriously irresponsible superannuation guarantee levy. That is to be joined in this place tonight by the sham contractors legislation. Labor's own Treasury has splashed around the figure of 100,000 jobs as being likely to disappear as a result of the SGL. The SGL, along with the increase in the training levy that goes with it, reflects the inability Labor to either understand the lessons of recent years or break free of the contemptible priority that is accorded the interests of mates over the interests of working Australians. The SGL also reflects the lack of understanding of simple business realities by Government members, who have had long enough in government in this place to demonstrate their capacities, or lack of capacity, for revitalising the Australian economy. They have had the best part of a decade-a decade in which Australia has declined further in its place under the sun. Above all, those policies reflect a government whose legislative programs are not so much ineffective as bad-bad for business and, therefore, bad for jobs. Regrettably, the Government has had the capacity to push through far too much of this inappropriate legislation, such as that relating to the super guarantee levy, the super union legislation of 18 months ago and the sham contractors legislation-all of which goes to prove its capacity to get it right for its mates, not its capacity to get it right for Australians. The problem has been that these policies have been and are inappropriate and run counter to the objectives of achieving solid economic growth and a strong, positive private sector able to generate jobs. The point that needs to be· clearly established here is that, ultimately, it is only the private sector that can provide the sustainable economic growth upon which a labour market of depth and vigour can be constructed. In recent years we have seen the cost of artificially pumping up the economy with borrowed money-largely foreigners' money. Over recent years the Goveinment has told us repeatedly that it has managed to create 1.5 million new jobs. But it has done so at the price of a blow-out in foreign debt. Now the chickens have come home to roost. Our unemployment and declining living standards are obvious testimony to that reality. Worse is the legacy that we are leaving to the next generation of Australians. We have had years of high interest rateswhat the now Prime Minister (Mr Keating) once referred to as the 'blunt instrument' of of monetary policy. Honourable members should remember that, in one period of 18 months in which interest rates were constantly over 20 per cent, the Government failed to rein in our trading deficit but succeeded in perpetrating irreparable damage to countless businesses across this country-that is, in effect, countless employers. It is not just that record numbers of employers have gone under, with all the highflying bankruptcy figures amongst the small business sector; in addition, countless thousands have been so badly hurt that they cannot recover quickly, if at all, and countless additional thousands more have lost their confidence. They no longer have any confidence in this Government or its commitment to investment and to creating an environment that is conducive to economic expansion and solid economic growth. It needs to be understood, as I fear it is by far too few people in this place, that confidence is the key to investment, which in turn is the key to growth and jobs. Countless employers will not be in a hurry to expand, to take on workers or to give young Australians a go. They· have had their fingers burnt, well and truly, too many times. Mr Andrew-You can't talk them into it.",75
166,Mr ANDERSON,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We certainly cannot talk them into it. They are too smart for that. They need to see the reality-the runs on the board-before they will put on more people. I referred earlier to contact with employers over the Government's superannuation guarantee levy. I dare say that everyone in this place will know exactly what I am talking about. One employer rang me a week ago and told me that he was putting all his plans for the future on hold. He told me that his confidence had been starting to return. He told me that he had intended offering his workers a modest pay increase-the first they would have had for three or four years-for great loyalty and dedication during a very tough time in his business. This is a good one: he told me that he had been about to create a new position for a young person in his small business, but he says now that he will not be doing it. He may not even retain all his current staff, because he has lost confidence-so fragile was that rebuilding of confidence in his operation. Mrs Bailey-""-There are thousands like him.",76
167,Mr ANDERSON,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As my honourable friend over here says, there are thousands of people like him right across Australia. This employer said it is not just what the SGL and the training guarantee levy that goes with it will cost him directly; it is what it will mean in terms of cancelled orders from prospective customers who, like him, have lost confidence just as it was starting to rebuild. young person who will not be offered a position in that business, whoever he or she may be? Tragically, he or she will not be Robinson Crusoe, for what that is worth. Officially, as we have heard here today, there are now no jobs for more than one in every three young Australians looking for full time work. That means that youth unemployment is about three times what it is for the rest of the population. Mr Andrew-It's not good in Port Adelaide either.",77
168,Mr ANDERSON,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I can imagine. The figures hide the even worse truth that because they are still at school, under Austudy or making do with part time work, many young and, effectively, unemployed or underemployed young people still do not appear in the statistics. I would be the last deny that we must encourage more and better education for our young. I was glad to hear the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) acknowledge the seriousness of the crisis and not attempt to sweep it under the carpet by simply talking about irrelevancies relating to people still educating themselves. The bottom line is that we have to create the jobs for young people to go to when they have trained. It is not just an economic argument about our economy's capacity to afford high levels of unemployment; there is also a massive personal dimension to this. It must be a frightful thing for Australiansparticularly our young people, fresh out of school-to find they are not wanted and to be repeatedly told, 'No, we don't want you. No, we have no place for you. No, we have no need for your abilities. No, your skills are of no value to us'. In a young person's mind, those rejections become, 'No, you have no value in our society'. It is not just the money that is at stake here; it is the self-esteem and the commitment of young people to our community. Who can blame them when they lose hope, when suicide rates soar and when they start to resent the lucky country because it is unable to provide them with the sort of future that What of that we took for granted? It is quite obvious that talkfests, summits and wishful manipulation of the figures will not dissolve Australia's unemployment crisis. We need action. We need an open and honest acknowledgment of the seriousness of the problem and its real causes, and we need stability and long term predictability in the development of a pro-business economic environment in this country. Ad hoc and bad decisions must end. A great deal more is needed.· The Government could start by scrapping its SGL and the appalling sham contracts legislation here in this place tonight. It could adopt a realistic approach to a youth wage. It could remove payroll tax-a tax on jobs. It could remove the petroleum excise and the wholesale sales tax. (TIme expired)",77
169,Mr SAWFORD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is a very sad day when this Parliament is subjected to two such disappointing contributions from the Opposition on the crucial issue of unacceptable employment levels in this nation and, indeed, the world. It is disappointing because the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) and the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) are two of the more able members on the Opposition side, yet they offer as solutions the abolition of payroll tax, the abolition of the superannuation levy and the abolition of the training guarantee levy and say that all our problems will be solved. For a fleeting moment I thought that in this place today the level of debate by the Opposition might be lifted. The Opposition's record on unemployment is practically non-existent, and many on that side of the House know that to be true. Concern and care for the unemployed? They have to be joking. Analysis of unemployment appears to be beyond the intellectual capacity of honourable members opposite. They describe what happens, but they cannot ask the intellectual question: why? They continue to attack' a problem by looking out the back window. They continue to believe that they can resurrect an industrial world. They want continually to drag this nation backwards to an industrial world that will be dead before they are. They have learnt little, if anything, last 40 years. Forward thinking, in their terms, is an acceptance of the status quo. They have no aims for glory and no acceptance of shame. In stark contrast to the Opposition's contribution, I at least would like to look out the front window in debating this matter of public importance. Throughout the industrialised world, whether we compare the OECD or the EC, as well as Australia, there appears to be chronic and endemic unemployment of around 10 per cent. It is an international problem that will be greatly exacerbated in the next 12 years, when one billion people will be added to this planet. The Opposition appears to believe that reliance upon conventional approaches to economic growth-that is, huge capital outlays, high energy consumption, the production of enormous amounts of pollution-will deliver one of the most important products of any economy; that is, enough jobs. It has not worked in the past 40 years, and there is little likelihood that it will work in the future. A simple examination of the 1950s tells us that the gap between various nations' GNP and employment was on a par, or at least at a marginal level. In the early 1990s there is a huge gap in all OECD countries. Where have those jobs gone? An analysis of employment from the 1960s is pretty enlightening. In the OECD, industrial employment declined from 35 to 30 per cent; agricultural employment fell from 22 per cent to 8 per cent; service jobs increased from 43 per cent to 62 per cent. But as we all know, or ought to know, we still have a human surplus in-labour. Traditional industries such as textiles, iron and steel and metals processing are declining in .employment, while electronics, telecommunications and biotechnology certainly are gaining, but not to the extent previously thought, to take up the labour surplus. We know that the micro-electronic industry has spawned whole new industries, but it has also frighteningly reduced the need for labour throughout the world. Traditional economic growth as proposed by those opposite no longer is always accompanied by a commenin the surate increase in the number of jobs. Throughout the industrialised world we are substituting capital, energy and increased output for human labour, which is in surplus. If we take the United States as an example of a large economy, we certainly know whathas occurred. Since the 1950s the output of the manufacturing sector has tripled, the amount of energy used has also tripled and the quantity of capital has quadrupled; but-and this is the real catch-the amount of input labour has increased by only a third. The worse polluting industries-oil and coal, chemicals, primary metals and paper-account for about 80 per cent of pollution in the United States. They consume about 20 per cent of energy and they provide about 3 per cent of the jobs. In the 1980s in the USA, 25 per cent of refining jobs disappeared and, despite rising production, coal mining jobs fell by 33 per cent. The patterns and trends in Europe and Australia are the same. . Even though there is a huge shift from manufacturing to services, it cannot replace the manufacturing sector. Obviously demand for manufactured products will continue. Unless we change the fundamental means of production-I thought the honourable member for Chisholm was going to get onto thisindustrial pollution and looking out the back window by conservative politicians will cripple not only the people but the environment as well. The answer certainly is political action and vision, something not found on the conservative side of politics. For centuries on this planet the economy has ruled at the expense of ecology. Yet the origin of both 'economy' and 'ecology' is the Greek 'oikos'. Some people in the environment movement suggest that we must sacrifice human well-being-that is, full employment-to the altar of environmental purity. Both environmental and economic health are in fact interdependent, something that people on the other side do not seem to have woken up to. The choice for full employment is not between the environment and jobs. It is neither or it is both, and I strongly suggest to this House that it is both. A coaiition obviously needs to be forged between the labour and environmental movements in the world, and conservative politicians need to be kept continually in opposition. We· cannot continue to have an economy depending forever on the depletion of natural resources, degrading of air and water, and rendering of huge areas of land unfit for habitation. That is why the MFP, of which the Opposition is so critical-a Labor initiative in my own electorate of Port Adelaide--'is so important. It will help to point the way to the future of employment opportunities. In the place of the worse environmental offenders, which include the oil, coal, chemical, paper and motor vehicle industries, will come new industries, but they certainly would not come to the light of day if this current Opposition happened to· fall into power. Even without environmental policies, many jobs in these industries are disappearing due to increased automation. Total pollution abatement expenditure in the OECD is now worth $200 billion annually. It created five million jobs directly and indirectly in western Europe and the USA. There has to be a move away from the massive combustion of oil and coal, and we are going to be forced to use energy more efficiently. The big question is: where do those jobs come from? I do not pretend I know all the answers, but certainly the following examples point to where those opportunities will lie. Take energy, for example. If we want to generate 1,000 gigawatt hours of electricity, in a nuclear plant we will employ 100 workers, in a coal-fired plant we will employ 116, in a solar thermal facility we will employ 250 and on a wind farm we will employ 550. The challenge is to build renewable energy systems at a lower or equivalent capital cost to conventional systems; that is, deliberately to divert spending to areas that are labour intensive-not deadend, untrained labour, but trained labour intensive employment. Energy efficient housing produces gains in employment-up to 80 jobs for $lm of expenditure. It is interesting to look at infrastructure spending, which we have noted in One Nation is so absent from Fightback. An environmentally sustainable economy will require the reversal of a still rising dependence upon cars and trucks. For this to happen, as we have said in the One Nation statement, rail-based transport must be given priority. Some wrongly suggest that this is a return to the practices of 80 years ago, but today there are .opportunities for technological an- other improvements. I looked at some German figures, which were interesting in terms of employment opportunitieS. The spending of a billion deutschmarks on highway construction in fact creates the fewest jobs; rail increases by 22,000 jobs; light rail by even more23,000; and road 14,000 and probably fewer than 10,000. . The skills of engineering, concrete pouring and all of the above are pretty much the same. The transition, or greater empha-is, is pretty straightforward. Recycling is another example. Alcoa in the United States estimates that there are 30,000 people in the USA involved in the recycling of aluminium, equal to twice the level of employment in the primary aluminium industry. That is based on a very low rate of recycling. Boosting it to 75 per cent would yield 375,000 jobs in the USA. To process a million tonnes of garbage in an incinerator might need 400 jobs, landfill might need 200 jobs, but in a recycling facility up to 2,000 jobs might be needed. We will have to learn to use capital, energy and manufactured output to our own advantage as people and as a world. In conclusion, I will quote George Bernard Shaw: Wisdom is not recollecting the past, it is taking responsibility for the future. (nme expired)",77

175,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"During Question Time today the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) quite inaccurately alleged that when Statement No. 2 for the 1982 Budget was prepared-and he made the inaccurate claim by reference to an alleged conversation between himself and the former Secretary to the Department of the Treasury, Mr Stone-that I had, in fact, had a conversation with Mr Stone in which I simply inquired, 'How is Statement No. 2 going?'. Mr Stone said, 'It is going okay, Treasurer'. I said, 'That is perfectly all right'. The import of the Prime Minister's allegation was that I uncritically accepted what the Department of the Treasury put to me in relation to Statement No.2. When he made that claim it did not ring true with my personal recollection. I have checked the record and found that the Prime Minister is not only a bit wrong, but he is disastrously wrong. In fact, in 1982 the Prime Minister asked a question which alleged that I had instructed Dr Hewson, who was then a member of my personal staff, to vet Statement No.2. He then followed that up with a censure motion against me alleging that I had interfered with the terms of Statement No.2. The Prime Minister, once again, has been found to be pathologically incapable of correctly respecting the truth.

178,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEE REPORT,On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works I present the fifty-fifth general report of the COQlmittee. Ordered that the report be printed.,81
179,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEE REPORT,"by leave-I thank the House. The Committee's fifty-fifth general report covers the activities of the Committee during 1991. The Committee presented 12 reports during the year on a range of public works, such as defence facilities; the Australian Embassy in Jakarta and the Australian High Commission in Islamabad, Pakistan; CSIRO laboratories in Melbourne; and houses for the Defence Force in Western Australia. The estimated cost of the proposals on which the Committee reported.during 1991 was $231m. The Committee met on 53 occasions during the year to conduct public hearings, carry out inspections, to consider reports and be briefed by departmental officials. As in past years, the report raises a number of matters of concern which emerged during the year. I will briefly mention a few of them. First, the tion of a shell filling facility at St Marys Munitions Filling Factory in New South Wales. Honourable members will recall that this facility, estimated to cost $7.7m, was referred to the Committee in October 1988. Not long after that, in December, the Committee held a public hearing into the proposal at which officials from the Department of Defence assured the Committee, firstly, that the facility was required; secondly, that despite urban encroachment, the factory would remain at its location; and, thirdly, the merits of the proposed work had been assessed as essential even though the establishment of Australian Defence Industries was in the offing. Accordingly, the Committee recommended to the Parliament that the work should proceed. The Committee was amazed when it was advised by the Department of Defence in May last year that the shell filling facility, which had meanwhile been completed, was no longer required. Apparently during 1990 the newly forme9 ADI had carried out an extensive review of its operations to rationalise and improve efficiency, which resulted in the St Marys Munitions Filling Factory being no longer required. The Committee believes the project was a debacle of monumental proportions. The new shell filling factory was proceeded with in a climate of uncertainty based on erroneous assumptions. The Committee accordingly gives notice that all public works referred to it for consideration, be they for the Department of Defence, or for other departments or agencies, will be required to withstand the 'St Marys test'-that is, the need, justification, benefits and public value of public works will need to be rigorously tested by the management of departments and agencies before they are referred to the Committee. This incident also demonstrates the risks involved in departments proceeding with the provision of major facilities during a period of organisational establishment or reorganisation. A second matter for concern involved another incident involving the Department of Defence. It relates to the refurbishment of Endeavour House, a former migrant hostel, construclocated in Coogee, New South Wales, to provide accommodation for junior sailors in the Sydney area. The scope of the work was original1y costed at $5.8m in August 1988 but, due to a litany of what can charitably be described as unfortunate circumstances, by January 1991 the cost had blown out to more than $7.2m. Fol1owing a briefing by Defence officials, the Committee concluded that some effort was made to adjust components of the project to keep it below the $6m reference limit; the scope of the project was poorly defined; and that inadequate administrative procedures in Defence had caused a project estimated to cost at least $7.385m from being referred to the Committee, contrary to the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act. The Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) subsequently advised the Cpmmittee that the Secretary to the Department had been asked to review administrative processes for the control of both capital works and repairs and maintenance. A third matter of concern relates to the approval of designs by non-Commonwealth authorities. During 1991, Australian Construction Services, formerly the Department of Housing and Construction, ceased to be the Commonwealth's design and construction authority. Departments and agencies are now free to select design and construction agents from the private sector. The Committee believes that in this environment there is scope for the rigorous overSight of the design of major works, formerly carried out by Australian Construction Services, to be diminished. In the past, Australian Construction Services was responsible for the application of planning and design principles with some measure of consistency. At one hearing, a witness submitted that there now appears to be generally no formal process by which the community can be assured that Commonwealth building work will conform to current community standards. Buildings and facilities planned and constructed for the private sector are subject to a number of formal processes, such as applying for building approval, the checking of plans, inspections and the issuing of certificates of occupancy. Whilst under the principle of the shield of the Crown the Commonwealth is not required to seek formal approvals and pay fees, now that departments and government business enterprises are regarding buildings and facilities as saleable assets, for the full value of these assets to be realised they would need to formally comply with local government and State government regulations. The Committee accepts that there are constitutional issues involved and will shortly write to the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) on this matter. The question of the provi-ion of work-based child-care facilities continued to be pursued by the Committee. In a number of instances, departments and agencies demonstrated that they are aware of their responsibilities to their employees. It was particularly gratifying to see a report during the year from the Australian Taxation Office, one of the largest Public Service employers, which stated: The ATO sees the provision of child care facilities for employees as good human resource management practices, enabling optimal returns on the Office's investment in recruiting, developing and retaining staff. The Committee continues to focus attention on the energy efficiency of buildings and reiterates that sponsoring departments and design and construction authorities must be more energy conscious in the design of buildings. The Committee therefore gives notice that in future more details of energy conservation principles and measures will be given close examination. In conclusion, I would like to pay tribute to my hard-working colleagues-the vice-chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), and the honourable member for Indi (Mr Ewen Cameron), the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gorman), the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil) and the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), as well as our parliamentary colleagues from the Senate-Senator Burns, Senator Calvert and Senator Devereux. I think members of the Committee will join me in thanking the dedicated secretariat staff for their professional approach to the numerous challenges faced by the Committee during the year.",82
180,Mr WEBSTER,COMMITTEE REPORT,"by leave-I was interested in the comments of the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) when tabling the Public Works Committee report. He 'referred to the new shell filling facility, work on which began a couple of years ago and which was completed last year, at St Marys, which is a small part of my electorate. In fact, the compound that takes in the St Marys ammunition factory, as it used to be called, is part of my electorate. Last year, I drew to the attention of the House the tremendous shock that many people received with the knowledge that this $8m factory at St Marys that was built for the filling of shells may never be opened. In addition to that $8m, of course, there was another $2m or so in consultancy fees. So in excess of $lOm was spent building a state-of-the-art shell filling factory at St Marys which may never be opened. I endorse the comments by the honourable member for Throsby, who, I must say, has made no apology to anybody for what seems to be a tremendous debacle. I feel that taxpayers ought to be demanding an explanation as to why this huge amount of their money was spent at St Marys on a massive structure which cannot be used; it may be that it cannot be used for anything at all in that area. All it will be able to provide in the future-if the Government proceeds with the closing down of the factory and a housing settlement is established there-is a lot of work for a number of bulldozers and men to remove it. It is a reinforced structure; it has huge mounds of shock-deadening earth around it, gravel and so on. It will be a tremendous job to shift it. So the removal is going to cost a huge amount. It was important for me to comment on this facility, because I was very concerned about the huge expenditure. I am concerned that the munitions factory at St Marys is closing. It is a very efficient factory. The safety standards that exist there are second to none anywhere in Australia and even in the world. Over 400 people work there. The Australian Defence Industries hierarchy says that they are going to be offered positions elsewhere, but of course these people all live in the area, they are settled in the area and they do not want to move. There is re1!-Ily no need for them to move. This $lOm state-of-the-art structure is seemingly going to be bulldozed. Somebody will need to do a lot of explaining about the monumental decision that has been made. I ask that this matter be pursued, particularly with regard to whether the ADI is prepared to reconsider and leave the factory at St Marys, where it is operating very well. I also believe that in terms of cleaning up the area the cost to the taxpayer is going to be huge. One wonders at the wisdom of coming to this decision. I commend the honourable member for Throsby for his forthright comments and also for his declaration of the St Marys requirements, or the new protocol, that will be necessary before any goveriunent department seeks the approval of the Public Works Committee in terms of any new structure. .

Where a person to whom this Agreement applies has claimed an Australian benefit under this Agreement and has, without the application of this Agreement, accumulated: (a)a period as an Australian resident that is less than the period required to qualify him or her, on that ground, under the legislation of Australia for a benefit; and (b)a period of Australian working life residence equal to or greater than the minimum period identified in accordance with paragraph 4 for that person and has accumulated a period of insurance in Austria, then for the purposes of a claim for that Australian benefit, that period of insurance in Austria shall be deemed, only for the purposes of that this Article for meeting any period required for qualification for that benefit set out in the legislation of Australia, to be a period in which that person was an Australian resident. 2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, where a person: (a)has been an Australian resident for a continuous period which is less than the minimum continuous period required by the legislation of Australia for entitlement of that person to a benefit; and (b)has accumulated a period of insurance in Austria in two or more separate periods that equals or exceeds in total the minimum period referred to in subparagraph (a), the total of the periods of insurance in Austria shall be deemed to be one continuous period. 3. For all purposes of this Article, where a period by a person as an Australian resident and a period of insurance in Austria coincide, the period of coincidence shall be taken into account once only by Australia as a period as an Australian resident. 4. The minimum period of residence in Australia to be taken into account for the purposes of paragraph I shall be as follows: (a)for the purposes of an Australian benefit that is payable to a person who is not an Australian resident, the minimum period shall be twelve months of which at least six months must be continuous; and (b)for the purposes of an Australian benefit that is payable to an Australian resident, no minimum. 5. For the purposes of a claim by a person for a pension payable to a widowed person, that , person shall be deemed to have accumulated a period of insurance in Austria for any period for which, his or her partner accumulated a period of insurance in Austria but any period during which the person and his or her partner both accumulated a period of insurance in Austria shall be taken into account once only. 1. Subject to paragraph 2, where an Australian benefit is payable whether by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise to a person who is outside the territory of Australia, the rate of that benefit shall be determined according to the legislation of Australia but when assessing the income of that person for the purposes of calculating the rate of the Australian benefit only a proportion of any Austrian benefit which is received by that person shall be regarded as income. That proportion shall be calcu,lated by multiplying the number of whole months accumulated by that person in a period of Australian working life residence (not exceeding 3(0) by the amount of that Austrian beiuifit and dividing that product by 300. 2. A person referred to in paragraph I shall only be entitled to receive the concessional assessment of income described in that paragraph for any period during which the rate of that person's Australian benefit is proportionalised under the legislation of Australia. 3. Where an Australian benefit is payable by virtue .of this Agreement or otherwise to a person who is in Austria, any compensatory supplement or social assistance and similar means-tested payment paid by Austria to that person shall be disregarded by Australia in computing that person's income for the purposes of the legislation of Australia or the application of this Agreement. 4. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 5, where an Australian benefit is payable only by virtue of this Agreement to a person who is in Australia, the rate of that benefit shall be determined by: (a)calculating that person's income according to the legislation of Australia but disregarding in that calculation the Austrian benefit received by that person; (b)deducting the amount of the Austrian benefit received by that person from the maximum rate of that Australian benefit; and (c)applying to the remaining benefit obtained under subparagraph (b) the relevant rate calculation set out in the legislation of Australia, using as the person's income the amount calculated under subparagraph (a). 5. Where the rate of a benefit calculated in accordance with paragraph 4 is less than the rate of that benefit which would be payable under paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 if the person concerned were outside Australia, the first mentioned rate shall be increased to an amount equivalent to the second-mentioned rate. 6. Where a married person is, or both that person ARTICLE 7 and his or her partner are, in receipt of an Austrian benefit or benefits, each of them shall be deemed, for the purposes of paragraph 4 and for the legislation of Australia, to be in receipt of one half of either the amount of that benefit or total of both of those benefits, as the case may be. 7. For the' purposes of paragraph 5, a comparison of the rates of the benefits shall be made as at: (a)the date of the first pension pay day occurring after the date from which the benefit is payable; and (b )each anniversary of that pension pay day for so long as the person concerned is entitled to the benefit; using, in that comparison, the number of months of the period of Australian working life residence accumulated by the person at the date as at which the comparison is made. ARTICLE 8 A person who receives from Australia an Australian benefit due to the fact that the partner of that person receiv-, by virtue of this Agreement, another Austrahan benefit shall, for the purposes of this Agreement, be deemed to receive that first mentioned benefit by virtue of this Agreement. NA If a person has completed periods of insurance in Austria and periods of Australian working life residence, those periods, insofar as they do not overlap, shall be added together for the purpose of qualification for an Austrian benefit. 1. If a person who has completed periods of insurance in Austria and periods of Australian working life residence, or the survivor of such a person, is claiming a benefit, the competent institution for Austria shall determine the amount of the benefit in the following manner: (a)the institution shall determine, in accordance with the Austrian legislation, whether the person concerned has an entitlement to a benefit by adding together the periods as provided in Article 9; (b)if entitlement to a benefit is determined to exist, the institution shall first calculate the theoretical amount of the benefit which would be payable if all the periods completed under the legislation of both Parties had been completed exclusively under the Austrian legislation; in cases where the amount of the benefit is independent of the duration of the period of insurance, this amount shall be taken to be the theoretical amount; and (c)the institution shall then calculate the partial benefit payable on the basis of the amount calculated in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (b) in proportion to the ratio between the duration of the periods of insurance to be taken into consideration under the Austrian legislation and the total duration of the periods to be taken into consideration under the legislation of both Parties. 2. Where the periods of insurance to be taken into consideration under the Austrian legislation for the purpose of calculating the amount of a benefit are in aggregate less than twelve months, no benefit under that legislation shall be paid. However, the preceding sentence shall not apply if the entitlement to that benefit has been acquired under the Austrian legislation exclusively on the basis of periods of insurance completed under that legislation. The competent Austrian institution shall apply Articles 9 and 10 according to the following rules: 1. In determining the institution responsible for paying a benefit, only periods of insurance in Austria shall be taken into consideration. PART III 2. Periods of Australian working life residence, during which the person concerned was employed or self-employed, shall be treated as BENEFITS periods of contributions. ARTICLE 9 3. Articles 9 and 10 shall apply neither to the conditions of entitlement to nor to the payment of the miners' long service allowance under the miners' pension insurance. 4. For the application of paragraph 1 of Article 10, the following shall apply: ARTICLE 10 (a)periods during which the insured person has been entitled to an age pension or invalid pension under the legislation of Australia shall be treated as if they were neutral periods; (b)the basis of assessment shall be determined exclusively on periods of insurance in Austria; (c)the contributions for supplementary insurance as well as the miners' supplementary benefit, the helpless person's allowance and the compensatory supplement shall be disregarded. 5. For the application of subparagraphs I (b) and (c) of Article 10, overlapping periods under the legislation of the two Parties shall be taken into consideration as if they did not overlap. 6. If, for the application of subparagraph 1(c) of Article 10, the total duration of the periods to be taken into consideration under the legislation of both Parties exceeds the maximum number of months of insurance specified under the Austrian legislation for the calculation of the rate of increments, the partial pension payable shall be calculated in proportion to the ratio between the duration of the periods of insurance to be taken into consideration under the Austrian legislation and the above-mentioned maximum number of months of insurance. 7. For the calculation of the helpless person's allowance, subparagraphs 1(b) and (c) of Article 10 shall apply; Article 13 shall apply accordingly. 8. The amount calculated according to subparagraph l(c) of Article 10 shall be increased, where applicable, by the increments for contributions for supplementary insurance as well as the miners' supplementary benefit, the helpless person's allowance and the compensatory supplement. 9. If the award of benefits under the miners' pension insurance depends on the completion ARTICLE II of essentially mining activities, within the meaning of the Austrian legislation, in specific undertakings, then only those periods of Australian working life residence during which the person was employed in a similar occupation in similar undertakings shall be taken into consideration. 10. The special payments shall be payable in the same amount as the Austrian partial benefit; Article 13 shall apply accordingly. 1. Where entitlement to a benefit exists under the Austrian legislation without the application of Article 9, the competent Austrian institution shall pay the pension which would be payable exclusively on the basis of the periods of insurance to be taken into consideration under that legislation, provided there is no entitlement to a corresponding benefit under the legislation of Australia. 2. The pension determined in accordance with paragraph I shall be recalculated in accordance with the provisioll$ of Article 10 as soon as entitlement arises to a corresponding benefit under the legislation of Australia. This recalculation shall have effect from the date on which the benefit under the legislation of Australia becomes payable. The irrevocability of previous decisions shall not prevent this recalculation. If a person is entitled to a benefit under the Austrian legislation without the application of Article 9, and if such a benefit would be greater than the total of the Austrian benefit calculated in accordance with subparagraph l(c) of Article 10 and the corresponding Australian benefit, the competent Austrian institution shall pay, as the partial benefit, its benefit so calculated increased by the difference between such total and the benefit which would be payable if the Austrian legislation alone were applied. NA Lodgement of Documents 1. The date on which a claim, notice or appeal concerning the determination or payment of a benefit under the legislation of a Party is lodged with an authority, institution or other competent body of the other Party shall be treated, for all purposes concerning the matter to which it relates, as the date of lodgement of that document with an authority, institution or other competent body of the first Party. 2. Any claim for a benefit under the legislation of a Party shall be considered to be a claim for the corresponding benefit under the legislation of the other Party for which the applicant may be qualified if the applicant provides information at the time of claim indicating that the person on whose record benefits are claimed has completed relevant periods of residence or of insurance <Jnder the legislation of the other Party and: (a) the claim is lodged with the institution of the ARTICLE 12 other Party; or (b)the claim is lodged with the institution of the first Party and that institution sends the claim within three months of its lodgement with that institution to the competent institution of the other Party. 3. In the cases to which paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article apply, the body to which the submission has been made shall forward the claim, notice or appeal without delay to the corresponding competent body of the other Party. ARTICLE 15 Advance Payments and Overpayments 1. Where an Austrian institution has made an advance payment to a person for any period and arrears of a corresponding benefit become payable for the same period under the legisARTICLE 13 lation of Australia, the competent institution of Australia shall deduct from those arrears the amount paid by way of advance payment and shall transfer the amount so deducted to the Austrian institution. Where an Austrian institution has overpaid a benefit for any period for which the competent institution of Australia afterwards becomes liable to pay a corresponding benefit, the overpayment shall be regarded, for the purpose of the first sentence, as an advance payment. 2.Where PART IV (a)an Austrian benefit is paid or payable to a person in respect of a past period; PROVISIONS (b)for all or part of that period, an Australian ARTICLE 14 benefit has been paid to that person; and (c)the amount of the Australian benefit would have been reduced had the Austrian benefit been paid during that period; then (d)the amount of the Australian benefit that would not have been paid had the Austrian benefit described in subparagraph (a) been paid on a periodical basis throughout that past period, shall be a debt due by that person to the Commonwealth of Australia; and (e) Australia may determine according to the legislation of Australia that the amount or any part of that debt may be deducted from future payments of Australian benefit payable to that person. 3. Where an Austrian institution has not yet paid the benefit described in subparagraph 2(a) to the person: (a)the Austrian institution shall, at the request of the competent authority of Australia pay the amount of the benefit necessary to meet the debt described in subparagraph 2(d) to the competent institution of Australia and shall pay any excess to the person; and (b) any shortfall may be recovered by the competent authority of Australia under subparagraph 2(e). Payment of Benefits 1. The benefit-paying institution of a Party may discharge its obligations under this Agreement in the national currency of that Party. 2. A benefit payable by a Party by virtue of this Agreement shall be paid by that Party without deduction for administrative fees and charges. Administrative Arrangements and Mutual 1.The competent authorities of the Parties shall, by means of an Arrangement, establish the administrative measures necessary for the application of this Agreement. 2. The competent authorities shall inform each other of laws that amend, supplement or replace the legislation of their respective Parties. 3. The competent authorities and institutions of the Parties shall assist each other, including by the communication of any information, in applying the legislation specified in Article 2 and this Agreement, as if they were applying their own legislation. With the exception of cash expenditures relating thereto, such assistance shall be provided free of charge. 4. The laws of a Party concerning confidentiality shall apply to any information about an individual which is transmitted in accordance with this Agreement to that Party by the other Party. Such information shall be used only for purposes of applying this Agreement or the legislation of a Party. 5.

Motion (by Mr Duncan) proposed: That the amendments be agreed to.",91
182,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I take this opportunity to speak briefly to these amendments. They arise from some undertakings given by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) when this matter was previously debated to examine proposals whereby, under the scheme that was put in place for subsecregistering migration agents and the requirement of the payment of a substantial fee of $1,000 for registration, there were particular people who might be seeking as agents to render migration assistance but in a very limited number of cases, perhaps two or three a year. This would happen particularly in rural towns, where the solicitor can very often be the person most literate and able to assist in filling out forms, but not necessarily seeking to 'hold himself out as a migration agent offering a comprehensive range of services which could be available on a regular basis such as to necessitate payment of a large registration fee. Of course, in the case of professionals such as accountants and lawyers, this would be in addition to any professional fee they might otherwise have to pay. It was therefore appropriate for the Government to consider this issue. I welcome the Government's reconsideration and the amendment that has been brought forward, which deals specifically with providing the opportunity for registration of an applicant proposing to give immigration assistance-that is, offering advice and filling out migration forms and the like-in no more than five migration cases, and that can include a number of applications in the case of family units. In that situation of handling up to five cases there would be a lesser fee of $50 and a fee of $100 in the case of a corporation, partnership or principal registered· agent. That seems to me to be an eminently sensible and appropriate response to the complaints that were made by representatives of the legal profession, in particular the Law Council of Australia, the Victorian Law Institute and the Law Society of New South Wales. I notice that the amendments also provide for people who are members of a diplomatic mission, a consular post or the office of an international organisation to be able to give immigration assistance in their capacity as such officers. I can understand that such people might often be called upon to offer some advice in relation to filling out forms and the like and that they should not be subjected to possible criminal offences through doing that. However, in relation to people who may hold consular positions in some of our major cities but who are not officers brought in from the diplomatic corps of a particular country-they may be well known members of the local community with other roles, professional or otherwise-I would not like to think that getting a consular posting would provide a mechanism for circumventing the requirement for people to register as agents, particularly when they are offering paid immigration assistance. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney General (Mr Duncan) can clarify that these arrangements would not enable such consular, diplomatic or other personnel to charge fees. We might need to look at that question again if they were charging fees. Finally, I indicate that, after this legislation was first in the House and then dealt with by the Senate, the President of the Law Society of New South Wales was in touch with both the Minister and me, concerned that there were a number of serious complaints made against some members of the legal profession about its self-regulatory approach. The criticism offered by the Minister was that they had 'not responded with adequate timeliness or vigour'. Mr Marsden states in his letter to the Minister: If you had been in possession of any information such as might substantiate this allegation of serious complaints against members of the legal profession, it would have been appropriate for you to have supplied the relevant legal professional bodies with that information. As the president of the largest legal professional organisation in Australia, I am bound to point out to you that I have never received from you any such information at all. I assume that that is during his term of office-which I might add is only this year. The letter continues: Any suggestion that the self-regulatory mechanisms of the Law Society of New South Wales do not respond with adequate timeliness or vigour to appropriate information of this kind is most strongly resisted. It is a defamatory allegation which we, as a profession, deeply resent. We take real and justifiable pride in the efficiency and diligence which characterise these mechanisms. He goes on: The unsubstantiated suggestion that there is a need for some progress to be made by the legal profession in strengthening its self-regulatory mechanisms was subsequently repeated in your speech when you want to assert that, while there will be an evaluation after two years of the relevant registration arrangements, one of the issues that will be considered in such evaluation is whether or not any such 'progress' has been made. The President, Mr Marsden, invited the Minister to provide him with relevant information to substantiate the remarks. I am aware that these comments have been made from time to time about members of the legal profession. I would certainly like to think that, where. complaints had been made to the Department about the conduct of members of the legal profession, when those complaints had been investigated they were followed up by the Department and complaints made to the professional bodies. I have always assumed that that was done. If it has not been done, it is unfortunate that we are making these suggestions against the legal profession. I would like to have an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that he will have the Minister clarify this matterthat the appropriate cases that were brought to the attention of the Law Society and the absence of appropriate disciplinary action can be drawn to Mr Marsden's attention and clarifiedso that there is not this contest between the profession and the Government. I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary would appreciate the important reason why, in terms of the credibility of this legislation, that ought to be done. I would seek his assurance in relation to that matter.",92
183,Mr DUNCAN,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,I will be happy to refer the matter to the Minister and ensure that he takes the appropriate steps. Mr Ruddock-Can the Minister brief us on the impact of the consular representatives and assure us that they are not able to do these things by charging fees?,94
184,Mr DUNCAN,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I do not have information on that matter directly, but I will also ensure that matter is taken up promptly by the Minister so that it can be dealt with expeditiously and I hope to the satisfaction of the honourable gentleman.

186,Mr BILNEY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Kingston-Minister for Defence Science and Personnel) (5.06 p.m.)I move: That amendments Nos 1 and 3 be disagreed to. The two amendments under discussion have the effect of reducing the time for the prima facie stage of a dumping inquiry from 25 days to five days. Those amendments are not acceptable because, in the first place, five days leaves insufficient time to give effect to the requirements under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade anti-dumping code and the requirements of Australia's domestic legislation relating to the consideration of application for anti-dumping relief prior to the initiation of an anti-dumping investigation. Secondly, five days leaves insufficient time to comply with the requirement under the GATT subsidies code for consultation with affected governments for the purpose of clarifying a situation and arriving at a mutually agreed solution prior to the initiation of a subsidisation countervailing duty inquiry. In the third place, a five-day prima facie period effectively nullifies the reforms contained in the Bill which enable the Australian Customs Service to supplement an application for 43, dumping relief with other relevant information by leaving the ACS with insufficient time to obtain and properly weigh such other information. It is pretty clear-indeed, it is common knowledge-that we should disallow these amendments.",96

Motion (by Mr Bilney) proposed: That the amendments be agreed to.",97
192,Mr JULL,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"I am sorry to stop the flow of what is turning out to be a most productive afternoon, but the Opposition has some very great difficulties with the amendments that have been sent back to us by the Senate to apply to part 2 of the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill in relation to the Air Navigation Act. Madam Deputy Chairman, you may remember that when this Bill originally came into the House of Representatives, in a bipartisan way both the Government and the Opposition supported it. We supported the Bill because all that was involved was that certain offences committed under the Air Navigation Act were taken out of regulations and physically put into the Bill. The legislation went over to the Senate and was under a guillotine when the Australian Democrats put up absolutely preposterous amendmentSMr Bruce Scott-What is new for the Democrats?",99
193,Mr JULL,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"That is nothing new for the Democrats. Unfortunately, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) supported the amendments because, he said, the concerns of the Democrats were reasonably based. He offered no other reason because of the time constraint. It was a relatively minor matter, but what have we ended up with? It is really quite startling. For example, international aircraft that do not land at designated international airports commit an offence. At the moment the penalty that is imposed by the Government is a fine of $5,000 and that imposed on an individual is two years gaol. We found that, for some unknown reason, the Democrats moved an amendment that the penalty be increased to $100,000. Clause 5 concerns the licensing of international airlines. The legislation provides for a $100,000 fine if unlicensed aircraft operate scheduled international air services over, into or out of Australian territory. The Democrats increased the fine to $500,000 and the gaol penalty to seven years. In clause 7 of the Bill, relating to nonscheduled international flights by Australian aircraft, the fine was set at $5,000. Amendment No.4 increases it to $100,000, or two years gaol for an individual. Clause 8 of the Bill concerns non-scheduled flights by aircraft with the nationality of a contract and sets the fine for contravention of the legislation at $5,000. Amendment No. 5 increases it to $100,000, or two years gaol. Clause 9 concerns non-scheduled flights by aircraft not possessing the nationality of a contracting state; the fine for contravention of the provision was $5,000; amendment No. 6 increases it to $100,000, or two years gaol. Amendment No.7 increases the penalty for failing to get permission for international flights from $5,000 to $100,000, or two years gaol for the individual. Amendment No. 8-1 think this was the hang-up of the Democrats-related to conditions for the carriage of munitions that had not been declared. The fine went from $5,000 to $100,000 or, in the case of an individual, seven years gaol. It is quite fascinating to look at the statements of the Democrats spokesperson, Senator Powell, justifying the increases. She said that the Democrats .were seeking to bring penalties to a better and more appropriate standard. She thought the punishment must fit the crime. She regarded munitions trafficking as very serious. As I say, the Minister-I suppose because of the pressure of the guillotine-just said, 'It all sounds reasonable to me. We will let it through'. The guillotine was placed on what was really a non-contentious Bill. It has resulted in these amendments. The real· difficulty I have with them is that I think we have started to go absolutely stark raving mad in terms of the administration of aviation in this country. It would appear that there are elements within the Parliament who think that everybody who flies an aircraft is an absolute ratbag or, at worse, a criminal. Let me say that aviation is a very specialised area. Most people who fly aircraft in Australia-there are 8,500 private aircraft; we are talking about only 500 commercial aircraft-are very responsible people. Do the Democrats really think that the people who fly aircraft will breach some of the awards on purpose? Of course, they will not. It has been decided that what could well be an inadvertent breach of a regulation which is in the Act now becomes a major criminal offence. One really wonders what it is all about and state whether some of the penalties that we are putting on the aviation industry are nothing more than a revenue raising exercise. Quite frankly, I think that the aviation industry is finding it increasingly difficult to bear some of the penalties and restrictions that have been floating around. I suppose it is fair enough for the Democrats to have this hangup about munitions. But in an international sense we look particularly foolish. If people are going to go into gun running or smuggling, do we honestly believe that a fine of this magnitude will stop them? We are talking about big intemational business and big international corruption; I do not think these measures will do a thing. As I have said, when the BiH was origina11y in this place, the Government thought it was fair enough to maintain those penalties in the Act, as did the Opposition. Everybody was happy. Then it went to the other place and the Democrats put the cat amongst the pigeons and the whole place went berserk. I think it would do us the world of good if we opposed these amendments, as we should, because they reaUy do make us something of a laughing stock in terms of the international marketplace. As I have said, the pressures that have been put on the aviation industry, which comprises really most responsible people, are just getting too much. The Democrats may be really. worried about some of the people who operate in aviation. But I checked with the Department this afternoon and was told that it is unlikely that there would be even 20 ratbags in the whole of the aviation industry in Australia; I would be surprised if there were even half that number. It seems to me that we are letting the Democrats get away with murder on this, and it is my intention to oppose this most vigorously.",100
194,Mr BILNEY,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"Kingston-Minister for Defence Science and Personnel) (5.21 p.m.)I am not notorious for agreeing with the Australian Democrats particularly often; and in some ways I am not their favourite person. But on this occasion the Government has agreed to support, and wiH support here, the amendments that were made in the other place. While some of the points that were made by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) seem plausible, I will point out two or three things. In the first place, he referred to Hollis, C. the carriage of munitions and gun running. It is the case that the fines proposed and the amendments are consistent with the Crimes (Aircraft) Act provisions so far as the carriage Kerr, D. J. C. of dangerous goods is concerned. So there is consistency there and I think the amendments are defensible on those grounds. In the second place, the penalties to which the honourable member for Fadden referred may seem draconian when one looks at the maximum penalties, but they are maximum penalties and the courts have the discretion to impose lesser penalties, including fines rather than imprisonment, for those offences. In the third place, white the figure of $100,000 for corporations may seem large, it is the case that typica11y in legislation fines that are provided for corporations are about five times those suggested for individuals. Speaking more generally, I do think that the community is right to express its opposition to offences of this kind through penalties, which I believe would constitute a deterrent to some of these activities. Therefore, the Government supports the amendments. Question put: That the amendments be agreed to. The Committee divided. [5.27 p.m.] (The Deputy Chairman- Mrs K.J.

Motion (by Mr Bilney) proposed: That the amendments be agreed to.",101
195,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The need to consider these amendments is entirely due, once again, to the lack of ordinary forethought given by the Government to its legislation in general and to its tax legislation in particular. I suspect that, without knowing the details, most of the amendments being discussed here this afternoon are also attributable to this lack of legislative competence, which we see displayed by the Government time and time again. Honourable members may recall that we discussed this Bill under the guillotine only a couple of weeks ago. On that occasion we were given less than 48 hours to consider amendments to taxation Acts comprising 1,500 pages in total. That is not just incompetence; it is typical of the arrogance of the Government towards the House of Representatives and the members that go to make up this House. In other words, in the most fundamental way we are denied the opportunity of representing our constituents' wishes time and time again on important taxation measures. We have before us now a series of Government amendments introduced in the Senate. Not only was the Government unable, because of a lack of foresight and legislative end- competence, to introduce this defective legislation in this House; it has to rely on the only true legislative chamber in the Parliamentthe Senate-as a venue for doing what is right and necessary. We do not oppose these measures. We think there are amendments put forward by the coalition in the Senate which should also have .been adopted by the became Government. In some cases at least, and probably in most cases, our amendments would have served to improve the quality of the legislation in the sense that it would. make it more workable and more in line with the Government's stated aims. The Govertunent seems reluctant to accept that many of the technical amendments proposed by the coalition were simply to make the legislation work, as it was intended, according to the statements-both press and second reading statements-of the Government. We find time and time again in this Parliament that the Government refuses, firstly, to give us the opportunity to debate legislation because it finds it necessary to introduce the guillotine, and, secondly, we are denied the opportunity to improve the Government's inadequate legislation. There are proposed amendments from the Senate to depreciation changes. The explanatory memorandum states: ' The amendment gives effect to the Government's announced intentions and will prevent a potentially significant but unquantifiable loss to the revenue. There we have it. Even the Government admits that its first effort to legislate did not meet its own. announced intentions-and that is the point I have already made. Furthermore, it now says that it cannot tell us how much 'saving' - if that is the right word-to the revenue will be realised by the proposed amendment to depreciation changes. The explanatory memorandum merely states that 'a potentially significant but unquantifiable loss to the revenue' will be involved by these amendments. Furthermore, the amendments will be backdated to 26 February 1992. Once again, businesses and taxpayers-those affected-will have arranged their affairS on the basis of the first draft and the Government's stated intentions, yet we have further amendments to the legislation, which could not possibly have been taken into account. Here we are on the eve of the close of the financial year for most businesses and business people in Australia. A further amendment is proposed involving the disposal of consideration on the expiry of an asset. We have no objection to that either. Our overall objection is to the fact that debate was unnecessarily curtailed in this chamber in the first place and due entirely to the incompetence, shaded by arrogance, of this Government towards the Parliament. This is not an isolated example because invariably at the end of sittings-not necessarily always-we have to deal with legislation such as this with great ramifications for the affairs of taxpayers around Australia under these circumstances. There can be absolutely no excuse for this happening time and again, as it does. I again put that on the record. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported; report adopted. INT-RNATIONAL AIR SERVICES COMMISSION BILL 1992 . Second Reading Debate resumed. (Quorum formed)",103
196,Mr LEE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I thank my colleagues for entering the chamber to hear my speech. The legislation before the House was introduced to establish an international air services commission whose responsibility it will be to divide up capacity and routes, given the Government's decision to allow multiple designation of carriers for international aviation into Australia. The first thing to remember is that this is simply the latest development in a series of initiatives which this Labor Government has been responsible for. It was the Hawke Labor Government which took the courageous step to terminate the two airlines agreement. Notice of the termination of that agreement was given in 1987 and in 1990 we started to see the results of that courageous decision when Compass Airlines started up and provided dramatic competition in Australia's domestic aviation market. Consumers, Australia's air travellers, were provided with significant reductions in air fares. There was a massive increase in the number of travellers and it is this Government-and in fact my colleague the honourable member for  Minister for Aviation when the two-airline agreement termination decision was made, and others-which took the courageous decision to press ahead with deregulation of our domestic aviation. The International Air Services Commission Bill seeks to extend that to the international sector. In the One Nation statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Government announced that it had decided to allow Qantas to compete in the domestic aviation market. The Government decided to allow our domestic aviation carriers-then Australian and Ansett, and perhaps Compass in the futureto apply for and compete on international aviation routes to and from Australia. In addition, in the One Nation statement the Government announced that it wanted to have a single aviation market across the Tasman so that carriers flying within Australia would also be able to fly to and from and within New Zealand. Of course, Air New Zealand has asked for equivalent rights within Australia and I understand that negotiations between the Australian and New Zealand governments are reaching a successful conclusion which will ensure that in the not too distant future we will have that single aviation market and as a result more competition, lower fares and an increase in the number of passengers flying the Tasman routes. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may ask what the result of that will be. The result will be an expansion in tourism in both countries. There will also be an expansion in the number of jobs in our country as a result of that greater competition. Since the One Nation statement, the Government has taken two further decisions in aviation. The first is to merge Qantas and Australian Airlines, a move which I believe for the first time will allow ""Qantas to compete on an equal footing with other major international airlines. We all know that airlines such as United and Continental often offer incentives to Australian travellers that if fly with their airlines they can get cheap flights in the United States on the domestic routes of those airlines. Likewise, British Airways says that Australians travelling with that airline to the United Kingdom can get cheap flights throughout Europe on British Airways. In my view, we have always held Qantas back by not allowing Qantas a proper competitive basis. My colleague the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), who is in the chamber, would understand how important it is that Qantas be given a fair chance to take on its international competitors. Mr Bruce Scott-And another runway at Sydney, too.",104
197,Mr LEE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The honourable member for Maranoa, who is at the table, says that another runway is needed at Sydney. Of course, this Government has taken the courageous decision to build an extra runway at Kingsford-Smith Airport, a decision which was the subject of some controversy. Mr Connolly-It is 10 years too late.",105
198,Mr LEE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Did the honourable member for Bradfield say that it is 10 years too late?,105
199,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Hon. J.D.M. Dobie) Order!,105
200,Mr LEE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I beg your pardon, Mr Deputy Speaker; I was being provoked by some members opposite. The honourable member for Bradfield is a bit afraid to acknowledge it, but I hate to remind him that 10 years ago a government of which he was a part decided to build not a medium-space runway at Kingsford-Smith but a close-space parallel runway which would have provided a minor increase in capacity at Kingsford-Smith and then we would have had to look at another runway. History has already shown that the decision by the previous Liberal Government to make a patchwork solution of the closespace parallel runway was the wrong decision and thank God a Labor government was elected in 1983. What decision did the former Government make on the second international airway for Sydney? There is silence on the other side of the chamber. No decision was made on the they second international airway. The previous shadow Minister for aviation said that we need to make sure that we get a second international airport for Sydney up and running as soon as possible, but what was done by those opposite .about providing that extra infrastructure we need to develop our tourism? Mr Grace-Nothing.",105
201,Mr LEE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Nothing, as the honourable member for Fowler interjects. I am pleased to see the honourable member for Fowler in the chamber. We all know that he has fought quite vocally and with great vigour to ensure that the Government puts funds into the development of the international airport at Badgerys Creek as soon as possible. I understand that he has recently been able to persuade the Cabinet that $56.1m should be provided to ensure that stage 1 commences in the very near future. Mr Grace-Friday morning.",105
202,Mr LEE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"A ceremony next Friday morning will result in the first sod being turned for stage 1 of the Badgerys Creek airport. I think that is a great credit not only to this Government but also to the honourable member for Fowler for ensuring that the Government meets its responsibilities in this area. We should ensure that we all understand the purpose of this Bill, which is to ensure that there is a multiple designation regime for international aviation and that that will be introduced by 1993. The new International Air Services Commission will start operation in one week's time, so it is very timely legislation. The International Air Services Commission will be an independent body to allocate aviation capacity and route entitlements amongst Australia's international carriers-Qantas, the existing international carrier, perhaps Ansett, Compass if it decides to apply for international routes, and any other new aviation company that decides to start up in Australia. The bases for allocating these aviation rights are as follows: first of all, we want to ensure that all carriers have an opportunity to compete. Secondly, we think we have to balance the rights of new entrants against those of Qantas, the existing Australian international carrier. Thirdly, we want to minimise the extent of bureaucratic delay and bureaucratic burden. We also want to ensure that all processes are accountable and transparent. I think those four factors will ensure that this body performs its responsibilities properly. We should understand that this is a very complex issue. Qantas has invested tens of millions of dollars in advertising, in purchasing aircraft and in training its staff to build up its customer base on many international routes. It would not be fair to Qantas to say that overnight it has to vacate many of these international routes to some new Australian carrier-a competitor, whether it is Ansett or anyone else. Qantas has earned the right to ensure that it does not overnight routes which it has built up and invested money in over many years, and in some cases decades. You will be aware, M1' Deputy Speaker, that Qantas has done a great job in expanding tourism to Australia. Qantas spends a lot of money advertising the benefits of travelling to Australia and other countries. I think we need to remember how much Qantas earns for Australia's balanl;!e of payments. Some members of this House, including one or two from the other side of the chamber, say that tourism should always come first. I think all of us accept that tourism is a growth industry. It has created a lot of employment in Australia. At the same time, I do not think we should be taking actions which create benefits for overseas international airlines at the expense of Qantas when there is not a demonstrated benefit to Australia's tourist industry. I think all members of this House should be seeking to balance those two competing interests-the interests of Qantas earning revenue for Australia, which is good for our balance of payments, and the interests of Australia's tourist industry, which we should not be holding back from development. This Bill proposes that multiple designation apply to all routes, subject to the agreement of our bilateral aviation partners. I understand that a small number of those routes are still subject to single designation and that the Minister will be seeking to negotiate to convert those from single to multiple designation routes as soon as possible. The shadow Minister for aviation, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), in his contribution was critical of some aspects of the Government's aviation policy. In one area he claimed that this Government should have. done more to allow charter carriers to bring tourists to Australia. For the record, I mention to the House that it was this Government which relaxed the charter guidelines in 1987 and again in 1990, with the aim of encouraging greater numbers of tourists to Australia, and therefore an expansion in jobs in this area. The Government agreed to charter flights initially, which have lose ended up testing the market, and finally to develop the market so it will be mature enough to sustain scheduled services. Examples of that are Air Lanka and Air Mauritius. While this Bill provides for the Secretary to the Department of Transport and Communications to have the final authority to approve charters, the proposed commission will have the power to provide advice to the Minister and the Secretary to the Department. That procedure will allow people who wish to develop charter flights to put their views before the Government and the Secretary to the Department. As to the Government's performance in seeking to expand tourism and increase the number of overseas travellers who come to Australia, I think we can be very proud of the achievements of this Government, and in particular the honourable member for Shortland and his colleague in the Hawke Government Ministry, the former member for Parramatta, Me John Brown, who put great emphasis on seeking to achieve an increase in the number of tourists travelling to Australia. In 1983, only about one million international visitors came to Australia. That number has grown at an average annual rate of almost 12 per cent a year. That is a great expansion in tourism and a great expansion in jobs. In 1991, over 2112 million international visitors came to Australia. Many people have been responsible for that success-including Paul Hog-n and Greg Norman, who have volunteered their services to' help promote Australia-not to mention Australia's film industry, which has helped to generate recognition for Australia. People such as the honourable member for Shortland and Mr John Brown can be very proud of their achievements in this area. Given the time and my understanding that other members wish to contribute to this debate, I conclude by congratulating the Minister on putting forward the proposal to establish this independent commission, which will be responsible for allocating capacity and routes. There are provisions in this legislation which I believe will strike the right balance between protecting Qantas's interests, protecting Australia's interests and ensuring at the same time that we do not hold back the growth and development of Australia's tourist industry.",105
203,Mr BRADFORD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I did not originally plan to say anything in this debate, but I was somewhat provoked by the remarks of the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee). It is fine for Government members to stand up here and talk about the Government's achievements in aviation, but unfortunately the facts do not bear out the honourable member's claims at all. Recently we experienced the airline dispute. I do not see how that could have been regarded in any way as an achievement. In fact, it was a terrible blot not only on this country's industrial relations history but also on its airline industry. At that time we saw how the Government sided constantly with the companies involved in that dispute and how the then Prime Minister denigrated pilots with the sorts of comments he made about their being glorified bus drivers. Recently, under freedom of information legislation, as the result of a request from the pilots' union, we saw evidence of clandestine meetings in the office of the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, attended by representatives of the ACTU and the chief executives of both the airlines. Available now for all to see is evidence of the extent of the behind the scenes deals that were going on between the Government and the airlines to destroy the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. The result of that-and it is still going on-is that there are unemployed Australian pilots in this country and many other Australian pilots have had to break up their families and go overseas to find work. If that is an achievement of this Government in aviation, I would like to see some improvement in what it has done. I think it is absolutely disgraceful that we still have overseas pilots working here, flying Australian aircraftMr Bruce Scott-Taking Aussie pilots' jobs.",107
204,Mr BRADFORD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"They have taken jobs from Australian pilots, and that is a very sad situation indeed. The honourable member for Dobell talked about deregulation and suggested that we did not pursue that as rapidly as we could have. It would have come with time. Let us see how the Government went about deregulating the airline industry. Immediately prior to deregulation, it signed agreements with the two major airlines-these are the sorts of deals with mates that this Government is renowned for-making it, if not impossible, then very difficult for any new airline to get started. I do not pretend that Brian Grey did not make mistakes with the setting up of Compass-he clearly did; but he set up the company with one hand tied behind his back and the other one rendered half inoperable because this Government, prior to deregulation, signed long term lease agreements for virtually all of the terminal space in Australia to be the exclusive province of Ansett and Australian Airlines. The only access Compass was given to terminals around Australia relied on the cooperation of one or the other major airline. That was another disgraceful act, a despicable act. It was a deal that this Government did, the same way as it dealt with the two major airlines in those meetings in the Prime Minister's office during the pilots dispute. did the same sort of deal with the major airlines in respect of terminal space immediately prior to deregulation. What sort of deregulation have we had? We have seen a lot of people hurt, not only people who invested their money",107
205,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Order! I remind the honourable member of the title of the Bill we are discussing. I ask him to get back to the Bill.,108
206,Mr BRADFORD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I wanted only to take the opportunity to address some of the issues. As I said earlier, I was provoked to do so only by some of the issues that were raised by the honourable member for Dobell. The other issue he mentioned was the third runway. I suppose that was fairly well covered. The Government has been dragged down to the point where it has been prepared to move forward with the third runway; that is the best interpretation I can place on it. It has had environmental impact study upon environmental impact study, so we know about the Government's commitment to that. The honourable member for Dobell also mentioned tourism. I happen to have a great direct interest in tourism, and aviation is an important component of tourism. We on this side have great hopes for tourism. In fact, we believe that under Fightback we will see the number of international visitors to this country actually quadrupled between now and the year 2000. But that will occur only if the sorts of changes we envisage are in place. Sydney Airport is a major problem in respect of that expansion, and I was pleased to hear today from the honourable member that there is at last some movement occurring at Badgerys Creek. The rapid construction of Badgerys Creek is an important component of Australia's ability to reap the rewards and benefits that will be there if tourism is enabled to grow.  p.m.)-Of all people to be talking about the in effects of a GST upon tourism, one would think the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) would be the last to show his It head. The effect of a GST is to provide a substantial incentive for people to holiday abroad. People holidaying within Australia, Australians holidaying in Australia, will be subject to all the impact of a GST-well in excess of 15 per cent as it is moved across the various parts of the transactions. That impacts upon domestic travellers and domestic holiday makers. Inbound holiday makers, the ones we are trying to encourage in this country, are also clobbered with the 15 per cent and all of its consequences. But if people want a holiday abroad they get an exemption; they do not have to pay the GST. That is a clear incentive. I suggest to my honourable friend that he think again, because his constituents and small business people would be absolutely clobbered, slugged by the imposition of a GST. The sheer ramifications of collection of a GST, recording every transaction, the cost of collecting it, storing all those documents for seven years, are horrendous. I say to him that in two ways the Opposition is really going to knife the tourism industry in his part of Australia. It is fascinating to listen to the honourable member for MCPherson talking about the pilots dispute. Those who were in this Parliament at that time know very well the role the Opposition played in extending that dispute. I said at the time that one member of the Opposition was behaving as if he were an agent of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. The Opposition by its succour, by its support, by its public adulation of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, extended that dispute and maximised the damage to the tourism industry. So members of the Opposition should not come into this place and clamour to us about the pilots dispute. The honourable member for MCPherson was party to it, his colleagues extended it, and the Opposition bears responsibility for much of the damage. As to the question he raised about meetings with the airlines and Ministers, if he goes back and reads the newspapers he will find that one of those meetings was held in Melbourne. There was a large press conference after it and everybody who was at the meeting was at the press conference. It was all clear and above board. When we on our side of the House are developing policy and responses, we have to speak to people. We cannot develop policies and views in silence. So those matters are really no problem; that is really trivia. The pilots dispute was all about increasing productivity in the airline industry. Why? To make air travel more affordable in this country. Air travel is just another form of public transport. It ought to be available to many people in this country as possible. We as a government and a party are totally committed to that objective. We fought for it over years. We opposed the snide extension of the two-airline agreement just prior to the 1980 election. No-one knew there had been a backroom deal until mid-1981. Fancy the Opposition talking about secret discussions! The two-airline agreement was extended in a secret discussion which nobody knew anything about until after it was all signed, sealed and delivered in 1980. It came out in the course of debate and discussion in 1981. That is why there was a split in the Liberal Party over it. The reasoning involved with the pilots dispute was to improve substantially productivity in the airline industry, and it has done just that. The Liberal Party is one of the parties that are clamouring about increasing productivity. We do not clamour about it; we achieve it. In that industry there has been an enormous increase in aircrew flying hours. The Opposition was supporting a situation where pilots were flying an average of eight hours a week at the stick and getting paid a full week's wages. They are all the kinds of inequities",108
207,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Order! As I did with the last speaker, I remind the honourable member to get back to the subject of the Bill before the House.  Speaker, far be it from me to move away from your ruling. I shall very quickly return to the breadth of your ruling. Productivity is important to international airlines, just as it is to domestic airlines; they are interwoven. I make the point to the House that airwaves and airways are very valuable national resources. One of the legacies we inherited from conservative governments over the decades was that, because they are very valuable national resources and because they can provide very large amounts of private profit and private benefit, they were heavily regulated by successive conservative governments, with the result that, whereas the two-airline agreement was of use and served Australia to some extent in its early years, it as long outlived its usefulness and restrained the growth of airline travel in this country. As we saw last year, some 16.7 million Australians flew within this country-a 30 per cent increase on the previous year, if my figures are correct. That came about because we as a government formed a view that the agreement had to be reviewed as it was a major adjunct to international airline travel. The agreement has since been terminated and Australians are now getting the benefit of that through greater competition. Similarly, the airwaves are regulated and some television stations did very well, thank you very much, and continue to look to further regulation of the airwaves. But the international airways and our rights under air service agreements are extremely valuable, and no nation in this world lightly enters into agreements or changes to air service agreements without consideration of its national interest. We need only look to Japan, the United States, France and the European Community to see how jealously they guard their rights under their air service agreements, and how parsimonious they are in changing those rights or giving out any benefits. The Bill before us will provide for an International Air Services Commission that will perform the task of examining applications for access to international air routes, evaluating those applications and making decisions, in that way keeping the decisions at arm's length from the Government. Some people would say that overall in international air travel Australia is a pretty small player. There is some substance to that. We are a pretty small player in many ways. We have only one designated international carrier because on the scale of airlines we are small. But the amalgamation of Australian Airlines with our designated international carrier, Qantas, will strengthen the domestic base of our international carrier, while there are routes that Qantas does not see as appropriate to operate. I will not go through all the legislation that is provided for because the Bill has been covered in second reading speeches in both places. I will, however, touch upon some parts of it. The International Airlines Commission will have the responsibility of determining the outcome of applications by airlines for capacity and route entitlements available under Australia's bilateral air service agreement. Its task is to determine and identify which designated carriers are selected to operate particular routes, to allocate available capacity and to set necessary conditions. With that responsibility the Commission must look to maximising the public benefit to be gained from the utilisation of that capacity. It would allocate capacity only to those Australian carriers which are reasonably capable of gaining the necessary approvals to operate on the route and are reasonably capable of implementing their proposals. The Bill provides for a definition of 'public benefit' and provides that the Commission in its considerations must have regard to the re-. quirement that there be a positive impact on Australian aviation industry structures. I mentioned the two-airline agreement earlier. The two-airline agreement is a superb example of regulation of a national resource to suit or benefit a particular party regardless of ownership or the individuals involved. It outliv- its usefulness. It is said in some quarters that, if Qantas and Australian are amalgamated and there is another domestic operator, that domestic operator should automatically have a right to international services. That proposal raises a lot of questions in people's minds. International rights to operate are very valuable. They are a national asset. With the regulation and utilisation of the airwaves we say in the case of pay TV, 'Let us put those out to tender'. There is a very good argument for putting out to tender the rights to operate any unused air service or new international air service so that the people of this country get the benefit of it. Those who are interested will make a commercial judgment as to how much they would like to tender, whether it is appropriate to operate or not, whether it is worth having a go at or whether it is something they will walk away from and not be interested in. They are all matters for commercial judgment; they are not matters for governments to determine or, as some would say, give away. The Commission's hearings will be public and it will have the responsibility of assessing those applications. It will have the responsibility of assessing the .rights that are presently under-utilised, assessing new ones that come up for renewal as a result of expiry, and assessing new routes that may be developed with other countries. In addition it will be required to ensure that decisions concerning the matters set out in the legislation are in the public benefit. Let me make a comparison with what happens in other countries. Four main countries have had to develop mechanisms for handling the determination of airlines' rights in a multiple designation environment. As I interpret the legislation, it is silent on multiple designation. It does not say that there should be one other operator; the matter is left unclear and unspoken. There could two, three, four or five operators, and that is how it should be. If New Zealand comes into create a single market with Australia, it should not be left to just the existing operators if there are other domestic airlines, such as Compass, that want to be in that service. They should have the freedom to participate in that business. After all, it is just another transport business. There is nothing magic about the airline business in the sense that it should have special treatment from the Government. There is nothing magic in the sense that dollars are counted any differently. If the business is run efficiently, is not too highly geared, markets well, provides a good product and competes well, it will do all right. If it does not, it will suffer the same problems that any other kind of business suffers if it does not compete well in the market and manage its business well. The UK has a civil aviation authority. It has responsibility for licensing and the economic regulation of airline aCtivity. As with the Commission proposed in this Bill, the CAA conducts public hearings on matters relating to designation. It is not at ann's length from the Government as the proposed Commission in this country will be, and the ultimate decision on designation is made by the Minister of State for Transport. But the determinations made by the Minister can be appealed against. When the CAA started out with that kind of arrangement it was a pretty stormy sort of activity, but in the period it has settled down. The United States has a much more legalistic approach and has no body comparable to the Commission proposed in this legislation. The process remains essentially under the control of the Department of Transport. In the US it is an administrative law judge that makes determinations as to carrier designation. The judge passes this determination to a senior career official in the Department, who reviews the decision and makes an announcement .as to the arrangements which will apply. The Department may overturn the decision, but it would have to justify that. This acts as a check or balance 'on Executive power. But, again, that process is not at arm's length, as the Commission provided for in this legislation will be. As· I said, the process in the United States is more legalistic. It is a costly and timeconsuming process. As I understand it, the United States does not have any better alternative at. the moment. In Japan there is no formal process for the making of designation determinations. The arrangements which eventuate generally arise out of a series of discussions and negotiations between the governments and the airlines. The Commission that we are putting before the Parliament is in a way singular. The system we are bringing in here is part of the process that this .Government has pursued with vigour since it came into office to deregulate and free upthe airline system, both domestically and internationally. We see transport as a major component of overall economic activity, and we see public transport such as the airlines as a service that ought to be available to all Australians and not restricted to the 10 to 15 per cent of Australians who were able to travel by air when this Government came to office. Do not let anybody in the Opposition raise in this chamber the two-airline agreement. It is the creature of those opposite. They cemented it in history. They kept it in history as long as they possibly could. They ensured in their 1981 legislation that it would be in force for another eight years. They split their own Party about it. To those who would come since in here and lecture the Government about deregulation I say, 'Go back and look at your own performance because no-one takes you seriously. Your record is well and truly known'. Similarly, in respect of international airline services, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), almost from time immemorial in this place, has clamoured about letting more airlines into the country and letting more airlines flow. His own Party did not believe him. He was Chairman of the Select Committee on Tourism and his own Government did not believe him. His Committee brought down a report. Prime Minister Fraser did not accept him. He did not have any currency. I have respect for him as an individual and as an honourable member, but I could almost express his views verbatim because I have heard them so many times. They are slightly embellished from time to time, but the message is essentially the same as the one he was putting out in 1976-77. I tum to the growth of the international airline market. We see that there was a downturn in international air travel last year. The report from the ICAO states that total aviation traffic was down 4 per cent in 1991 and international air traffic was down 5 per cent. The ICAO report made the point that in international terms that was the first year since the 19408 that world scheduled traffic had shown a decline. However, as a result of the efforts and decisions of this Government the picture in 1991 was totally different in Australia. Due mainly to the effects of deregulation, 1991 domestic passenger numbers were up nearly 30 per cent on the previous year, and even outstripped traffic growth .in the previous record year, 1988, when hIgh traffic was created by the Expo and bicentenary events. As I mentioned before, in the year ending December 1991, a record 16.7 million domestic passengers were carried. There is growth in international travel into Australia. I think 84.8 per cent of those passengers are carried by the top 10 airlines operating to this country. Parliament needs to bear in· mind that just a few years ago we saw the extension of air service rights or opportunities to operate into this country extended to a number of minor international airlines, which had the effect of devaluing Qantas. Those who were interested in floating or purchasing Qantas naturally looked to what routes it operated, what security it had on those routes and what profit could be earned on those routes. But then the Kangaroo route was opened up to a number of minor airlines, which are yet to produce substantial figures of traffic into this country. There is not a tougher business than the international airline business. We are a nation of 17.6 million people. We have 42 international airlines operating into this country. We have the prospect of more operators moving into the international scene to bring people to this country. I want to make the point that that decision by bureaucrats did have a damaging effect on the value of Qantas, and people need to rememher and understand that. We are looking to continuing growth in the tourism market. Sydney took 48.9 per cent of the market in 1991 with 4.2 million passengers; Melbourne 19.7 per cent; and Brisbane 13.8 per cent. The top 10 carriers accounted for 84.8 per cent of the total passenger market for the 1991 year. The growth is there. It is a tough business to be in. We have a good product to offer international travellers in this country. There are two things that need to happen: firstly, we need to he as efficient as we can in the operation of airport services. People do not remember the colour of the paint on the outside of the terminal; they remember the smiles on the faces of the people who greet them and the price and quality of the services they enjoyed when they were here. Secondly, we need to do more in marketing Australia's destinations abroad. If we take the international airline policy of this Government, our domestic aviation policy and our very effective and vigorous policy towards tourism together, then we can continue to develop this industry and Australia's economy.

209,Mr ROBERT BROWN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is another significant step along the path of fundamental reform initiated by the Government since taking office in 1983, reform which is transforming Australia's industrial relations landscape. The measures it proposes exemplify this Government's approach to industrial relations reform, as distinct from the Opposition's alternative. The fundamental elements of our approach are: a flexible industrial relations system that at the same time enhances efficiency and equity at the workplace and responds to national macro-economic imperatives; the existence of democratic organisations of employees and employers to represent the interests of their members, as in all truly free societies; a role for public institutions, notably independent industrial tribunals, to provide social protections through the safety net provided by an effective award system and to contribute to industrial stability through the machinery of conciliation and arbitration; consultation and cooperation between workers, their unions and employers as essential ways to ensure that industrial reform and workplace changes are best framed and implemented on a sustainable basis; and a legitimate and necessary government role in reforms through supportive policies and labour market programs to promote desired outcomes at the national, industry and enterprise levels. Abandoning the reform process to the whims of the market through deregulation would be counterproductive. This practical approach, founded on firm social democratic values, is directed towards delivering the best and fairest economic outcomes for Australia. It recognises the vital role that our industrial relations institutions and practices have to play in achieving these outcomes. A best and fairest economy is marked by internal cohesiveness, flexibility, optimum development of the skills and productive performance of the people, and sustained growth in living standards with a fair distribution of national incomes. Accordingly, since 1983, this Government has set out systematically to pursue these objectives by applying Labor's approach to delivering practical reforms: we have applied a flexible accord wages policy responsive to Australia's economic circumstances; this has delivered responsible wage outcomes, a dramatic expansion in employment through the 1980s, very low inflation and record low levels of industrial disputation; we have improved the legislative framework governing the Federal industrial relations system; we have strongly supported the overhaul of award and trade union structures in Australia through industrial relations policies, workplace reform programs and assistance for union rationalisation; we are driving fundamental complementary reforms in education and training; and we are managing and overseeing a transformation of industrial attitudes and behaviour, away from the adversarialrelationships of the past and towards the cooperative approach that is most conducive to a new workplace culture; our catalytic programs have helped to accelerate and extend this transformation through wider acceptance of the need for workplace reform and the adoption of international best practice in Australian firms. This careful and sustained reform process has meant drawing together the industrial parties, with the tribunals, to work as one nation. It has necessarily rejected the 'big bang' type of confrontationist approach which would bring confrontation back to the workplace, subvert the 'umpire' role of the independent tribunals, and substitute blind reliance on market forces for wages policy and reform programs. The deregulationist agenda-preoccupied solely with activity at the enterprise level, with negative cost cutting, to the exclusion of industry and national strategies-would lead to the exploitation of the vulnerable and disadvantaged in the community. This would be at the expense of the longer term dynamic strategies-implemented realistically and cooperatively-which are needed for genuine flexibility and development of a mobile, highly skilled work force. Yet these are the prerequisite conditions to produce in Australia the high wage, high productivity type of economy which dominates world markets. The Government proposes through this Bill to extend the process of practical reform that builds on the achievements already made through our approach. We believe that is the priority, not only of Australian workers and their unions but also of the great bulk of the business community. I tum now to the main proposals in the Bill. It has five main elements: a fundamental revision of the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 to facilitate and encourage workplace bargaining; the parties to a dispute within the jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will be enabled to reach agreement on terms to settle the' dispute and to have the agreement certified by the Commission to operate as an award; a provision to enable the Commission to review unfair contracts; conferral of specific duties on the office Vice-President of the Commission in relation to registered organisations of employers and workers; simpler processes for the recovery of unpaid award wages; and improved machinery for national consultation on industrial relations matters. Certified Agreements The key aim of the new certified agreements provisions is to facilitate workplace bargaining agreements that boost productivity and improve the living standards of workers. There is now consensus in Australia on the need to focus industrial relations more directly on the enterprise and workplace. The participants in our system are moving steadily towards accepting greater responsibility for finding their own solutions to industrial differences, in a way which is constructive and produces lasting benefits for employers, workers and the community. The changes made by the Industrial Relations Act in 1988 through the section 115 provision for certified agreements have been recognised as an important step forward. A certified agreement operates as a fixed term 'closed' award for its agreed specified period and does not necessarily have to conform with national wage principles. Until recently, however, all sides-including the Commission-have shown a very cautious attitude towards certified agreements. In practice, and notwithstanding some notable innovative arrangements such as at ICI, there have been relatively few agreements presented for certification. We are clearly past the uncertainties about the benefits of more decentralised bargaining and it is obvious that, for various reasons, the provisions are too restrictive in their operation for current needs. Accordingly, last October, in a parliamentary statement, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) foreshadowed legislative action to address the issue. The Commission in its national wage decision later that month also referred to some difficulties in the provisions. The proposed legislation thus reflects experience with more decentralised bargaining of and the existing provisions. Essentially, we are proposing that, within the scope of the constitutional conciliation and arbitration power, parties to a dispute should be able to settle their differences and prevent future disputes with greater confidence that their agreement will be accepted for certification. Greater prominence will be given to certified agreements. A new division will be included in the Act to deal with such agreements. The division will be prefaced by a clause specifying that the objects of the division are to facilitate the making and certification of agreements and to encourage their use in the prevention and settlement of disputes. The Commission will be required to perform its functions under the new division in a way which furthers these objects as far as practicable. The intended effect of these provisions is to ensure that certified agreements are available as a real alternative to the mainstream award system and not reserved for exceptional circumstances. There will be simple criteria for certification: no disadvantage to employees; the inclusion of dispute-settling provisions; and consultation by unions with their affected members about the agreement. If an agreement applies to a single business, including a project or joint venture, part of a single business, or a single workplace, there must be a single bargaining unit comprising all relevant unions, though the Commission will be able to permit exceptions. A key element of the new certified agreements provisions is that a certified agreement must not disadvantage the employees it covers; in respect of their terms and conditions of employment. The circumstances in which the Commission may find that an agreement will disadvantage employees are specified. It must first consider whether certification would result in the reduction of employment entitlements and protections for employees covered by the agreement, under an award or under any other law that the Commission considers relevant. If the Commission judges that such a reduction would occur, it must consider whether or not the reduction is contrary to the public interest, in the context of the terms and conditions of those employees considered as a whole. The provision is not intended to operate in a way to reduce well-established and accepted standards which apply across the community such as maternity leave, standard hours of work, parental leave, minimum rates of pay, termination change and redundancy provisions and superannuation. This test is designed to allow some flexibility in the arrangements which parties may include in a certified agreement, but to prevent reductions in protections or entitlements if they are unfair or against the interest. The Commission will be able to refuse to certify an agreement which applies more widely than to a single business if, as now, it considers the agreement to be contrary to the public interest. The Commission will only have such a discretion for an agreement which applies to a single business, part of such a business or a single workplace if the Minister for Industrial Relations applies to have the agreement's effect on the public interest considered. This ministerial power will only operate for 18 months as a safeguard while the operation of the new provisions becomes established. In these circumstances, an agreement may be refused certification if it is found substantially to jeopardise the public interest. Similar conditions will apply to the Commission's powers to review an agreement's operation once certified. I should emphasise that the ministerial power is not expected to be used in any but the most extreme circumstances. A certified agreement will still be variable only during its specified period of operation on limited grounds, reflecting the agreement's 'closed' nature. Under the new provisions, where parties agree, they will be able to extend the period of operation of a certified agreement. It is also proposed to change the arrangements which apply after agreements reach the end of their specified period of operation. At present, they cease to have effect after expiry. This has caused some difficulty. It is proposed that, after their specified term expires, agreements continue to operate but in the same manner as other awards. Alternatively, they can be replaced by a new agreement or a mainstream award or simply cancelled. The new division will also contain a number of changes designed to streamline procedures for the certification of agreements and to facilitate their use. There is now a requirement that a Full Bench must deal with agreements which the President considers to be inconsisten.t with general wage fixing principles. This will be removed. So will the requirement prohibiting a certified agreement being based on the terms of another certified public agreement. Where the Commission has grounds for refusing to certify an agreement, it may permit parties to vary the agreementto make it certifiable or it may certify the agreement subject to undertakings as to its operation. The new provisions will represent a more complete approach to certified agreements, reflecting the Government's expectation that the parties will increasingly seek to have their own arrangements accepted and given effect in the federal system. They are designed to accelerate workplace reforms and lift our productivity performance. I emphasise that this will· be undertaken within an effective framework which provides for best practice workplace bargaining, which ensures fairness and which maintains and consolidates appropriate roles for employers, unions and tribunals in the process. Independent Contractors The Bill proposes to amend the Act to: give the Commission power to review unfair contracts for the performance of work by independent contractors; give independent contractors the choice of joining a federally registered union; and maintain and extend the protections against coercion available to independent contractors. There has been considerable misunderstanding of the Government's legislative proposals regarding independent contractors, based either on misinformation or unwillingness to consider the actual effect of the proposals. In developing its proposals, the Government has consulted widely and at length with interested groups, particularly with employers. It has taken into account the needs of industry, as well as those of other relevant interests . .In consequence, the Government made a number of amendments to the Bill before its introduction into this House. The principal change was to remove proposed provisions that would have allowed the Commission to deal with certain industrial disputes about the use of independent contractors. In the Government's view, it was appropriate to clarify the Commission's role in this area because, in a modem economy, it is unrealistic to limit the jurisdiction of the national industrial tribunal strictly to involving only employees in the strict legal sense. Notably, the High Court has found that the principal constitutional power in respect of industrial disputes is not so limited. The Government's view is that the Commission already has a broad jurisdiction over industrial disputes concerning the use of independent contractors instead of employees to perform work, but considered that the issue should be put beyond doubt legislatively, with appropriate guidance for the Commission on how to exercise that jurisdiction. In the consultations with employer bodies, it became clear that they preferred to have the scope of the existing jurisdiction clarified by the High Court. The Government agreed to that course. The other elements of the Government's proposals, to which I have already referred, are still both necessary and desirable. The unfair contract review procedure will allow a party to a contract that is harsh, unfair or against the public interest to apply to the Commission for its review. Where the Commission is of the opinion that the contract is harsh, unfair or against the public interest, it will be able to vary or set aside the contract. It will also have the power to make interim orders to protect the position of a party to the contract, pending the outcome of proceedings. In view of the campaign of concentrated misinformation to which the Government's proposals have been subjected, it is necessary that I, on behalf of the Minister, set the record straight. The Government's proposals do not stop people working as independent contractors, as the Opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) well knows, if that is what they want to do. They do not convert such people into employees. What they will do is provide a cheap and convenient means of redress to individuals who are working as independent contractors and who are being exploited. The Government can only wonder at the antics of the Housing Industry Association and others who are campaigning so vigorously against the proposals. Why do they object so strongly to measures that will protect exploited members of the work force? If there matters is no exploitation, then the proposed provisions will have no operation. Notably, other employer bodies, although they do not regard the legislation as necessary, are not associated with this campaign. These proposals do not introduce uncertainties into the tendering process. They will have no practical application to freely entered into contracts of a commercial nature. Decided cases before the New South Wales industrial tribunal under equivalent legislation make it clear that the Commission will not intervene to protect people who merely regret having entered into commercial contracts. The provisions provide a way to redress situations of unfairness on the merits of the case, without resort to the civil courts and the attendant costs and delays, or the unrestrained abuse of pressure tactics. The new arrangements will operate only on a case by case basis, not on a general or class action basis. One of the extraordinary claims which have been made is that the new provisions will lead to increased prices for houses. This is nonsense. The proposed unfair contracts review procedure is more limited than that now available under some State laws. Such a procedure has existed in New South Wales for many years, and has recently been carried over by the former Greiner Government into the New South Wales Industrial Relations Act 1991. There has been no evidence that those provisions have increased housing prices. As the Master Builders Association has acknowledged, the Government's proposals will not lead to such increases. To claim otherwise is simply scaremongering. Those people who are responsible for it know that because that is their purpose. Allowing independent contractors to join federally registered unions is not novel. Some independent contractors do so now. In addition, a union will not be able to seek among independent contractors a wider class of members than it may seek among employees. The protection available to independent contractors under the Act will continue to apply, and is to be extended to make it clear that an independent contractor may not be compelled to join a union nor be discriminated against on account of membership or non-membership of a union. The term 'independent contractor' covers individuals who are performing work under a contract for services as opposed to employees who perform work under a contract of service. It will be explicitly limited to natural persons. Vice-Presidential Duties An increasingly important area of the work of the Commission relates to registered organisations of employers and employees. There are, for example, complex questions arising in relation to the rationalisation of unions in the federal system, through amalgamations, changes in coverage and associated rule alterations. At present, this area of work is undertaken by presidential members designated for the purpose by the President. Reflecting the importance, complexity and amount of such work, it is proposed that the Act be amended so that a specific panel responsible for this area is formed in the Commission, headed by the Vice President. The panel will comprise the Vice President and presidential members designated by the President. All panel members will be available for other duties. The establishment of the new panel is similar to the arrangements in the Act by which industry panels are established for the purposes of preventing and settling disputes in particular industries. Small Claims The Bill will make it easier for employees to recover relatively small amounts of money to which they are entitled under awards. This will provide a more efficient method of enforcing awards in situations where complex legal procedures and legal representation are unnecessary. A virtually identical scheme already exists in New South Wales for small claims under State awards. Similar schemes are commonplace for consumer claims. The new small claims system will apply to claims brought in magistrates courts for amounts up to $5,000. The Government will be able to increase this amount by regulation. The main features of this new system will be exclusion of legal representation, relaxation of the rules of evidence and overcoming technicalities. At present small but blatant breaches of award obligations can occur without it being worthwhile for employees to incur the legal expenses necessary to enforce their award entitlements. These small claims typically involve no difficult questions of legal interpretation, making the involvement of lawyers an unnecessary complication and expense. It is proposed that representation by a barrister or solicitor will not be allowed unless the magistrate decides to allow it. The Bill also proposes to give the Government power to make regulations restricting the magistrate's discretion to allow legal representation. For example, legal representation could be prohibited except when all the parties to the litigation agree to allow it. This is now the case under New South Wales legislation governing small claims under State awards. Because of constitutional restrictions, the Commonwealth can only restrict a State magistrate's power to allow legal representation if State legislation already imposes the same restriction on the relevant State courts. That is why the Bill provides for this to be done by regulation. The regulations will be prepared in consultation with States that have enacted relevant legislation. The regulations will also be able to ensure that officers of unions or employer groups will be allowed to appear in court to represent their members. The Commonwealth only has the constitutional power to do this if State legislation already includes comparable provisions governing'the State jurisdiction of the relevant courts. This constitutional restriction will make it necessary for regulations to be made on a State by State basis, as for the regulations concerning legal representation. Ensuring that parties to these cases can be represented by expert industrial advocates, rather than by barristers or solicitors, will help magistrates courts to address the practical issues that arise in these cases. This is another aspect of making enforcement of awards a more efficient process. Changes to Structure of NLCC Council The final major proposal in the Bill is designed to encourage greater tripartite consultation on industrial relations and other employment matters of national concern. It is proposed to enhance the representative nature of the National Labour Consultative Council by widening its membership to include another employer representative. It also proposes to give the Minister power to invite other persons and bodies to be represented at meetings, as appropriate. The Bill amends the National Labour Consultative Council Act 1977 accordingly. Other matters Several other minor technical amendments of industrial relations legislation are also included in the Bill. To sum up, this Bill is a significant step in designing an industrial relations system which will facilitate our progress towards the leading edge of the regional and international economy. This progress can only be sustained and maintained if all those involved can take part and reap the benefits. Its governing objectives, therefore, are fairness as well as efficiency. Its governing method is through cooperation and participation, rather than confrontation and division. In this way, the whole community gains the rewards. On behalf of the Minister for· Finance (Mr Willis), I commend the Government's proposals to the House, and I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. Leave granted for debate to proceed forthwith.",112
210,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I thank my colleague and friend the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) for the opportunity once again to indulge in a very favourite pastime of mine in this House: locking horns with the honourable member for Charlton. There is a certain irony, a certain coincidence, of some historical significance so far as industrial relations law in Australia is concerned, that this particular debate, which is about an amendment to the Federal industrial relations law, should take place on the very day that the New South Wales Minister for Industrial Relations of the past several years, Mr John Fahey, has been installed as Premier of New South Wales. Let me commence my remarks by saying that, despite the rather unfortunate circumstances in which Mr Fahey has assumed the premiership of New South Wales, I personally congratulate him on the assumption of that very high office. He is a man I have an enormous respect for. I believe that he did an outstanding job for the coalition in shepherding the industrial relations legislation through both the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council in New South Wales. It will for ever be to the credit of the Greiner Government in New South Wales that it was prepared to stick to its guns, despite the adversity of numbers in the upper House in New South Wales, in order to get vital legislation reforming Australia's industrial relations system through the New South Wales Parliament. Whilst it is true that it was the Queensland National Party Government-with which I did not always totally agree-that was responsible for the first legislation in Australia endowing individuals with the right to make direct employment contracts bypassing unions and industrial relations tribunals, it has in fact been in New South Wales that at a State level such legislation looks like surviving intact, least for a considerable period of time. So I commence my remarks by acknowledging the contribution of the new Premier of New South Wales, John Fahey, to the cause of industrial relations reform. I have to say to my friem:l the honourable member for Charlton, as I do to my friend the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards), that the tide of history is against those who would retain the institutional grip of the organisations on industrial relations in Australia. The tide of history is in favour of contractual arrangements at the workplace level. Day by day further evidence accumulates. But, because of what I perceive to be a grave and weighty matter, I seek leave to continue my remarks later, and I am sure that on this occasion the Speaker will readily facilitate my request.",118
211,Mr SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Leave is granted, and I thank the honourable member for Bennelong for his kind remarks. I was listening with interest to the matters he was raising before the House. I may even stay and listen to it later, but honourable members should not hold their breath. Leave granted; debate adjourned. LOCAL GOVERNMENT (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL Bill returned from the Senate with amendments.",119
212,Mr SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Before I call the Minister, I would like to make a brief statement to the House. The message from the Senate returns to the House the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill 1992 with two amendments. I have had an opportunity to consider these amendments. Amendment No. 2 seeks to increase the maximum amount which may be paid to Tasmania by way of assistance for local government purposes. There is a standing appropriation in the principal Act which appropriates funds from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for whatever payments are made under the Act. The effect of this amendment clearly is to increase the sum of money that may be appropriated under the Act. The House will at be aware that the third paragraph of section 53 of the Constitution states: The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. The issue therefore arises as to whether the Senate is able under the Constitution to amend the Bill in this way or whether the desired changes should have been made to the House by way of a request for an amendment. In considering this question, it needs to be said that in both the second reading speech of the Minister for Family Support and Minister for Local Government and the explanatory memorandum of this Bill it is said that the net financial impact of the changes proposed in the Bill is nil. This situation was explained by the Minister in these words: Increases in funding to the Northern Territory and Tasmanian local government will be offset by an equivalent reduction in the general purpose assistance provided to those State governments. In other words, I understand that it is the intention of the Government to reduce the payments to the Northern Territory and to Tasmania made under other legislation by the increases in funding made under this Bill. However, this intention is not reflected in the Bill presently before the House. In the terms of the Bill presently before the House, the amendment increases the potential charge on the Consolidated Revenue Fund. As I said in 1992 a similar situation on 20 December last,· it is naturally for the House itself-not for me-to consider such matters. I believe that my role is limited to bringing such issues to the notice of honourable. members.",119
213,Mr SINCLAIR,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. Are you suggesting that there is now a matter in dispute between the other House and this House? In that instance, may I suggest to you that the matter is one therefore that should not be now debated before the House. As the Senate has apparently passed, with the approval of those who are the advisers to the President, an amendment which it asserts to be within its power, if you assert left. that it is not within its power, do you believe that it is appropriate that the matter be debated here,or are you suggesting that it is now a matter for resolution of this House and that we reject the amendments passed in the other place on the basis of their being ultra vires? I think you are putting yourself in the position of being judge, jury and everything else. I think there is a problem",120
214,Mr SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The right honourable member for New England can take a point of order but he knows that he cannot make a speech as a point of order. At this time of night I would hate to have to deal with him, because he might then move the honourable member for Bennelong in on me in a hurry. As the right honourable member for New England has participated in many constitutional problems in the past, he might know that this matter is something which should be considered by the House but not in the House as a whole. As the right honourable member for New England and his colleague the honourable member for Bennelong would know-the honourable member for Bennelong would know this better than he does-the appropriate place to consider this very weighty issue is in committee. I am glad that the right honourable member is here. I am sure that,. when we go into committee and the Minister moves a motion, the right honourable member for New England will have something to say. I hope that he will have something to say, because I would expect that all members of this House, particularly the father of the House, would be very keen to see that our rights and prerogatives are not interfered with by the Senate and that the Constitution is upheld. Rather than the right honourable member taking a point of orderhis Leader is here now to give him some instructions in the matter, I see, which is very useful for all of us-I think that the most appropriate course is for us to have the Minister move his motion, in which he will be proposing that we deal with this matter in committee. Of course, I shall not be able, nor would it be appropriate for me, to offer any advice in the committee, but I am sure we will be very interested to hear from the right honourable member and his colleagues on my",120
215,Mr SINCLAIR,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"On a further point of order, Mr Speaker: I am concerned because the remarks you have just made reflect on the Chair and, with you occupying the chair, it puts us in an awful quandary. You have suggested that the Chairman of Committees in committee might be more appropriate to consider a matter of such weighty disposition as affects the Constitution of Australia and the appropriate powers between the other place and this chamber. I suggest to you, Mr Speaker, that your own authority is such that surely you can take a position on such a simple matter.",120
216,Mr SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The right honourable member should resume his seat and I will rule on his point of order. As he should know, these weighty matters involve back and forth consideration, and the appropriate place for that is in committee. The right honourable member has suggested that I was trying to act as judge and jury. I was pointing out to him-and he may not have heard me-that the more appropriate place for this is in committee, as he would know. I will go back to my office and listen with interest as to whether he has anything sensible to say in committee, and I might take it up with him privately if he has not. But I will be interested to read the Hansard tomorrow to see what his contribution was. I hope that in his contribution he will uphold the rights and privileges of this House, seeing he is the father of the House. Ordered that the amendments be taken into consideration in Committee of the Whole House forthwith. In Committee Consideration of Senate's amendments. Senate s amendments No. 1 Clause 4, page 2, proposed subsection 1OA(2B), definition of 'Gazetted amount', line 36, after ""Minister"", insert ""after sultation with the respective States and .Municipal Association of Tasmania in the case of Tasmania and the Local Government Association of the Northern Territory in the case of the Northern Territory"".

Motion (by Mr Robert Brown) proposed: That the Committee- , (1) considers that the effect of amendment No. 2 of the Senate would be to increase the burden on the people in contravention of section 53 of the Constitution and declines to consider the amendment; and (2) recommends that the Senate be informed that if amendment No.2 contained in message No. 489 is forwarded to the House as a request for an amendment, the request will be considered by the House.",120
217,Mr SINCLAIR,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The motion moved by the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) is not altogether a matter to be treated as lightly as I would suggest the Committee seems to be treating it. What we are saying is that the advice to you as the Chairman of this Committee is that a motion that has been supported by the Senate, presumably asserting that it is within its authority, we assert is in contravention of section 53 of the Constitution. I do not know that that is good enough. The Minister has given us a fairly bland sort of assertion. All he has done is move a motion. While that might satisfy him in one sense, it hardly satisfies the will of this chamber. This is not a matter we can treat just on the basis of an advice from the Minister. I think there is a fundamental concern. Obviously the Senate has passed the amendment only because it has taken counsel and decided that it is within its authority to pass the amendment. I understand the reasoniag that Mr Speaker gave to us. He is suggesting that there is going to be a variation, as I understood it, in the financial allocation between the States. I put to you, Mr Chairman, that a variation is different from a reduction in the financial conallocation. I suggest that there is absolutely nothing against the other place deciding that there should be a variation in the way in which funds should be provided. I would accept that, if there were going to be a reduction in the quantum of money, that would be ultra vires the other place in accordance with the Constitution. I put to you, Mr Chairman, that there have been many occasions when the other place has said that there is a capacity to reallocate funds as they have been provided by a motion of this place on reference to the other chamber. I quite seriously say that we are taking too lightly the motion of the Minister. It is a matter of some significance, if there should be a reapportionment. I come from New South Wales, and for a long while in both New South Wales and Victoria individual taxpayers have believed that they have been charged disproportionately because their funds, under our tax reimbursement formula, are distributed amongst those States with lesser populations. As a result, the individual services provided are somewhat less per capita than would otherwise be the case. Indeed, there is a fundamental problem. Mr Greiner, who I believe was an outstanding Premier of New South Wales and who regrettably has handed in his resignation today, sought to ensure that the burden on the individual residents of New South Wales should be no greater than that on the residents of any other States. As I understand the consequence of this motion, it is suggesting that the Senate is not able to reapportion funds provided under other legislation. I disagree with the suggestion by Mr Speaker that that is outside the powers of the Senate. Therefore, we need to look very closely at the provisions of the first part of the motion the Minister has now submitted to us. Quite apart from that initial concern I raised, I think there is a fundamental problem. While I know that in the proceedings of this place it is going to be very awkward to get the advice we need and to take the time to consider the matter in detail, I think there is a fundamental problem. The problem is twofold. The one relates very much to what I understood to be the matter that was put before the last Premiers Conference, that is, the proper apportionment of funds between individual citizens of the more populous States as against the less populous States. The second is the extent to which the Senate, for whatever reason, might decide within its powers that it is going to reapportion funds provided there. I would like to be assured that the advice being given by the Minister in the form of this motion is valid and correct. I would also like to be assured that we are not, in passing this motion, setting up a conflict with the other chamber which might well canvass issues far more fundamental than any of us at this moment in this debate might have had an opportunity to reflect upon.",121
218,The CHAIRMAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I will clarify the matter for the right honourable member for New England. Looking at the Senate's message in relation to the matter moved by the Minister, it states: No. 2 Clause 4, page 3, proposed paragraph IOA(2C)(a), line 1, omit ""$4,410,000"", substitute ""$5,193,000"". That seems to ge the genesis of the matter of contention. I thought I would clarify that from the point of view of the right honourable member for New England.",122
219,Mr SINCLAIR,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I understand that, Mr Chairman. The point I am making is that, as I understand it, the Senate is not increasing the total quantum; it is reapportioning it. If that is so, I do not believe that the first part of the motion is accurate. I think the Senate has power to transfer the apportionment of moneys but not to increase the allocation of those same moneys.",122
220,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,It is a reallocation.,122
221,Mr SINCLAIR,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"That is right, it is a reallocation of money. If the Senate is going to reallocate money, surely that is something that over time we have accepted is within its power. I think the first part of the motion is wrong and therefore we really should not take the advice of the Minister at face value. I think the Senate is totally within its authority to reapportion money: increase the money, no; reapportion the money, yes. I believe that that is what is being done in this instance.",122
222,The CHAIRMAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,I should point out to the right honourable member for New England that I was clarifying the matter. I was obviously not trying to argue the point from the chair.,122
223,Mr ROBERT BROWN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"CharltonMinister for Land Transport) (8.46 p.m.)Some of the points the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) has raised are issues of validity. Tlte question of the apportionment of those funds will be the subject of future Appropriation Bill debate within this chamber and within the Senate.' I do not think it is appropriate at this stage for us to be anticipating the decisions of the Parliament. I want to emphasise the terms of the motion I have moved. The first part of the motion states: That the Committee(1) considers that the effect of amendment No. 2 of the Senate would be to increase the burden on the people in contravention of section 53 of the Constitution and declines to consider the amendment; For the further advice of the right honourable member for New England, the second part of the motion states: . (2) recommends that the Senate be informed that if amendment No.2 contained in message No. 489 is forwarded to the House as a request for an amendment, the request will be considered by the House. It is now a simple matter for the Senate to determine its position. In the light of that decision quite correctly and appropriately being carried by this chamber and conveyed to the Senate,. the Senate will now have the opportunity to respond and to have this chamber consider its decision.",122
224,Mr SINCLAIR,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I have been advised by the Clerk that the effect of Senate amendment No. 2 is to increase the amount that will be able to be made available to Tasmania from $4m, to $Sm-bdd. It is therefore in contravention of section 53. The question of distribution between the States does not arise in respect of amendment' No.2. That advice being from the Clerk and that, as I understand,· being the position, perhaps I am in error. I confess that at first blush it seemed to me that it was a matter of reapportioning the moneys, not increasing the moneys. It was for that reason that I raised the point of order. On the basis of that advice from the Clerk, I will accept that perhaps it is in contravention of section 53. I put to the chamber, nonetheless, that on issues of this sort I find it a little incredible that presumably advice has been given by the Clerks in the other place that this resolution was in accordance with its powers and that we have received it on that basis. It might be of interest to members of this chamber if we were at some later stage to have an opportunity to understand why the Clerks in the other place believed the resolution to have been within the Senate's powers whereas within this place we are told that it is ultra vires.",122
225,Mr TIM FISCHER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"This is not an unimportant matter, particularly with regard to these requested amendments from the Senate, which is the recommendation that will flow from this motion if it is carried by the Committee and sent by the House of Representatives back to the Senate. Time and time again in the closing stages of each sitting we have had this circumstance of, in effect, conflicting advice from the Clerks of the Senate and the Clerks of the House of Representatives on the one hand, and different Standing Orders and different constitutional requirements associated with legislation on the other. As shadow Minister for veterans' affairs in the mid-1980s, I had a situation where a Bill bounced for 11 months in not dissimilar circumstances before it was finally sorted out. I have a deep concern over the continuing ability of the Senate to attach request amendments to Bill after Bill, sometimes on matters not directly related to the amending Bill, and for those amendments to be presented to the House of Representatives in a way which, upon a change of government after the next election, could well frustrate our legitimate legislative program in the Parliament of Australia. It is something on which there is now a wide margin and difference of viewpoint of what can be properly moved as an amendment to legislation in this place, particularly with regard to amendments which create a financial requirement versus what the Senate moves almost every other day of the week, particularly towards the end of sittings. I place on record my concern over the Senate's ability to act, quite often, in an almost cavalier fashion and request amendments. On this occasion it actually went one step further and inserted an amendment, and we are asking it to come back to us with a request amendment. Even then we should consider very carefully that request amendment in terms of the motion. It is not just some esoteric, legal, complex, technical dimension of this legislation; it goes very much to the central core of powers between the House of Representatives and the Senate. I make the further point that I read very carefully all the amendments flowing out of the Senate, especially the request amendments, and I note at times with increasing concern the extent, width and depth of some of those request amendments and their lack of attachment to the parent Bills to which, quite often, those request amendments are attached. It is for those reasons that I place my conc;erns on record. I know that the next time. I pass a certain Clerk of the Senate in the corridor I do not expect to get the same friendly 'cheerio' as I have on previous occasions. Question resolved in the affirmative.

228,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"Bennelong) (8.54 p.m.)Ever willing, Mr Speaker.",125
229,Mr SPEAKER,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,It is wonderful to see the honourable member for Bennelong and I in accord for a change.,125
230,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,Indeed.,125
231,Mr SPEAKER,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,It is a worry to both of us!,125
232,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"Before I was graciously pleased to allow the interruption of this debate I was talking about industrial relations and saying a few things about the enormous contribution that has been made by the new Premier of New South Wales to the cause of industrial relations reform in Australia. I was reminding the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) and the honourable member for Oxley. (Mr Les Scott) and others in this House who have an intense interest in industrial relations that the tide history and the tide of change is against those who would seek to defend to the bitter end the institutional grip of organisations on industrial relations in this country. No matter what people may say about this or that dispute, the fact remains that there is an inexorable historical process under way in Australia at present which will sweep away the bargaining monopoly held by trade unions in this country; it will sweep away the nostrums of the industrial relations club; and it will sweep away the insufferably arrogant assumption made by the present industrial relations system that men and women in of Australia are too stupid to be trusted with the respOnsibility of deciding what is good for them. Mr Robert Brown-Not stupid; powerless.",125
233,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"This is the absolute essence of the whole debate on industrial relations. I say to those opposite: - Are you for 1992 a regime which denies men and women in Australia the right to decide their own future, or are you in favour of a regime which forever ties them to the mandatory intervention of industrial organisations or industrial tribunals?'. I have to say to those opposite, and to my friends opposite-I do have a number of friends opposite-that the tide of history is against what they are trying to defend. It is only a few years ago that their Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), would get up in Question Time as Treasurer and say that there was no way he would ever embrace enterprise bargaining in Australia. He would argue against the very notion of enterprise bargaining in Australia. He would say that it was completely incompatible with the Australian culture and the Australian experience. Yet what he is now doing, and what the honourable member for Charlton was doing a few moments ago, and what I am sure the honourable member for Oxley will do in a few moments when he contributes to the debate, is saying, 'Yes, we are in favour of enterprise bargaining and we in the Labor Party are introducing the latest model of enterprise bargaining'. The honourable member for Oxley nods assent. I of am glad that he confirms the argument that I am putting, which is that the ground has shifted. I can remember in 1986 when the coalition embraced for the first time the notion that people should have the right to strike their own bargains outside the industrial relations system. I can remember that the wrath of the gods and of Cain and everybody else descended upon us. They said, 'You can't do that in Australia; it's tyrannical; it's disgraceful; it's outrageous. The ACTU is on us. Some members of the Business Council are onto us. Some people in the Metal Trades Industry Association are onto us. The ACM is shaking its head. The Australian Financial Review'that great bastion of centralised wage fixation-'is onto us'. The ones to finally turn out the light on centralised industrial relations will be the editorial writers of the Australian Financial Review. All those people were down on us and said that it could not be done and now they are craving respectability as enterprise bargainers. They have become in those terms the ultimate harlots of the industrial relations debate. Five years ago they were saying that enterprise bargaining was anathema to the Australian psyche and the Australian culture. Now they are trying to wrap themselves in the clothing of enterprise bargaining. What they are saying now is, 'We believe in enterprise bargaining too but we can do it better than you'. Yet five years ago enterprise bargaining was absolute anathema. I can remember the honourable member for Blaxland getting up and saying he was in favour of financial deregulation and all forms of deregulation. However, when it came to deregulation. of the labour market it could not be done: because the power shares held by the trade union dinary movement were too great there could not be a deregulation of the labour market. That an erroneous proposition when he asserted in 1986. By the Government's manic deny embracing of the language of enterprise bargaining it is acknowledging just how much ground has shifted in this debate. There are four essential principles in philosophy of industrial relations. They very simple propositions. The first and foremost proposition is that every man woman in Australia has the right to strike direct bargain with his or her employer or employee. In other words, it ought to be competent, it ought to be possible, permisting sible, for corporations or other employers Australia to enter into direct employment contracts with their employees without mandatory intervention of an organisation or an industrial tribunal. We are not saying that it should be compulsory. We are not saying that every single employer or employee should do it. What we are saying is that, if people want to do it, what in the name of everything that is understood about an Australian fair go should prevent men and women over the adult age making a rational decision about their own future? Yet incredibly enough, in the enlightened era of 1992, when this country in my view undoubtedly suffers from what I can only describe as anti-discrimination overload, we are obsessed on certain issues about any kind of intervention into individual rights and liberty. Anybody who tries to assert any kind of community standard on certain things is howled down as some kind of troglodyte conservative. If one stands up and says there are certain things that, according to standards of decency and taste ought not to be communicated on television or on radio, one is .accused of being a screaming, old-fashioned conservative. Yet the Same people who scream abuse at those who would seek to uphold some of those standards are the very people who say, 'Never shall Australian men and women have the right to decide their own other future so far as their employment opporhe said that tunities are concerned'. I regard this as one of the most extraordouble standards that this country has seen. Those very people who are the loudest was in proclaiming the libertarian philosophy it when it comes to a lot of other things would workers the right to decide that they, and not it union or an employer organisation, know what is best for their future. That is the cradle of our first principle. That is what it is our all about. It is not about destroying trade are unions; it is not about denying people the right, if they so choose, to have their and employment relationship regulated by an a award; it is not about saying that Australian trade unions do not have a legitimate role in Australian society; and it is not about asserthat employers are always right and in unions are always wrong. I have never asserted that. The honourable member for the Charlton knows that only too well. I have met some grisly employers in Australia, as I am sure the honourable member for Charlton has met some grisly trade union officials. It is to the shame of this country that somehow over the years there has not been an earlier recognition that there are some extremists on both sides who do the cause of rational industrial relations a great deal of harm. I am not· into the business of imposing on this country some kind of totally unrestrained neanderthal approach to industrial relations, because, under principle No. 1 of oui' approach, part and parcel of the right we are going to give to people to go outside the system is to write into the necessary legislation certain minimum standards. We· will have a minimum hourly rate of pay. According to the law we will pass, people who go ()utsi-e the industrial tribunal, outside the award system, and form a contract with their employer or employee will have to observe that minimum standard: They will not be able to escape it. They will not be able to contract out of it. They will also have to observe things such as annual leave. I say quite openly to the Minister for Land Transport, the honourable member for Charlton, that the idea of having an argument about the reasonableness of a basic four weeks annual leave in Australia is ludicrous. I am not about to embrace some kind of argument on that proposition. I know enough about my fellow country men and women to understand that that sort of thing simply on. There will also be minimum standards about sick leave. These are the sorts of things that people are entitled to have guarantees about. They are entitled to have guarantees about such things as long service leave, health and public safety regulations, as they will under State legislation. I believe very strongly that if people decide to go into contractual arrangements, matters such as the length of the working week, whether or not there should be any penalty rates or holiday loadings and whether there should be any redundancy arrangements ought to be matters of negotiation. On the other hand, if people are going to stay under the umbrella of an award system, so be it. It will be determined by the relevant tribunal. I say to the Minister, for whom I have great respect, that the first and important principle, although it will enable people to have a freedom they do not now have, will not give an untrammelled right of potential exploitation to any employer in Australia, because it will be circumscribed by those very necessary minimum standards. Mr Robert Brown-You know what the system is. MrHOWARD-The honourable gentleman knows well that that is not the line that has been peddled by some of his colleagues who would have us believe and have . the Australian people believe that the Liberal Party is into the business of hacking away at annual leave entitlements and sick leave entitlements. We are not into the business of providing a charter for exploitation of the weak. We are into the business of providing a charter for those self-confident men and women of Australia who believe they have the right above everybody else. The Minister asserts, by the shaking of his head, the most neanderthal proposition imaginable: no matter how intelligent, no matter how gifted and no matter how selfassured categories of men and women in Australia may be, they should never have the right to decide what their remuneration will be; they can be allowed to do it only if they run it past some kind of official for whom they have never voted and whom they have is not never met and never want to meet. I know the Australian people and I know that the compelling logic of what I am· arguing is the reason why this· debate has shifted under the Government's ground. The whole political strategy of the Labor Party and the ACTU between now and the next election will be to try to be as much like the Liberals as possible so that the people will not think there is any difference in voting for them .. That is exactly what Government members are on about. They are not on about anything else. They are on about dissolving the differences. My friend the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), who normally makes a very robust contribution to debates-and I welcome his entry into the chamber-knows exactly the point I am making. That is principle No. 1. Principle No.2 is one that I am sure even the honourable member for Charlton, in his moments of total private candour, would acknowledge is a fair principle: the principle of freedom of association. Surely a man who supported conscientious objection to military training must support the right to join or not to join an industrial organisation. How could anybody who articulated with the fervour I know the honourable member for CharltonMr Robert Brown-You are right.",125
234,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"Of course I am right. I am absolutely right. It follows from the honourable member's passionate espousal of the principle of coriscientious objection .to military service that if one supports the right of a man or woman not to be conscripted, one must support the right of a man or woman not to be forced to join an organisation. In case any of that canard gets a run later in the debate, I say that I think that principle ought to be applied with equal force to professional organisations in Australia. I have told the presieJents of all the law societies and medical associations around AustraliaMr Robert Brown-I'll bet they listened.",128
235,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"Whether they listened or not, the law will be changed with equal application. At the moment I am a member of the Law Society of New South Wales. I disclose that I renewed my practising certificate a year or so ago because I took on a consultancy. Mr Johns-Just in case.",128
236,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"No, I am a great believer. in broadening one's tastes. I think one should have a totally catholic view of the world on these matters. I have certainly broadened my. tastes on professional practices. I say to the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Johns), the Prime Minister's early friend from the Centre Left in Queensland, that I believe there should be an equal application of that principle of voluntary association-no compulsory unionism; no closed shops; no preference clauses. The third great principle of the policy is maintenance of the rule of law; in other words, those gains that have been made against the predatory behaviour of industrial organisations over the last 10 years in the great Mudginberri dispute, the great Dollar Sweets dispute, and the pilots dispute, where we are infinitely indebted to a former President of the ACTU for upholding the principle of the potential liability of industrial organisations for damages inflicted on Australian corporations. Resting on those im-cableprecedents, we will certainly not embrace the notion of some kind of toy labour court, some kind of putty in the hands of the trade union establishment in Australia. Our fourth very important principle is that, if somebody wants to join a union in this country, that person should have the right to join the union of his choice, be it a craft union, an industry union or, dare I say it, a company or enterprise union. I.am not against industry unions. If people want to vote in a democratic fashion to form industry unions, what right have I to stop them doing it? Let me say to the Minister opposite that if the employees of Toyota Australia want to form the Toyota Australia Staff Association and they want to give that body the exclusive right to negotiate on their behalf with the management of Toyota about their wages and conditions, what earthly right does the Government have to go along and say that they cannot do it, that they should be some kind of miserable, clerical fragment of a giant nationwide union that has auto workers, spare parts workers, metal workers, timber workers, mine workers and people making remote decisions in centralised union offices? The Government talks about the remoteness of Canberra. If members of the Government are allowed to finish their process of union rationalisation, they will have the most remote union structure this country has seen. I am for choice when it comes to union membership. We will defend the right of people to join as well as not to join unions. People's right to enjoy tax deductibility of their bona fide subscriptions will be left totally untouched. There has never been any the suggestion on our part that that will be interfered with. They will have the right to decide what kind of unioll .they want to join. That will mean more unions; I acknowledge that. But I happen to think that is right and democratic, and it is the right principle based on freedom. The real objective of the coalition in the area of industrial relations is to bring about industrial relations climate. that brings forth the productive talents of Australian employers and employees. I believe that the goal many people in the Government is the same benefits as my goal. We all want a more productive tum around. Australia, rising living standards and security for our families. There is no argument about that. Our disagreement is about the way we get there. We happen to believe that the best way of getting the optimum outcomes for Australian nation is to say to individual Australians, 'Here is the most congenial economic climate we can give you. You take advantage of it and work your heart out to the best of your ability and, at the end of the day, we are going to have a more prosperous Australia'. The Government's answer is, 'Yes, we want to have that more prosperous goal, but you don't trust individual Australians. You never do that. Oh, no. That is one thing you must never do'. Ultimately, the Government's bottom line is that individual Australians are mugs, that they do not have the capacity. Mr Johns-It is all abo.ut power.",128
237,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,It is not all about power. What about a bit of power to individuals?,129
238,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,Order! Could we please have less conversation across the table.,129
239,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"Oh, no; it is terrific. I do not seek protection from these friendly intervery jections on this occasion. It is all about saying to individuals, 'You go to it'. Of course, there will be minimum standards. Of course, there will be protection for the weak and the vula nerable. But it will not be at the hobbling the able and the energetic. That is what is wrong with the enabled, Government's system. That is why it has delivered such rotten productivity performanunion; ces. Despite all the Government's bleating about and criticism of New Zealand, the latest economic evidence coming out of New Commission Zealand is showing that it is starting to get few runs on the board. It is starting .to show a bit of growth. It is starting to win a few productivity gains from its industrial relations policy. It is starting to see a bit of a turin naround in its current account deficit. New an Zealand has gone through a long dark valley of economic downturn, most of it due to the fact that for 30 or 40 years it paid itself more of than it could afford by way of retirement and the like. But it is now starting to As I have said repeatedly in this House, I do not tie myself to the New Zealand industrial relations model. I have been studious in rejecting that proposition. But I have to the observe, as somebody who is interested in passing in what is happening in New Zealand, that things are starting to tum around. I reckon that by the time the election is held they will have turned around a lot more. I do not think we will hear very much from the Government about New Zealand in the election campaign. The Government will probably try to dredge up some other country; it will probably get into Argentina or Chile or somewhere like that in order to run a bit of a fear campaign. Perhaps with the few minutes I have left I should say something specifically about the provisions of this Bill. This Bill is a motheaten relic of what was originally designed. The Minister will have· to concede that the moths have really got to this Bill. He talked a big bang. This was going to be the grand slam takeover of independent contractors by the Industrial Relations Commission. All of the employer organisations, to their great credit, went along to the Minister .for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) and said, 'Look, if you go ahead with this legislationin its present form, we are going to run very powerful campaign exposing that Bill cost of to the Australian public'. The Bill in its original form would have for example, the Building Workers Industrial Union-that is Senator Cook's old that is the union that Mr Gyles had a few critical things to say about in New South Wales-to go along to the Industrial Relations and put in a log of claims for all a people in the home building industry. Despite anything that was said to the contrary and all this talk about sham transactions, of course there is a harsh and unconscionable provision legislation at a State level. That has been there for years. That is where it belongs. It ought not to be limited to harsh and unconscionable industrial contracts; it ought to apply to any kind 'of contract. Courts of equity from time immemorial have had a right to set aside harsh and unconscionable agreements. It is there now. In my State of New South Wales, if a person is an independent contractor, he does not need the passage of this Bill to complain about a harsh and unconscionable contract; he can go to the Equity Court now and ask for it to be annulled. Why on earth does the Government want to intrude the' Industrial Relations Commission? The only reason the Government is intruding it is that that is all that is left of the originally desired intrusion. It is the relic; nothing else. The original idea was that the Government put all of these things within the purview of the Industrial Relations Commission. It threw in 'harsh and unconscionable', took fright and took out section 127A. It is now left with just the relic. It sits there like the proverbial thumb. There is really basically no reason for it at all. It is all that is left of what was originally the big pay back to the BWIU because of the Troubleshooters decision by the High Court. Nothing can expunge the fact that Raffa, the BWIU State Secretary in Victoria, sent out the levy for $10 a head to pay the fine imposed by the Federal Court. He said, 'Don't worry, brothers, it is all all right. The Minister has told me he will amend the Industrial Relations Act to overcome the effect of Troubleshooters'. I have got it there in black and white. It has nothing do with sham contracts; it has nothing to do with those migrant women outworkers in the textile industry. If the Labor Party had really been worried about them, it would have done something about it eight or nine years ago. It has everything to do with overturning the Troubleshooters decision. Troubleshooters got up the Government's nose. The reason it got up the Government's nose is that it beat the system in Melbourne. The system had ground to a halt in Melbourne and the only way one could get anything done on a building site in Melbourne was to call in Troubleshooters. What really got up the Government's nose, when it analysed it, was that the blokes on Troubleshooters were ending up getting higher pay than they would have been if they were under the award. In other words, the Government could not run the old exploitation argument. It simply was not available. That is what really got up the Government's nose. It was too much for the mandarins of the ACTU, so it said, 'Come on, Peter, we want that fixed'. Of course, Peter took fright; he ran. They huffed and they puffed on the employer side and he gave way. I am not quite sure precisely where the Democrats came out, but they came out fairly sensibly, at least in the interim, in relation to the Metway Bank, and I will come to that in a moment. Really the Government should scrap the whole thing. I said originally that, if the Government changed section 115 to make if easier, I would be attracted to it. I do not think the Government has made it easier. A lot of sore people in industrial relations who do not necessarily agree with me on other things agree with me that the Government has not really made it easier. It has created a situation where Bill Kelty can ring up Peter Cook any time over the next 18 months and say, 'Hey, I do not like the enterprise agreement that has been put through. I want you to approach the Industrial Relations Commission to have it set aside'. I actually think the way in which this Government has treated the members of the Industrial Relations Commission has been, to say the least, very uncivil. Mr Bevis-You're going to abolish it, John.",129
240,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"As I have said before, we will stab them in the stomach. The Government has stabbed them in the back, and it has done that repeatedly. We are up front about it. I have had discussions with the President of the Commission and, to his very great credit, he has said, 'At least we know where we stand with you. You have made it perfectly clear that you want to diminish our role. If the Parliament of Australia diminishes our role, we will live with that'. But the problem the Commission has with the Government is that, although the Government has mouthed platitudes about the Industrial Relations Commission, when it has come to the crunch it has undennined .it. This is a miserable moth-eaten relic of what was originally going to be a bold further intrusion. It does not deserve the support of the Parliament. Section 115 is not liberalised. It is unnecessarily confusing the situation regarding harsh and unconscionable contracts. There is no requirement for the appointment of additional deputy presidents. The President has ample authority. Quite honestly, it is a Bill that ought to be well and truly thrown out. I thank the House for the opportunity of putting a few things right about industrial relations. Debate (on motion by Mr Les Scott) adjourned.

Motion (by Mr Johns) proposed: That the amendments be agreed to. .",130
241,Mr CONNOLLY,SUPERANNUATION GUARANTEE,"Bradfield) (9.22 p.m.)These amendments are the result of a deal that has been struck between the Government and members of the Democrats in the Senate resulting from a long-standing inquiry conducted by the Senate into superannuation refonn in this country. We opposed these proposals in this chamber and in the Senate, and we continue to do so. We finnly believe that the approach being taken by· the Government to. the introduction of a compulsory superannuation levy is fundamentally flawed. I refer specifically to some of the remarks made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator MCMullan, when introducing these proposed amendments. He claimed that the superannuation guarantee legislation represented sqme major advances in superannuation policy, specifically for the working men and women of Australia. He claimed four points. Firstly, it will allow them when they retire to benefit from a much higher retirement income. Secondly, it will allow future governments to increase the age pension in line with community expec-ations. Thirdly, it will reduce the future burden on today's youth flowing ftom our increasing aged-dependence ratio. Fourthly, it will provide for a much needed increase in private and public sector savings. My colleagues Senator Alston and Senator Watson, in a minority report tabled in the Senate as a result of the inquiry I referred to, directed their efforts at explaining specifically the fundamental flaws in virtually all of these arguments. For example, it is claimed that it is going to significantly increase savings. The truth of the matter is that evidence was taken by the Senate inquiry from a host of people in the banking industry and the finance industry, as well as ill the superannuation industry. It came out time and time again that the evidence on which this legislation is based is fundamentally flawed. For example, Professor John .Freebairn said: The key to providing high income in retirement is the pursuit of policies promoting high economic growth. . Paddy MCGuinness argued: The weight· of economic evidence is that imposing compulsory superannuation on individuals does not increase total savings. It simply causes people to save less of their residual income, their take home pay. Treasury, which above all is the summum bonum of advice to the Government on this matter, had this to say: Higher superannuation savings would not be fully offset by reductions in other savings because many employees have equivalent levels of nonsuperannuation savings and superannuation savings are not a perfect substitute for other savings ... Some substitution . . . can be expected, however, . . . there is unlikely to be complete substitution. No estimate of the likely magnitude of this effect is available. In other words, there is likely to be a very considerable switching effect-not a perfect effect by any means, but a very high level of switching. Therefore it cannot be said with any degree of confidence that there will be any particular level of increase in savings as a result of the SGL regime. These .are the issues which are the very basis of this legislation. I go on to make a further point. It was claimed by Senator MCMullan that these proposals will have the effect of allowing people to retire with a much higher income. It is perhaps potentially true that if people's level of contributions is high-in this case up to 12 per cent is anticipated by the year 2002-they will be taken out of part of the pension. Whether they are. taken out of the pension system entirely tends to ignore some fundamental realities of the employment strata and trends in Australia at the present time. If it is assumed that Australians are continually contributing because they are inJull time employment, perhaps that objective can be achieved. However, the trend would suggest that many of those people are going to be in part employment for part of their lives as well as in full employment for other parts of their lives and, sadly, they may well spend considerable periods out of employment altogether. What is fundamentally lacking in this proposal is the capacity to create a series of . bridges throughout life, so that people will be able to fund their retirement to an, adequate extent on the basis not only of their capacity to pay but also of the capacity to pay of their employers. This is one of the fundamental flaws in this legislation. The Government has simply ignored the fact that under current circumstances there are thousands of emplpyers who are literally desperately hanging onto every dollar they can just to keep the doors open, just to keep. people in employment, just to keep the proverbial wolf from the door. We are seeing every day a growing number of business failures and businesses going bankrupt. In this dreadful environment, they are now being told that they have to provide a further 4 per cent increase in the level of compulsory superannuation contribution. Our colleagues in the Senate, the Democrats, argue that they have done a great thing. They have reduced the impact on business. Why? Firstly, this proposal was meant to commence in July this year and now it will not commence, in accordance with these amendments, until early next year. Secondly, it was meant to be at the rate of 5 per cent. Big deal, they have reduced it to 4 per cent. Small changes of this nature have been introduced. Perhaps the only one of any significance is in relation to small business, where the amount has been increased by a considerable sum for those companies which will not be subject to coverage by the legislation. Nevertheless, the fundamental problem is that there are winners in some cases, perhaps, but there are also significant losers .in these proposals. I refer specifically to the problem of dability. One of the major damning indictments of the SGL proposals in this legislation and in these amendments relates to the impact they are going to have on employment. The Senate Committee was told, this House has been told and the Government has been told by employers across Australia that the very minimum cost to jobs will be 60,000 and it could be as high as 100,000. Despite this fact, in its doctrinal stupidity the Government is persisting with introducing proposals when it is quite clear from what I have said that so many employers can ill afford or are incapable of carrying these additional costs at this time. This legislation. does not just play around the edges; it involves substantial cost increases to provide superannuation cover. Some 800,000 non-managerial, non-award private sector wage and salary earners will be brought into the scheme. Possibly 50,000 to 100,000 public sector employees who currently lack effective coverage will be brought into the scheme. Many of those public sector employees at the present time are not adequately covered because of poor vesting arrangements. These are the sorts of issues the Government has not adequately addressed in these proposals. . Finally, there are possibly 650,000 employees of non-complying employers, of whom at least 600,000 are in the private sector, who will also be brought into the . system. In other words, these new people represent some 25 to 30 per cent of private sector employment around Australia and possibly 5 per cent in the public sector. Overwhelmingly, these are the people employed by small business. They are often young professionals who are consciously determined to try to pay off their homes before they. enter into superannuation when they are closer to retirement. Regrettably, the great bulk of them are employees earning less than average weekly earnings. Again, the Democrats will say they have done a great job because they have increased from $250 to $450 a month the threshold affor- under which people will not have to make contributions. But the sad fact of the matter, as we have said in this House on many occasions, is that the Government's proposals do not adequately cover people in part time employment-explicitly the hundreds of thousands of women who are in part time employment-who are being unfairly treated by current superannuation policies and. who will not be adequately supported in any way by the proposals to have come before the House over recent weeks and, finally, tonight. As I said before, at the final bell employers will have to make a determination: 'Are we going to enter into this scheme or are we going to put off workers?'. The fact of the matter is that many of the workers who will lose their jobs are precisely these part time workers who are lucky to have any work at all under current circumstances-in an economy where some one million people are unemployed, where probably another half a million people are underemployed and where there are hundreds of thousands of young people who cannot get into the work force. Despite all those realities, all that pain and the destruction of all the hopes and expectations among those people, the Government is effectively introducing a proposal which at this stage the economy simply cannot sustain for economic reasons. The Government has put forward a proposition, as did Senator MCMullan in the other place, for the establishment of a society which cannot be achieved under current circumstances. It has set a range of four goals which will not be achieved. Therefore, the Opposition, regrettably, continues to oppose the passage of this legislation. Question resolved in the affirmative.

242,Mr CONNOLLY,SUPERANNUATION GUARANTEE,"Bradfield) (9.34 p.m.)This is the second Bill in a series of superannuation Bills to come before the Parliament, being the Superannuation Guarantee (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1992. This Bill refers specifically to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 and some amendments thereto, the taxation Acts and, finally, the Industrial Relations Act 1988. I wish to make a number of observations about the amendments to the Industrial Relations Act. The Government characteristically agreed with the Australian Democrats that it would amend the Industrial Relations Act 1988 to permit the superannuation contributions covered by the superannuation guarantee scheme to be taken into account when the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is making its decisions in national wage cases. Honourable members will be aware that this matter has quite a history. A case went before the, High Court which determined that the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission did in fact have the authority to include superannuation matters in the context of determining its wages and terms and conditions of employment. Nevertheless, the Opposition would like to make the point and have it on the record that it is particularly concerned that there is no proposal for, or any conception of a guarantee of, productivity increases. We are simply being asked to agree that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission should effectively place into awards increases in superannuation from time to time on the basis of promises which mayor may not be made and which mayor may not ever be achieved. It seems to us that, if there is going to be any possibility of achieving an effective universally based system of superannuation in this country, one of the criteria should surely be that there must be increases in productivity at least to compensate for the additional charges brought down on business. . We are not talking hereabout a mere bagatelle. For the last two years we have been talking about a 3 per cent levy. We are now going to rai-e that to 4 per cent. By the year 2002 it will be at least 9 per cent, and we all know that it is a secret of the Government that it would like to have it at 12 per cent. For this nation to achieve in that many years productivity increases of up to 12 per cent is at best a hopeful objective. It certainly has been the basis for productivity increases in this country over the last decade. One thing is certain: while the industrial relations of this Government remains in place it is unlikely to increase significantly despite all the talk that we have heard from Ministers in this place, in the Senate and elsewhere over the years about the achievements of this Government in terms of productivity-which, as I said, are extremely low-and its general approach to industrial relations reform.. If the House is going to support the view that the Industrial Relations Act should be amended, that superannuation contributions should become part of the normal arrangements by which the Australian Industrial Relations Commission determines wages and terms and conditions,. we believe quite strongly that this should be on the basis of at least taking account of the level of productivity in place, because that is closely linked to the point I made earlier about the capacity of industry to pay. If that capacity is not there, the inexorable outcome has to be that people will cut their costs of production, and the easiest way to cut production costs is to cut the jobs of the men and women of Australia. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported; report adopted. NA NA 1992 Second Reading Debate resumed.",140
243,Mr LES SCOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I have been looking forward to speaking on the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) spoke earlier on this Bill. As usual, his views on industrial relations are distinct from those on this side of the House. He made quite clear the continuing attitude of the Opposition to industrial relations compared to the Government's. I believe that the Government has a very proud record in the industrial relations arena since it came to office in 1983. During that time, with the not cooperation of the trade union movementand the only way to achieve good, sensible mdustrial relations is in cooperation with the policy trade union movement-we have achieved much. Through the accord, we have a wages policy which is second to none throughout the world. It has provided stable industrial relations in this country. That is proven by our strike records compared with those in a whole range of countries throughout the world. I think we can stand very proud of what we have achieved in the industrial relations arena. The Bill before the House tonight goes a bit further towards actually protecting the rights of workers. We often take for granted what contractors are. In a statement on what the Bill is all about, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) said: The Bill contains three distinct elements relating to independent contractors. Some of the misunderstanding and misrepresentation of the Bill arises from a lack of comprehension of how these provisions are framed and are intended to operate. A preliminary point should be made . . . that an independent contractor is an individual performing work under a contract for services. He wanted to make that point quite clear. He continued: It does not mean an incorporated body, as many contractors are. It means an ordinary individual. The legislation was deliberately framed in that way because it is such people who are commonly subjected to the type of unfair· treatment that this Bill is designed to address. The Bill itself goes a long way towards addressing the problems that we often find with contractors. I am sure the honourable member for Bennelong would acknowledge, as he often talks to people from Queensland-I note that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Johns), who is at the table, is also from Queensland, as is one of my colleagues the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), who will be speaking later-that Queenslanders particularly know what it is like to have regressive industrial relations attitudes, as were seen in the Bjelke-Petersen era. Unfortunately, as time goes on, I see the honourable member for Bennelong lean further towards the views of the likes of the former Queensland Premier, Mr BjelkePetersen. I think that is sad in some ways, because the honourable member for Bennelong is often seen as not being a bad sort of bloke in this place; but when he heads that way he will obviously get a lot of criticism from this side of the House. The debate that has gone on here really shows the quite distinct differences. There have been a number of debates on industrial relations over recent months, particularly in this place. Those differences have really come through. There is little doubt in my mind that industrial relations will be one of the biggest issues in the next election. There will be a couple of big issues-this one and the Opposition's consumption tax. I do not want to divert from the industrial relations arena here tonight to talk of a consumption tax because that is another issue that will certainly affect a lot of workers in this country. What we are talking about are the rights of workers. When it comes to industrial relations there are quite clear differences between us and those opposite. The honourable member. for Bennelong suggested earlier tonight that we are heading towards a time when the electorate out there will not see much difference between us and the Liberal Party. But when it comes to issues of industrial relations and taxation policies there really are quite distinct differences. Mr Anderson-There certainly are; you just don't want them seen.",141
244,Mr LES SCOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"My word! The honourable member for Gwydir interrupts. He obviously knows what I am talking about. Those opposite do not believe in industrial relations. When we talk about industrial relations, we should be talking about good relationships between the worker and the employer. Those opposite want the workers of this country going back 100 years-plus in terms of work practiees. It was because of the draconian attitudes of people with views similar to those opposite that this great Party that we represent on this side of the House was formed' in the first place. Boy, the amazing part is that 100 years later those opposite have not learnt anything. How can those opposite continue to have the same attitudes today as would really take us back 100 years? What those opposite do not realise is that in a business it is the workers who really make a big contribution to make that business work. We acknowledge that the investment that people put into a business is crucial, but it is also very important to realise that the workers in those industries also have a big contribution to make. They are the ones who make industry work; they make the products; and they have such a lot to offer. When comparing Australia with overseasand - ome colleagues from the other side have travelled overseas with me-we should look at what has happened in the Scandinavian countries and how people work together there. I can remember many years ago when I was involved in the banking union and my national secretary had just visited Europe on a tour with the ACTU. He had talked to people in Scandinavia about the participation of employees in the decision making process and how they are even on the boards of the companies there. When he told them that we do not have that sort of cooperation in Australia, they said to him, 'They must make a lot of mistakes then' - and we in Australian business do. . I am sure that the honourable member for Gwydir, who comes off the land, knows that the workers on his land have a lot to contribute. Mr Anderson-They certainly do.",142
245,Mr LES SCOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"But the Opposition does not want to recognise it. It wants to take away the rights of workers as individuals to protect their own incoPtes. They are entitled to that. That is what happens in Australia, and we have got to change. All the processes we have gone through, with the reforms and efficiencies we have brought in during the term of this Government in reforming our industrial relations practices, have been crucial to helping Australia become more efficient. WorkerS now expect to participate more and more. They no longer want to be put in a situation where they go to work, contribute. nothing and are pleased to get away from the place. In many cases the workers are now pleased to make a worthwhile contribution because the work practices are extremely important to them. Work satisfaction is very important to employees. That is something which those opposite never acknowledge; they seem to think that people are just machines that can be used and abused. That is not what we stand for on this side of the House, and we will never walk away from what we believe. The honourable member for Bennelong suggested before that the Government has changed this and that and that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has walked away from commitments to our industrial relations pplicies. That is just wrong. We have never walked away from them. We have reformed and changed the policies because we accept that there has to be change. There will be change in any society. If we do not accept change, we will stagnate. There is little doubt that those opposite want us to go back 1()() years. Unions were formed in this country to protect workers rights. Had the employers done the right thing in the first place there would not be any need for unions. One of the points that the honourable member for Bennelong made was that all men and women have a right to strike a pay rate with their employers. One can imagine what sort of chaos that would cause even in a mediumsized industry, let alone a large industry, if each individual employee had to strike a rate of pay with the employer. Surely, it is better practice to have an award rate of pay and to know the conditions that one is required to work under than to have individual wage rates. What happens in the ·Iatter situationand it happens in America-is that people are exploited. That is the idea of it. One employee is set off against another. People are not allowed to tell each other how much they earn, with the fear of dismissal hanging over them. In the recent APPM dispute in· Tasmania, one of the leaders of APPM made the comment that workers should be worried when they come to work that they may not have their job at the end of the day. What a terrible way to live. What a terrible attitude for an employer to have to his work force. How does he ever expect to get a decent commit-· ment from the employees? The workers of this country do have a big commitment to this country because it is what they stand up for. They love this country and they like working for it. They like to see things being achieved. But we do not like to see people exploited. There is little doubt that that is what happens with contractors all. the time. We have all seen it. If people have not seen it they have not been out there looking around, because it happens all the time. I remember many years ago when a woman I knew who had been out of the work force for many years wanted to come back into it. She went to a lot of trouble to· get back into the work force. When she finally found employment, the employer wanted to offer her work as some sort of a contractor, to avoid taxation for a start. As a small business the employer would not have had to pay payroll tax anyway, but he wanted that cash in hand arrangement in order, he said, to benefit both of them. But it would not really have benefited the worker at all because she would have been working for an extremely low rate of pay. As far as taxation is concerned, that employee had a responsibility to declare that money as income, but the employer wanted to name her as some sort of contractor. I remember that situation very well. They are the sorts of things that we need to protect against. That is what this legislation is all about: to protect the rights of people. We often hear from those opposite about the right of people not to join a union, but what about the right of people to join a union? We never hear those opposite talk about that. People .do have a right to join a union-the right of association. Mr Anderson-We always have rights.",143
246,Mr LES SCOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"All the time we hear employers say, 'If you're a union member, you won't get the job'. That is supposed to be a good quality in the Opposition's eyes; well, it is certainly not a good quality in our eyes. I .understand that we want to move on pretty swiftly with this legislation tonight, so I will not dwell too much on it. I believe that this legislation is a further step in the reforms that this Government has been prepared to put forward in the interests of better industrial relations-reforms in industrial relations of which we, as a government, are so proud. We have been very successful in this area since 1983, working in association with the trade union movement and all other parts of the community. I commend the legislation to the House.",144
247,Mr MCARTHUR,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 is one of the most unnecessary and divisive pieces of legislation to come before this House in many years. The Bill has been very cleverly written. Despite the denials of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), this Bill contains a hidden agenda, as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) so ably put it. Like other members on this side of the House, I have received many representations on this Bill. The petition that I presented to the House in the last few weeks, asking that the rights of contractors be protected, gathered hundreds of signatures in a very short space of time from people who supported it because they were very concerned about the implications of this legislation-unlike the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) who is leaving the chamber. The hidden agenda that is contained in the Bill is the desire of the Government and its mates in the ACTU for union coverage to be extended to the presently largely nonunionised sectors of the economy. That is the bottom line of the legislation and that is the approach of the Minister and the Government to this legislation. The domestic building and road transport haulage sectors are important examples. There are more than 810,000 self-employed and independent contractors-an important 15 per cent of the work force. The ACTU is aware that forecasters, such as Syntec, have recently commented that parts of the Australian economy where job numbers will grow the fastest over the next few years include some where the smallest percentage of employees or contractors belong to unions. Again, that is why the Government is very worried. The household services sector and the agriculture related sector are two such areas where Syntec thinks there will be a development in numbers. 'DIe ACTU is aware of the potential for more membership fees to flow into reverse the trend towards falling union membership levels, which has seen only 31 per cent of workers in the private sectors stay as union members. That is a very important figure for members of this House and people in the electorate to remember and understand. This figure has dropped from approximately 47 per cent in 1983 when the ex-President of the ACTU, the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, came to power. Under his regime, the number of people in the trade union movement has fallen. The impetus for the legislation came largely from the cases heard in the Federal Court and the High Court in relation to Troubleshooters. Troubleshooters successfully sued the Building Workers Industrial Union, of which the present Minister for Industrial Relations is a former official. Immediately the Troubleshooters decision was handed down, Senator Cook commented that the law was an as. Troubleshooters was found to have a legal right to trade and the BWIU was found to have been trying to prevent the company trading. Members of this House would be aware of the ramifications of that case. The upshot of the Troubleshooters case is that the BWIU has collected a $10 levy from each of its members this year t(j pay the damages awarded to Troubleshooters. Troubleshooters should be given the recognition it deserves by the Australian public for refusing to bow to union thuggery and intimidation. The Minister has repeatedly claimed that the Government's withdrawal of proposed new section 127A from the Bill before the Senate will mean that independent contractors now have nothing to fear. That is what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Johns), who is at the table, and the Minister have been suggesting. What the Government was trying to do in relation to proposed new section 127A was give the Australian Industrial Relations Commission jurisdiction over the contractors. That is the thrust and the bottom line of the legislation. The Commission could consider in the now deleted proposed new section 127A: The effect of the use or proposed use of independent contractors on the development of the .skills workers in the industry. I would have thought that contractors generally are as skilled as workers who are paid daily because of the risks involved in operating their own business. If one is a contractor, one has to continually consider the most efficient way to make one's living and meet strict quality standards to protect one's reputation in order to get the next job. That is a very clear understanding of what subcontractors are all about. The Commission was also to be given the power to consider the custom and practice of '"" the industry in relation to the use of contractors. This would have meant an easy opening for the union movement. Whether or not other sections of the Bill say that a union must already have an on-site member if it is to be a party to any proceedings, we all know that many union organisers are expert at nodding or winking and getting their way without strict legal compliance. The Industrial Relations Commission was also to be allowed, under the now deleted proposed new subsection 127A(I)(iii), to look at 'the total remuneration of an independent contractor' and whether it: ... Is or is likely to be less than the total remuneration that would be payable to an employee if the employee. performed that work. That was the whole argument in the Troubleshooters case. As the honourable member for Bennelong said quite rightly, Troubleshooters proved that the independent contractors received more remuneration than the award workers. I would like to draw some parts of the Bill to the attention of the House very quickly, because time is limited. The remaining proposed new subsection 127B(4) states: In reviewing the contract, the Commission may have regard to: (a) the relative strength of the bargaining positions of the parties to the contract and, if applicable, any persons acting on behalf of the parties; That is a suggestion that the union movement can become involved. Proposed subsection 127B(4)(b) says: . . . the Commission may have regard to. . . whether any undue influence or pressure was of exerted on, or any unfair tactics were used against, a party to the. contract; Again, that is a suggestion that union interference could occur. Proposed subsection 127B(4)(c) talks about the development of the skills of employees and (d) talks about whether the contract provides total remuneration. The final proposed subsection 127B(4)(e) talks about any other matters that the Commission thinks are relevant. What a wide ambit this Bill has to ensure the union movement becomes involved. That was the up-front intent of the Government and one can see exactly what has been retained in proposed section 127B. The way the real world operates is that union intimidation can often be of a verbal nature or expressed in some code form. For instance, a company doing contract work in my electorate found that, for a time, it could not receive its normal supplies. It turned out that some months previously it had declined an offer to join a union involved in its particular activities, so the wholesaler was prevented from supplying the company with materials. Once the Industrial Relations Commission has considered even a handful of cases; precedents will be created and there will be, in those ominous words so often used in industrial relations, a 'flow-on effect' or, as the lawyers often say, industrial reality will be the key. As the Housing Industry Association has said, the Bill will inhibit the rights and freedoms of business to conduct its operations in a truly commercial mariner. The RIA has been attacked repeatedly by the Minister for Industrial Relations. It has some very legitimate concerns. As Dr Ron Silberberg, the Executive Director, says, the HIA has already been joined in. its $5m advertising campaign against this Bill by the National }<'armers Federation. Mr Silberberg goes on to say: ... what we object to vigorously are the provisions of the Bill which seek to make commercial contracts subject to interference by unions and the Australian Industrial Relations Commission rather than judicial judgment. That is the key. The HIA then talks about the removal of proposed section 127A, which I have talked about. It states: ... the ... removal . . . has been shown to represent no concession at all. It will remain open for unions to initiate, or threaten, a dispute terms of a commercially negotiated contract ... A union' inspired standard for terms and conditions - . . will have been set for the whole industry. I ask the Minister: why should an industrial tribunal be given the power to look at what are essentially contractual arrangements between two consenting parties? This Bill fails to define what a sham contract is; however, time prevents me from going into that argument any further. Why should the Industrial Relations Commission be able to look at a contract and consider whether it is likely to provide more or less remuneration for the contrllctor? The 810,000 self-employed and independent contractors operating in Australia largely accept the risk and reward trade-off for their activities as independent contractors. If they did not, the independent contractors in the domestic building sector would have deserted that field years ago for the relative security offered by the commercial building sector. This Government cleverly constructed this Bill so that if one part had to be abandoned, as we have seen has occurred in the other place with proposed new section 127A, another part could act as an effective substitute, as has been the case with proposed new section 127B. Rather than seeking to subtly undermine the, position of contractors in the Australian economy, the Government should be opening up unions to competition by insisting that voluntary agreements between individual employees and their employers should be introduced. This Bill, even as amended, must stand condemned for its indirect attack on the rights of independent contractors, whose largely efficient system of organisation should receive bouquets rather than brickbats from the centralist Minister for Industrial Relations of the Keating Government.",144
248,Mr FERGUSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Reid) (10.01 p.m.)With a little over six of his 30 minutes speaking time remaining, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) actually conceded that he might address the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill. Before that we had a long pontification about the Opover the position's industrial relations policy. The honourable member for Bennelong went on to congratulate the former New South Wales industrial relations Minister, the current' Premier, for his role in 'bypassing the union movement' in relation to that State's legislation. Of course, that was somewhat contradictory to the facade, the image, that he later contrived in his contribution when he said, 'I have never said the unions are always wrong; I have never said that the employers are always right'. As I said, the reason given by the honourable member for Bennelong for congratulating the former New South Wales industrial relations Minister was that the Minister had totally bypassed the union movement. The honourable member for Bennelong talked about the former New South Wales industrial relations Minister, John Fahey. He took minimal interest in the Bill. It is interesting to note that when the Minister, who did such a chivalrous job of undermining workers' conditions and bypassing the union movement, dealt with the question of unfair contracts, the issue that is of such concern to many of those opposite, he failed to amend the New South Wales legislation. He brought in a very substantial list of draconian measures to undermine those conditions, but he actually continued with the provision under section 88P which is largely replicated in this legislation. If we look at the history of section 88P in the New South Wales legislation, we find that it was of such breadth that it allowed the union movement to initiate cases. A case in which I was involved, one concerning Wilson , Parking, went to the Privy Council; it shows that we need to deal with this question of independent contractors. It is not because of some problem in the building industry with one company, Troubleshooters, but because of what is happening in a number of widespread industries in this country, because of the difficulties in establishing the control test, because we have fairly significant unemployment in this country. That lends itself to the undermining of conditions and the construction of sham contracts. I notice that the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr M-Arthur) said that they were not defined in this Bill. I think he must have been a little busy on other matters. of late because I found that .in proposed new section 127B there is a list of the sorts of things that will be dealt with in regard to what is unfair: the relative bargaining strength of the parties; the presence of undue pressure; the situation in relation to maintenance of skills and training. There are a few indicators as to what the Government means by sham contractors. It is interesting to note that the New South Wales State Government sees some benefit in the legislation that the Government is introducing tonight to tackle unfair contracts. Typical of the realities rather than the rhetoric from the Housing Industry Association is that, as people might be aware, its arguments have been undermined by the Master Builders Association, which publicly repudiated fallacious claims about a possible increase in housing costs because of this legislation. The Housing Industry Association has been dynamited into the air by other building groups which say that this is just a nonsense. If any builder were to come forward and blame increases in housing costs on these changes, it would be ridiculous. The reality is best put by CCH-'.the bible of industrial relations-which says: In many situations, avoidance of the employment classification is solely for the benefit of the principal/employer and may be to the detriment of the worker. Avoidance of workers' compensation premiums, award rates of pay and conditions are some of the motivating factors in this regard. The uncertainty of the application of the employment tests leads naturally to an intelligent reticence on the part of many potential litigants to challenge the purported status of their work contracts. Unfair contracts legislation is an alternative remedy for some disadvantaged directly or indirectly by employment contracts cast into the form of independent cOntracts. Rather than directly challenge the classification claimed by the principal it may be a wiser alternative to argue in the appropriate and forums that the contract is unfair and should be varied or set aside. . The real situation is that in widespread parts of industry, not just on a few building sites or in the cottage industry, these contracts are constructed with the sole purpose of avoiding award conditions. Another interesting part of the contribution by the honourable member for Bennelong was when he said, 'We are not tyrants; we will give some minimum conditions in awards or in industrial relations in this country. We are not as bad as New Zealand. We will guarantee long service, annual leave, hourly nites, et cetera'. I do not know why there has been biblical approval for these industrial relations conditions. The only point that the honourable member for Bennelong contributed was that the Opposition would keep these conditions because the public would not cop its getting rid of them. Those opposite will protect those conditions because the public will not let it undermine them. That is the rationale between what should and should not be undennined by these minimum rates that will be in the Opposition's industrial relations policy. The honourable member for Bennelong also went on about how Mr Gyles had made some comments about the BWIU. Those comments must have been made during the jottings that Mr Gyles was doing in his inquiry into the BWIU while he was constructing the rather unsuccessful defence of the former New South Wales Premier before ICAC .. This legislation was described by the honourable member for Bennelong as a motheaten relic of what the Government started out with. As a person on the other side of the industrial relations debate, I am quite happy with the outcome of this legislation. I think the question of the reasonableness of these unfair contracts will have some importance for industrial relations in this country. I do not think it is moth-eaten. I do not think it is unimportant. I think it does matter. I do not think the credibility of the honourable member for Bennelongis all that great in industrial relations. He spent most of his 30-minute speech concentrating on the Opposition's policy. Those opposite are fairly embarrassed of late because the Premier of Tasmania-a person with slightly more electoral success than the honourable member for Bennelong has had-has indicated that the one thing he finds pathetic in the Federal parliamentary scene, the thing that he really cannot live with, is the constant obsessional support given to employers by those opposite in every industrial dispute. Throwaway lines about how when those opposite get into power they will do something about the barristers and the architects, et cetera, do not stand up to the light of day. When we look at the Opposition's record in a variety of administrations in States around this country where the coalition has been in power, in some cases for 30 years, we find that it did nothing about the controls that people exercise over their own jobs. It is all right to start talking about compulsory unionism, et cetera. It is all right to throwaway a few lines about how those opposite will get tough on other bodies, but the fact is that they have shown an absolutely inept endeavour-even when they have been interested-to do anything about the situation. That was most recently demonstrated in relation to the conveyancing laws in New South Wales, where the Minister was repudiated by the Caucus for daring to make a move in this area, and there was no result. Very briefly, other measures in this Bill relate to the question of underpayment of wages. Once again, this largely repeats the New South Wales legislation. The amount goes up to a limit of $5,000.. Someone on our side said that the figures were minor. Quite frankly, up to $5,000 for the individual worker can be a significant amount. I see this as a fairly important step forward. It is also noteworthy that there will be an attempt to limit the involvement of the legal fraternity to give the adjudicator the right to amend applications where there are minor problems and to make this jurisdiction a fairly liberal one in the way that it handles evidentiary matters. On the question of enterprise agreements, once again we have great predictions from the honourable member for Bennelong-a man with a pretty abysmal track record in predictability, as we saw in the Burnie dispute. Once again he is of the view that this will not encourage agreements in this country. I think even most of those opposite would have a bit of difficulty associating themselves with that kind of argument. What does the legislation itself do? For the first time it puts in a provision that it is an aim of the legislation to facilitate and encourage agreements, It introduces a single criterion in regard to certification and ,it writes in a requirement that there be a dispute settling procedure. It requires that the unions consult their membership in regard to these agreements. It talks about a single bargaining union. It ends compulsion for Full Bench approval and, of course, it Iiberalises the degree to which the authorities can interfere with certification. Why the honourable member for Bennelong would say that· all these very measures, both in a legal sense and in a practical on the ground industrial relations sense, do not facilitate the spread of agreements is really a bit hard to fathom. I think those opposite are well aware that, when the rhetoric about how we want a centralised system is got rid of, the reality is being seen by everyone each day of the week. Whether perhaps the Government has been prodded to it by practical changes in the industrial environment is another issue. The practical result of this legislation certainly be to facilitate these agreements. That is of some concern to those opposite. If they were to succeed electorally, there is a system in place which does provide significant protection for workers in the context of the establishment of a system where agreements are facilitated. It will certainly make it that much more difficult for them to undermine conditions, to drive down wages 'and to drive down living standards because the system will be in place. I commend the Bill to the House.",146
249,Mr CHARLES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise tonight to address briefly this Industrial pass legislation Relations Legislation Amendment Bill. I must say that this is a bad Bill. This is legislation and this Government deserves greatest condemnation for having introduced it, for having amended it, for it and for bringing it to this House tonight in the dying stages of these sittings of the Past Parliament. This Bill is purely and simply a pay-off the ACTU and in particular a pay-off BWIU in order to keep the mates happy. all about the Troubleshooters Available It is all about the issue of whether or not Australians shall have the right to be indepentwo dent contractors and to contract their services to employers, or whether all workers in country shall be required to be employees, shall be required to be controlled by the soagreements .. called union movement and shall be required to have their wages and conditions of Australian employment determined by stitched up deals between Bill Kelty and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook). I think that the Minister has decided that the coalition is going to win the next election and he is doing everything possible to see that legislation is stitched up in advance to it as difficult as possible for us to introduce voluntary union membership and true enterprise agreements in the Australian work force. The real effect of this Bill will be an increase in union power and a decrease in the value of the individual, with the resultant increasing decline nationally in productivity and in international competitiveness. That is will an issue that I will return to in a moment. Despite Senator Cook's constant statements to the contrary, there has been no demand in the wider community for any legislation to deal with so-called sham contracts, except from the ACTU and particularly from the BWIU. In that respect I would like to quote from a letter to one of my constituents from Vince Raffa, the BWIU State Secretary, on 14 February this year. He began with. words to the effect of, 'Dear member, sorry but we have just levied you some more money'. I quote from one paragraph in which he said: We have also been vindicated by the fact that the Federal Government has announced its intention to making the Troubleshooters Available type arrangements illegal by changing the draconian Federal Industrial Relations Act. the On 4 May -990, Tom MCDonald, the National Secretary of the BWIU, wrote to Bill proceeding with Kelty stating: experience shows that where workers work as self employed subcontractors. it is impossible to effectively unionise and organise those workers. to This is why the new right is pushing the self to the employed subcontract arrangements. It is Shame, shame! Honest to goodness, fair case. dinkum, fancy trying to give people the independent right to be contractors! There are major issues in this Bill: the first relates to contractors and the second relates to this section 115· certified agreements, the so. called-by this Government-enterprise The contractors legislation will allow the Industrial Relations Commission to inquire into, modify and, if necessary, disallow. contracts, including contracts of employment. In my view, it is not appropriate that a quasi-legal body such as the AIRC is given the authority, the right and the legal jurisdiction to determine contracts. Then- are make other mechanisms available if we are concerned about so-called sham contractsattempts to move outside what we would consider to be fair practice. One mechanism would be to amend the Trade Practices Act. Another would be to amend this Bill in one section to allow a magistrate to determine whether or not a contract was sham or, very simply, to leave the Bill as it is and allow the existing Industrial Relations Act 1988 to deal with any sham contracts. At the end of the day, there really is no need for this legislation. There is no need for any contractors reform. The point of the Bill is that the AIRC can, under ACTU nudging, alter the nature of such industries as the building and construction industry. I bring to honourable members' attention proposed new section 127B(4)(d), which reads: whether the contract provides total remuneration that is, or is likely to be, less than that employee performing similar work. .. That little provision gives any union the opportunity to take along to the AIRC any subcontractor who happens to belong to the union and works in the housing industry and say, 'This contract that I signed with my builder to build a house is a sham contract and it is no good because the conditions in my contract are different from what I would get if I was building a school or a hospital or a church'. Boy, are they different. We will come to that in a moment. Public interest is a criterion for review of contractors, but it is no longer a criterion for certified agreements under section 115. This is complex Ilegislation. I must admit that we have received varying advice from industry throughout Australia regarding the amendments stitched up by Senator Cook and by the Democrats. Advice given to the Housing Industry Association is that removal of proposed section 127A will in fact widen the scope of AIRC involvement in contracts. I seek leave to table advice given to the RIA by its lawyers in that respect. Leave granted.",149
250,Mr CHARLES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The first issue is the fact that it is complex legislation. None of us on either side of the House is absolutely certain of the outcome or effects of the Bill and its absolute legality. There is only one simple solution: scrap the Bill and let us start all over again. The second major issue in this Bill relates to certified agreements. I will be the first to admit that there has been some relaxation of the rules for section 115 agreements, but this legislation now requires that a union must be a player. That means that it is impossible for any individual, in agreement with his employer, or any group of individuals .in agreement with their employer, without the intercession of a union, to make any kind of industrial agreement with their employer and get certification from the AIRC. A union must be involved. The last point about certified agreements is that these so-called enterprise agreements are all above award agreements and overall have very little to do with the issue of productivity. of an This Bill is the second leg of the current attempts by the Minister to make certain that his commitments to the ACTU to help it increase its power and control over the industrial relations agenda are in fact honoured. The. first leg was the Construction Industry Reform and Development Bill. The second leg is this Bill. The third leg will be to reduce the impact of sections 450 and 45E of the Trade Practices Act with respect to unions, but to increase penalties for companies or employers. In addition to those three legs, there is also the Remuneration Tribunal fiasco and the Australian Industrial Relations Commission now having decided that the Government holds it in such contempt that it is not sure whether it is even worthwhile continuing as an independent tribunal, because its independence has been so questioned by this Government and its partner, the ACTU. The Construction Industry Reform and Development Bill was a great bureaucratic nightmare that adds thousands of more pages to rules and regulations in Australia and it will do absolutely nothing to reform the construction industry. It is a furtherance of the club between powerful vested interests, those being the big builders in their associations, and the unions. This Bill and the Construction Industry Reform and Development Bill act to transfer major project practice in the construction industry to the housing industry. In that respect I would like to quote very briefly from the May 1992 report of the Department of Planning and Housing of the State Government of Victoria. The report stated that, if we take major contract conditions and impose them on the subcontract housing industry, some of the extra costs on housing will be superannuation, currently at $40 per week, which is way over any 3 or 4 per cent; redundancy payments of $41.60 per week; minimum site allowance of $1.35 an hour; mandatory union membership-no ticket, no start-additional site amenities; and higher labour rates for certain trades. I quote from the report: ... bricklayers charge $450 per 1000 bricks for houses but up to $870 per 1000 under commercial rates. The 1992 report on world competitiveness prepared by the World Economic Forum and the International Institute for Management Development placed us sixteenth out of 22 OECD countries. That report condemned Australia as falling behind in productivity; management as lacking . initiative, incentive and drive; and its workers as lacking any competitive nature. The Opposition comprehensively rejects the Bill. It is a bad Bill. It is draconian legislation.",150
251,Mr BEVIS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"It may be some coincidence that this evening, whilst we are debating this legislation in the - ouse, Channel 2 has· a program going to air with Couchman doing one of his segments with our colleagues across the Tasman. It is a special New Zealand broadcast looking at the New Zealand industrial relations legislation. A few minutes ago, when I was in my office collecting some documents, I noticed some of the things being said on air by workers, unions, employers and politicians about industrial relations in New Zealand-an industrial relations experiment which the Liberal-National Opposition has taken great interest in and which it has· espoused as a model upon which we should design· our own future. n is not surprising that during the discussion this evening on the Couchman program, time and again the workers comntented that, when it comes to deciding their conditions of employment under an unfettered bargaining process, such as is proposed by the Opposition in Australia, they do not have any bargaining power and they are completely powerless. Some mention was made of a Christchurch carpet yam company dispute, which ran for some months. There was a strike, followed by a lock-out, followed by the starvation of workers back into sign contracts. In the course of signing those contracts a meeting was held, and the rhetoric sounded familiar to the APPM dispute which we have just witnessed in this country. The rhetoric emanating from the Christchurch dispute was about the rights of the employers to talk freely to their own employees, without the interference of union officials and the right of freedom of choice-many of the things we have heard this evening from honourable members opposite and which the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has often referred to both inside and outside this place. Yet, when its it all boils down, .those workers at the Christchurch carpet yarn company were starved back into contracts. In the end, most of them signed a contract without their bargaining agent being present, at one of those 'freely chosen meetings' those opposite like to talk about. One of the great tragedies of this debate is that the Opposition has sought to cloak its policies in terms of the freedoms and rights of individuals. As I have had cause to mention in this place before, the freedom those opposite talk about is not a freedom to improve conditions of employment. Under the provisions of awards and agreements now in place-even before these amendments broadened the scope; even before these amendments take effect-the opportunities exist now for employers and employees at individual workplaces to negotiate agreements, but to do it with a minimum base rate guaranteed by reference to the Industrial Relations Commission. The freedom is there now to negotiate those things, and honourable members opposite know that only too well. The only freedom that does not exist now is for people to breach the minimum conditions. The only freedom an employer does not have now is to try to pay his workers less money than the minimum base rate set by the Commission, by agreement or any other means. But the Opposition would have us believe that there is a great body of Austmlian workers out there clamouring for the freedom to work for less money; clamouring for the freedom to give up their sick leave, long service leave, accouchement leave, study leave, overtime rates, holiday leave loading and a whole range of other entitlements. That is the freedom that the Opposition has spoken about. Tonight on Couchman the myth was blown open when he had a look at the reality of the New Zealand experiment. There is no freedom in the negotiating process when only one side has power. In a negotiating process, there is no bargaining where an individual employee negotiates with the employer. For genuine bargaining to occur, there either has to be a final umpire to whom one can take the issue or there has to be some equality of leverage on each side. An employee has very little leverage at all on his own in an organisation when confronted with the company on the other side of the table. At present the leverage employees have is twofold: firstly, acting collectively through their agent, the trade union movement; and, secondly, acting in the knowledge that, if an impasse occurs, the matter can go before an umpire-the Industrial Relations Commission. The Opposition has adopted a policy which says that employees no longer have recourse to those two things. It is important that those opposite understand some of the things their policy says. lam not sure that all of them do. The Opposition's policy says, quite clearly, that one can have recourse to the umpire-the Industrial Relations Commission-only if the boss agrees. It must be award determination by agreement. Employer and employee have to agree to go to the umpire; they have to agree to go to the arbiter. Right now that is not the case. If either party feels that an impasse has been reached, that there is a wall in front of them they do not think they can get around, they can go to the umpire, the Commission, and have the matter resolved there. Those opposite would deny workers. the opportunity to have recourse to an umpire. That is their policy. I have yet to hear anyone from the Opposition tell us.how that enhances the rights and freedom of Australian workers. That is because it does not. No amount of glossy rhetoric that those opposite can c10ud this issue in will go to alleviating that problem which their policy creates for Australian workers. This Bill sets out to make a number of enterprise agreements easier to enter into and tries to free up the system a little, but it does it in a way which maintains an element of equity, justice and social consideration. It is not saying, 'Let's throw it to the open winds and let the fittest survive'; it is saying, 'Certainly there has to be some enterprise bargaining and there has to be a greater acknowledgment of the wherewithal of the enterprise to pay'. That cannot be done in a vacuum. It cannot be done without regard for what it does to the quality of life and standard of living of the people affected. We cannot hope to protect those things with talk about the marketplace fixing it, because it will not. Historically, it has not anywhere in the world. The only way we can do that is to say that, if things go off the rails, either party can go to the umpire. There is a bottom line which this country sets as the minimum standard no matter what occupation a person is in and no matter where he or she works. That minimum standard is enforced by having a commission and by having the rights of employers represented by employer unions and the rights of workers represented by employee unions. When it is all boiled down, that is the major difference between what we are doing to enhance workplace reform and what those opposite are about. They are about the law of the jungle and .letting the cards fall where they may. Under the Opposition's policy it is inevitable that the cards will fall in favour of the powerful and the rich. This evening some mention has been made of the building industry. The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) sought to draw an analogy between the costs involved in major construction and those involved in housing. Whilst he did not say it, I think the clear inference was, 'Look out. If this legislation goes through, the cost of laying bricks will go from $450 a thousand to $800 a thousand'. Let us put that to rest, because that is one of the scare campaigns that members of the OppositionMr MCArthur-Absolutely right.",151
252,Mr BEVIS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member for Corangamite, who is at the table, tells me that that is the Opposition's position. Let us get the record straight, because that is one of the furphies the Opposition has tried to peddle in this debate. Mr MCArthur-That's exactly what's going to happen.",153
253,Mr BEVIS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"There we have it: the Opposition is on the record as saying that that is what will occur. The Master Builders Association has now publicly stated that that is not its view of the effects of this legislation. In a letter to the Editor of the Age, the Executive Director of the Master Builders Association of Australia, Mr John Murray, said: The Bill now retains only a limited provision allowing the Industrial Relations Commission to review individual harsh and unconscionable contracts at the request of the contractor involvedwell. a provision similar to, but narrower than, those which already exist in NSW, SA and Queensland industrial legislation, and which have been operating for some years without any ill effects. We do not believe that these provisions will increase housing costs. So we have the Master Builders Association putting to rest the sort of misleading comment that the Opposition has been peddling about housing costs. If the Opposition was really concerned about housing costs, it might like to say something about what its policy will do about it. It might have forgotten that its GST will increas- the cost of housing by about 3 or.4 per cent-$2,000 to $5,000 on the cost of housing because of the Opposition's GST policy. That is real; there is no doubt about that. Even its mates in the Housing Industry Association will tell it that, but it tries to say, 'It really doesn't mean too much, it's only a couple of thousand dollars'. There is a bit of politics being played there and both the Opposition and myself know that is the case. When it comes down (0 this industrial legislation, let there be no misunderstanding: what is contained in this Bill concerning contractors is narrower than that which has been in the State legislation in Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia for years. The Master Builders Association has said that without any ill effects our legislation will not increase the cost of housing. We are short of time this evening and there are a lot of Bills that have to be dealt with. Time will not allow me to go through the other matters of importance, but I am sure these issues will be debated often between now and the next election and I look forward to those future debates.",153
254,Mr ANDERSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Gwydir) (10.36 p.m.)Mr Deputy Speaker, I was about to take on personally the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), your predecessor in the chair, on the issue of his rather disparaging implications in relation to the relationships that I enjoy with the people I employ. I would simply like to respond by saying that I do consult, I do respect and I always err on the side of generosity in my dealings with them. On that basis, we get along extraordinarily They would pay tribute to that if they had an opportunity to do' so. I reject his implications out of hand. Moving to the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), New Zealand is not Australia. Since he has challenged us to read our policy, I might challenge him to do the same. We intend giving people choice. If they really must remain within the centralised system and all that that implies, they will have that right. If the honourable member is going to sound' off about New Zealand, perhaps he might also' reveal some of the other interesting information that is arising out of that place. In half of the contracts that have been signed so far, union representation has been involved. Sixty-five per cent of the contracts that have been signed have involved pay increases and 30 per cent have involved the maintenance of pay levels. Add to that the fact that New Zealand has been recording its first trade surpluses over the last couple of months since 1973 and we see that New Zealand is not quite as easily dismissed as the honourable member would like to have us believe it is. I simply ask him, as a member of the Government: how long are we going to have to wait, with the Government's policies before we see that critical question of our trade imbalance turned around? It is a great pity that nobody, with the exception of the BWIU, the ACTU and those opposite, really believes the promises made about this package, the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill. In fact, the vast majority of people out there who know anything about it seem to believe that the aggregate effect of the package before us will involve the production of more regulation, more inflexibility and a greater role for the trade union movement at precisely the time when the opposite is required. It is predictable that the union movement, and the BWIU in particular, which has a great input into this whole deal-an input greatly facilitated by the fact that it has a former member as the Federal Minister for Industrial Relations in this place, Senator Cook-would disagree, and it does. The BWIU has been deeply concerned about subcontractors in the building industry for a long time. There are about 40,000 of them. There is quite a bit of money involved, apart from anything else. It ought to be a source of great concern to the BWIU and those opposite that labour productivity, quality of workmanship, cost and the remuneration levels of the contractors-the workers involved as contractorsare all better in the non-unionised housing industry than they are in the construction side of the industry. Instead, it is perceived by BWIU and its mates as a threat, not a challenge to do better. The Building Workers Industrial Union and its mates-presumably including those in the Government-would prefer to see the notorious inefficiencies, rorts, cost overruns, time overextensions and what have you that are common in Australia's construction industry extended to the house building sector. I will come to the point that the honourable member for Brisbane made a moment ago about Mr Murray and his claim that the HIA is g(,)ing over the top. It is a pity that that option is evidently preferable to the alternative of accepting the challenge of transferring the outstanding performance of the house building industry to the construction sector. By the mob opposite's own reckoning, their own figuring, that would reduce construction costs by 20 per cent. Their ex-Prime Minister said so just before Christmas. But no, the BWIU, seeing the threat to its power and to its finances, insisted that something be, done about it. Those 40,000 contractors could be contributing up to $12m a year at current rates; and worse, if workers really catch on that they can get a better deal without representation, in a lot of cases they might want out. The Troubleshooters case, in which it failed to secure its interests via the law, convinced that union and the ACTU that it should lean on the Federal Government for help in rebuilding union domination by legislative means. That is what this package is all about. In a very real and worrying sense, what is before us is more the product of union objectives than government objectives. It needs to be remembered that the union movement is having trouble convincing people in the workplace that it is entirely relevant. Although 85 per cent of workers work under awards, only around 30 per cent of the private sector now bother signing up with a union. The hidden ,objective in this package is to entwine independent contractors into the web of union power and union dominance. That power and position would, needless to say, be greatly enhanced by the additional revenue that might be raised. It is estimated that the nationwide there could be up to a million contractors. Again, at current average membership rates, if those contractors could be encouraged by one means or another to join a union, as they would be facilitated and encouraged to do by this package before us tonight, we could be looking at $300m worth of additional revenue for the union movement. How do the amendments propose to achieve these objectives? By three essential methods: giving the Commission power to review unfair contracts for the performance of work by independent contractors; allowing the Commission power to prevent or settle disputes over the use of independent contractors; and allowing unions to enrol contractors by opening union membership to individuals as well as to employers. I suggest that by this means the traditional common law right of contract in this area will be virtually broken, unnecessarily and unwisely. The power to represent independent contractors before the Industrial Commission will increase the coverage, power and influence of unions. There can be no real doubt about that, nor can there be any real doubt that that is the objective of this whole package. This presupposes that the Commission will be given jurisdiction to detennine claims made by independent contractors. That is, of course, a major feature of the Bill. Turning to the technicalities for a moment, it is of very deep concern to me that, by virtue of the deletion of section 127A, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission may well be less fettered in its capacity to review contracting arrangements. This is the point the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) came to, and I want to back him in his concerns, despite the objections raised by the honourable member for Brisbane. The Industrial Relations Commission, by virtue of the removal of section 127A, will not have to take into consideration in the exercise of its jurisdiction the five criteria set out in that section in relation to independent contractors. This means that when the Industrial Relations Commission reviews a contract as to whether it is unfair, harsh or against the public interest, it has no criteria for review but may take account of specific matters and any other matter, which presumably means that there will be no real limits on the review power of the Industrial Relations Commission. If this is correct, the amendments may well prove, when all of this is tested, to be far wider than even the Government had predicted and hoped for. Frighteningiy, that raises the potential that a set of standard contracts very possibly instituting restrictive and expensive work practices will soon emerge as precedents based on accumulated cases build up. This is at the heart of the Housing Industry Association's concerns in this instance. It has estimated that there is a possibility of something like a $15,000 rise in the price of an average Australian house. That has been well publicised; it is out there in the public arena. I put it to the House that it is contemptible that the Housing Industry Association, as a responsible and respected organisation, should see its excellent work and its very real concerns arising out of that work discounted so cheaply, dismissed in a barrage of abuse and, where possible, ignored. It is not alone in its concerns, and I think it is critical to note that. The CAl submission to the Senate Committee contained some interesting warnings. Mr Bevis-They are pretty independent groups, aren't they?",153
255,Mr ANDERSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"You could hardly call the BWIU independent. I want to record the following, which is from the CAl submission: It is important to note the potential of the three tests in this provision (unfair, harsh or against the public interest) to be used to dramatically extend the reach of the award system of regulation in this country. The New South Wales Industrial Commission has on occasion used a simple numerical comparison of the total amount received by an award employee and an independent contractor and seen this to be sufficient to satisfy this teSt. For example, in Minister for Youth and Community Services (1991). . . Cahill decided that relief under the New South Wales equivalent provision should be granted as the total remuneration received by an independent contractor houseparent responsible for the care of children the Department placed with her was l- than a person performing the work as an employee would have received. Similarly, in Assai versus Kater... Glynn J. decided that a cleaning businesS provided for a total remuneration less than that which a person performing the work of an employee would have received under the relevant award, which was held to be against the public interest. The provisions will not only dramatically extend the influence of awards in setting rates for independent contractors, but may also extend the influence of awards in determining how work is performed. For example, awards have a very substantial influence on patterns of work, including the hours of the day, days of the week, and the number of hours per week, by for example requiring penalty rates outside certain hours to be paid. Many of these restrictions simply reflect the history of the particular area, having been granted decades ago and simply continued in force thereafter, rather modern competitive requirements. Independent contractors not bound by such provisions could perform work at different hours, at different cost. Mr Murray of the MBA might have done well to have had a good look at that - fore he made his pronouncements yesterday. The amendments are also supposed to facilitate the smoother passage of certified - greements. We on this side of the House would accept the need for such an outcome, but we would raise real doubts as to the likelihood of that eventuating as a: result of this pac-ge.,Fora start, despite the partial exclusion in section 1?4E, in many cases an agreement cannot be ratIfied without the agreement of at least one union in the workplace. Removing the power of .the Commission to refuse certification on public interest grounds, and insisting for the first time that a ).1Oion should be involved, except in the case where there is no union representation on the sitewhich is a sop, I guess, to smllll business-is obviously going to enhance the role and place of the more powerful unions. It may well be that the most objectionable sweetheart deal, objectionable so far as the public interest is concerned, or failing, on any number of other tests, would have to be approved by the Commission if the union and the employer happen to agree. I do not know how workers' interests can necessarily be guarallteed by that approach. It would also raise the possibility that an excellent workplace negotiated agreement satisfactory to employees and employers could not be signed, no matter how happy employees and employers might be about it, if the union no matter how disinterested in the outcome' of the arrangemeritsit might be, refused to sign. . I hav- overstepped my time. Suffice to say that, at a time when we need t.o improve our flexibility, productivity and efficiency in the interests of building a decent future for all Australians, this package appears to head in precisely the wrong direction and therefore should be rejected in its entirety. Mr .BRADFORD (MCPherson) (10.49 p.m.)-I take it that the Government has lost interest in this matter, not having a speaker than here to follow the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson). I am delighted to take the opportunity to say a few words. I am very flattered to have both the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) and the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), both renowned or notorious trade unionists, or apologists for the trade unions, here to listen to my remarks tonight. I hope that they will listen intently. Earlier tonight the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) put the Opposition's position succinctly and eloquently. I have not heard anything from either the honourable member for Reid or the honourable member for Brisbane that in any way changes my mind about the Opposition's intractable opposition to this proposal. Much has already been said during the debate. about the so-called reforms. One would have to take the word 'reforms' extremely literally if one wanted to. read reforms into this legislation. So I take It that we are talking about reforms in a very loose sense. There is no doubt in my mind that the Government's intention with the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill is not to reform. That is patently clear. Anyone who reads or listens to this debate tonight would surely form that view. It is really much simpler than ' reform; it is about preserving and extending union power. I thought the remarks by the honourable member for Reid were really hollow. I do not think his heart was in it. He is a pretty honest sort of a bloke. I have served on a committee with him. I think he knows that that is what this is all about. Let us· face it, the unions have a problem. They are becoming irrelevant. As the honourable member for Bennelong said in more or less these words earlier tonight, the average Australian worker is not so dumb after all' he or she has come to realise that there h- not been very much return on the investment in union membership. In fact, most of them have decided that unless they are forced to join-only some 30 per cent of the private sector work force are in a union and most of them are in that category-they do not see any particular reason to join. I suppose the ultimate slap in the face for many of those workers who are forced to join is that they become aware that by doing so some of their membership dues are actually going to support the Labor Party. That even rubs salt into the wound. People are not only forced to join a trade union, but by virtue of that membership they are also forced to support the Labor Party indirectly, and they do not like that either. The context of these reforms-lam j-st using that word loosely-needs t<;> be clearly understood. This Government is dominated and controlled by the trade union movement. Martin Ferguson, the brother of the honourable member for Reid, calls it a partnership between the ACTU and the Government. It is more than a partnership. Actually, Bill Kelty and Mr Ferguson are de facto Cabinet Ministers. They are really about self-preservation. I believe most Australians quite correctly attribute many of Australia's problems today to abuses of union power. I think the honourable member would concede that point. We are not talking about the rank and file unionist who chooses to join a union-he has the democratic right to do soand gets value for his dollar out of doing that. developer. We are talking about abuses of union power. I could talk about plenty of examples if I had more time tonight. That is why industrial relations will be a key issue in the next election, which is just around the corner. We on this side of the House are very happy to. fight the next election on the issue of industrial relations. We believe the realisation has dawned on most Australians that trade union bureaucrats are only about preserving their own jobs. Time and again they have demonstrated their callous disregard for the preservation of workers' jobs; How many times do we hear the argument from trade unionists that they are not prepared to forgo the hard-won gains that they have been about winning for their members over many years? That just shows them up for what they are. They would prefer to fight to maintain those practices and conditions, which they have· won in a different economic environment that is no longer with us, rather than concede that some of those things should change. Many of the work practices and the benefits that we now have, such as holiday leave loa4ings, which I think are widely acknowledged to be an anachronism in today's environment, are evidence of that fact. Those sorts. of conditions and practices were gained in different times. They were often conceded by employers who were operating between high protectiori barriers. It was easy in that environment· for employers to concede-and they did time after time-and they were simply able to pass on those costs to whoever was going to pay. It was very often ultimately the consumer. I was interested to read the second reading speech of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) when he introduced this Bill in its original form in the Senate. The speech talks a lot about democracy, yet this Bill seeks to further proscribe it. One important element of democracy is surely the right to engage in free enterprise, yet this Bill attempts to limit that right. For a variety of reasons, some work-on construction sites, for example-is carried out by contractors. This is a perfectly satisfactory arrangement for both the contractor and the builder or This debate is being carried out in the shadow of the APPM dispute at Burnie, which was surely one of Australia's most bitter, even violent, industrial disputes; Mr Ferguson-You are very sad it is over so soon.",155
256,Mr BRADFORD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"We are not. On the contrary, we are not sad. That is a reflection on us. We do not want industrial disputation for the sake of it. We have nothing to prove. The G<:>vernment was pointing the finger at us throughout that dispute and saying that we were sitting on the sidelines egging on APPM and hoping that it would .be successful because that was somehow going to demonstrate that what the Government incorrectly regards as our approach to industrial relations was going to work. What happened was that those opposite saw it as an opportunity to sheet home to us something that was not the truth. That reflection seriously misrepresents our intentions. What we are ultimately about in our industrial relations policy is ensuring that the process of reform is speeded up. It must be speeded up. The Government's approach to waterfront reform, for example, shows just how slow reform can be if it is dictated by the I trade union movement. I will talk about Burnie for a moment. I do not want to take up too much time tonight because some of my colleagues also want to speak on this Bill. In Burnie, the. union's major victory was in ensuring that it continued to play a role in workplace reform. I believe that APPM may have been ill advised to preclude this right from the start. However, the decision was made in the face of a difficult financial situation, exacerbated by a of unreasonable arrangements and practices which had previously been agreed to. Perhaps it is unreasonable or even impractical not to have unions involved, particularly in large workplaces such as the one at Burnie. However, ultimately the right climate must exist in the workplace. We on· this side of the chamber want to achieve what Dr Hewson has described as a generational change in industrial relations-away from confrontation towards cooperation. Trust is a key element in achieving workplace reform. This was clearly missing at Burnie and it will be for a long time to come. However, an important result of the APPM dispute which, from our perspective, is obviously fundamental is the end of the closed shop. The company will no longer collect union dues. Importantly, the company has established its right to manage. It will consult with its employees, as it ought to, but it will not negotiate with them on matters not fixed by awards. ' I do not want to take up any more time because I know that others wish to speak on this Bill. We are not in any way backing away from a fight on this issue. The reform of industrial relations is absolutely fundamental if Australia is to move forward.",157
257,Mr TUCKEY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I watched the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), the Minister who handled this matter in this place, read the second reading speech. I have it in my hands at this moment. It is interesting how he chose to describe the purpose of the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill. There is some great union bureaucratic rhetoric in the words used. It is interesting that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) tells us that with this legislation the Government will provide a cheap and convenient means of redress to individuals who are working as independent contractors and who are being exploited. This speech has been made to this Parliament in the year 1992, not the year 1892. The day that the union movement and the union bureaucrats lose the word 'exploited' they basically do not have a job and so they go on convincing people that they are being raft exploited. I. keep going around the housing sites of my electorate in Perth, and I keep looking for these downtrodden exploited subcontractors .. There are some interesting facts. I do not see any. The people I do see all seem to have new equipment; they seldom drive nails with hammers because they have air guns which they have paid for; they have high quality equipment-saws and things of this nature-all paid for; and they have late model vehicles. I have a daughter, recently turned 21, who had a boyfriend who was an apprentice to a subcontractor in roof construction, which is a very specialised area today. You hardly ever meet carpenters-they are either carpenters who put up a roof or carpenters who put down other fittings. That is the way the industry has developed and it is all being done by subcontractors. Is it not funny; I have not seen one of these people marching in the street demanding that the Parliament protect them from exploitation. Mr Ferguson-None of them use this Act. Mr TUCKEY"""":'No, none of them need this Act, and by his interjection the honourable member for Reid has confirmed what I am about to say next. This is not the independent subcontractors protection Act; this is the trade union bureaucrat protection Act. Mr Ferguson-How do they use it?",158
258,Mr TUCKEY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Quite simply, by being able to involve themselves. How else can you guarantee yourself a living-other than by getting into Parliament, of course. We know the stepping stones of trade union bureaucracy today: you take a job with a trade union and the next thing you know, you are a member of parliament with a chance of being Prime Minister. The rules are all set .down. I have not seen the little book but I am sure it is there. The whole thing is that the people whom those opposite claim to represent do not want them because if they did they would come around knocking on the door, saying, 'Please sell me a ticket'. Is it not funny that we have to have a strike like we have at present in the Pilbara, because one bloke out of some thousands has not paid the union any money. That is the worry of those opposite. They are scared stiff that if gets away with it then someone else might do the same. In the Pilbara we have this amazing situation where the largest iron ore carrier ever to visit Australia is tied up at the wharf; Who is losing? The workers up there are losing wages; and the Western Australian Government, which is in a, diabolical financial position, is losing royalties that it might otherwise be expending on the poor and those who are out of work through no fault of their own; all because one bloke up there does not want to join· the union. Surely that is his fundamental right. It so happens that that right stated: is guaranteed by the laws of Western Australia-bQt those opposite need not be worried about that.. I have written to the Minister for police in Western Australia:""-one might wonder how long it will take him to reply....;""beeause I heard a trade union bureaucrat say on the radio that the company must sack this man. The company says that if it were to do so it would break the law. If I rang people tonight and encouraged them to break the law I could be prosecuted because, as I understand it, that is ,a felony. Yet, we have people who; because they happen to be tntde union bureaucrats, say, 'We're above those sorts of things'. . Mr Ferguson-He didn't say that. You didn't hear what he said.",158
259,Mr TUCKEY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I heard what he said. The fellow said, 'The company must sack this man', but the law of Western Australia says that that is a breach of the law, and he is protected by that law. I bring honourable members back to this point: where are the letters? Where are the petitions from subcontractors demanding this protection? They simply are not there. If honourable members go back to Senator Cook's correspondence file they will not find one letter from a proper subcontractor saying, 'Please protect me, Senator; I need your help'. Subcontractors do not exist only in the building trades. That very successful boat building industry that goes with the crayfish industry in Western Australia is carried out by subcontractors. They do not earn the basic he wage. They earn $1,000 a week, yet they are very economical for the manufacturer because they do more work in an hour. The Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh), who is at the table, does not have control of this legislation, which is a pity because, at the conclusion of the debate, I would like a question answered. In my State it is quite a common practice for young couples to save money for a house, go directly to the subcontractors and ask them to build their home. The Minister for Land Transport, in his second reading speech, The unfair contract review procedure will allow a party to a contract that is harsh, unfair or against the public interest to apply to the Commission for its review. Where the Commission is of the opinion that the contract is harsh, unfair or against the public interest, it will be able to vary or set aside the contract. The Minister for Consumer Affairs might ask me what happens to a young couple who go to the bank, having obtained contracts from a concrete worker, a bricklayer and the various other subcontracting trades involved in building a home, aggregated the contracts and said to the bank, 'We want to take out a mortgage for $50,000 to build our home , according to these contracts'. At this stage of the game the bank would approve that, but what happens if one or two of those subcontractors cart that young couple off to the Industrial Relations Commission at the conclusion of the job and say that the contractual arrangement is unfair and not even in the public interest? If that young couple appear before a commissioner who happens to be a one-time trade union bureaucrat, will they find-and I think the Minister should answer this-that they have to go back to. the bank and borrow another $1O,000? On Good Friday I drove past a housing site where bricklayers were working. Is it unfair and against the public interest that they perfonned that work at ordinary time? It was clearly their personal choice, but is that a situation where those subcontractors ,can say, 'Because I agreed to lay these bricks in two weeks and I should have had three, I have therefore been forced to work on Good Friday. '? Does that make the contract unfair and unconscionable? I do not know and I do not think the Minister knows. The Minister for Consumer Affairs might give some guarantees t«;> the young people in my State that they will not be dragged before the Industrial Relations Commission in that situation. I bet she does not. I bet she dodges it. These are the circumstances that we have question. However, the big question is-and I am obliged to close on this point-what it all about? The industry that the Government is setting out to protect does not want its help. Not one of those people has written to the Government or protested. There are no petitions announced in this place by the What is the Government doing it for? The Government knows what it is doing it for. It comes down to those simple words of Bill in Kelty which I quoted in this place before when the IRC threw out accord mark VI. It was televised and he said, 'Comrades, allow the IRC to get away with this, we will lose all our power'. He did not say, 'Our members might be unable to feed their children'. He, said, 'We will lose all our power'. Subcontracting is seen as a means eroding the power of trade union bureaucrats and that is why this Parliament is passing shameful legislation. It is not to protect people concerned. They do not want the Government's help. They do not want the rights. Government's involvement and it is, therefore, a farce.",159
260,Mr COSTELLO,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Higgins) (11.09 p.m.)This Government has been in power for nine years. It is a government which brought in a new industrial relations Act in 1988 and it is a government which amended that Act in 1989, 1990 and 1991. But never before, not in any of those nine years, has this Government seen fit to regulate independent contractors in that new Act ot in those amendments. The reason why in 1992, nine years after it came to power, it decided to regulate independent contractors for the first time was not that it had suddenly found out that independent contracting was being conducted on unfair, harsh or unconscionable terms; it was not that it had received complaints from independent contractors; and it was not that it had suddenly been alerted to something that was wrong in industrial relations. It was for one simple reason: the Federal Court of Australia, the Full Federal Court of Australia, and the High Court of Australia, in a case known as Odco Pty Ltd v. BWIU, found that Odco, which traded under the name Troubleshooters, had the right to to trade in Australian industry, had the right to supply independent contractors to commeris cial building sites and had the right to be protected against the interference of trade unions and thdr officials which were seeking to drive it out of the industry. That is why this has happened. Because the BWIU and the Clerk. other def-ndants were ordered to pay $420,000 in costs, with damages still to be assessed, this Government has decided to step and try to reverse the findings of the court and the consequences that flowed from them. I want to place on record the fact that I if we know the principals of the company Troubleshooters Available, Brian Groves and Peter Bosa, because I lived with them through those court cases in the Federal Court, the Full Federal Court and the High Court, 'and I saw what they had to put up with and the of pressure they were put under. I saw the shameful conduct of the trade unions which this sought to drive them out of business and I the saw them vindicated. They are fine people who went to courts of law to vindicate their I consider it a shameful day, after people have gone to courts of law, have vindicated their rights and established their rights to trade freely, that this Parliament can step in and undo the consequencesrif those judgments. What is more, I consider it shameful that this Parliament can step in with legislation which has been prepared by the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Peter Cook-the superannuated BWIU official-who has used his position in this Parliament as an opportunity to reverse the courts' decisions and to do for his ex-union what he could not do in the courts by bringing the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill into this place. Never before have we seen such a naked exercise of the responsibilities of a Minister of the Crown for personal, political and associational advancement as we have seen with this legislation. The Troubleshooters business provided for independent contractors the opportunity to find work on building sites and it provided for builders the opportunity to find independent contractors to work on 'building sites. Every one of the independent contractors who worked through Troubleshooters Available was a member of the BWIU, yet the BWIU mounted a campaign to drive them off building sites. YeS, that is right, a union mounted a campaign to drive its own members out of work. That is what occurred. The union took union· funds, including the membership subscriptions of those men, in an attempt to drive them out of work. The finding of the judge in his judgment of 24 August 1989 was: I am satisfied, in the light of all the evidence, the two respondent unions, along with others in the building industry, have adopted a policy of trying to prevent the applicant from operating in the industry· as it presently does. After the Full Court judgment came out, this superannuated ex-BWIU official who now parades as a Minister of the Crown said 'The law is an as', and he gave an understanding to those respondents that he would intervene to help them in a way that the courts had not. If the House wants proof of that, it is there in black and white in the letter of Vmce Raffa, the BWIU State Secretary, of 14 February 1992 in which he told members of the union that they were all going to have a $10 levy imposed on them. Remember that it is no ticket, no start, so nobody had a choice as to whether they would pay this levy. They all had to pay the $10 levy to make up the costs the union had lost in the courts. When Vince Raffa wrote to the members and told them 'Yes, you are all in for $10 to cover the costs we lost trying to drive our own members out of work in the industry', he said, 'We have also been vindicated by the fact that the Federal Government has announced its intention to pass legislation making the Troubleshooters Available type of arrangements illegal by changing the Federal Industrial Relations Act'. There it is in black and white. Vince Raffa on 14 February 1992 said, 'We have got it. We may have lost it in the courts; we may have broken the rules; we may have tried to drive our own members out of work; we may have lost $420,000; we may have to levy you all $10; but don't worry about it because the Federal Government is going to intervene to render this illegal'. That is the conclusion of Vince Raffa, in black and white. What Raffa was saying was, 'We have the ultimate umpire. If the law is against us and we break the law, we just call in the ultimate umpire and we change the rules'. It is like the tennis player who loses a point and says, 'I have got the man who makes the rules of tennis. I am going to change the rules so that now when I hit the ball outside the boundaries, it is in· for me' .. Vince Raffa was saying, 'Don't worry about it. We do not have that to obey laws .. There is nothing as mundane or prosaic as the observing of laws by trade unions. We control the umpire. We'll just change the rules'. I want to tell those opposite another fact they ought to bear in mind. It was always said in this case that the reason the unions were against Troubleshooters was that Troubleshooters was paying people below the awards once all the benefits were cashed out. When I had the State Secretary in the court and he was asked to produce the figures that showed that Troubleshooters independent contractors were being paid less than the award, what did we find? He had never done the figures. He had never ever done the calto culation. He had gone out on a campaign for a couple of years to try to drive them out the basis that they were undercutting awards, but he had never done the figures. When they called in Arthur Andersen and led the evidence, what did we find? After every one of those benefits was cashed out, conditions. they were being paid above awards for tradesmen and equal to awards for labourers alcontractor though, as the judge said, it would vary from year to year according to the amount of work in the industry. The whole campaign was ditions, based on a falsity. That caSe shows that there is a mechanism in Australia to determine whether or people are employees or independent contracpreserve tors. The mechanism is in courts of law. That is an example of where that occurred and how it can occur under the current law. We do not need this Bill to do that. What we need this Bill for is to move that question out of the courts and into the Industrial Relations mission. We like getting things out of the courts and into the Commission. The first thing this Bill will allow the Commission to do is to make an order that employees be employed rather than indePendent contractors retained. So the Commission will have the right, in arbitrating on an industrial dispute, to prevent such arrangements future if a dispute arises. The Commission will have the power to do it. The second way in which the mechanism will work is that, with the power to set terms and conditions for independent contractors to rewrite contracts, the Commission will be able to set independent contracts on such terms as to make sure there is no advantage in having independent contractors-to make sure that the independent contracts have to operate on such inflexible terms and conditions as to take quashing away any advantage in having an independent contract. That is why Government members want to move this matter into the Commission. They want to take away the basic freedom of independent contractors to contract. Those in the Government say, 'People do not have the right to fix their own terms and conditions. We want a state agency to be able supervise it. We want a state agency to set terms and conditions for independent contracon tors'. Do they never think about what an independent contractor is? An independent contractor is someone who wants to work for himself. Because he wants to work for himself, he wants to set his own terms and To say that one can be an independent with no independence to set one's terms and conditions, or to be subject to state intervention in setting those terms and conis a non sequitur. It is basic nonsense because, in the final analysis, the Government wants to take away that freedom; it wants to not preserve the award system, it wants to the control of unions. The Government does not like people being free. The thing the Government fears more than anything else is that independent contractors, as happened in the Troubleshooters case, will actually negotiate better terms and conditions Comthan those in awards. That takes away the whole rationale of unionism. The real problem that the union movement had with the . Troubleshooters case was that in the absence of the union' they ,were doing better. That destroyed all of the propaganda that says that unions are the only things that stand between exploitation' and the civilised community. It occurring in the exposed that lie. Rather than have that exposed in the future, the Government wants to take away that freedom. This is disgraceful legislation. It has come up at this late hour only because of that case. That case was determined in the courts fairly and squarely, and the consequences ought to stand without any rewriting of the rules by the ilk of the disgraceful and discredited, freedom denying, independence Labor Party. Question put: That the Bill be now read a second time. The House divided.

INDUSTRIAL - HEMICALS (NOTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT) AMENDM}:NT BILL 1992 First Reading Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Second Reading",160
261,Ms MCHUGH,PAIRS,"I move: That the Bill be now read a - ond time. The Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989 established the national in-histrialchemical notification and assessment scheme. The Act establishes a national system of notification and assessment of industrial chemicals which, among other things, aids in the protection of the Australian people and the environment. When the Government introduced the scheme, it decided that the regulatory impact on industry be reviewed after two years of operation. This review is currently in progress. This is known as the regulatory impact review. I anticipate further amendments arising from this review, aimed at minimising the Tegulatory impact of the scheme on industry to the extent that this is consistent with the maintenance of adequate safeguards for workers. The Bill presents a small but significant amendment to the Act. It addresses one aspect of the legislation of particular concern to industry because of its impact on product development. The Bill amends the Industrial Chemicals (Notifications and Assessment) Act 1989 to allow for the introduction of new industrial chemicals for the sole purpose of commercial evaluation. New industrial chemicals introduced for this purpose are to be exempt from the assessment provisions of the Act. This means that importers and manufacturers may evaluate the. commercial potential of a new industrial chemical without having to invest resources in preparing the detailed notification package covering the chemical's physical and cheniical properties and toxicology which is currently required. The Bill enhances innovative product development by significantly reducing regulatory requirements. The Bill provides that new industrial chemicals introduced for the sole purpose of commercial evaluation have to be notified to the director of the scheme and that information on occupational health, public health and environment protection is provided; Proposed section 21A deals with the object of the commercial evaluation permit system. The object is to provide a simple means of bypassing. the assessment certificate system where a new industrial chemical is being introduced for the sole purpose of commer,cial evaluation while ensuring that adequate safeguards are imposed. One safeguard is the provision of a material safety data sheet to the director of the scheme. This specifies any health hazards that could be caused by the chemical, the manner of handling the chemical and procedures to be adopted in the event of any emergency involving the chemical. . Another safeguard is to be found in clause 6 of the Bill, which subjects chemicals introduced for commercial evaluation purposes to the priority existing chemical provisions of the Act. These allow for the chemical to be assessed. The Bill provides that chemicals introduced under a commercial evaluation permit would normally be introduced for a period of one year only and in quantities not exceeding 1,000 kilograms and must be used for the sole . purpose of commercial evaluation. There is a facility to increase the amount up to 2,000 kilograms and for a· period up to two years where the director is satisfied that the increased quantity and the increased time are necessary for an effective commercial evaluation. The Bill also includes a power to impose conditions and a power to revoke or vary any condition on permits granted to allow for commercial evaluation. There is a significant penalty for a breach of the conditions on which a commercial evaluation permit is granted. As confidentiality 'may be an important consideration in new product development, the Bill allows an applicant the right to apply for certain information to be granted confidential status. The needs of industry are met because a manufacturer or importer of a new industrial chemical will be perm'itted to test the chemical with a view to ascertaining its potential for commercial application without the regulatory burden of having the chemical fully assessed. If the evaluation Indicates that the chemical has a commercial market the importer or manufacturer can make an informed decision whether it is worthwhile to apply to have the chemical notified arid assessed as a new chemical. In this way the Bill will remove some of the commercial risks currently associated with product development. The passage of the Bill will show the strength of the Government's commitment to reducing the regulatory burden on industry. The Bill provides an easy and cost effective way for Australian industry to extend existing markets and create new markets. By minimising the regulatory cost of developing and improving products, while maintaining safeguards, the Government is determined to create a regulatory climate which will foster industry development. This will assist in achieving the Government's micro-economic reform goals. In canvassing the need for the commercial evaluation category in the Act, the Government has consulted widely. It has consulted with relevant Commonwealth, State and Territory agencies as well as the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Chemical Confederation of Australia, the Australian Chemical Industry Council, their affiliates, other industry associations not affiliated with these peak bodies, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and interested non-government organisations. All parties support the amendment. Industry has sent a clear message that the new category will have benefits flowing 'from' it. These include a proper consideration of possible risks to health and environmental matters and removal of a restraint to innovation and trade. I commend the Bill to the House and I, present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill. ' Leave granted for debate to continue forthwith.",163
262,Mr ANDERSON,PAIRS,"Gwydir) (11.38 p.m.)In the absence of my colleague the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who would normally have carried the passage of ,this legislation for the Opposition, I seek to make a few remarks.' We will not be opposing - he legislation. As noted by the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh), the Industrial .Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Amendment Bill amends the I.ndustrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989, which established the national industrial chemical notification and assessment scheme. The 1989 Act established a national system of notification assessment of industrial'chemicals to protect people at work, the public and the environment from the harmful effects of industrial chemicals. The Bill is a progression from the 1989 Act, which was intended to remove an impediment to product development which was, I might add, of great significance to Australia's rural industries. The Bill provides for the exclusion of chemicals which are being commercially evaluated from the elaborate, time-consuming and expensive assessment provisions of the Act. I note the remarks made in the Senate by Senator Parer and record the coalition's agreement with the posi-ion which he set out there. The Bill has been sought by industry, and, the coalition supports this reduction of regulatory burden on industry while maintaining necessary safeguards. It is a forerunner to a number of changes to improve the scheme, and I understand that the industry is quite enthusiastic about further amendments to be introduced later year. As I said earlier, the Opposition supports the Bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion byMs MCHugh) read a third time.

The following answers to questions were circulated: Government Debt Ratios (Question No. 818) Mr Langmore asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 15 May 1991: (1) What is the ratio of government debt to GDP in each aECD country for the most recent year for which data are available. (2) How many aECD countries have (a) larger and (b) smaller ratios of government debt to GOP than Australia. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The aECD publishes broadly comparable data on the ratio of general government debt, in both gross and net terms, to GDP but does not publish such statistics for every member country. General government data exclude the operations of public trading enterprises. Estimates published by the aECD of the ratios of general government gross debt to GDP for 1990 and 1991 are shown in Table 1. aECD published estimates of the ratio of general government net debt to GDP cover only 14 of the aECD's 24 members and do not yet include Australia. Net government debt data for 1990 and 1991 published by the aECD are set out in Table 2. There are significant differences between gross and net debt data because the latter government financial assets. In particular, superannuation and other employee-related trust fund balances are netted out in the data. (2) All 17 of the other countries for which United States(d) aECD data are available had larger gross governJapan(e) ment debt to GDP ratios than Australia in both . Germany(e) 1990 and 1991. While the aECD does not provide a set of Italy comparable data for net government debt ratios that United Kingdom includes Australia, on the basis of an estimate, Canada shown in the footnote to Table 2, of Australia's net Belgium government debt to GDP ratio as at end-June 1990 Denmark (the latest year for which an Australian estimate is Finland(e) available): NA (a) ten countries for which aECD data are available had net government debt to GDP ratios larger than Australia in 1990; and (b) three countries had net government debt to GDP ratios smaller than Australia while the ratio for Japan was about the same as Australia's.

For Australia, this means the data include the central government operations of the Commonwealth, State and local governments. The operations of public trading enterprises are not included. (b) The gross holdings of debt between central government agencies are not netted out. (c) EPAC has estimated that Australia's net government debt to GDP ratio was 10.8 per cent at end-June 1990 (the latest year for which an Australian estimate is available). (d) Excludes capital outlays of the Resolution Trust Corporation. (e) Financial assets exclude corporate shares. State Insurance (Question No. 1153) Mr Hollis asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 16 October 1991: Does any federal instrumentality have arrangements with State insurance corporations comparable with the arrangements which the Reserve Bank has with State banks; if so, what (a) are the States and (b) is the nature of the arrangements. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Insurance and Superannuation Commission has a responsibility to supervise insurance companies, insurance brokers and superannuation funds in accordance with the requirements of the relevant legislation. However, this supervision does not normally extend to the activities of State Government insurers because Section 51 (xiv) of the Constitution preserves the rights of States to legislate in matters of State insurance not extending beyond the limits. of the State concerned. NA 1990 1991 During the last financial year, four State Govern% % ment insurance offices conducted life insurance -19.9 business. Only one of those companies was subject 32.7 to federal supervision because it operated beyond -6.7 its own State boundaries. This company, G10 Life Limited, which was established as a subsidiary company of the NSW GIO in order to transact life insurance business outside NSW, is registered under the Life Insurance Act 1945 and is subject to the provisions of that Act in the same manner as any other life office. The State insurers conducting life insurance business provide statistics and accounts to· the Insurance and Superannuation Commission solely to enable total industry data to be tabulated. NA The Insurance Act 1973 exempts State Government insurance offices from the supervision of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission whether or not they conduct business beyond the limits of the State concerned. While some States have implemented rules under which their general insurance offices are required to comply with Commonwealth legislation, they do not comply with normal Commission requirements for such things as lodgement of returns, gaining approval for reinsurance arrangements and assessment of assets and liabilities for solvency test purposes. Should a State Government general insurance office be privatised and no longer come under the control of the relevant State Government it would come under the operations of the Insurance Act 1973. Televising of Sporting Events (Question No. 1333) Mr Bruce Scott asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, uPQn notice, on 26 February 1992: Is it a fact that Queensland commercial satellite television broadcasts Channel 10 programs exclusively; if so, will the ABC be allowed to telecast test cricket matches, and other special event programs which are not available to Channel 10, in those areas serviced by satellite television and not receiving an aggregated television service.",165
263,Mr BEAZLEY,GENERAL INSURANCE,"The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question, based in part on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Until 31 December 1991 the ABC had a commercial agreement with the Nine Network to televise a comprehensive live coverllge of the Test Cricket to all country areas. Following the implementation of an aggregated television service throughout Australia on 1 January 1992, however, PBL Marketing which controls Australian rights to local Test Cricket chose not to make the regional rights available to the ABC. Without the legal right to continue coverage of Test Cricket it is not possible for the ABC to serve those areas where the signal from the Nine Network is not available. The ABC has chosen not to purchase secondary or regional rights. The major problem for the ABC is splitting itS· satellite feeds. The North East satellite footprint does not presently allow a localised transmission pattern. The ABC is not in a position to provide ""one-off"" and isolated transmissions which disrupt its own schedules and transmissions. The Minister is unable to provide information on QSTV's broadcasting strategy generally. In respect of test cricket, the Minister has been informed that Channel Nine sold the rights to QSTV to broadcast the last test series in full. Apparently it was QSTV's commercial decision to broadcast only highlights from this coverage. ABC: Television Programs (Question No. 1348) Mr Mack asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 27 February 1992: (1) Does the ABC receive contributions from outside parties for the production of some of its television programs. (2) Does the ABC provide a full account of outside contributions it receives in its annual reports; if not, (a) why not ensure that the ABC provides a full account in future annual reports. (3) In 1990-91, (a) how many outside contributions were made to the ABC, (b) who made each contribution, (c) what was the sum of each contribution and (d) to which television production was each made. (4) In 1990-91, (a) how many staff positions within ABC TV were either (i) wholly or (ii) partly funded by outside contributions, (b) which positions were so funded and (c) with respect to each position, (i) what was the source of the contribution, (ii) what was the sum of the contribution and (iii) if the position was partly funded by outside contributions, what part was so funded. (5) Is there an ABC program titled ""The Million Dollar Idea""; if so, (a) what is its current status, (b) was the program funded by a Government agency or other outside party; if so, by whom and (c) what was the full cost to the ABC of producing the program, including the value of any ABC facilities provided to a co-producer.",171
264,Mr BEAZLEY,GENERAL INSURANCE,"The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question, based on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation: (1) The ABC does not receive contributions per se from outside parties for the production of some of its television programs. The ABC is expressly authorised by Section 25(5)(b) of the ABC Act to enter into co-productions with bona fide producers of programs, films, sound recordings, concerts and public entertainment (including sporting events). These co-productions often, but not always, involve the ABC receiving payments from coproducers in order to help offset its production costs. (2) Disclosure of financial information for coproductions is made in the ABC's Financial Statements in particular at Note 2 to the Statements. The Financial Statements are included in the Annual Report and fully meet Australian Accounting Standards requirements, the ""Guidelines for Financial Statements of Commonwealth Entities"", and requIrements of the Australian National Audit and (b) will the Minister Office. (3) Information regarding co-productions entered into by the ABC during 1990/91 is considered commercial-in-confidence as release of this information would negate the ABC's future bargaining position. (4) It is not possible to state precisely how many, or more particularly which positions within ABC television are wholly or partly funded by payments received from co-producers. In some instances a co-producer will necessitate the creation of particular positions which will be on a fixed-term ""run of show"" basis. Other productions will create a demand for existing .ABC labour which in turn will justify the retention of that labour. For each dollar spent on program production in 1990/91, approximately 65 cents was spent on ABC labour. On this basis the total co-production receipts would have provided funding for approximately 169 full year equivalent staff. (5) ""The Million Dollar Idea was the name given to a program concept which was offered to ABC television in 1991. The program was offered to the ABC by the independent production company Clever Country. The ABC entered into a licence fee/facilities hire deal with Clever Country, but the program which resulted was not up to ABC standards and has never been completed. The value of ABC facilities used in the development of the series was $64,000. The funds and resources contributed by Clever Country amounted to $306,000.

In some cases broadcasts may also be receivable in parts of adjacent FEDs not listed. (2) The transmitters on this list have been funded by the Government through the Department of Transport and Communications under announced SBS extension programs. Smaller communities on , the list have been included because they are within the service area of major centres. SBS transmitters have also been provided by communities under the self-help broadcasting reception scheme in Wagga Wagga and Griffith NSW, Swan Hill Vic, and numerous smaller communities. (3) The Government is committed to the SBS and its role in reflecting the multicultural nature of Australia. However, as limited resources are available, SBS television extension must be considered on a phased basis. In June 1989, the Government announced the extension of SBS to Darwin and eight regional areas. The announced timetable is: 1991 Latrobe Valley 1992 Bendigo, Ballarat, Darling Downs. 1993 Spencer Gulf, Darwin, North-East Tasmania 1994 Cairns, Townsville The Government has not yet considered any extensions after that. (4) The extension of SBS television to the NSW north coast from Taree to Tweed Heads would require the provision of transmitters and associated equipment at three main transmitter sites and six translator sites at an estimated cost of $7 million plus annual operating costs of about $0.83 million. (5) The needs of residents of the NSW north coast will be taken into account if and when further extensions are considered. Residents in rural areas not served by terrestrial transmitters have two options for reception of SBS television. The first is to install individual satellite receiving dishes. alternative, the Government's Self-help Broadcasting Reception Scheme (SBRS) allows community groups to fund the establishment of facilities to receive SBS from the satellite system and the FEDERAL retransmission of those services within a local AREA ELECTORAL coverage area. The Government provides financial DIVISION assistance in the form of sales tax exemption for satellite receiving equipment used for this purpose. Ballarat Technical assistance is also available from the Bendigo Department of Transport and Communications. SBS Television (Question No. 1375) Mr Ewen Cameron asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 3 March 1992: (I) Has Albury-Wodonga been on the priority list to receive SBS transmissiDn.

(5) Has the ABC recently issued a marketing kit which promotes ABC TV facilities to potential clients as Australia's finest prod-ction house. (6) Is it a fact that the ABC does not compete on equal tenns with private film and video production houses because the ABC's capital is mainly provided and its recurrent costs are mainly met from appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. (7) Is the Government committed to making Australian industry competitive and efficient through the instrument of the level playing field; if so, how can this be reconciled with the marketing of ABC TV facilities to outside clients. (8) Is the marketing of ABC TV facilities to outside clients for profit in accordance with Government direction; if not, will the Minister review the marketing of ABC TV facilities to outside clients.",175
268,Mr BEAZLEY,BORROWINGS INTEREST REPAYMENTS,"The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the .honourable member's question, based in part on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation: (1) Yes. The capital investment in facilities excluding land and buildings after accumulated depreciation is valued at $57m. The cost of maintaining production staff and facilities in 1991/92 is $118m. (2) Yes, the cost of maintaining the facilities and capital investment are currently. being met by appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. (3) The ABC is an independent statutory authority which makes its own management and commercial decisions under its charter and in the light of other legislative requirements and Government policies. This Government has encouraged the ABC to undertake limited commercial and entrepreneurial activity so as to supplement its Budget appropriations. In this.context the ABC has elected to make film and video productions for outside clients for profit. (4) Yes, the ABC is competing for clients with private film and video productions houses in some instances. (5) Yes, in October 1991 the ABC distributed promotional material to approximately 3,000 addressees throughout AUstralia. (6) There is not a level playing field for either the ABC or the commercial sector in areas where they compete. Both have advantages and disadvantages which require comparisons to be made with care. The ABC negotiates from a rate card set generally at going market rates and is often undercut by the commercial sector. Tenders are not always judged solely on a lowest price basis but often have regard to other qualitative factors. (7) See answer to Question 6 above. (8) As indicated in response to Question (3) above, the Government has encouraged the ABC to undertake limited commercial and entrepreneurial activities. The Government is planning to introduce a Bill shortly to enhance accountability requirements for these activities. ABC: Television Dramas (Question No. 1413) Mr Mack asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 24 March 1992: (l) Has ABC TV produced any television drama programs under (a) co-production or (b) pre-sale arrangements since 1988; if so, (i) which programs, (ii) which' outside production companies were involved in the production of each, (iii) what is the total value of the contracts for drama program production awarded to each production company and (iv) when was the co-production or pre-sale contract entered into for each program.

269,Mr BEAZLEY,BORROWINGS INTEREST REPAYMENTS,"The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question, based in part on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation: (1) (a) and (b). Yes, the ABC has produced television programs under co-production and presale arrangements since 1988. (i) and (ii) See attached Table for progrflms produced under co-production arrangements since 1988.

(iv) See attached Table (fifth column) for the dates of each co-production contract. (2) ABC Television Commissioning Committee members responsible for assessing or recommending proposals for ABC TV engagement in co-production or pre-sale arrangements with outside production companies are: Director Television, Controller Television Production and Development, Controller Television Resources and Services, Network Programming, a Legal Officer, Federal Head TV Production Planning plus the Head of the relevant Department. (3) The Head of TV Drama, with the assistance of her Executive Producer In Melbourne, is directly responsible for assessing and recommending all proposals for ABC engagement in co-production or pre-sale arrangements with outside production companies for TV Drama programs. When the Head of ABC TV Drama proposes proceeding with a project, she arranges the development of that project and supervises the negotiation of the terms under which such development is entered into. The Head of TV Drama makes a recommendation to the ABC's Commissioning Committee and if the project meets the approval of the Commissioning Committee and the Managing Director, it then goes to the ABC Board for ratification. All of TV Drama's development and production activities are carried out with regular reporting to the Controller of TV Production and Development entered and monthly reporting on all projects in co-development or co-production to the ABC Board through the Director of Television. (4) The Head of TV Drama is responsible for the overall supervision of all ABC TV Drama productions. The day-today supervision of the ABC's involvement is undertaken by the Production Controller of the Department and the officers answerable to him. (5) Commissioning Committee approval to award a contract for the production of a TV program under co-production or pre-sale arrangements, and the ratification of the project by the ABC Board, are dependent on the appropriateness of the project to the ABC in both artistic and financial terms. Projects must be high quality programs which meet the ABC's charter and which are suitable within the mix of ABC TV Drama programming. All proposals to be contracted must meet the ABC's internal guidelines with respect to budget, costings and investment position.

The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in its National Inquiry. Into Racist Violence Report (NIRV Report) recommended that any qualification on Australia's obligations under Article 4(a) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Fonns of Racial Discrimination be removed. The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody recommended that Governments which have not already done so legislate to proscribe racial vilification. In the response to that Report the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs noted that before legislative action can be taken, Australia would need to withdraw its reservation to Article 4(a) of the Convention. He also noted that the Government is disposed to legislate to specifically prohibit incitement to racial violence in circumstances where an appropriate link could be established between the act of incitement and the act of violence threatened or occurring. The Government wi\l be considering the issue of racial vilification shortly. (3) New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory have legislated to prohibit racial vilification. Victoria has announced that it intends to introduce legislation to prohibit acts of racist abuse, harassment and incitement to racial hatred, South Australia is considering extending the law beyond existing discrimination prohibitions.

272,Mr GRIFFITHS,CAPRICORNIA KENNEDY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Government established the Bureau of Tourism Research (BTR) in 1987 in accordance with the recommendations of a Government Inquiry into Tourism. The primary functions of the BTR are to provide a national focus for collection, analysis and dissemination of data and to conduct or coordinate research on priority issues in the tourism field. The Bureau is funded by the Commonwealth and State{ferritory Governments on a 2: 1 basis. Its budget in 1991/92 is $2.6 million. While the BTR undertakes a broader range of activities than pure market research, it is respon- levels. sible for the conduct of the two key monitors of tourism activity in Australia, the International Visitors Survey (IVS) and the Domestic Tourism Monitor (DTM), which provide an important focus for market research. The Australian Tourist Commission (ATC) and the State{ferritory tourism authorities also conduct market research, as do major tourism operators. The ATC's market research focuses heavily on market segmentation studies of Australia's major or emerging overseas tourist markets. State and Territory tourism authorities conduct market research in both the domestic and international markets. (2) A broad range of tourism or tourism related research is carried out by State and Territory Government tourism authorities and by consultants on behalf of the private sector. For instance, the industry, through Tourism Training Australia (TTA), researches its training needs. The industry also undertakes research under the auspices of the Australian Tourism Research Institute and the National Centre for Studies in Travel and Tourism. The BTR has focused improving the quality, flexibility and responsiveness of its domestic and international visitor surveys, the provision of technical advice to government and industry, and on increasing its forecasting and analytical output. The emphasis of the ATC's activities has been on Australia's overseas tourist markets. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) conducts a comprehensive quarterly survey of tourist accommodation in Australia and other surveys of selected service industries, including tourist accommodation, travel agencies, motor vehicle hire and tourist attractions. (3) A recent evaluation of the BTR concluded that a number of areas of unmet demand needed to be addressed and the rePort of the Tourism Working Group on Ecologically Sustainable Development identified the need for an expansion of research to facilitate the development of an ecologically sustainable tourism industry. (4) Additional research is needed at the local and regional level. The BTR is developing a methodological kit for regional tourism monitors, which will extend the IVS and DTM. This will ensure that the existing national surveys become more relevant and useful resources for tourism development at these (5) Research on the impact of major resource projects on tourism activity in specific regions is generally commissioned by industry interests and undertaken by private consultants, as is the required environmental research. . (6) Tourism research and statistical collections undertaken by the Bureau of Tourism Research, the Australian Tourist Commission, the Australian Bureau of Statistics and State and Territory tourism authorities are funded by the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments. Funds for research into workforce issues in the tourism industry are provided by the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Department of Industrial Relations. Industry contributes to the cost of research conducted by the Australian Tourist Commission and Tourism Training Australia. Universities' research activities sometimes cover tourism, while most commissioned research for the industry is carried out at the industry's expense. (7) The tourism industry has a keen interest in, and recognises the value of any research on issues 0"" related to enhancing its growth potential, including economic, environmental, social and cultural issues. (8) Yes. In relation to part 7(a): (a) The BTR has developed a CD-ROM (Compact Disk-Read Only Memory) based package for the supply of IVS and DTM statistics in electronic fu-; . (b) the project was funded by the BTR; and (c) the results will be available shortly to industry on a fee for service basis. In relation to part 7(b): (a) Case studies of specific projects are undertaken by the project's proponents and are generally commercial-in-confidence reports which are the proponent's property. The Australian Bankers' Association is developing a kit to assist small tourism businesses develop investment proposals; (b) the costs of the Association's initiative are being met by the Association; and (c) the Association will disseminate its material through its normal channels. In relation to part 7(c): (a) I understand that Australian zoos have encountered few problems with influencing koalas to breed .. (b) unknown; and (c) unknown. In relation to part 7(d): (a) The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, with assistance from the BTR, is developing a strategy for monitoring levels of tourist activity in the Reef area; Base line studies and monitoring of fauna and water quality are required to be undertaken before the GBRMPA grants permits to tourism operators applying to conduct activities in the Marine Park which have the potential to illlpact on the Park; (b) the development of strategies and policies for monitoring tourist activity is funded by the Commonwealth. Studies related to the impact of specific tourism activities on the Great Barrier Reef are funded by the operators concerned; and (c) the manner and timing of the dissemination of the findings has yet to be decided by the Authority. In relation to part 7(e): (a) I understand that numerous grass trials are conducted throughout Australia by government agricultural departments and private firms. With regard to the development of grasses for golf courses in the tropics, the Queensland Department of Primary Industry employs research scientists who work on improving turf grasses; (b) unknown; and (c) unknown. In relation to parts 7(f), (g) and (h): (a) the tourism industry is aware of the need to protect and manage the environmental resources on which it depends. For instance, the Australian Tourism Industry Association, in July 1990, developed a 'Code of Environmental Practice' to facilitate achievement of ecological sustainability in the industry. The significance to the tourism industry of specific issues such as the items covered in 7 (f), (g) and (h), was reinforced in the recommendations contained in the report of the Tourism Working Group on Ecologically Sustainable Development; (b) unknown; and (c) unknown. (9) (a) I am not aware of any specific research by the tourism industry into increasing the survival and reproduction rates of koalas in captivity. However, I understand that Australian zoos have enCountered few problems with breeding koalas. (b) I do not envisage that the tourism industry'S needs will suffer if the tourism industry did not undertake this research, particularly given the research ipterests of the natural environment authorities. (10) The Tourism Working Group on Ecologically Sustainable Development, which included representatives of peak tourism industry organisations, discussed options for establishing a tourism research and development corporation. (11) The question of research and development bodies is an issue that is currently under consideration by the ESD Working Group. Its conclusions will be considered in due course. (12) No. (13) Research projects which emanate from governments are considered by the Tourism Research Committee and the BTR. If the BTR cannot undertake any particular project in-house, it determines the body to conduct the research through the public tender process. (14) Unknown. (15) Unknown .. (16) A recent evaluation of the BTR concluded that it has been effective in carrying out the objectives laid down by Tourism Ministers and continues to meet a well-established need for tourism data and analysis. It also concluded that there are' public good aspects to the provision of this information which fonns the basis for improved government planning and better decision making within industry. The evaluation of the Australian Tourist Commission concluded that the ATC has been effective in meeting its marketing objectives as set out in its charter; that the impact of this marketing is positive; that it provides important value added by increasing visitor flows to Australia'; and that Government funding of international tourism promotion is justified. Department of Industrial Relations: Employment Goals (Question No. 1503) Mr Langmore asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 28 April 1992: Following the Prime Minster's pledge at the start of the One Nation strategy to fight the battle against une,mployment and for economic recovery with all the energy he can muster, is the Minister's Department giving pre-eminence to the goal of growth of employment in Australia in its corporate planning and policy development; if so, (a) how is pre-eminence being given, (b) in what ways is the goal being implemented and (c) are there any departmental activities which are inconsistent with maximising employment growth.",188
273,Mr WILLIS,CAPRICORNIA KENNEDY,"The Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) and (b) The Departm-nt's primary corporate goal is to assist the Government in meeting its industrial relations and wider economic and social objectives. Promoting economic recovery and employment growth has been a high priority for the Government during the year. The Department has continued to progress the Government's program of award restructuring and other workplace refonn initiatives to improve the productivity of Australian industry and the competitiveness of the Australian economy and provide more and better jobs. Further transfonnation of the industrial relations system occurred with the implementation of workplace bargaining. Management approaches based on consultation and participatory processes are being encouraged to harness the ideas of workers and their trade unions in devising strategies for economic reconstruction and workplace refonn. (c) There are no departmental activities inconsistent with the pursuit of Government policies maximising employment growth. Department of Primary Industries and Energy: Employment Goals (Question No. 1505) Mr Langmore asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 28 April 1992: Following the Prime Minister's pledge at the start of the One Nation strategy to fight the battle against unemployment and for economic recovery with all the energy he can muster, is the Minister's Department giving pre-eminence to the goal of growth of employment in Australia in its corporate planning and policy development; if so, (a) how is pre-eminence being given, (b) in what ways is the goal being implemented and (c) are there any departmental activities which are inconsistent with maximising employment growth. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department of Primary Industries and Energy has in place a range of policies and programs which, sustain employment through the advancement of Australia's agriculture, minerals, energy, fisheries and forestry industries. These industries are important contributors to the economy in their own right. In addition, they have strong links to other industries as well as to regional economic development and employment. The Department is also working with industry groups to assist in the development of value adding activities, particularly in early stage processing of products in which Australia has a comparative advantage. (a) and (b) The Department's approach to employment creation in the rural and resources sector is based on strengthening the international competitiveness of Australia's primary and energy industries and processing activities based on these commodities. The growth prospects of these has industries, and the economy more generally, depend crucially on adequate infrastructure and efficient industrial and market structures. They are also strongly influenced by uptake of new technologies and industrial processes, based on relevant research and development. A significant proportion of the $2.3 billion increase in expenditure arising from the Government's ""One Nation"" strategy will be spent on C improving national infrastructure. This will not only directly lower costs and improve the competitiveness of our rural and resource industries, but families in regional Australia will also benefit directly from the social justice and family support measures outlined. The improved depreciation and investment allowance arrangements announced in the ""One Nation"" economic statement will drive increased production, exports and employment in the rural and resources sector. The liberalisation of foreign investment guidelines in relation to mining projects is expected to foster more rapid application processing by foreign companies which have expressed interest in developing Australian assets. In addition, the removal of export controls on iron ore, total volume approval for mineral sands projects, streamlined approvals processes for major projects together with land access initiatives will provide the basis for continued growth in Australia's crucial mineral and resource industries. The introduction of the 10 per cent Development Allowance for major projects with capital costs of over $50 million will complement taxation reforms and accelerate the early development of valueadding activities, such as large projects to process and package food to supply the domestic and export markets. These measures will be further assisted by the Government's research and development initiatives. A growing, prosperous rural and resource sector will more readily accept research initiatives. The Government's contribution to the Research and Development Corporations will exceed $112 million during the course of the current financial year. This expenditure will encourage a further $70 million from private industry sources through existing research and development matching arrangements. Effective applied research will, through the diversification of economic activity and gro,,:,ing value-adding related investment, provide rural and regional Australia with a wider and more secure employment base. The ""One Nation"" Statement modified and clarified the law on partial debt writeoffs and debt for equity swaps. These 3J1lendments will offer incentives to financial institutions to avoid foreclosures and provide the maximum incentive for rural based businesses to trade their way out of difficulties and maintain employment levels. Employment in farm and rural areas is also being strengthened through a number of specific assistance measures introduced' or boosted through the ""One Nation"" strategy. The Government will provide an additional $10 million this financial year and in each of the next two financial years under Part A of the Rural Adjustment Scheme (RAS). RAS Part A provides interest subsidies to help farmers implement farm build-up and improvement programs or to adopt new technologies or management systems. Total RAS funding has now been increased to $193.9 million in 1991-92. A new $21 million crop planting scheme for the 1992 winter and the 1992-93 summer crop planting seasons is being established. The scheme will provide eligible farmers with a 75 per cent interest subsidy on commercial finance to meet the costs of crop establishment. The scheme will be tightly targeted to viable crop farmers who are in severe financial difficulties. It will be fully Commonwealth funded and administered through the States' Rural Adjustment Authorities. The Department is also providing additional funding for the Rural Counselling Program (RCP) of $0.245 million in 1991-92 and $0.77 million in each of 1992-93, 1993-94 and 1994-95. This will allow 13 new counselling services to be established over this period, and the provision of a rural counselling resource centre for the training of rural counsellors. The RCP assists farming families facing financial difficulties by providing advice and referrals to other services. The goal of employment growth has also been emphasised through recent ministerial initiatives impacting on the JobSkills labour market program. Approximately 500 places in this program have been secured in 1992/93 to pilot test a Landcare work skills development initiative. These measures complement the range of measures already in place to help employment in rural and regional Australia, such as the Local Government Development Program, the Business Advisers for Rurlll Areas Scheme, the Innovative Agricultural Marketing Program and Marketing Skills Program. In taking all of these steps, Primary Industries and Energy is giving strong emphasis to the goal of employment growth in IlIral and resources sector. (c) No. Treasury: Professional Staff (Question No. 1511) Mr Langmore asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 28th April 1992: How many of your Department's professional officers (a) have studied or (b) are studying economics at the Australian National University and what proportion of the professional staff does each figure represent. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: 'Professional officers' in respect of each has been interpreted to be officers in economic policy advising positions. (a) 64, 29% (b) 13,6% Note that within Australia Treasury officers are located only in Canberra, so that officers undertaking part-time study usually do so at the Australian National UniverSity (ANU). Of the 13 at the ANU at present, 11 are studying part-time; of the 64 who have studied at ANU, 35 (or 55%) also have qualifications from other institutions. Statutory Authorities: Employment Goals (Question No. 1519) Mr Langmore asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 28 April 1992: Following the Prime Minister's pledge at the start of the One Nation strategy to fight the battle against unemployment and for economic recovery with all the energy he can muster, is the (a) Affirmative Action Agency, (b) Australian Trade Union Training Authority, (c) Joint Council of the Australian Public Service and (d) National Labour Consultative Council giving pre-eminence to the goal of growth of employment in Australia in its corporate planning and policy development; if so, in each case, (i) how is pre-eminence being given, (Ii) in what ways is the goal being implemented and (iii) are there any organisational activities which are inconsistent with maximising employ the Department of . ment growth.",190
274,Mr WILLIS,CAPRICORNIA KENNEDY,"The Minister for Industrial the Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) (i) and (ii) The Affirmative Action Agency administers the Afftrmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act 1986. The Act requires employers covered by the Act to take a pro-active approach to eliminating discrimination against women in the workplace and promoting equal employment for women. The Act has an important role in the Goverrunent's workplace reform strategy. It is only' by realising the full potential of all employees that Australian industry will achieve the competitiveness so necessary for providing jobs. (iii) None of the activities of the Agency are inconsisten,t with the pursuit of Government answer policies maximising employment growth. (b) (i) and (ii) TUTA's primary function is to plan, develop and to undertake programs of trade union training in Australia. TUTA has placed the highest priority on planning, development, promotion and delivery of training to promote workplace change. This area of training includes the development of enterprise negotiations and effective involvement in consultative mechanisms around work organisation, job design, skill formation, job security, prciduct quality and related issues. TUTA delivers 80% of training through industry programs which allow the tailoring of courses to meet the needs of particular industries. Training promoting workplace change is also delivered through the general training program. TUTA is also delivering this training at the enterprise level by agreement between employers and unions. The enterprise level programs often include joint training. of union and management representatives on consultative committees and assist them to identify a range of issues which can be addressed to improve productive performance. In recognition of the growth in. demand for this type of training and its importance in developing a more efficient, skilled and prciductive Australia, TUTA has established a National Unit to coordinate and deliver workplace change training at the enterprise level. (iii) There are no Authority activities inconsistent with the pursuit of Government policies maximising employment growth. (c) & (d) (i) and (ii) The Department of Industrial Relations corporate planning and policy development encompasses the Joint Council of the Australian Public Service and the National Labour Consultative Council. The Department's prim8ry corporate goal is to assist' the Government in meeting its industrial relations and wider economic and social objectives. Promoting economic recovery and employment growth has been a high priority for the Government dUrlngthe year. The Department has continued to' progress the Government's program of award restructuring and other workplace reform initiatives to improve the prodi.Jctiyity of Australian industry and the competitiveness of the Australian economy and provide more and better jobs. Further transformation of the industrial relations system has occurred with the ilnpiemerttation of workplaCe bargaining. Managelnent approaches based on consultation and participatory processes, including Joint Council of the Australian Public Service and National Labour Consultative Council, are being encouraged to harness the ideas of workers and their trade unions in devising strategies for economic reconstruction and workplace reform. (iii) There are no departmental activities inconsistent with the pursuit of Government policies maximising employment growth. Commonwealth-State Disability' (Question No. 1529)' Mr Aldred asked the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, upon notice, (;m 28 April 1992: (1) What are the principles which will govern the allocation of funds through the CoinmonwealthState Disability Agreement, particularly in Victoria. (2) Will (a) $100m f-r accommodation and (b) $145m for quality of life be allocated under the agreement; if so, what proportion of the reSpective amounts will be allocated to the psychiatrically disabled. ' "" (3) What process is being followed to determine the principles governing the allocation of funds under the agreement. (4) Is the field of psychiatric disability represented in (a) determining the principles referred to in part (3) and (b) allocating the funds; if so, (i) who are the respective represen-tives and (ii) on what basis were they chosen; if not, why not. (5) How will the direction of funds allocated under the agreement to the psychiatrically disabled be ensured.",192
275,Mr HOWE,CAPRICORNIA KENNEDY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The principles which will govern the allocation of funds through the Commonwealth/State Disability Agreement (CSDA) are the same regardless of the' State/Territory concerned. Under the CSDA the Commonwealth will have administrative responsibility for 'employment services while the StatesfTerritories will have responsibility for accommodation and other support services. Areas such as advocacy and research and development will continue to be the responsibility of both levels of Government; Funds corresponding to the various service types will move to the level of Government which assumes responsibility for the particular service types. The principles governing this transfer are as follows: i. State/Territory G-vemments are required to introduce legislation; complementary to the Commonwealth Disability Services Act 1986 (DSA) before there will be any transfer of services and corresponding resources; Agreement ii. rationalisation of service provision will be achieved across both levels of Government. Thus, there will be a reduction in overlap, duplication and gaps in services provision resulting in savings which will be channelled - ack into the provision of disability services;' ,, ' iii. the transfer of services between the levels of Goveinme-t will be accompanied by a transfer of their associated level of funding. These services will continue - o be funded at existing levels for at least, twelve months. After this time the Government will have the ability to increase or reduce the level of funding provided to imy service in line witlt contractual arrangements; , iv. while funding levels of individual services may ,vary after twelve months, it has been agreed that the rationalisation will not be seen by either level of Governrnent as an opportunity to reduce funding overall (see Special Premiers' Conference Communique 30/31 July 1991); v. the Statesrrerritories will receive growth monies and additional transition paymentS to make extra places available and to assist the process of change towards service delivery models that reflect the Principles and Objectives embodied in the DSA; vi. payments to the Statesrrerritories will be subject to requirements for reporting on new places and to the conditions of the Agreement being met; vii. the transition payments offered under the Agreement will be provided on a per capita basis. The transition payment is additional and separate to any funds provided by the Commonwealth under s14 of the DSA; viii. the Commpnwealthis committed to achievjng an equal per capita distribution of Commonwealth funds made available to disability services to the States.. Once equalisation is achieved, Commonwealth growth funds will be offered to States on a per capita basis. (2) The CSDA provides for: i. the allocation of growth funds to fund new accommodation places. This amounts to $100m over five years; and ii. the making of transition payments to improve the quality of existing services rather than for the provision of new services. This amounts to $145m over five years. The allocation of these funds will be achieved through·planl1ing processes that are encouraged by the Agreement rather than by allocation purely on disability type. Clause 6 of the Agreement provides for planning processes where both the Commonwealth and each State will consult and seek to agree on the establishment of broad program initiatives and. targets in respect of people with disabilities identified as program priorities (eg 'schoolleavers), service types and regions. The Agreement provides that the Commonwealth and each State will develop three year forward plans for those service types for which they have responsibility. The preparation by the Commonwealth and a State will occur in consultation·with each other, with consumer representatives and with other relevant bodies, organisations and groups. (3) The principles referred to in Question 1 were developed through a process of public consultation and negotiation by Heads of Government. This process commenced in 1990. (4) Consumers, including people with a psychiatric disability, have played an important part in determining the framework for the rationalisation, that is, the Commonwealth/State Disability Agreement through the initial consultative processes undertaken by both levels of Government. People with psychiatric disabilities, along with other disability groups have had an opportunity to participate in the determination of the principles as outlined in 3 above. Similarly, people with disabilities will have the opportunity to participate in the allocation of funds through the planning processes outlined in 2 above. . The implementation phase of the CSDA is a Government to Government responsibility and is being undertaken through a process of multilateral and bilateral discussions. (5) People with psychiatric disabilities, who have been accorded a low priority for funding under the Commonwealth Disability Services Act in the past, will be eligible to access services under the Agreement according to their individual needs. One of the most significant benefits of the CSDA is that by clearly delineating the responsibilities of each level of Government, the lack of clarity that has occurred in the past regarding provision of services for people with psychiatric disabilities should be eliminated. Employment services for. people with psychiatric diSabilities, as for all people with disabilities, will be the responsibility of the Commonwealth. Accommodation and other support services for people with psychiatric disabilities will be administered by the States{ferritories. Acute medical services for people with psychiatric disabilities will remain a health sector responsibility. Human Resources Development in the APS (Question No. 1548)",193
276,Mr MCARTHUR,CAPRICORNIA KENNEDY,"the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 29 April 1992: (I) Did the Public Service Commission's survey of human resource development in the Australian Public Service (APS) for 1990-91 find that males in the range of (a) Administrative Service Officer classes 1 to 4 and equivalent and (b) Senior Officer grades A to C received fewer training hours than did females in the same range; if so, in each case, what action has the Commission instituted to close the gap. (2) How many action plans or repo!1S concerning the matter raised in part (1) have been received from portfolio departments and agencies. (3) Which departments and agencies have submitted the material referred to in part (2) and on what date in each case. (4) Did either situation described in part (1) change substantially across the APS·during the 6 months to 31 December 1991. (5) What are the implications for the Equal Employment Opportunity program' of the discrepancies referred to in part (1). (6) Will each department and agency be required to identify the differences referred to in part (1) future access and equity plans published by the Office of Multicultural Affairs.",194
277,Mr KEATING,CAPRICORNIA KENNEDY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Public Service Commission's 1990-91 HRD Survey, Developing People in the APS,does show a lower training rate (measured in days per person) for males in the ASO 1-4 and equivalent grades, and for the Senior Officer and ,equivalent grades, although this does not necessarily mean fewer training hours. The HRD Survey requires that full training days only be reported. The Commission's role is to provide Service-wide data such as that contained in the HRD Survey. Resolving any discrepancies shown up in the data is the responsibility of individual department and agency management in the light of their own circumstances. (2) See answer to (I) above. (3) See answer to (l)above. (4) It is not possible to answer this question in advance of circulation and completion of the 1991-92 HRD Survey on Developing People in the APS. This information should be available towards the end of 1992. (5) In its draft EEO Strategy for the 1990s, the Commission has given particular emphasis to the need for agencies to ensure that appropriate EEO strategies in relation to training and development are in place. The appropriate strategies are a matter for individual departments and agencies to implement in the light of their own circumstances and development needs. (6) This information will continue to be included in the Public Service Commission's HRD Survey. Racial Discrimination (Question No. 1550) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 29 April 1992: (1) Did Australia report to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) that (a) in or about June 1976 the Bjelke-Petersen Government refused to grant consent or permission to the transfer of the Archer River Pastoral Holding to John Koowarta, (b) on or about 8 December 1976 the Bjelke-Petersen Government stated that the transfer came within the ambit of its September in 1972 policy of not viewing favourably proposals to acquire large areas of additional land for development by Aborigines or Aboriginal groups, (c) on 12 November 1977 the Bjelke-Petersen Government declared the property a national park in the Queensland Government Gazette, (d) on il May 1982 the High Court held that the Bjelke-Petersen Government's refusal was in Contravention of the Racial DisCrimination Act 1975 and (e) after the High Court judgment, Koowarta continued proceedings in the Supreme Court of Queensland against the Queensland Government; if so, in each case, (i) on what date and (ii) in what terms. (2) Further to the answer to question No. 386 (Hansard, 4 December 1990, page 4409), did Australia's Seventh Periodic Report to, CERD covering the period from October 1987 to October 1990, omit references to the Archer River case on the ground that there had been few developments in the case during the period. (3)Further to the answer to question No. 1324 (Hansard, 24 March 1992, page 1438), will Australia's Eighth Periodic Report, due in October 1992, disclose that Koowarta died on 29 August 1991 without gaining possession of the Archer River property or securing compensation for its conversion into a national park. Mr Kerin-The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Australia, in its Fourth Periodic Report, reported to CERD the matter raised.in item (a) and referred to issues concerning item (d). The Fourth Periodic Report, which was presented to CERD on 7 August 1984 during its 28th Session, states at page 13, paragraphs 40-42: ""40. A discussion of the legislative framework within which measures to combat racial discrimination operate in Australia would not be complete without reference being made to a recent court decision. The validity of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 was upheld in a decision of the High Court of Australia handed down in May 1982 in the cases of Koowarta v. Bjelke-Petersen and Ors; and State of Queensland v. Commonwealth of Australia (1982). 41. The former case arose out of a refusal by the Queensland Government to permit the transfer of leasehold land to the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission which was acting at the request of the Winychanam Group of Aboriginals of which Mr Koowarta was a member. The latter action arose when the State of Queensland brought an action against the Commonwealth in the High Court seeking a declaration that the Racial Act was invalid under the Constitution. 42. The High Court, by a majority (4 to 3) upheld the relevant provisions of the Commonwealth Racial Discrimination Act 1975 as within the ""external affairs"" power in s.5 1 (xxix) of the Constitution ..."" Australia has not reported to CERD concerning matters raised in items (b), (c) and (e). (2) Yes. (3) Yes. , Port Kembla and Newcastle Ports: Labour Productivity (Question No. 1556) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 29 April 1992: Did the Minister state in answer to question No. 1325 (Hansard, 31 March 1992, page 1536) that in 1990-91 labour productivity was 56 673 tonnes per man-year at Port Kemblil, NSW and 140000 at Newcastle; if so, to what extent was the disparity between the two figures due to different (a) load capacities, (b) demand patterns and (c) receival technologies.",195
278,Mr BEAZLEY,CAPRICORNIA KENNEDY,"The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: The reply to question No. 1325 did state that labour productivity for loading coal was 56 673 tonnes per man-year at Port Kembla and 140000 at· Newcastle. In the view of the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics, the major reason for this disparity is the large difference in loading capacities of the two ports. During 1990-91 36.6 million tonnes were loaded at Newcastle (maximum capacity 46 million tonnes per annum) compared with 13.01 million tonnes loaded at Port Kembla (maximum capacity 15 million tonnes per annum). Newcastle has two separate coal loading terminals serving three berths under a single management to satisfy this demand. One of these terminals can berth two ships simultaneously allowing a high equipment utilisation rate to be achieved. Like Port Kembla; the other terminal has only one berth, but can sustain a loading rate of 8000 tonnes per hour which is higher than the 6600 tonnes per hour Discrimination possible at Port Kembla. Labour productivity can therefore be expected to be greater at Newcastle because of these factors. ANZAC Day Marches: Live Telecast by ABC (Question No. 1559) Mr Halverson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 29 April 1992: (I) Are the ABC's live telecasts of the ANZAC Day marches in the States and Territories watched by thousands of veterans and their families. (2) Is the Minister able to say whether the telecasts are of particular importance to hospitalised or frail veterans and others who cannot attend the marches and services. (3) Did the ABC interrupt its direct telecast of the 1992 ANZAC Day march in Melbourne to rebroadcast a program; if so, (a) was the rebroadcast program relevant in any way to ANZAC Day and (b) did the interruption result in the service at the Shrine of Remembrance, one of the most important and sacred aspects of ANZAC Day commemorations, not being telecast. (4) If the ANZAC Day march and service in Melbourne were not telecast in their entirety, who was responsible for the decision not to do so. (5) Were direct telecasts of marches and services elsewhere in Australia affected by the decision referred to in part (4); if so, where. (6) Have ABC telecasts of ANZAC Day marches or services exceeded the programmed time in previous years; if so, (a) when, (b) were the telecasts extended until the events had been completed and (c) why was a similar practice not adopted in the case referred to in part (3). (7) In estimating the time required to telecast the entire marches and services does the ABC consider (a) weather conditions, (b) the number of persons taking part, (c) the speed at which ageing veterans may be able to march and (d) other factors which may significantly affect the speed at which the events proceed; if so, what allowances are made for the impact of such factors on the time made available for the telecast. (8) Did the ABC inform the RSL of the decision referred to in part (4); if so, (a) when and (b) what was the RSL's response. (9) Has the ABC received a negative reaction from (a) veterans and (b) the wider community as a result of the interrupted telecast. (10) Will the Minister intercede to ensure that in future the ABC provides direct telecasts of the ANZAC Day marches and services in their entirety, irrespective of other programming commitments.",196
279,Mr BEAZLEY,CAPRICORNIA KENNEDY,"The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question, based on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation: (1) Yes. The ABC is now the only television network which provides live coverage of ANZAC Day activities. (2) The Minister believes that the telecasts would be appreciated by veterans and others who cannot attend the marches and services in person. (3) Yes. The ABC concluded the telecast of the Melbourne ANZAC Day March and service at the advertised time of 12 noon. ABC television was providing live coverage of ANZAC Day activities in all State capitals before returning to the national network In the past, three hours has been sufficient time to cover the ANZAC Day activities, unfortunately, while the March had finished in other cities, Melbourne took longer than expected because of unanticipated delays experienced along the route, especially in St Kilda Road. : The program broadcast after the scheduled conclusion of the March coverage was the advertised ""Open Learning"" program, broadcast on weekday mornings and repeated on Saturday mornings. (a) No. (b) Yes. (4) It was a management decision to stop the televising of the ANZAC Mllfch at 12 noon. (5) No. (6) No. (7) In the past, three hours has been sufficient time to provide a comprehensive coverage of the ANZAC Day activities. Unfortunately, this was not the case in Melbourne this year. Because of this, future coverage may have to be more open ended to accommodate unexpected delays and local State needs prior to States re-joining the national network for advertised programs. (8) No. (9) Yes. The ABC has received many complaints (especially by phone) about the interruption to the ANZAC Day telecast in Melbourne. A letter from Bruce Ruxton, State President of the Victorian Branch of the RSL, was published in the Australian on 29 April 1992. In a letter to the Editor (30 April 1992) in response to Mr Ruxton,the Director of Television, apologised to viewers for any distress caused by the decision, stating that no slight was ever intended towards ANZAC veterans in Victoria.

States and Territories: Commonwealth Funding (Question No. 1562) Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Finance, upon notice, on 29 April 1992: (1) What sum was paid from Commonwealth sources to each State and Territory in each .year from 198Q to 1990 for all purposes (a) in contemporary and (b) 1991 dollars. (2) What percentage of total Commonwealth revenue was allocated to the States and Territories in each year from 1980 to 1990.",197
280,Mr WILLIS,CAPRICORNIA KENNEDY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as fo]]ows: Payments to the States and the Northern Territory are shown in detail in tables which I will submit for inclusion in Hansard. Table A shows that total gross payments to the States and the Northern Territory have progressively increased in contemporary dollar terms. However, Table B indicates that, in 1990/91 dollar terms, using the non-farm GOP deflator to convert current into constant dollars, the figures have fluctuated to some extent. Real total gross payments to the States rose from $27,487m in 1980/81 to a peak of $30,909m in 1984/85. Howt\ver, by 1989/90, they had fallen back to $26,82Om. Then, in 1990/91, they again rose, this time to $27,781m, that is, $294m higher than they had been at the beginning of the 1980's. These general patterns have been repeated throughout the mainland States, but there are some variations in Tasmania and the Northern Territory around the end of the decade.

The figures exclude repayments to the Commonwealth and direct payments to local government. Payments to the ACT, which were part of the Commonwealth Account but not separately identified until 1988/89, were $700m, $608m and $67Om Table A also shows that, as a percentage of Commonwealth revenue, payments to the States and the Northern Territory fluctuated between 35.0% and 38.8% over the period 1980/81 to 1983/84. Thereafter, the percentage fell continuously until 1989/90, by which time it had reached 26.8%. However, by the end of 1990/91, the percentage had risen back up to 28.4%. It should be noted that the Australian Capital Territory is excluded from the two tables. Prior to 1988/89, payments to the Australian Capital Territory were included in the Commonwealth public accounts, and were not separately identifiable. Since then, funding for the Australian Capital Territory has been separately identifiable as the Commonwealth's relationship with the Territory moves to a State-like basis. Consequently, details of Commonwealth payments to the Australian Capital Territory are available only for the years 1988/89 through 1990/91. These are shown in the notes to Table A.

Political Advertising (Question No. 1575) Mr Scholes asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 6 May 1992: (1) Are pre-prepared video and audio tapes which are recorded on behalf of political parties exempt from the provisions of legislation covering political advertising. (2) Are agreements between political parties and the media which enable the use of pre-prepared material outside the ambit of the political broadcasting legislation.

Housing: Waiting Lists (Question No; 1577) Mr Langmore asked the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, upon notice, on 6 May 1992: (1) How many applicants are on State and Territory Housing Commission waiting lists and what is the total number of people waiting· for public housing. (2) What is the average waiting time for public housing in each State and Territory.",199
282,Mr HOWE,STATES AND THE NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as fol1ows: (1) The number of applicants on each State and Territory housing waiting list, not including tenants requesting transfer, at 31 December 1991was: NSW-65,367 VIC-42,319 QLD-22,698 WA-19,032 SA-44,019 TAS-4,652 ACT-5,013 NT-6,909 The total number on waiting lists for public housing was 210,009. (2) The waiting time for public housing varies with the type and location of dwellings and whether a tenant is eligible for a priority allocation. Therefore, no single average waiting time is available for any State or Territory. The following table shows information provided by each State and Territory on the estimated time that a tenant who has been recently allocated public housing would have waited for a 3 bedroom detached dwelling (or, in the case of South Australia, an equivalent attached dwelling) located in a capital city suburb at a distance approximately mid-way between the centml business district and the metropolitan fringe.

Brisbane Airport (Question No. 1595) Mr Jldl asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 26 May 1992: (1) Has the Government accepted the recommendations of the Task Force to Review the Operation and Planning of Brisbane Airport which reported in June 1991. (2) What action has the Government or its agencies taken to implement the nine recommendations of the report.",200
283,Mr BEAZLEY,AGENDA,"The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) The following action has been taken to implement the nine recommendations of the report: ReCommendations 1 and 4 - The Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) has reviewed the Brisbane Airport Master Plan taking into consideration the work of the Task Force. A future review of runway development options will specifically address the benefits and disbenefits of upgrading the 14/32 runway.  restrictions on using the 14/32 cross runway by B737 aircraft on a weight limited basis. Recommendation 3 - Standard Instrument Departures (SID's) associated with the use of the 14/32 runway designed in accordance with the Task Force guidelines, have been introduced by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Recommendation 5 - Operations over Moreton Bay continue to follow the pattern established during the Task Force with night time operations on occasions reaching 99% over the Bay. The procedure of jet aircraft taking off over the Bay and reaching an altitude of 5000ft before flying over residential areas is now in practice and has been incorporated into the CAA's Noise Abatement Procedures. Recommendation 6 - Local instructions were issued and formal documentation has been finalised by the CAA with regard to jet aircraft arriving from the north to be directed by Air Traffic Control (ATC) to join final approach for runway 01 at or south of the Brisbane River. Recommendation 7 - The Brisbane Airport Consultative Committee (BACC) is in the process of establishing an. environmental sub-committee. Recommendation 8 - Four noise monitoring terminals have been established in Brisbane suburbs with review of the scope of monitoring to be undertaken by the sub-committee of the BACC. Recommendation 9 - Land use controls on land surrounding the airport are being reviewed by the Queensland Government. The Queensland Department of Housing and Local Government has been developing a mechanism for addressing airport related issues, including noise. Planning guidelines are to be issued to local governments in Queensland in the near future. Pensioners Living in Yugoslavia (Question No. 1617) Mr Thckey asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 1 June 1992: (1) How many (a) aged, (b) invalid, (c) wives, (d) widows class B and (e) sole parent pensions are paid to Australian residents living in the former Yugoslav republics. (2) What total sum was paid to the pensioners referred to in part (I) since (a) 1 July 1991 and . (b) 1 January 1992. (3) How are the pension payments made. (4) What criteria must persons living overseas meet to receive the pensions. (5) Are the persons referred to in part (4) counselled on their reasons for leaving Australia and travelling to areas such as the former Yugoslav republics. (6) Has the Government investigated claims that many of the persons referred to in part (1) are fighting as freelance soldiers in a regional war while receiving Australian pensions.",202
284,Dr BLEWETT,AGENDA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: It is assumed the honourable member is requesting information about former Australian residents: (1) As at 22 May 1992, 2,833 Australian pensions were being paid to residents of Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro and Macedonia. Of these: (a) 1,053 were age pensions; (b) 1,304 were disability support (or invalid) pensions; (c) 303 were wife pensions; (d) 157 were widow B pensions; and (e) 16 were sole parent pensions. (2) (a). For the period 1 July 19.91 to 31 December 1991, a total of $10,254,755 was spent on pension payments to the region; and (b) from 1 January 1992 to 4 June 1992, total expenditure on pension payments to the region is estimated· as $9,465,928. (3) Pension payments have been made by four weekly cheques, drawn in the $US equivalent of the $A entitlement. (4) Usually, people living overseas must have been in receipt of an Australian pension before leaving Australia in order to transfer that pension overseas. Not all Australian pensions can be transferred overseas. For example, carer pension is not portable at all. Certain categories of disability support, sole parent and widow pensions are not payable for long term absences from Australia. Pensions paid overseas are subject to income and assets tests and people must meet the same eligibility criteria (age/impairment level etc) as other pensioners. Rates of pension overseas may be lower than rates paid in Australia as the rates may be determined with reference to the periods the pensioners were Australian residents during their working lives. (5) Pensioners transferring overseas must obtain a departure certificate from the Department of Social Security. Obtaining the certificate usually involves an interview with DSS. People are advised of their rights, obligations and payment arrangements while overseas. They are not counselled for or against going to any particular country. (6) The status and continuing eligibility of Australian pensioners in the former Yugoslav republics have been reviewed on an ongoing basis. DSS has maintained two locally engaged staff in the Australian Embassy in Belgrade with the specific role of monitoring pension payments to the region. Reviews to date have not identified any Australian pensioners involved in military activities. /",203
