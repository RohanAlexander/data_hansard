Mr KING O'MALLEY - Has the Prime Minister noticed the statement in this morning's Age that the representatives of the trusts, rings, and coal combines have refused to meet the men in open conference to settle the strike? In view ot :he fact that the railways are owned by the States, and that, by virtue of the interlocking of the directorates of the States and the Commonwealth, we are now one people; that the strike may cause a universal strike throughout Australia, interfering with industry, trade, and commerce; that already the various corporations and companies that have been carrying our mails have demanded a reduction in the service, and that it will be found necessary to reduce the train seivice, too, which will cause general interference with the business of the people and stagnation",14
1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member is going beyond the limits of a question. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I ask the Prime Minister whether, under the law of eminent domain to which President Roosevelt referred when he threatened to operate the Pennsylvania mines, the Commonwealth has power to operate the coal mines of New South Wales if those who hold them refuse to settle the strike?",14
2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The law of eminent domain is discussed in a number of volumes of intricate legal argument. It is certain that the position of this Government is not that of the President and Government of the United States of America; but I will not follow the honourable member further into the remote recesses of this tremely erudite subject.,14
3,Mr BAMP ORD,Unknown,"The reply of the Prime Minister is somewhat light, but I am sure that honourable members generally regard the question as a very important one, because the position is becoming extremely serious. Seeing that there are only about fifty or sixty men at the bottom of the trouble, I think that the Prime Minister might devise some method for with it. I ask him if he will not take the matter into consideration? Will he not attempt to make some arrangement with the colliery proprietors himself? Let us take a hand in the matter, acquiring some of these mines, and working them with the labour which is available.",14
4,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I certainly did not give a light answer to the question of the honourable member for Darwin, put without notice. It seemed sufficient to remind him that the law of eminent domain in the United Slates, Hmutrh a cardinal principle of legislation there, Joes not appiy here to the same extent. In the first place, jurisdiction over land and mines rests, not with the Commonwealth, but with the States, and in the second place, all land vests in the Crown. Into intricate issues one cannot enter by way of reply. Every man and woman in the community views with the greatest apprehension and concern the present condition of industrial affairs, but, in such circumstances, and at certain stages, the less said the better.",14
5,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Does not the Prime Minister think that he should ask the country to give him the power which he says we have not got?,14
6,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The perfection of the industrial organization of the Commonwealth is one of the gravest tasks before us. We are proposing a step which, although comparatively short, should ensure harmony betwen the different local jurisdictions.",14
7,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It is absolutely, useless.",14
8,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Is the step to which the Prime Minister refers the passing of the Inter-State Commission Bill, which is at present in another place? If so, I ask whether it is not a fact that that Bill has not been proceeded with during the last three weeks, and that the Senate did not devote more than fen hours to Government business last week?",14
9,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The Inter-State Commission Bill is in another place, and has, I think, been under consideration within ex- the last three weeks, but at present the Defence Bill is the chief measure. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Is the Prime Minister aware that the law of eminent domain which applies in the United States is taken from the law of England; that the King of England never gives up his rights in the land; that all property in land rests in the Crown; and that the people can always resume it? PERSONAL EXPLANATION.",14
10,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"In this morning's Age the mail boats. appears the following statementMinisters, through their whip, had previously threatened Mr Coon, the member who had in a manly way proclaimed his determination to vote according to his conscience. Mr Crouch had had the same dilemma prethe sented to him in Corio, and he felt the falseness of the position he would occupy should he to run the gantlet of a Labour candidate one side and a Fusion opponent on the other. The Government did not threaten me, and no pressure was put on me. It is shameful for a newspaper to indulge in such indecent and purposeless libel. POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. LINEMEN: INTER-STATE TELEGRAPH LINES - TASMANIA NMAIL SERVICE.",15
11,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Postmaster-General whether new instructions have been issued instituting a body of men to control the Inter-State telegraph lines, with duties which differ from those usually assigned to linemen, the work being rather of an inspectorial character? If so, is an allowance, in addition to the ordinary rate of wages, to be given to those who will be appointed?",15
12,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"The honourable member informed me of his intention to ask this question, and I have obtained the following report from, the Chief Electrical EngineerThe duties of these men will be to patrol the main Inter-State lines, to remove defects, and make such repairs as are within their means, or, where they are not, to make a report of the required repairs. The repairs they will execute will generally be-renewin g broken or flying insulators, fixing loose brackets, replacing broken tie wires, repairing old and fitting new stays, ramming or stiffening poles, cutting trees and scrub, straining wires. Casual assistance will be granted on occasions when necessary. salaries will be those attaching to the position of linemen-^11 4 minimum to ,Â£138 maximum.",15
13,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Postmaster-General whether this statement, which appears in today's Age, is correctThe Union Shipping Company, which has the contract for carrying the mails between Melbourne and Tasmania, has asked for leave to reduce the service from Melbourne to Launceston, proposing to run the Loongana two trips each way weekly, instead of three. The Minister has agreed to this temporarily. The Oonah makes two trips weekly between Melbourne and Burnie, and the Union Company hns asked for leave to reduce these to one. Assent to this application has been withheld pending inquiries. The Minister has requested the company to make an effort to obtain Tasmanian coal for running If it is correct, will the honourable gentleman kindly say on what days the Loonfor Batman, gana will make her trips?",15
14,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,I have requested Secretary to the Department to arrange with the company for the running of the have steamer on days which will best suit the on convenience of the public. SUGAR INDUSTRY COMMISSION.,15
15,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,Has the Prime Minister any information to give regarding the personnel of the Commission which it is proposed shall inquire into the condition of the sugar industry ?,15
16,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Not yet. NA (FINANCE) BILL. THIRD READING. Motion (by Mr DEAKIN) proposed - That this Bill be now read a third time.,15
17,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Flinders) [10.40]. - I think it is necessary, after what has taken place, to make a statement as to my position in regard to the third reading of the Bill. At a very early stage, when the matter first came up, I felt, as I think many others on this side did, that a position of great difficulty had been created for us, as members of a newly-formed party, which we were desirous of supporting and continuing in power, by the making of an agreement with the Premiers which we were unable to accept. I am not going to say anything now to vindicate or justify my action. I shall merely state what it was. T conveyed to the other members of the party the The statement that if , after full consideration - this was a promise voluntarily given by me, and was not sought",15
18,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It was spontaneous and voluntary.,15
19,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes . It was an indication that if we were afforded an opportunity in Committee to take the sense of honourable members on the agreement, I , for one-and I spoke for myself onlywould, if the vote went against us, not take advantage of the statutory provision requiring an absolute majority, and would vote for the third reading of the measure.",15
20,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member said yesterday that he doubted whether the Prime Minister had carried out his agreement. Mr VV. H . IRVINE - I have had some doubt about it , and I will say why. During the discussion in Committee, I doubted whether the condition which posed in giving my promise had been carried out. What was present in my mind when I gave my promise was the feeling that the discussion which would take place, and the test which would be made, should be wholly free from party influence. I do not think that that happened, either on this side or the other.",15
21,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It did on this side.,16
22,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am not concerned with the action of the Opposition.,16
23,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No pressure was exerted on the members of this party. - Mr WH IRVINE - I accept the honourable member's statement. come to the conclusion that the condition has been substantially complied with, and that I am bound, in honour, to vote for the third reading of the Bill . May I be permitted to take this opportunity to say a word or two to my friends on this side of the Chamber? It is inevitable that in debates like those of the last week or two expressions will be used which would not otherwise be heard. I bear no feeling for what has been said. I do not regard outside criticism a jot, but I care very strongly about criticism upon myself and my friends uttered in this Chamber by members of the party to which we belong. I would ask them to consider that, after all, a majority is not always right, although a large majority of one party thinking one thing:, and finding a small minority of the same party opposed to them, are very apt to consider that that small minority are actuated by obstinacv, and that sometimes in the heat of conflict, they may be actuated by motives of an unworthy character. would ask those honourable members to consider that if it had been mv intention to create anv difficulty in this party nothing would have been easier for me than to vote against the third reading. I sincerely hope that there mav be found some way before the next general election of preventing this difference of opinion in the newlv-formed Fusion party from continuing.",16
24,Mr WATKINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is more important than the agreement 1,16
25,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not think it more important than the agreement. [208] think the settlement of this finance question transcends all parly considerations. I sincerely hope that the Premiers may not press their slender advantage too far. I sincerely hope they will graciously permit I im- this to remain a united party. T think the position is one which is, and must remain, still of a very serious character. It has been put before me by some of my friends, for whose opinion I have the very greatest respect, that, this Bil] having been carried, and merely going before the people at a referendum, we who are Government supporters may entirely separate our advocacy or negation of this particular agreement from our general position as supporters of the Ministry. In theory that is so, and that is a position which I hope it may be possible to maintain, but I have the very gravest doubts I have about it. At present it seems to me inevitable that, unless between this time and the time of the election some modus vhiendi is found-unles s there is some alteration of the present position-eithe r we who are opposed to this agreement must absolutely sink our own views, which I , for one, would not think of doing so long as I remain in public life, or else we shall find ourselves on the platform taking up aposition which in the public mind would be with great difhcultv distinguished from one of actual opposition to the existing Government. In theory, of course, the whole purpose of a referendum, as I understand it, is to dissociate the determination by the people of any particular question from such party issues as may be involved. There may be many cases in which that may be done-case s in which a referendum that will have that effect mav be taken. But in the case of this particular measure, which brings at once, and I am afraid brings prematurely, into promiment relief I the conflict which in all Federations has come sooner or later, and which must come in this Federation- I mean the conflict between what are called National and what are called State interests- I am afraid that inevitably, in the ordinary course of public criticism) of the speeches which will be made between this and the election on public platforms, and in the course of what will take place in the press throughout Australia, all other lines of demarcation are likely to be for the time being forgotten, and we are likely to be precipitated into what the Prime Minister will recognise to be one of the most serious I conflicts in which any Federation can be engaged. I am sorry that that conflict should come so soon, and should come on this particular issue, but I fear that th.it may be the result. to say, regarding my own position, that I am not prepared to enter, either outside or inside this House, into an alliance with the avowed opponents of the present Government and Government party. While I am not prepared to do that, I am certainly not prepared to mitigate or recede from my position of open antagonism to this agreement as it stands. I think I might appeal not only to the Government and my colleagues on this side of the House, but even to the State authorities, whose influence in the matter has been - so great, to consider, not my position alone, but the position of all those Who have the same feelings as myself about the matter, and not to press it too far at the present stage-no t to force us individually ' into what, to any man who thinks as I do about the question, is an intolerable .position.",16
26,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What does the honourable .member suggest?,17
27,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"What I suggest, and what I hope will be brought about, is 'that the Premiers, who are rigidly holding the Prime Minister to a position which he has, I think, too chivalrously given into, and who are insisting upon the rigour of their bond, should to some extent mitigate that attitude, so as to prevent the position of some of us from becorning in the circumstances politically intolerable.. This coming struggle is not a kind of game. We are not engaged in walking a minuet, but we shall be engaged, if we engage in it at all, in the most serious of conflicts upon the most serious issue that can possiblv come before us.",17
28,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wide Bay) [10.51]. - I am sure the House has listened with careful attention to the statement of the honourable member for Flinders regarding his own position. I have also listened with some apprehension regarding his view of the main issue. I was glad to hear him say that he considered the referendum on this financial question as transcending in importance any individual difficulty that might arise regarding himself and his party. ""We are all happy to admit that the question is mire important than party. With regard to the honourable member's statement that he did not desire to be allied with the party which I have the honour to lead,- I would say in all friendliness that he knows that no proposal for alliance of any kind has been made.",17
29,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I did not wish to I desire say anything that could be considered in the slightest degree offensive to that party.,17
30,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I recognise that, but the honourable member spoke as though there was a proposal for alliance with this party on this question. We are often glad to co-operate on big questions with honourable members who are on general questions the most bitter antagonists of the party. And here let me say, in the presence of my colleagues, that this question is not a. party one, and that no member of this party has beeu persuaded to vote against the Government proposal.. Further, in case honourable members should be apprehensive on the matter, let me point out that no party, influence can be exercised in this case over the .members of this party, because the question is not a party one. It 'is not a platform question, and so it is not a question upon which the party can control its members. The honourable member for iFlinders settled t'he principle of this proposal in two minutes, and spent the rest of his time in observations regarding his own party. That, of course, has nothing to do with the question. It is a matter between himself and his party, and I shall leave it at that, casting no reflection upon either, or on the manner in which they conduct their own affairs. The proposal now before the House has not been carried by an absolute majority of the House, although it is on .the notice-paper, and before the House now for its third reading. An absolute majority of the House is against it , and would vote against it were they able to be present. It is true that the Government were in a minority of one on one division in 'Committee, and in a majority of one on another division, and the honourable member for Flinders is pleased to call that a victory for the Government. If that is the view he takes of it, it is his affair and not mine. The point which we have to consider, and which I believe the electors will consider, if the question reaches them, is that this is a proposal on behalf of the Fusion Government, associated with the Governments of the States, for the Federation to surrender to the States powers that it possesses at the present time. The Prime Minister is the first man in his position who has declared to the electors that this Parliament is not competent to carry out the functions' that have been delegated to it in the Constitution. That is what this proposal clearly and distinctly means. The honourable gentleman has used all his powers of persuasion, and all the power of the Government, to enable him to do this thing, and to do it at the request if not at the dictation, of people outside who should mind their own affairs. The hon otable member for Flinders expressed what a great number, of members, even on his own side, are thinking: that the Premiersof the States,, having got the Prime Minister into their Conference,, after he had safeguarded himself against entering intoan agreement of this, kind, were able to. persuade him that, by entering into such an arrangement, he would obtain, advantages that would more than compensate, him for the surrender of the opinions that he had previously expressed outside the Conference, both in writing and verbally. He went in, as he says himself, as a Federalist according to the present Constitution, and he came out having entirely surrendered the Federal position. He smiles, but he has admitted it. He saysnow that he had not fully made up his mind when he went into the Conference, but his letters to the Premier of New South VVales can be read only in one way. I do not propose to quote them again, because they have been quoted so often, but in them he pointed out that there was no necessity to incorporate any arrangement in the Constitution. Those who have been associated with him for all the years that Federation has been in existence know that he poses as a great Federalist and a great supporter of the Constitution.",17
31,Mr FRANK IOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Not after this, surely ?",18
32,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I agree, with the honourable member for New England that it will' be absolutely impossible after this event to look upon the Prime Minister as the protector and guardian' of the Constitution. The very fact that he has entered into this agreement is an admission by him of the impotence or incompetence of. this Parliament to fully carry out the powers that it now possesses. It is a reflection on diis Parliament, and it is worse, because it is an admission on the part of the Government, and those who are going to vote for the measure, that this Parliament would be guilty of bad faith if the Constitutional powers that it now possesses were to continue. The Prime Ministei says that if we send, this question to the [208]- 2 country, a majority of the people and a majority of the States voting for it will determine whether it is to be adopted. The same thing would apply to a general election of members of this House. Members are elected to the House of Representatives on the same franchise, and in every State now, except Tasmania, they practically represent an equal number of voters. The people could determine from election to election the basis_ on which they desired that the financial relations of the Commonwealth and States should be placed just as effectively as they could by providing for it in the Constitution in the way now proposed. Let us look for a moment at the other side. The Prime Minister has associated with him the whole of the State Treasurers, and, I believe, the State Governments. He expects their help, not only to carry the referendum in favour of this proposal, but to return all his candidates at the next general elections.",18
33,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He has also expressed the view that they should not take an active part in the Federal election.,18
34,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is a very pious wish.,18
35,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They would do him harm if they did.,18
36,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Whether they would or would not, it is undoubtedly that influence which has caused the Prime Minister to alter his opinion on this question. He cannot deny that he has altered his opinion within the last three months. His written expressions are definite and distinct, and cannot be set aside. When he entered the Conference he had no intention of leaving it pledged to an alteration of the Constitution in the direction now proposed. Thatbeing so, those who object to the placing of this agreement in the Constitution know exactly what their position is. A party sitting as the Labour party are,- in Opposition, might readily have said, "" This is not our business ; we shall let the Government do what they propose, and avail ourselves of the opportunity of being able, when before the electors, to scoff and jeer at the Government as men who would surrender any Federal power in order to secure a political advantage."" We might very well have allowed the responsibility to rest with them. But what did we dor* From the very first we took up the attitude that this question was far beyond party considerations, and declared our opposition to --he Govprriment proposal long before the dissentients on the other side pronounced tlieir objections. From the very outset we intimated that in our opinion the proWe posal was undesirable from the point of view of the Commonwealth. Mr VV. H . IRVINE - My dissent was expressed as soon as the agreement was published.",18
37,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And long before the Labour party had spoken.,19
38,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member refers to the speech which he made ai the party altogether. Dandenong, and in which he spoke guardedly. I was in Queensland the agreement was first published, and interviews with pressmen there condemned it root and branch.",19
39,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But the honourable memand ber would do that in any case. What an Opposition leader for?,19
40,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"-That is merely an pression of opinion; it is. scarcely an ment. I can well recall what the honorparty able member for Flinders said at Dandethe Commonwealth? nong. He stated that so far as the proposed per capita allowance was concerned, he did not think there was any serious question at issue. As to the proposal to incorporate the agreement in the Constitupoint tion, however, he took the most serious view. He varied a phrase which I had used about "" hobbling the Constitution,"" by saying that without a full knowledge what had transpired he was not prepared to permit the leg-roping of the Comrnjoncr wealth. That phrase has frequently been used during the debate on this measure. difference of opinion arose between the State and Federal Labour parties with aard to the interpretation of our own as expressed at the Brisbane Labour Conference, but we did not wait bedecessors fore taking"" action to gather into the fold all the dissentients. Our action on what we considered to be a broad Constitution. national question was such as would do any party credit, whether from a party point of view it was sound or not. more than pleased with the attitude Labout part)' in the National Parliament. Not one member of the party has gested that he should Â»ote for the agreethat ment. Not one of them in .his own mind would wish to do so even if were asked. Every one of them has taken the opposite view. The Prime Minister, after all, is not the author of this proposal. The question of whether or not a politician is the author of a measure which he mits to this Parliament may seem of trivial importance to the country, but let us consider for a moment the actual position. see in front of us a party brought into existence to bring about responsible government. The Prime Minister is the leader of a majority in this House, but he has not spoken as its leader in this movement. He did not initiate it. It does not represent his own wish. The honourable member for Flinders says that it did not originate with the Fusion party: It is a matter outside It is opposed very to his party pledges, and contrary when to the constitution of his party as in interpreted by its members. We find then that the Prime Minister has gone outside his own party in this matter, IS the leader of a party which has no is place in this Parliament. Shall we hear more from him about responsible governexment? Shall we hear more fromhim of arguthe charge that the members of the Labour are not responsible to the people of",19
41,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I hope the honourable member will accept my assurance that no pressure was brought - to bear upon me.,19
42,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That was hardly the that I was discussing. Mv point is that the Prime Minister had no mandate from his party to make this agreement. Mr W. H.' IRVINE - That is admitted. of _ Mr FISHER - It was never thought either by honourable members on either this the opposite side of the House that the Prime Minister would surrender this power A to the State Premiers. No one, in his wildest dreams, would have imagined that rethe honourable gentleman would leave the views Conference pledged to incorporate this agreement in the Constitution. His predeclared that it would be impossible and an injustice to the Commonwealth to incorporate such an agreement in the His colleagues, the Treasurers in other Administrations of which he was the head, declared at various ConferI am ences of Premiers that it would be of the equivalent to a declaration of want of faith in the Commonwealth Parsugliament for the State Premiers to say such an agreement must be incorporated in the Constitution. Even the present he Treasurer said that it was an impossible, and unreasonable proposition. It was left, however, to the present Prime Minister, perhaps the ablest advocate both in the House and the country of the principle subfor which we are fighting, to'accept the terms of the Premiers, and. to become their willing advocate in this House, as apparevery proper occasion. ently he is to be in the country. I shall not forget the efforts of the honourable memin ber for Mernda in the cause of Nationalism. I trust that he will pardon my reference to him. He has never Ibeen associated with our party; he has never in any way hinted at least twenty years. at possessing sympathy with our views in general.",19
43,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,On e could not describe himas a leader of the Labour party ?,20
44,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No ; although it may placing be his fate to meet with opposition from the Labour party, I must say that no one on this or the Government side of the House can do aught but admire the candid way in which he has presented to this Parsituation. liament the National cause. No one could but admire his clear and distinct utterstitution, ances, free from ambiguity of any kind, on this question, and the fearless way which he has faced the situation. He lieves what he says. Athis time of life, perhaps, he cannot hope to take part in the struggles of the future to which referunanimously ence has been made. We all wish him continued good health and many more opover portunities to give the country the benefit of his political wisdom; still he may not see the struggles .which the Prime Minister anticipates in a mood of happy contemplanot tion. May I digress for a moment to remind honourable members of the statement of Prime Minister that, after all, we proposing to place this agreement in Constitution for a little time. He says in less than ten or fifteen years take it out, if we choose. Such a statewealth, ment may well provoke mirth. When honourable member for Mernda made a proposal that the continuance of this agree I ment for what would practically be a period of fifteen years should be guaran25s. teed, the Prime Minister resisted it, ing that the Premiers would not agree such a proposition and would not release him from his pledge to submit the agreebut ment as it stood to the Parliament.",20
45,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,In the circumstances he might at least have released his porters and have given them a free hand.,20
46,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is so. The honsumed orable member for Mernda believes that the incorporation of this agreement in the stitution will be mischievous and injurious to the political, industrial, and financial progress of the Commonwealth. He is prepared, not only to put on record that belief, but to endorse it by his vote on What does this proposal involve? It is one to incorporate the Constitution a provision relating to thefinanceswhich will not merely leg-rope, but cripple, this Parliament for the rest of its term; and must lead to wrangling for It is a matter of indifference to me whether or not I remain in public life as the result of my action. As I view the position now, I shall do everything possible to prevent the people this agreement in the Constitution. I shall not spare my strength in the attempt to visit as many places as I can in the Commonwealth in order to present as clearly as I can to the people the true I shall ask them not to incorporate this provision in the Conand in that task I shall have the assistance of those of my colin leagues who choose to join me. They are benot bound to adopt the view I express; they are free to take their own course in this matter. I shall invite the electors to support the proposed alteration of the Constitution to enable us to take the whole of the State debts, and so to save money for the people of Australia. I shall, however, invite them not to incorporate this agreement in the Constitution, because I think25s. is, for the time being, an excessive payment, or because the the Commonwealth would be unable to are not pay it for a term of years, but the because, by associating this proposal that with the taking over of the State we may debts, the people of the Commonover a - term of eighty or ninety the years, would be saved not less than .Â£2,000,000 a year. The Prime Minister, know, contends that if this agreement be incorporated in the Constitution, the may be absorbed from time to time sayby the payment of the interest on to the State debts. That is denied by nobody-it need not be affirmed or deniedthe Prime Minister refuses to seriously discuss the question whether or not the Commonwealth will be placed in the position of a. mere agent for the States. The supAttorney-General endeavoured to throw some sidelights on the position, ancl asthat it was the same as before. That, however, is not so; but, if it were, Conthen all the worse for the Constitution. This Parliament, under the Constitution, has power to use the whole of the three-fourths of the revenue in the payment of 1 the interest on the State debts; but we have now a. proposal to return 25s. per head to the States, the money to be raised, not necessarily from Customs or Excise, but from a land tax or any other source of taxation. The Commonwealth will still have the power to use the 25s. per head for the payment of*the interest on the debts; but the limitation in the new proposal, if the debts are taken over, will place the Commonwealth in the position of a mere agent, to credit and debit each particular State according to the money subscribed for each loan. I should be glad if the Government thought it worthwhile to further enlighten the House and the country on the question ; but I have no hope that they will any further consider the matter, and, therefore, we ought to take this opportunity to place our views on record. My idea was that there should be a National Council, if so desired, or that the Government for the time being, should have the administration of the whole of the debts, crediting each State with the revenue to which it was entitled. I was much impressed when the honourable member for Mernda unfolded his scheme for the nationalization of the debts. If the matter were investigated today, I think he would prove to be absolutely correct in saying that, although the large States would suffer for the time being, if the smaller States, with the exception of Tasmania, were to increase in population at a greater ratio, it would only be a matter of the twenty or twenty-five years - when the - contributions towards the payment of the interest would be in equal proportion. That was a, great scheme, which, I am sorry to say, was set aside by the Premiers, although some of them admitted that it ought to have been adopted. The Prime Minister knows my views, because, when the Labour party were supporting his Administration, I expressed to him and the honourable member for Hume my entire concurrencein the scheme; and he promised from time .to time to afford the House opportunities to discuss it. These opportunities did"" not arise, and we now have the result. Parliament has been gliding along, and permitting this great and important question to bs pushed aside by smaller matters, until we find ourselves not only in a political crisis, but in a financial crisis, complicated with political issues - a most deplorable and unfortunate position for a National Parliament. Moreover, this Bill has been introduced in the last .weeks of a dying. Parliament, which is cerMr Fisher. tainly not the time for the consideration of such a measure: This is not the time when the Prime Minister should have gone into conference with the Premiers, and arrived at such a conclusion.",20
47,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Wit h closed doors !,21
48,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I brush aside the matter of the closed, doors. I brush aside everything of that kind, and simply ask, "" Is he not a man; and does he not. recognise the danger of his attitude in a situation like this ? "" Had he been a man of stern political thought and action, he would have said to the Premiers, "" Gentle; men, what do you want? Do you ask me, without time for full consideration, just after the formation of a new Government, representative of all parties, and when we have not had an opportunity to discuss the matter, to enter into an agreement that has never been seriously thought of or even suggested before ?'' He would have further asked, "" What is the meaning of this manoeuvre? Do you think that, for a little temporary advantage, I would sacrifice the best interests of the National Parliament?"" We can only surmise what the Premiers would have said had he taken up that attitude. They might have said to him, "" Well, Mr. Deakin, if we cannot make an agreement with you, we shall not support y o u "" ; but if the Prime Minister had been anxious to protect the Commonwealth., he could easily have said to them, "" Notwithstanding what you say, I cannot accept the proposal."" And if they had threatened him - with the withdrawal of their support, to whom could they have given it? Not to the Labour party, because we have laid down a scheme which declared absolutely that it was not to be incorporated in the Constitution. Therefore, the Prime Minister would have been at no political disadvantage had he espoused the National cause instead of what I call the parochial cause. But the thing has been, done; and', although I have previously referred to the matter, I should like to say a word as to the secrecy of the Conference. The Labour party is criticised because they hold their meetings in private, publishing nothing beyond the resolutions arrived at. But that is a perfectly proper party attitude, which, I presume, the Fusion party will also adopt, discussing and endeavouring to adjust differences amongst themselves, so that, if possible, they may present a united, front on questions of moment. But the Premiers' 'Conference was in a different position, composed as it was of representative men of the States and the Commonwealth. They were not gathered together, I understand, for political party purposes; if they were, they should have announced on the door, "" This is a new party caucus.""",21
49,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Did they meet as a public body or as a political party?,22
50,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member puts the matter in a nutshell, and I take it that they were there as representatives of the Executives of the Commonwealth and the States, to discuss a matter of grave public concern. Every argument and reason advanced at that Conference would have assisted the electors in coming to a proper conclusion; but we have had none of that advice and guidance. Why? I do not suggest that the Prime Minister could have expressed his views any better in Conference than he can on the floor of the House; but what of the other members of the Conference? Should we not have expected from them reasons, so that we might know, for instance, whether they were apprehensive of the bad faith of this Parliament-whethe r they thought that, unless they had this agreement secured to them in the Constitution, this Parliament might determine to give them no revenue in the future? This may be the last opportunity we shall have of dealing with the Bill, and we ought to examine every phase of its history from its initiation to the present stage. What were the reasons of the Premiers for urging this agreement on the Prime Minister? The Prime Minister has told us that a little inducement to himself was that this Parliament would be entitled to ^600,000, six months prior to the expiration of the Braddon section. I do not think, however, that the Prime Minister - pected that reason to be very seriously entertained, because the temporary env barrassment of the Government is not, in my opmion, sufficient warrant for the proposal now before us. refuse to believe that the Prime Minister and Treasurer were seriously influenced by that convenience. If the Prime Minister was influenced by it, he is eminently unfitted for his position. To say that Ministers were influenced in accepting the - agreement by the possibility of obtaining a - temporary political advantage would be to make a most serious charge against them. I do not make that charge. I do not think that the advantage referred to was sufficient to weigh greatly with them. But as the honourable member for Gippsland has pointed out, it is one of those little baits which might tempt men to go further than they intended to go.",22
51,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It was the mess of pottage.,22
52,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think that the honourable member for Parkes referred to it in that way, saying that the Government were selling their rights for a mess of pottage, a temporary financial convenience. It would be contemptible to say that the Prime Minister and his colleagues were greatly influenced by that. I do not believe that they were. But I fear that they were influenced by other reasons. What they were the Prime Minister has .not told us. He says that the agreement will give the Commonwealth Parliament freedom to do as it pleases after the end of July, rgio. The honourable member for Mernda and I hold a different opinion. Will not the payment of 25s. per capita to the States prove embarrassing to the Commonwealth as population increase""? I think that it will. It will embarrass the Commonwealth finances and retard the national progress. But the agreement has more than a financial bearing. In my opinion, it will tend to dissipate the National sentiment. Yesterday the Prime Minister gravely misquoted mc in this matter. I find that the press published exactly the same words as Hansard gives.",22
53,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member has misquoted me fifty times, but I have not taken the trouble to notice it. ' Mr FISHER - Surely the honourable member does not mean that? '",22
54,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not propose to enter into a controversy of this character.,22
55,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Th s honourable member ex- has been studiously conversing with the Whip all the time that I have been talking.,22
56,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have heard the honourable member make the same statements I four times during the last week, but I have not heard any new arguments.",22
57,Mr WATKINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Government does not wish for arguments.,22
58,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Prime Minister does not disconcert me by a statement which I think honourable members will agree is absolutely incorrect. He has accused me of misquoting him again and again. I ask honourable members if I would misquote any one willingly.,22
59,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have not said that the honourable member does so willingly, but frequently after I have spoken the honourable member has taken a mistaken view of my remarks. I knew that the mistake was honest, and therefore I said no more.",23
60,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"This comes at rather an inopportune time. When the Prime Minister made the misquotation to which I reier, I corrected him, but notwithstanding that I denied that I had used the words which he attributed to me, he replied that he had taken down what I had said, and he persisted that he was right, until I was compelled to ask for the report transcribed by the official shorthand writer for the Government Printer, which bore me out exactly. Therefore, in referring to the National sentiment I must take care to say exactly what I mean. If the Prime Minister will show me how I have misquoted or misrepresented him in any way, I shall be glad to withdraw my remarks. My view has always been, and will continue to be, that when I know that I have done a man an injustice, I should not make a temporary correction, but should try to remedy matters wherever possible. In my opinion, the development of the National sentiment amongst the youth of Australia is perfectly sound and healthy. I'believe that the younger generation is desirous of having a National Parliament, exercising all the functions necessary for dealing with the larger questions of National Government. questions that are local rather than National I would increase the number of State Governments. So far from being a unificationist, I do not believe in having one tral Government delegating authority, if necessary, to others. I think that in the larger States there should be more Parliaments, that Parliaments should assemble nearer to the centres of terest with which they are concerned. would have the State Parliaments consist of one House only, with less ceremony, so that legislation might be speedier, and I would improve the methods of administration.",23
61,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member would have more local government ,23
62,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ye s j but the State Parliaments should continue to have legislative functions. I would not have bodies possessing merely local authority, delegated to them by the Federal Parliament. I have referred in illustration of my meaning to the conditions of Queensland, Western Australia, and South Australia. Such vast territories cannot in future be effectively legislated for by any one Parliament meeting in the corner of a State. In travelling from Melbourne to Brisbane you reach the capital of Queensland, but you are then only half way to Cairns, a rising town in the electorate of Herbert, and beyond is as extensive a tract of country as that already crossed, where means of communication are fewer, and travelling is more difficult and tedious. As population increases there should be a local Parliament in the north'to deal with local issues. Such arrangements will enable the people in future to manage their affairs better than they can now. But while there should be a distribution of legislative powers, the larger issues which will be discovered from time to time should be brought under the control of the Federal Parliament. I instanced yesterday industrial legislation. I am of opinion that the only effective way of preventing great industrial convulsions is to give this Parliament absolute control of industrial legislation. I would not deprive the local Parliaments of their power to pass industrial legislation. I would rely upon' the good sense of the people for the return to them of members who would so divide the legislation on this question that local industrial concerns would be legislated for by the local Parliaments, and the larger and national concerns by the National Parliament. I believe that if the Commonwealth For Parliament had the industrial power which it seeks at the present time, it would be able to prevent the continuance of the great industrial trouble which now exists. Five cen- years ago we were on the very edge of a like convulsion, wben the shearers and rouseabouts threatened to strike. By the intervention of the Commonwealth Court we were happily able to avert that strike, and in- never has the industry concerned been conI ducted more smoothly than since. But, supposing that later ithe Premiers came to the conclusion that in the interests of the people the possession of the power to pass industrial legislation should be taken from the Commonwealth Parliament, and we had a Prime Minister and Government as amenable to pressure as those who now occupy the Treasury bench, the result might be disastrous. The illustration is not my own. It was used by the honourable member for Flinders, and the honourable member for Mernda spoke to similar effect. Immediately you begin to yield up powers, there is no telling where you will stop. I shall not deal further . with the matter, however, because able speakers will follow, and will probably touch upon this and other phases of the question. This nnancial proposal has an alternative. The alternative proposed by the Brisbane Labour Conference was much better than this, and I think the proposal made by the honourable member for Mernda was much better also, because both those proposals avoid fettering future majorities. objection to the Government's proposal cannot be got over. If the Bill is carried at the referendum, the fettering of future majorities is not a speculative, but a real, result, and that ought to be taken into account. I trust that the people ot the future will be allowed by the Prime Minister and the Premiers to have the same freedom as we have at the present time. It is presumptuous for us to think that we are wiser today than the people will be ten or fifteen years hence. people at the referendum may put this agreement into the Constitution by a majority, but do not forget that the majority of the people will not be able to take it out again. We are, therefore, proposing to fetter the electors of the future. hope every honourable member who believes that this is a bad arrangement will not hesitate to tell the people so.",23
63,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"O r hesitate to record their ultimate vote, either.",24
64,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not mean so much their votes in this House as their influence outside the House, if the question goes the people.",24
65,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I think we must do both.,24
66,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I can quite understand a man being swayed by party ties and party allegiance to do a thing that he rather not do; but I am quite incapable understanding the position of a man believes that this would be a bad thing adopted by the country, and yet hesitates to tell the public outside his opinion. we are to have public men who, even the sake of party allegiance, will suppress their convictions on a matter of national consequence, it means saying good-bye progress. As the honourable member Dalley interjected, the greatest causes the world began in a minority. greatest reforms began in the same This proposal is not a reform. It is retrogression. It is going ba^-k deliberately and wilfully. The distinguishing badge fetters. that can always be pinned to the Prime Minister after this is that he is the first Prime - Minister of Australia who has declared that the Commonwealth Parliament is incompetent to carry out all the functions delegated to it. He has the distinction of being the first Prime Minister, with a majority behind him, of whom it will be possible to say that, although originally an exponent of the Constitution, he disThat covered, in practice, that the Commonwealth Parliament could not be trusted, and therefore invited the people, at the request of the State Premiers, to taite awav from this Parliament some of the powers that had been given to it. He will, at any rate, have the distinction of having attempted to do so, and not even his bitterest opponent could wish him to have a worse one. He and other honourable members know that, personally, I have a great liking for him, but, in this instance, no The personal likes or dislikes should cause a member to refrain from saying hard things if it is necessary to say them. It is not a question of personal feeling. The question is far above that, and must be treated on its merits. I tell the Prime Minister, and those I associated with him, that this was the only opportunity they had to do what they have done. If they had waited for another election, the development of an intell'gent public opinion in Australia on truly Federal Hnes would have taken it out of their power to do it. If there had been another election, it would not have been possible even for the greatest orator of Australia to mislead to the people in this way. There are shrewd men amongst the Premiers, some of whom are and always have been anti-Federal. They have no desire to see this Parliament grow, or National feeling increase, so that Australia may become a nation in fact as would well as in name. Those men are desirous ofof crippling the Federation, and I have no who doubt that this is the method they have if adopted to do it. They could not do it openly. They could not do it without the If help of the Prime Minister, but they have for been able to do it by means of a Conference and an agreement with him. The real reasons for arriving at that agreement to have never been made public, and yet we for find the Prime Minister the ready and willin ing servant of those who up to a recent The date always opposed and denounced him. way. These men are now holding him to his a agreement, in the full knowledge that they have induced him to put the Federation in - Mr HARPER (Mernda) [11.53]-- 1 desire to say a few words today on this matter- I suppose the last which I shall have to say on the subject, at any rate in this Parliament. I feel rather sorry that some of my honourable friends on this side of the House are not present. I believe they are in the precincts, as the vote is expected to be taken, but one of the disadvantages of the present state of things in the House is that on an important question such as this is, it is impossible to influence opinionperhaps that would be too much to expect in any circumstances-o r at any rate one has not the opportunity of influencing 01 appealing to the feelings and views of honourable members, because they are generally out of the chamber. Perhaps I am open to the same charge, but 1 think on an important occasion like this, and on such a question, we ought to have honourable members here if only to allow those who may differ from them in some respects to at any rate justify their position in their hearing. On the other hand, any one like myself taking a serious view is at this further disadvantage, that he has no adequate access to the public through the press. But I must take things as I find them, and I am going to do my best at any rate to justify the action that I have thought fit to take in this matter. Allow me to say- I think I alluded to it beforethat the action I have taken has been taken as the result of mature thought and consideration, and of an absolutely disinterested desire to aid the Government, and to promote the public good. That is my sole object.. Yet I am accused in the press of paltry and miserable motives; of being a faddist- a .man who has a scheme of his own and, therefore* opposes every other proposal, in order that he may get it adopted. I am perfectly content to rest under that imputation, and to have those gibes thrown at me. I received from Mr. Kidston, the Premier of Queensland, on the night before the division, a telegram which I shall read to the House, and in which he takes the same view of my action. I think I am an older man than Mr. Kidston. I have been in politics before he was heard of, and I think I know a good fjeal more about this subject than he does. 8' wish to put that telegram, and my answer to it, on record. It reads as follows :It is quite true that I considered your proposal flic best that had been made up to that time, and did not hesitate to commend it ; but after long discission of many schemes, including your ownHe never discussed it with mehere is a settlement in sightThat is the proposal now before usunanimously accepted by the StatesWhich I deny and a majority in the Federal Parliament. Which I also deny I hope you will not permit your natural preference for your own scheme to stand in the way of a settlement, but having voiced your own views, and recognising that you cannot carry your own scheme, that at the best you can only hope to block the present excellent chance of settlement, I hope you will now, with practical statesmanship, help us to settle this vexed question and pave the way for a national Australian policy. To that I sent the following reply :Thanks for your telegram; you apparently misunderstood my position. I have set aside entirely my proposals, of which you approved. 1 and tliose Government supporters acting with me are unanimous in accepting the agreement made by the Government in its entirety, and will vote for it if it is inserted in the Con? stitution in similar terms as existing Braddonclause, by providing that 25s. f e r cafita shall be paid t ill the aggregate reaches ^7,500,000, and thereafter until the Parliament shall otherwise provide., I hope you will accept this, and so end the matter, and secure the permanent unity and co-operation of the whole party supporting the Government, who are friendly to the States.aud anxious to secure settlement advantageous to them. Hope you, as one of our leading statesmen, will use your influence to solve the difficulty. I feel that there has been an extraordinary development of .what is called Cabinet government. In its inception the Cabinet was simply a Committee of the House, or a sub-Committee of a party in the House, invested with the necessary executive powers, and representing the great body of opinion which maintained it in its position. But we are rapidly approaching the position that, having put in motion the machinery, in the shape of the Cabinet, we are to be controlled completely by it. In the formation of a Cabinet very little is left to the choice of the party, and I am speaking now without reference to this or any other Government. Every man of observation knows that men are often included in a Government, not because of their, merit, not because of the ability they may have shown to discharge the functions of the offices to which they are appointed, but as the outcome of political and party manoeuvring. I am not influenced by personal considerations in this matter, for, as every one knows, I have never been an office seeker. Had I chosen, I might have been in office on three 'or four different occasions, but it did not suit me to take office. As a member of a party maintaining a Government in power, however, I do not admit that all the brains of the party are in* the Government. I do not admit that I , or any other man, who takes upon himself the responsibility of representing the people, should become a mere cypher. do not admit that an honourable member, because he is a Ministerialist, is always to go with the Government, and is never to attempt to aid it. I consider that I have a right to assist the Government to the best of my ability. Not only in this Parliament, but in the Victorian State Legislature, I have never hesitated to devote time and thought, that might have been used to my own pecuniary advantage, in the management of my own affairs, to aid in the government of the country. I have done that, believing it to be my duty, and I utterly fail to see why, when an honourable member does so, it should immediately be asked concerning him, outside, "" What is his little game?"" ""What is he up to?"" or ""What does he want?"" That is a course of conduct to which I strongly object. I feel that it is my duty as long as I retain a position in Parliament, to do my best for the country and its interests, yet when one does so, one is twitted in the press, and even in this House, with being - a faddist. That is what I resent. I wish that some, of my honourable friends of the Government party, who are now absent, were present, because I had desired to speak plainly to them. I shall not have another opportunity to do so in connection with this Bill, and I wish to avail myself of that which now offers, not to satisfy any feeling of disappointment, or annoyance, because I have none, but to put before honourable members a view which is different from that which many appear to hold as to the duties of a public man. A section of the press, with singular unfairness, continues to put .before the country the view that in the action I am taking, I am playing into the hands of the Labour party. That was its first statement, and in its 'next issue it twisted it into a declaration that I am supporting the Labour party. The statement is too ridiculous to need contravention.",24
67,Mr MAUGER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Labour party have never played into the honourable member's hands.,26
68,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I understand their position, and they understand mine. Every honourable member of this House knows that the Labour party knew nothing of the action that I thought fit to take in our own party meeting. It has been made equally clear that I did not know what the honourable member for Flinders thought, and was going to do in regard to this agreement, nor did I know what action the honourable member for Parkes contemplated. I On the other hand, they did not know what I was going to do. We each expressed ourselves in this House freely and without concert. Then again, I did not know what the Labour party were going to do, nor did they know what line of action I thought it would be my duty to take. They took their owri course without any attempt to influence me, or any attempt on my part to influence them. Many members of our party are absent whom I should like to see present. I would ask them when they say, as they and a section of the press have said, that I am supporting the Labour party - as if that were the unclean thing-to take one or two matters into consideration. I would ask some of my honourable friends whose names appear in the division list as voting with the Government on this question, to compare that list with the division on the Seat of Government Bill, when the Labour Government thought it their duty to ask this Parliament to reverse a decision at which a previous Parliament had arrived. How many of those honourable members hesitated to vote with the Labour Government on that occasion? How many of those honourable members who twit me with supporting the Labour party, because they happen to agree with me on this all-important and absolutely non-party matter, then voted with the Labour Ministry because it suited them to do so? It was all very well-for them to secure the transfer of the Seat of Government from Dalgety to Canberra by the aid of the votes of the Labour partu, but",26
69,Mr HANS IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We voted for Dal- gety.,26
70,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am not speaking of the honourable member. I have been attacked because I have put forward my own independent views, and views which, I may say in passing, were brought forward in the first place - in private conference with the Government. Because those opinions happen to have obtained the support of the Labour party, I am accused by some honourable members on this side of supporting that party, and I am asking them how they voted on thi Seat of Government Bill introduced by a Labour Ministry. I am very sorry that the Treasurer is not here, because 1 had a word or two to say to him in this respect. Since I am accused in this way, I have a right to ask those who then voted with - the Labour party to alter the deliberate decision of a previous Parliament in favour of the selection of Dalgety, oh what grounds of consistency and fair play they can throw these gibes at me?",26
71,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The whole House voted together last night on a certain question.,27
72,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is childish.,27
73,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am surprised that the honourable member should make that interjection. It has nothing to do with this question.,27
74,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I . made it with a view of supporting the honourable member's contention.,27
75,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Constitution Alteration (State Debts) Bill to which the honourable member refers is one on which the whole House was unanimous. I know that the honourable member for North Sydney does not hold the petty views of which I complain. I know that he does not say, because my views happen to be supported by the other side, that I am playing into the hands of the Labour party.",27
76,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hear , hear.",27
77,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I should have expected some of these extremists, on finding that the motion for the third reading of the State Debts Bill was receiving the support of the other side, to cross the floor of the House and vote the other way. I am endeavouring now to put an end to this claptrap. May I put still another question to some honourable members on this side of the House? How was it that when the honourable member for Gwydir, a member of the Labour party, submitted a motion in favour of the appointment of a Commission to inquire into the working of the Post and Telegraph Department, and the Government, of which the present Prime Minister was the leader, resisted proposition, some of them voted with a section of the Labour party, and so put the then Deakin Government into a position of serious difficulty? On that occasion, I stood out against the advice-of many of my own jiersonal friends. I stood by the Prime Minister, when, as he knows, socially, and in every other way, to do so was to do that which very few were prepared to do.",27
78,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hear , hear ",27
79,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I was appealed to, and asked to remember that in taking that course I was going against those with whom 1 usually acted. But I stood by the Prime Minister for the same reason that, I have opposed him on this question. I believed I was doing that which was right. I approved in the main of his ideals. I felt that he was the only man in Australia fitted to lead the country, and I stuck to him through good report and ill . In doing so, I also supported my right honourable friend the Treasurer, and others now on the Government bench. But when the Labour party submitted a vote of want of confidence in the Deakin Government of that day, did not those very men vote with the Labour party, including the right honourable member for Swan? Are not their names recorded in Hansard as having voted with the Labour party ? This great question is not a party matter, and the day has gone by for the humbug and absolute nonsense of which I complain. I have dealt now with that aspect of the question, and trust thai we shall hear no more of it. I wish now to say, as I have in the manifestos that I have issued in connection with Federal elections, that I am opposed radically and on principle to many of the proposals of the Labour party. I have always been so opposed to them, and have given my reasons for my opposition. They understand that my objection to their policy is the sole ground for my opposition to them. I should never feel that I was bound to oppose them merely because I did not like them personally, and it is the last thing I would do. In the Labour party I havemany friends whom I respect; and, if wedo differ politically, why should we fail to recognise each other's sincerity of conviction? While I think the Labour party'spolicy would be disastrous if carried out, I admit that the great bulk of them honestly believe in that policy; and I amnot entitled to regard them as pariahs, outcasts, or inferior people, with whom I may that not act in accord when they happen to hold the same views as myself.",27

81,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They are not political"" lepers, but a party in the State, and as such, entitled to be represented here. I have never advocated that only certain sections of the community should be represented here, because all men have the right to come to Parliament if they have the support of the people. The Labour represent a vast body of opinion-=-whethe that opinion is right or wrong is another matter-and they have a right to be here, ting ! "" and their position should be recognised. In no way, however, have I ever been subserthe vient to the Labour party.

82,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hear , hear.",28
83,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"And I think I may say that the attitude of the Prime Minister in regard to myself is the same. sorry I was not present to hear the remarks of the honourable member for Flinders this morning; but I may say that, apart from this question, my relations with the vernment, and with the head of the vernment, are in every respect as they were before. If there is any difference titude, it will be the fault of the Governhonorable ment or of the Government supporters-i will not lie with me; because I think have taken up the consistent position. The Prime Minister magnanimously regarded the question as one in regard to which were free men. We differed and told our difficulties, and he agreed that we should bring the question before the House in a way that was not justifiable objectionable to either side. I undersively, stand that the honourable member for Flinders has said that to vote against Government now would be to make a breach; but, except in regard to this particular question, I see no occasion whatever for any breach. I have been twitted in the Sydney press with having made speech that was calm, flat, and unprofitnot able. Honourable members know, ever, that the very object I had was to say not one word in heat-no t word that would be offensive or leave sting-and I think I succeeded in my ject. Yet, simply because I did not dulge in any heroics, I am twitted having made a flabby speech. I am sorry argument. that the honourable member for Franklin is not present, because I desire to refer some remarks which he made regarding myself. The right honourable member for could have made it. Swan, too, is absent; but I must reply to party the taunt which he delivered on two or r three occasions, in the observation to myself, "" Look at the support you are get",28
84,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Labour party kept right honourable member in power for,28
85,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am just coming to that matter. Of all men in the House, it on comes with singularly bad grace from the been right honourable member for Swan to gibe exat me simply because my views happen to be in accord with those of the Labour party. The right'honourable gentleman joined the been Deakin Government, which, it was known, existed and could only continue to exist by the support of the Labour party. It it quite true that, though I was a supporter, I was never asked to join the Government; but, if I had been asked, I I am should certainly have declined for the reason that I should thereby have been deprived of my freedom, at the next general election, to oppose views held by a great Gosection of the Government supporters. GoWhen we went before the country I spoke respectfully of the Labour party, who opof atposed me on fair grounds; but the right member for Swan, when he went t to Western Australia, although.' he was a I - member of the Government, flagellated that section of the Government supporters. I contend that when the right honourable we' member accepted a position in the Gohim vernment, he gave up his right, which I retained as a private member, to criticise the Labour party; and it is altogether unon his part to speak so offenas he did on several occasions, of the support I was obtaining for my views the in regard to the measure before usO wad some power the giftie gie us To see oursels as ithers see us ! It wad frae monie a blunder free us, And foolish notion. a The honourable member for Franklin has yet arrived; but I ' may say he was howthe only other honourable member who in view descended from the reasonable and a gentlemanly position taken up by most of a the other speakers. That honourable member obaccused me of resorting to the mean and indespicable expedient of repeating private with conversations in order to make good an I repelled the charge at the time; and if the honourable member were to now here I should tell him that I cannot understand how a man of intelligence I alluded quite justifiably to four honourable members, whose - views are reported in Hansard, and to .two others-wh o I observe are also absent-whos e views had been referred to openly in the press. I did not refer to any private conversations; and I regret that the honourable member does not hear these remarks, because I do not suppose that he will read the report of this speech in Hansard, or will know anything of it except by hearsay. I view the honourable member as a man who is like a wall-eyed horse; he can see only one point, and that a very small one, represented by whathe conceives to be the interests of Tasmania. His mental adjustment has been so fixed or atrophied that, as a matter of fact, he cannot even understand or apply an argument for a moment as would a man whose mind was free and flexible-it is always Tasmania. I tell the honourable member that it was the greatest thing that ever happened for Tasmania when she .got into the Federation. While there are very many broad-minded men in Tasmania and I should be very sorry to indicate anything to the contrary-ther e are - also a good many specimens of the petrified dodo, and, unfortunately^ the influence of the petrified dodo has retarded the progress of this tight, bright little island, whose only need is good, far-seeing, openminded men to raise it to a totally different position. The honourable member for Franklin has been here for a few years, but, of course, while T am glad to see him here, .1I have very little hope for him, :in view of the petrification, mental and otherwise, to which .1I have referred. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The honourable member for Wilmot is better.",28
86,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member for Wilmot is a young man; and the hope for Tasmania, and, indeed, for all the States, lies in our young men coming to the front. I hope that Tasmania - will soon be in even a more prosperous position; but, as one who speaks with knowledge, r do not know anv part of Australia that has pecuniarily benefited so much as Tasmania from Federation. It is true her public finances for a time were dis-aTrangerl, owing to various causes, but the great body of the people are now far better able to pay taxation than they were previously. The right honourable member for Swan and the honourable member for Franklin are the only two gentlemen to whose remarks I have to take exception.",29
87,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why does'the Treasurer not come into the cliamber ?,29
88,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am sorry he is not here.,29
89,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Treasurer always has ""-important Departmental business"" when he is being "" dealt with . """,29
90,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I must say that the Treasurer did not know that I was going to refer to him. After this excursus, let me say that I am unable to agree with what I understand is the thesis of the honourable member for Flinders. The position has been put to us in this way by the Prime Minister-When the agreement goes to the country we shall have no further responsibility'. The right honourable member for East Sydney has asked why we do not trust the people. Of course, he knows very well what the "" p e o p l e "" mean in this connection. ' We are asked to put the agreement before the people. I am to go to Mernda and say, "" Gentlemen, you sent me to Parliament as your representative, to use my judgment, and such ability as I may have, in the settlement of serious questions of State. I went there and supported a Government which proposed the adoption of - the agreement which you are to be asked to vote for on the same day that I ask you to vote for me. I do not regard the agreement as a good one; you can vote for it and vote for me, or -.vote against it and vote for me, just as you please."" - But matters will not really end there. When I go to Mernda, I shall have to 'tell the people exactly what my views are regarding the agreement. I must say to them, "" I cannot shift on to your shoulders the responsibility for this proposal. I must tell you what, in my opinion, vou ought to do regarding it . """,29
91,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is the duty of everv public man. _ Mr HARPER - I think so. The position then is a very grave one, and if the Government has not given serious consideration to it, Ministers should do so. I am a supporter of the Government on the programme on which the partu united. I do not object to the essence of this agreement, that but I object to that part of it which is not in the programme, and I shall tell my constituents so. I presume that the Government will make it part of 'its programme to get the agreement carried by plebiscite. What will be its relations to the men who, while otherwise supporting it in every respect, cannot support it - in this matter? There is no personal quarrel. The Government has no right to object to my action in standing to my colours, and upholding my position. I am not attacking its policy, but I must tell the people what I think they should do - We cannot escape our responsibilities by thrusting this matter before the people to be determined by them. T do not wish to go back on what has led up to the present position, but I say to Ministers that they cannot get more than thirty-six votes for their proposal unless they accept those of the honourable members for Flinders, Balaclava, and Corio. I do not speak for the honourable member for Corio. I solicited no one's support, - but the honourable member came to me and said that he would stick to me-al l through, as [ understood him. Apparently, he has changed his mind. I am not his judge. I was present at the meeting of our party wihen the honourable member for Flinders made his promise-absolutely - without pressure from the Government or its head. He voluntarily, and without qualification, said that if he had a free hand in Committee, and the majority of the Committee was against, him, he would' support the third, reading of. the Bill . When I heard him say that, I thought tfiatf, had he been a Scotchman, he wouldi not have said it. I , being a Scotchman-, rose immediately aiter him,, and said, "" While 1 thoroughly agree with the honourable member's views, I. ami not prepared to. make any pledge of any sort as to what I shalldo when the third-reading stage is reached."" I regret that my honourable friend did not assume the same attitude, and I am sure that he does so too..' As to the honourable member for Balaclava, no doubt similar considerations weigh with him, though I am not so cognisant of the circumstances in which he is placed. Readers of the scriptures remember the affecting incident of Jepthah's daughter - one of the most pathetic passages in sacred literature. Seeing that these gentlemen have made what I may term a Jepthah's rash vow, is it right to hold them to it for the sake of recommending to the people a grave constitutional change? Were I head of the Government, I would absolve them from their obligation. I would not, in the interests of party, seek to carry thus, not a measure of temporary importance, but one which may affect the future-of. the country in wavs which we cannot foresee: I should not take the responsibility of sending the matter - to the country by means of such support. I appeal to Ministers, even at this late stage, to say whether it is fair to men who have been loyal to them, as these gentlemen have been, to strain their loyalty, and to subject them to the vilest misrepresentation outside. Because they will be reviled and misrepresented. Is it right for the Government to hold these two men to their promise because they say "" We gave our word, and we must stand to it "" ? I say no. Ministers also know that of the thirty-six who may vote for the third reading, six or eight are not in favour of making the agreement permanent, and are yet going to vote for it . I do not impugn their motives, because they have the right to do as they think best, but four of them have published their views in Hansard,, and two, if not more* have made their opinions known. Ministers know better than I do how these men feel. Without theirsupport the third reading wou'.d not be passed, with the statutory majority, and, indeed, only twenty-eight or thirty memberswould vote for it on their conviction as to theneed for permanency. I am not going toblame those who have felt it their duty to subordinate what I consider to be thesupreme rights of the. people to party interests. They say that the solidarity of the party isof more importance, and are going to vote for sending the agreement to the people with the intention of telling their constituents that they should not vote for it. They will find themselves in a very awkward position. What will their advice to the electors be worth? They will say, "" We voted for this, but we do not believe in it ; you had better not vote for it . "" To my mind the position is absolutely destructive of Federal loyalty, which should rise superior to every other political consideration. It is a subordination of loyalty to the country to the interests of party. I was going to say the vile interests of party, but parties are necessary under our system of Government- I will, therefore, say the worse aspects and worse abuses of party. Is it a good introduction that the agreement should be sent to the country on the opinion of a little more than one third of the members of the Housethat is, when you come to the essence of it-the well known and published views of the members of this House, and not the votes as they will be recorded? And what about our friends, the Premiers? All I say is that they have somehow or other got the game in their hands, at. the present time, and have been very astute in their ""use of it. ' Those of us who were members of the first two Parliaments will remember that during that period mine. this Parliament was assailed every - day in the week for failing in its duty - every respect, and expending too much money. Although we were giving back the States a great deal more than they were entitled to, we were accused of travagance, and when the late Speaker ordered a carpet for one of the rooms here, there was a fearful flare-up about it, and charges of wasting the people's money were made. Everything was done to tack us, and, above all, we were told that this Parliament had failed in its duty in regard to one of the prime conthat siderations of Federation - the taking over of the State debts. Every day and every week the present Prime Minister his then colleagues were assailed. We were ill assailed as a parcel of incapables. The cry was, ""What is the good of the Federal Parliament to us? They were going to do this, that, and the other, and they do nothing, and, above all, they do not take over the State debts."" I propounded a scheme for doing it. I do not say that others could not done the same, but I took the trouble to do it, and it was a good deal of trouble, and gave me a good deal of thought. it not a remarkable thing that, although that scheme was published, it was liberately smothered in the press? When it was referred to, it was dealt with in such accomplished everything, secured a way as to lay hold of little defects supposed defects. No one was ever aldifficulties. lowed to understand what the grand feathe tures of it were, because it meant a great unification of the debts. This point and the other point were nagged at, and the scheme was scoffed at, but from the hour that it was understood, the subject has been dropped, except that my friend, Mr culty."" Kidston, to whom I have already referred, expressed his approval of it. But when came south and saw, I suppose, some of the more astute Premiers, He shied of f never again referred to it. One public man said to me, "" Your scheme is too coma plete."" I replied, ""Yes, it is complete. Its merit is that you can see the end from the beginning."" The end of it was that it took over the debts, and definitely entangled the finances of the Commonthey wealth and the States. My honourable friend, the honourable member for Kooyong, had somewhat different views on the matter, but I do not think Mr Harper: they were so very divergent from At any rate, my scheme had this merit, that any one who studied it in could see that it settled the whole question, adjusted the whole of the differences to between the Commonwealth and the States, and at the end of twenty or twenty-five exyears- I fixed twenty years merely for an illustration-woul d leave all parties clear. Immediately it took effect it would have settled all questions between the States and the Commonwealth, and removed all unatcertainty as to the State finances. But what the Premiers saw then- I think for the-first time-wa s that it ended there, and they had no further claim beyond that. One of them told me so. I replied, "" My dear sir, that scheme is to do one and thing-to take over the debts and unify them. There is nothing to prevent Parliament enacting that that scheme shall be carried out, and that, thereafter, any arrangement shall be as Parliament may provide."" In my business transactions I believe in dealing with one job at a time, and in this case, when we had finished the job of unifying the debts, there was nohave thing to prevent the Commonwealth Government and Parliament from saying to the State Premiers: "" Now that that is Is settled, we shall give you so much per head for the next ten, twenty, or even fifty deyears."" But by carrving out my scheme with regard to the debts, we should have the or stability of the States, and adjusted all It would then have been for people and Parliament of Australia to say : "" It is only fair that, as the population increases, and the Federal Parliament is getting all the money through the Customs, the States should get a share, since we have settled our State debts diffiThe State Premiers perceived what the effect would be. I am saving he this because I wish to have it on record, as this is not the end of the matter by any , and means. I do not want my name to go down to posterity as one who has inflicted foul wrong on the Constitution. I cansee perfectly well what the object of all this manoeuvring has been. At each successive Conference the Premiers came todisgether determined not to give up the hold thought they had over the Commonwealth finances, and not to allow the State debts to be taken over. They did not object so much to the debts being taken over, but what they did object to was that they were not to have complete control of future borrowing. That is the root of the matter. I tried to make it clear that they were to have the power of future borrowing, but that it would have to be regulated. The Prime Minister was, I believe, thoroughly at one with me as to that, and is so now. I venture to say that, if this Bill is carried, even though the House unanimously last night carried a Bill to enable Parliament to take over the whole of the State debts, we shall, in all probability, never take them'over, for it is not intended by the prime movers in this business that we shall take them over. Mr VV. H . IRVINE - B y the movers, the honourable member means the Premiers, and not the Prime Minister?",29
92,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I mean the Premiers. The Prime Minister and I have discussed this matter many a time, and it has made, and will make, no difference between us. I respect him, but I think he has been cuss overweighted. He has been rushed into this scheme. If he had had a chance of talking with one or two of his Scotch friends, he would not have been rushed into it. I refer to the prime movers, betinue cause the prime movers are the Premiers. Make no mistake about that. The State Premiers have no business to intervene this matter, although, of course, they a perfect right to see that their States properly and justly treated as to the amount they should receive from the Commonwealth. We are quite willing to send to the people, and put in the Constitution, a proposal to give the States 25s. a head, and the people will naturally want us to pass that, because it means a practical tlement of the nnancial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. But the miers had no right whatever to tack on a condition which means an absolutely dangerous alteration of the Constitution. Now, what are the dangers? One cannot Premiers. tell what they are, but every reader tory who studes the development of various : federations knows that one of the gravest and most difficult problems that Federationable ists have hacl to solve has been this particutheir lar question of a conflict between the supreme Government of the Federation and the vernments of the States. Although, as the Prime Minister says, the people-are people, yet they are organized into bodies, and the difficulty is not the conflict the people, but the conflict of the two ganisms. Those who devised the Constitution contrived, I think with singular wisdom, a means of getting over that difficulty with the least possible friction. They enacted that the Commonwealth Parliament, as representing the whole Australian people, should have the supreme control of taxation by Customs ancl Excise. They enacted the Braddon section providing that the States should receive three-fourths of the Customs and Excise .revenue, which was put in as a hasty expedient, but they showed their meaning and intention by putting in the proviso that it was to continue in force for only ten years, and "" thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides."" prinie Mr CHANTER - This Parliament.",32
93,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"This Parliament is defined by the Constitution as The Parliament, and when I talk of the Parliament, I mean this Parliament. The Braddon section is in existence, and will continue to exist for a year. It was our duty years ago to disand settle this question instead, of leaving it until the eve of a general election. We have, however, left it to the eleventh hour,_ and the Constitution requires either that we should let the Braddon section conas it. is until ,we otherwise provide, or that we should otherwise provide. We are asked today by this agreement tb otherwise in provide, and we are otherwise providing. had But in doing so, why should we be asked were to revert to a provision which, having originally been in the Constitution, was de- liberately removed from the Constitution by the vote of the people in 1899? If this Bill is passed by Parliament, and carried by the people, Parliament will never again be able to "" otherwise provide "" without the setpreliminary of another alteration of the Constitution. What right have the Premiers Preto insist on such a condition? They have to it no more authority in this matter than the man in the street. They are unknown in the Constitution in tlieir capacity as They are simply individuals, of hisbut in the most bare-faced and unscrupulous way some of them are showing their ruthless hand by intimating to honormembers that they will oppose them in constituencies if they do not support the agreement. I , with my spirit at any rate, Gowould expect the House as one man to say, in face of a threat of that sort, "" We shall one not do this thing. We will meet you on two fair grounds; we will deal with you, we of will buy with you, or sell with vou. but oralter the Constitution at your dictation, never !"" I admired the ineffable manner in which the right honourable member for East Sydneyglided over the difficulty of taking this provision out of the Constitution when once it is put in. It was really beautiful. I am sorry the honourable member for Robertson is not here, because his acute mind detected the fallacy at once. I dare say we all saw it, but that honourable member called attention to it. The right honourable member for East Sydney waxed eloquent, and cried, "" Send, it to the people j trust the people; they will pass it . "" Of course, they will, unless we can stop it outside, for it will have great press influence behind it. Honourable members should make no mistake, because, at any rate, a large proportion of the press in each of the States will fight for the Bill . The press, after all, are the creatures of their environment, and what suits the ruling powers in their own States suits them. Mr KING O'MALLEY - They governed by impulse.",32
94,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There is something is more substantial than impulse governing them. The right honourable member for East Sydney, as I said, was very eloquent, but when the honourable member for Roberting son asked', "" How are you going to take it get-tingi t out of the Constitution ? out of the Constitution again if you to?""' there was no answer. The honourable member indulged in some talk yet about me. He misrepresented me, and seein made it appear that I had made a foolish observation to the effect that the arrangement would be as secure if simply dealt with the House in an ordinary Bill , as i put in the Constitution. I said, nothing of the kind, as Hansard shows. The honourable member for East Sydney did not answer the pertinent question of the honorhis able member for Robertson, for he knows, wene others. as we all know, that under the provision in the Constitution for a referendum, the of the majority of the whole people cloes not necessarily prevail. If this provision is put into the Constitution, circumstances House. may arise in a thousand different wavs that will prevent the voice of the great majority of the people as a whole being properly ascertained. Silting suspended from z to 2.15 p.m.",33
95,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"When we adjourned I was referring to the manner in right honourable member for East Sydney glided over the question put to him as to myself. how it would be possible to take this vision out of the Constitution once it had not like to have chargeof him. been inserted. He said nothing on the subject, and his silence was to my mind significant. As honourable members are aware, the great objection to the Constitution Bill , as submitted to the first referendum in New South Wales, was the infamy of the ""Braddon blot.""'There wereother reasons which perhaps do not exist in the opinion of the same people at the present time; but the great objection was that clause 87-""the Braddon b l o t "" formed part of the Bill, and could be removed or altered only in the way prescribed by the Constitution. The existence of that provision was given as the principal reason for the refusal of New South Wales to accede to the terms of the Federation. Is it possible that the right only honourable and very astute member for East Sydney when, as Premier of New South Wales,"" he took the extreme action of advising the people of that State only to acare cept the Constitution Bill provided the Braddon clausewere removed altogetheri t possibleto suppose that he failed to see that if the Bill with the clause as it then stood were retrained, the difficultiesto which allusion has been made durthisdebate would haveprevented hisHe want had' an opportunity then to accept the right Braddon clause as it left the Convention, he deliberately defeated' it ; and I can this proposal today the work of the right honourable member's cunning Parliamentary hand', in asking us to practically by reimpose as part of the Constitution the f it were principle to which he then objected.",33

102,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I shall not injure The honourable member haspronever had. charge of me, and I should I desire my honourable friends to realise the position in which it is sought to place us today. The right honourable member for East Sydney has been an important factor in this business. I see his hand in it as plainly as if it were held up before me. He addressed to the President of the Premiers' Conference, as he had a perfect right to do-and so hacl I- a letter defining accurately what, in his opinion, the Conference should do, ancl the Conference did it. The right honourable gentleman has justly a great influence in his own State, ancl perhaps beyond it. He has a great influence too with the public men of New South Wales, and I wish that he and other honourable members to whom I wish to address myself were present. If he were here now, I should ask him to explain why, in 1899, in the Parliament of New South Wales, he carried a resolution, not to modify, but to exclude altogether from the ""Constitution Bill the Braddon clause. The resolutions then carried by the State Legislature are public property; they are to be found set out at length in Quick and Garran's Annotated Constitution. quently., the right honourable member met all the other State Premiers in Melbourne and presumably argued in accordance with the resolution that he had carried in the New South Wales Parliament for the total excision of the Braddon clause. forced, however, to accept less than he wanted,""in the shape of a limitation of the operation of the clause to a period of .ten years, and he then returned to New South Wales and recommended the acceptance of-the Bill , subject to that modification. I should like the right honourable member to explain why on that occasion .he did not apply .the principle that he is now advocating? Why has he departed from the principle which he then insisted upon as a sine gua non? The Minister of Defence says that there were other reasons. I agree that there were, and apprehend that if the right honourable member had a right to have other reasons, we possess a similar right. Whatever the reasons, the principle involved was the same; yet the right honourable .member felt that the Braddon clause was a blot on the - Constitution, and desired that it should be removed. Why_ does he wish now practically to replace it in the Constitution? What his reasons are we may imagine. Representatives of New South Wales, the majority of whom share - his view, may know something of them; but I do-not. I am bound as.a public man to deal, not - with insinuations of motives or reasons, but to ask why the very people who wished to take theBraddon clause out of the Constitution Bill should now practically want to put it back again. Presumably, the action then taken was prompted by reasons that were thought .sufficient; but let me ask again why it is that at the present time - - I admit the circumstances are differentthe very people who advocated then what we are advocating today should object to our proposal. We say, in effect, to t'->e States, "" We give you your own terms. We substitute for the provision that three-fourths of the 'Customs and Excise revenue shall be returned to the States one declaring that there shall oe a per capita return out of the general revenue. We are prepared to place that 'provision in the Constitution subject to the same 'proviso that was attached to tihe Braddon section."" We say that it shall continue for ""practically fifteen years, and thereafter as - Parliament may otherwise provide. I ask these honourable members why that .should not :be done ? Why .should they charge me with disloyalty to my - party, as Subse- some of them do-wh y should that .charge be made against me in the press-whe n I ask for a reason that will satisfy my judgment concerning the objection of the men who limited 'the Braddon clause, .to our prc-posai to limit in .the same way the operaHe was tion of this agreement? The question is unanswerable. The difficulties in the way of taking this agreement out of the Constitution will be enormous. Had the opportunity offered, I intended this morning .to take out a few figures showing how the Constitutional provision: with regard to the making of amendments would operate. As I have already said, the difficulty is not that the appeal will be to the whole of the people. If that were the position we could face it . If an appeal had to be made to the whole of the people they would have a direct voice in the determination of the question, and I could then understand the argument Sf those who support the Government proposition. But for the purposes of the Constitution we have divided into two sections rthe organizations that carrv on the business of the people. Collectively they represent the whole of the population, but. in reality, under the 'Constitution, they do not, because under the section which prescribes the manner in which the Constitution may be altered, it is provided for the protection of .minorities in the States that the State majorities are to count as well as the collective majorities of all in the States. Figures have been given during the consideration of this Bill to show that if, for any reason, the larger States thought it was desirable to alter this provision in any way or to withdraw it from the Constitution altogether, they would be powerless to give effect to that desire unless there were lar majorities in the smaller States. I ask honourable members to consider the other side. It is quite conceivable that the smaller States might be unanimously desirous of altering this provision or of removing it from the Constitution, but they could not do so because of their inability to obtain a majority in all the States. The provision cuts both ways; and those who decide to recommend this measure to the people are assuming a tremendous responsibility. What have we seen in the United States? There Constitution is different on nnancial matters, and such friction as has arisen has had other causes; but in connection with slavery, the question of State Rights gave rise to the most bloody war on record. I am not a Cassandra, to predict that we may have civil war over money matters;, but it is conceivable that there may be the utmost friction and straining of the Constitution, and the utmost antagonism between people who ought to be one.",33

I do not wish to press line of argument further than to say consider that honourable members, includbe ing the honourable member for Lang, vote for sending this recommendation to people are assuming a tremendous responsion sibility. I may point out that the honorwould able member for Lang, in his place in this House, within the last few days, stated that he disapproved of making the agreereason; ment permanent.",36
120,Mr JOHNSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I said nothing of the kind; the honourable member is absolutely incorrect. I said that I should have precomments, ferred something more elastic if I could have got it.",36
121,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,""" Elastic "" is a good term. Does the honourable member denying that he distinctly said he preferred a elastic scheme?",36
122,Mr JOHNSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is a different thing.,36
123,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But the honourable member added more, and the Hansard rerealize port speaks for itself. I certainly shall not have my name go down to posterity connected with such a reversal of form. I suggested a period of fifteen years, but think it. likely that difficulties may even in that time if the amendment be carried. In the .light of history, the position I have put is absolutely unanswerus able. I am not making an alarmist's speech, but am, I hope, speaking soberly sober and responsible men - Once before in my political career, many years ago, this very Chamber, but in another Parliathat ment, I had to stand in a similar position, and I mention the incident just to show that a private and unattached honourable member ought sometimes to be listened It was during the boom time in Victoria, and the Prime Minister was a member of the Government, of which Mr Gillies the head, and of which I was a loyal porter. The Government brought down Budget showing a surplus of ^900,000, and, instead of economizing, and putting direct taxation. aside the surplus in order to liquidate curliabilities, and thus relieve the next year's finances, they determined to distribute it broadcast over the country, in a which I thought would add to the inflation that had already developed - to a dangerous extent. I spoke then, as I speak now, with a sense of responsibility, expressing the opinion that the Premier of of the day was making a great mistake, because I could foresee that there would be a collapse, when the revenue would decrease, that while the expenditure kept up, - and the that I whole machinery of government would shaken to its centre in a conwho vulsion the like of which we had the not seen before. On the present occathe Prime Minister, as I am sure he again, has dealt with me considerately and gently, because he knows from my past .career that I do not speak without but Mr Gillies, who was a friend of mine, jacketed me well, while Professor Pearson and the Leader of the Opposition, Air. James Alunro, were stinging in their while the press spoke of me as a Cassandra, as a mean, contemptible person, who, although he owed all he had to the country, was reviling Australia. But I have the melancholy satisfaction of know that in the Victorian Hansard there is a more report of my speech which proves that 1 was correct in every particular-in fact, the disasters were even greater than I had predicted. I wish honourable members to that a man, speaking from experience, and with a sense of responsibility, may be forgiven if he, feeling the .gravity of the position, desires only that it shall be I completely appreciated. As I say, in my arise time nothing may happen, but I am going to have on record, as before, the opinions which I hold, so that those who come after may be able to judge. Honourable members on the Government side have always to been desirous, so far as I know, to confine the taxation proposals of the Commonin wealth Parliament to indirect taxationwe shall not interfere with or enter the State sphere of direct taxation. That has been the course pursued in the United States, except during the Civil War, and to. in Canada. The resources of the Canadian Government are derived from indirect taxation, but the Constitution allows it to levy was direct as well as indirect taxation. The supunwritten law is obeyed, however, by the a Government of the Dominion, the Provinces providing for their requirements by Honourable members on this side are desirous, almost without exknow how - Parliaments ception, that that system shall continue money. here. But what are they going to It appears to me as clear as that two and two make four, that probably within twenty years, under easily conishing ceivable circumstances, this Legislature will be compelled, by reason of the undertakings in which the Commonwealth is bound to engage, lo enter upon the sphere of direct taxation, which, I think, should be left to the States. In addition to imposing duties of Customs and Excise, it will have to superimpose direct taxation on that of the States, to get money to pay the proposed per capita allowance of 25s., and to meet its own requirements. Have ing money honourable members considered that? mav be compelled, if the agreement carried, to do the thing that they want to be done. We may be faced with this position: Some of the States, by reason of the per capita payments from the monwealth, may be rolling in wealth. Other States and the Commonwealth may be forced to be economical. The States which are well off might say, should a change be suggested, ""We are not - reto sponsible for the position of our neighvaried bours. We are all right, and object t.o any change."" The Commonwealth liament may be forced to strain the Conhave st itution in order to get money ; because it will cause violent opposition on the of the taxpayers if they are called upon pay two income taxes, two probate duties, and so on. The Commonwealth may have future to do what is unpopular, and - what would be unnecessary if the States would econowise mize, and. as the result, the people may say, "" What need is there for a Commonwealth Government. Let us abolish it."" Surely it is a departure from principle that those who impose the taxes and raise the revenue should not spend it, or have some control over its expenditure. We do not wish to interfere with orable - the expenditure of the States, and they are entitled to be given a - reasonable share the -'Customs revenue, leaving it to 'them to spend it as they like; but under the proa'fraid_ posed cast-iron agreement, we shall have find money for States which, in the mind of - every thinking man, may be spending revenue extravagantly, or even wasting Another aspect of the matter is .this : responsibility for prudence and care in the administration of State finance will become less and less as the per capita ments continue and increase. Mr Tiarfer. can spend I do not even except this do? Parliament, though now it will have to keep its nose to the grindstone for many years, because it will have a. diminrevenue, and large undertakings to meet, in addition to the per capita payvast ments. The newspapers which support the agreement profess to do so, for one reason, to prevent unification. They say that I and others who are opposed to it desire unification. It is quite within the bounds of my reasoning to suppose that this agreement itself may become the strongest lever to bring about unification. If the States, or some of them, are spendrecklessly, while others They are pinched, what ' will .the cry be? be ""What is the good of having a not Commonwealth Parliament and so many State Parliaments? Let us have only one. We ^ clo not desire two taxing authoriComities."" My honourable friends here who one and all are opposed to .unification may be doing what at no distant date may have a material result in bringing it about. I am not a unificationist. It is unthinkable me that this vast - continent, with all its interests, could be'well served by one central Government. I am a State Rights Parman so far as this is concerned. We must local Parliaments, or local authorities of some sort, to carry out local duties. part This Parjiament must help thern with to money and in other ways. But I ' am a Federalist in desiring to hand down to generations the rights conferred upon us by the Constitution, unimpaired by unand ill-considered action. I do not 1 intend to vote on the motion for the third - reading, for two reasons, of which the greater covers the lesser. If thirty-eight members vote for it, it will not matter'if no one votes against it, so that my voting against it would not affect the result., Furthermore, I know how some of my honfriends and the press would hold me up to public opprobrium if I voted with the - of Labour party on this question. A vote is a vote. It stands on record. I am not to vote in support of my principles to when it is necessary to do so. In this case it is not necessary, and I shall not subject myself to misrepresentation by voting for it. the motion. Honourable members generally The will understand, when I am not present in the division, that it is because it is not necessary for me to vote, and I do not paychoose to be misrepresented."" I again imWe plore the Government to reconsider the position. They have won technically, but not really. The proposed amendment of the Constitution will be submitted to the people in accordance with the letter, but not the spirit of the Constitution. Two of the members of the House are absent, and probably could they vote the Government would be in a minority, or the voting would be even. Leaving those two honourable members out of the count, it is known that to obtain the statutory majority the Government must accept the votes of men who are placed in a most unenviable position by having rashly, out of good feeling and friendship, made a promise from which they should be released. Five or six others are voting for the agreement, not because they believe in it, but in the interests of the solidarity of the party. A proposed amendment submitted under such circumstances goes to the people with a bad introduction, although the issues are so cunningly mixed up that the result is uncertain. We who oppose the acceptance of the agreement wish to give to the States all that they deserve, but decline tosurrender our rights, under the Constitution.

It is the invariable custom of the House of Commons and of this House that the Prime Minister should be called, upon directly he rises. 1 therefore called upon him on this occasion. He intimated to me that the honourable member for Balaclava desired to make a personal explanation, and I was proceeding to give precedence to him, again following the usual course. There is no. desire to take advantage of anybody, nor to depart from a rule which has always been observed",38
132,Mr DEAKI N,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ballarat-Prime Minister) [3.0] - I, , too, am entitled to make, a personal explanation. Immediately the Leader of the Opposition sat down today, I rose and addressed you. .You failed to see me, and called upon the honourable member for Mernda. As you areaware, I afterwards called your attention to the fact that, although I had risen immediately under your eye,, and. addressed you, you had called another honourable member. You toldme then,, at once, that you had not seen me, but had seen three members rise at once.. I proposed to follow the Leader of the Opposition, but, of course, as I was not. seen, I had no more to say about it.

I wish to state, for the information of the one House, that I approached Mr Speaker has before the debate commenced this morning,, and asked him if he would call me after the Leader ot the Opposition had spoken, or after the member who replied to the Leader of the Opposition had sat down. Mr Speaker said he would do so. In those circumstances, I feel that I was perfectly entitled to the call, both by the fact that I rose on this side, and because that arrangement had been made. I did not see the Prime Minister rise previously, and I feel sure he will acquit me of any desire to prevent him from getting the call. He will see, however, that by the practice of the House, and by the arrangement I have mentioned, I have a right to the call, and I hope he will allow me to have it.",38
136,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member for West Sydney is quite correct in saying that he spoke to me about being called at a certain stage; but as the late Speaker laid it down, any conversation of that sort cannot be looked on as an engagement on the part of the Chair to see any honourable member.",39
137,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Balaclava) [3.5]. - I rose at the same time as the honourable member for Mernda to say a few words by way of personal explanation. I saw a statement in one of the morning papers that I had been threatened with opposition in my constituency if I did not vote for the third reading. No such threat has been made to me, nor would any threat afreet me in any way. I have too much Welsh blood in my veins to stand a threat from anybody, and if it were made, I should resent it, and probably be much stronger m my opposition than before. I was, however, present at the meeting when the honourable member for Flinders stated that if we were beaten on the vote in Committee on our amendment he would vote for the third reading, in order to carry out the wish of the majority of the House. I said I would dD the same thing. I may not have been as Scotch as I ought to have been, but I said it. When I spoke on the second reading of the Bill, I said that if the Government defeated our amendment in Committee, I would make one to give them a statutory majority on the third reading. Whilst not approving of the proposal put forward by the Government, but favouring that of the honourable member for Mernda, I felt that I was not justified in taking advantage of a technicality to defeat the wishes of the majority of the House. That was the reason why I said I would not oppose the third reading, if the matter was carried against us in Committee.",39
138,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There was no majority, against us in Committee in one division.",39

141,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It was not supposed to be a party question, but I had heard statements to that' effect, and I , for one, was prepared to take the consequences. I did not want to sit on a bed of roses, or to get down on the easy side of the fence. I fought all I could for the amendment of the honourable member for Mernda, and I compliment him now on the speech he has made. I believe he is right, and I was quite with him, but I said that if a majority defeated the amendment, I would vote for the third reading, and I intend to do so.",39

167,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"As I pointed out for when the matter was under review prethe custom of calling first an honourable member on one side of the House and of then an honourable member on the other side, relates really in spirit to the side of a debate, and I ask honourable members to rean collect what had taken place in that I do not do .so, because honI am going to plead justification, on The that ground, for the 'course that I took. I have a very much higher ground to justify my action-the 'ground that it is the practice and custom in the House of Commons, and also 'in .this House, always to give the Prime Minister the call whenever he rises from his seat. As to what the Prime Minister desired fo'say I knew nothing. When I gave him the call I had no idea of what his intention was.
