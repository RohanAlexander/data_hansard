1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. J. S. Rosevear) took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. HOUR OF MEETING. BUSINESS OF THE SESSION. Motion (by Mr CHICTJSY) proposed - That the House, at its rising, adjourn to tomorrow, at 10.30 a.m.",15
2,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"Fawkner) [2.32] - This is the first intimation of this kind that the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) has given since assuming the high office which he now holds. Members of the Opposition were having regard to the duration of the present sessional period, the Prime Minister would have been able to work out a programtme which would not impose on members the same continuing burden that was found necessary in order to dispose of the major legislative proposals of the Government.",15
3,Mr BARNARD,Unknown,The Opposition has. been complaining about Parliament not sitting for sufficiently long periods. It is now getting what it was wanting.,15
4,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"If the honourable member considers that the Parliament can function as effectively as it should under present conditions, I must hasten to disagree with him. These long sittings, however necessary they may have been to enable the Government to have its major legislative proposals passed, do not enable the Parliament to work as was intended.",15
5,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,The Opposition has taken up a good deal of. the time in the discussions.,15
6,Mr MBNZTES,Unknown,"And usefully, too.",15
7,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"I am glad to be reminded by my leader that the time has been usefully employed by honourable members on the Opposition side. The programme submitted to us made necessary closft examination by the limited number of members on this side of the House of the important issues involved. Without adopting obstructive tactics the Opposition has sought to assist the House in the examination of the legislation that has been presented. It has had the satisfaction of knowing that many of the suggestions which it has raised in the course of the debates have been embodied in Government policy, as announced subsequently from the other side of the chamber. I do not raise this matter from a party point of view, and I regret that the Minister for the Navy (Mr Matin) has found it necessary to deal with it from that aspect. I am anxious, as are all other honourable members, to ensure that the Parliament shall function as a democratic institution. A great deal of time of honourable members is taken up in dealing with their correspondence, in interviewing Ministers, and in disposing of other duties relating to their constituencies, and they will not be able to spend the whole of their time in the chamber if the sittings extend from 10.30 a.m. to about 11 p.m.",15
8,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,This is really full employment.,16
9,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"If that is the brand of full employment, that the Prime Minister is offering for the post-war new era, he will need to recast his ideas about a 40-hour week. Honourable members interjecting,",16
10,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"Honourable members opposite are showing a little more spirit than usual, and that is a welcome sign. The notice-paper contains only one major item of legislation, as far as we can see at present. I understand that there will be a discussion on the issues arising from the Unitedi Nations Conference on International Organization, and possibly the Treasurer intends to introduce his budget proposals in the course of the present sittings. If that is to be done, the Parliament is not being treated fairly. It should be possible to dispose of the legislation now on the notice-paper with Parliament working on a normal number of days, and for a normal number of hours on each day, thus enabling honourable members to have a reasonable recess in order to prepare material for the forthcoming budget debate. The Government has given no indication of its future legislative programme. We merely have the curt announcement in the terms of the motion of the Prime Minister that there is to be a continuance of the abnormal practice of meeting at 10.30 a.m. on three days of a four-day sitting week. The right honourable gentleman owes it to the House to give some indication of what the Government has in mind.",16
11,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"Macquarie - Prime Minister and Treasurer) [2.36] - in reply- I thought that I was doing a good turn to some honourable members by arranging for the House to meet at 10.30 a.m. tomorrow. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt) and other honourable members were kind enough earlier in the sessional period to agree to the postponement of private members' business to a more appropriate occasion. Such an occasion will arise tomorrow. Apart from that, it is likely that, with the consent of Mr Speaker, the suspension of the sitting at the luncheon hour tomorrow will be more lengthy than is usually the case. The proposal to meet at 10.30 a.m. tomorrow was designed specifically, not to hasten the passage of legislation but rather to give to honourable members an opportunity to discuss the private motions that appear on the notice-paper, a very important one being that of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies), and, in addition, to afford an opportunity for the discussion of grievances tomorrow night. I hope that the passage of legislation will be sufficiently rapid to warrant a week's adjournment at a later stage.",16
12,Mr HOLT,Unknown,Is it intended that the budget shall be brought down during the present sessional period?,16
13,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"Yes . Other important legislation also is to 'be introduced. When it reaches the second-reading stage, the House will be given time to consider it. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA MANUFACTURIN G COMPANY.",16
14,Mr SHEEHY,WUNDERLICH TIL E,"The Wunderlich Tile Manufacturing Company in my electorate is the only company that has continued the manufacture of tiles during the war. Cherry clay is in plentiful supply. Earlier, I stressed that tiles were playing a big part in home construction in South Australia. Will the Minister for the Army guarantee that the necessary releases fromi the Army shall be made to permit the manufacture of tiles to be stepped up?",16
15,Mr FORDE,WUNDERLICH TIL E,"Applicatio n for the release of man-power by the company question should be made first to the Power Directorate. If they make a favourable recommendation, the matter will be sympathetically considered by the army authorities. I shall be pleased to investigate any cases which the honourable member may care to ibring to my notice. NA CONFERENCE. AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION : POSITION OF MKS. TENISON-WOODS.",17
16,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR," Some time ago, the Acting Minister for External Affairs indicated that when representatives to the pending conference of the International Labour Office were being appointed, consideration would given to the inclusion'in the Australian delegation of Mrs Tenison-Woods, who was precluded from attending a similar conference in the United States of America recently owing to transport difficulties. Will the Minister now state whether consideration has been given to the matter, and what decision has been reached?",17
17,Mr BEASLEY,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"The procedure in known connection with the appointment of sentatives to the conference of the Interhow national Labour Office is very well known. The employers and the workers nominate representatives, and the Comof the OpDosition ? monwealth Government also appoints delegates. On this occasion, the Government has gone further than usual, and has appointed advisers in each stance, something which was never done before, the reason being that the Governmember ment regards the International Labour Office as a very important organizaCampbell tion. I am particularly anxious that it should survive, in spite of the existence certain other bodies which are attempting to usurp its place. It has been suggested that Mrs Tenison-Woods, because of special qualifications in regard to welfare, should be an Australian delegate to the conference. It is a little difficult to know how she can be fitted in. cannot be fitted in on the employers' side unless they chose her as their reoresentacheck tive, and the same applies in the case of the trade unions. It has been suggested that the Government might add her name into the list of official appointees. Man The matter of choosing advisers outside those already selected will be decided by the Minister for Labour and National Service, and I shall ask him to consider the case of Mrs Tenison-Woods;. - THE NEW GUARD.",17
18,Mr JAMES,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"'Can the Minister for Information say whether it is a fact that Colonel Eric Campbell, the one-time leader of a revolutionary body known as the New Guard, which flourished in New South Wales twelve years ago, is now a member of the Australian Country party? Is it also a fact that Mr Gregory Forster, who is suspected of having been a member of the New Guard, is now a member of the Liberal party? If the answers to 1 be these questions are in the affirmative, what action is being taken to ensure that the New Guard is not being re-organized under cover ol* established political parties in order to make another hid for the destruction of our system of parliamentary democracy? Will the Minister make inquiries into the activities of the former leader of the New Guard, and of such persons as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Harrison), who is well to have been playing around with reprethe New Guard, and advise the House many of them are now leading lights in the parties led by the Leader of the Australian Country party and the Leader",17
19,Mr CALWELL,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"T understand that Colonel Eric Campbell, who once led in the revolutionary movement to which thp honourable member has referred, is now a of the Australian Country party. I understand that the same Colonel Eric has advanced so far in the councils of the Opposition parties that hp of has nominated for selection as the Australian 'Country iparty candidate for the division of Hume at the next federal her election. I also understand that Mr. child Forster is a member of a branch of the Liberal party, andi may even be contemplating nominating for She the Warringah seat. I do not know what action has yet been taken to keep a on the activities of the New Guard, or'whether there is any reason for believing that former members are attempting to re-organize their revolutionary movement under cover of established political parties which constitute the Opposition in this Parliament. I shall miake inquiries, because I believe that it is necessary, in these difficult days, to preserve our democracy uot only against the enemies outside, but also against the enemies inside. At a later stage I shall inform the House of the result of my investigations. All that I can say now, in conclusion, is that so many queer people are joining the political parties which constitute the Opposition in this Parliament that many honourable gentlemen opposite will not have so much reason to feel so lonely in future. HOSPITAL STAFFS.",17
20,Mr FRANCIS,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"The secretary of the Private Hospitals Association in Brisbane, Mr Trewen, stated this week that, the closing of the MCDonald Private Hospital, because of staff shortage, was "" only the start,"" and the Queensland Minister for Health, Mr Foley, said that the State Government was helpless to remedy the situation, pending action by the mailpower authorities. In view of the shortages of nursing and domestic staffs, not only in the MCDonald Private Hospital, but also in hospitals throughout Australia, including the tubercular sanatorium at Kenmore, will the Minister for Labour and National Service indicate what action the Government proposes to take in order to ensure that adequate staffs shall be provided for these essential institutions?",18
21,Mr HOLLOWAY,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"Everybod y knows that during the last two or three years, great difficulty has been experienced in obtaining nursing and domestic staffs for hospitals and asylums. The Department of Labour and National Service has been endeavouring to obtain the release from the Services of nurses and other women for this work, but volunteers do not come forward readily, because of the unsatisfactory conditions and inadequate salaries and wages. In an endeavour to make it a little easier to get staff, we have approached the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, and the hearing of the claim will commence next Monday. We hope that as the result of this case, better conditions will be provided for employees of hospitals and asylums, and that, consequently, more women will be prepared to join their staffs. AUSTRALIAN FORCES. CALL-UP OF YOUTHS-DIRECTIO N OF DISCHARGED MEN TO EMPLOYMENTRELEASE OF LONG-SERVICE PERSONNEL - TROPICA L SERVICE.",18
22,Mr CHAMBERS,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"It is generally accepted that Army recruits must receive twelve months' training before they can be used as reinforcements in operational areas, but youths are still being called up for military service on attaining the age of 18 years, and will not be utilized as front-line soldiers for at least twelve months. In view of the present satisfactory state of the war against Japan, will the Government consider the advisability of discontinuing the call-up of these youths for military service?",18
23,Mr FORDE,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"This matter received consideration recently when the Government decided that between 58,000 and 64,000 persons, not including the normal discharges due to wastage, should be discharged from the fighting services by the end of the year. The matter raised by the honourable member will be reconsidered, but I cannot give any assurance that. the present procedure will be discontinued. However, all the circumstances will be taken into consideration before a decision is made by the Government.",18
24,Mr HADLEY,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"Will the Minister for the Army make arrangements for a large contingent of front-line war veterans to be returned to Australia by ship immediately? In order that due recognition shall be accorded to these battle-scarred warriors, will he ensure that, on their arrival, they shall march through the streets of the first capital city they reach ?",18
25,Mr FORDE,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"I have nothing further to add to what I said yesterday, namely, that a substantial batch of war veterans, with at least five years' .service, will be discharged' and that the men will arrive in Australia within the next fortnight. Approximately 300 of them will come from the New Guinea area and about 200 from the Borneo area. The kind of welcome that will be extended to them on their return, is being considered, and suitable action will be taken.",18
26,Mr ABBOTT,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"In view of the fact that the Government's plan, as announced on the 1st June, for all members of the Army and Air Force, with operational service overseas, who have had five years' war service to be given the option of discharge, will the Prime Minister submit to Cabinet a proposal to eliminate the stipulation subsequently imposed that, in order to qualify for release, servicemen must have had two years' operational service overseas?",19
27,Mr CHIFLEY,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"All of these qualifications will be reviewed in the light of changing conditions. In dealing with this matter, the Cabinet and the Advisory War Council considered that the position had been fully covered for the time being by the decision announced on the 1st June. However, as I have said previously, I hope that further releases can be made. The circumstances which the honourable member has mentioned will be considered as conditions vary from time to time.",19
28,Mr GUY,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"During the absence abroad of the Minister for the Army, I placed before the Minister acting on his behalf the case of men who had seen service in tropical areas, and had returned to Tasmania. Some who were placed in B class are now under draft to leave Tasmania again, whereas there are in Tasmania A class men who have never left that State. I ask the Minister whether it is reasonable that B class men, who have seen service in the tropics, should be sent away again while A class men, who have never left Australia, should be allowed to remain here?",19
29,Mr FORDE,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,If the honourable member will give me some further particulars,19
30,Mr GTJT,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"I have already sent' the names, numbers, &c, to the department.",19
31,Mr FORDE,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"I shall call for the papers, and give the honourable member's representations sympathetic consideration. It does seem to me that if men have been in forward areas, and are now B class, they should not be sent to forward areas again, but others should take their places. I shall have the matter examined.",19
32,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR," Several ministerial announcements have been made recently controverting the allegation that discharged servicemen are being directed by man-power to certain positions. I hold in my hand, a paper indicating that two men discharged from the Air Force, who had previously held positions with private trading banks, have been asked to report to Compton Parkinsons, in Sydney, for employment. I ask whether this indicates a change of policy on the part of the authorities.",19
33,Mr HOLLOWAY,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"No , there has been no change of policy, although policy is at present in a state of transition because of the decision to release large numbers from the Army and the Air Force. If there is any dispute, it is in relation to air force trainees. But the answer I gave last week to a question on this subject was correct, namely, that all men who have been released-excep t those released on occupational grounds, to go to special jobs in which cases they will be retained in the work for which they were released-wil l be permitted, if they choose, to return to their former occupations. If occupational releases refuse to do the work for which they were released they may be returned to the Army. All other persons discharged from the forces will have the right to be reinstated in their former occupations. In some instances their reinstatementwill be deferred because of the need for their engaging in more important work than what they were doing before their enlistment. They will be asked to do this more important work, and I understand that in many instances where men have been so requested they have agreed, recognizing that they will be allowed to go back to their own jobs later. As I have said, the only point not definitely settled, and it will be settled next week, is that relating to young Air Force trainees. They may be required to undertake essential work after discharge. It was suggested that if they did not engage in essential work they should be sent back to the Army, but decision on the point has been deferred. The War Commitments Committee will deal with it in a few days time, and in the meantime a definite instruction has been given that they shall not be handed over to the Army by the man-power authorities after discharge. Sir FREDERICK. STEWABT - In one case I have in mind, the man graduated in Canada and has taken a refresher course since his return to Australia.",19
34,Mr HOLLOWAY,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"If he has been discharged, and was not a trainee at the time of his discharge, he has a right to go back to his old job. He may be asked to do more essential work, but if he refuses he will not, so far as I know now, be directed against his will. FODDER. SUPPLIES OF WHEAT FOB (SOUTH AUSTRALIA.",20
35,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"Has the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction received either directly or through the Prime Minister a telegram from the Premier of South Australia protesting against the decision of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture to reduce by one half the quantity of wheat for stock and poultry feed in that State from the end of this month, although the supply of wheat for feed in Victoria will be doubled? Has the protest been considered, and will the Premier be given a reply before any other authority in South Australia is informed of the Government's decision ? Also, will South Australian members of this House be advised of whether or not the Government has any views on this subject?",20
36,Mr DEDMAN,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"I have not received, either direct or through the Prime-Minister, any communication whatever from the Premier of South Australia. That being the case, answers to the other questions do not arise. THE WAR. SURRENDER TERMS FOR JAPAN-VP-DA Y CELEBRATIONS.",20
37,Mr SPENDER,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"What seem to be inspired comments are appearing in American and British newspapers to the effect that more lenient terms than unconditional surrender will be extended to Japan in the event of its Government suing for peace. Do these statements in any way reflect the policy of this Government, and, if not, can the Prime Minister say anything to the country in respect of this matter, which is of vital importance to our future ?",20
38,Mr CHIFLEY,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"There has been no change of the Commonwealth Government's attitude on the general understanding that unconditional surrender terms would be imposed upon Japan. I have received no information on the matter, even of the most secret character, from those who are at present concerned with negotiations abroad, and I am not aware of any change of policy.",20
39,Mr SHEEHAN,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"In today's Sydney newspapers it is suggested that peace feelers have been sent out by the United States of America to Japan. It is stated on good authority that the Republican Whip has asked President Truman to stop the Pacific slaughter. Can the Prime Minister say whether, if the war should come to an end suddenly, the Government has plans for the celebration of VP-Day?",20
40,Mr CHIFLEY,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"Certain proposals have been made in this regard, but I am unable to inform the honourable member what decisions have been reached. I understand that some of the States have suggestions to make, and I have no doubt that the matter will be discussed at the forthcoming Premiers Conference so that there may be uniformity throughout Australia in regard to whatever observance of victory is decided upon. TIMBE R SUPPLIES.",20
41,Mr FULLER,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"In view of the urgent need to secure increased timber supplies from Australian sources for housing and other urgent projects, will the Minister for Works and Housing ascertain the prospects of idle timber mills throughout the Commonwealth resuming operations?",20
42,Mr LAZZARINI,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"In reviewing the general housing situation and the supplies of materials for housing, the Government realizes, as does everybody else, that timber is vitally necessary for a construction programme. The timber position is being constantly examined with a view to making man-Dower available to expedite supplies from timber mills and other sources. VEGETABLE SEEDS. PEAS.",20
43,Mr MOUNTJOY,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"Is the Minister representing the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture aware that there is a shortage of pea-seed in Western Australia and that merchants in that State attribute the shortage to the lack of activity by the Vegetable Seeds Committee? Is it a fact that New Zealand has ample supplies of pea-seed, and, if so, will the Min- Greenfeast ister take action to have supplies imported from that dominion?",21
44,Mr DEDMAN,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"by leave- I understand that the honourable member has made inquiries from the department on this matter, and the department has advised me in detail of the vegetable-seed position in Western Australia. The Vegetable Seeds Committee placed orders in New Zealand in June, 1944, for delivery from the 1944-45 crop. New Zealand experienced' a disastrous year because' of floods, one seed merchant advising that he had thrown out many thousands of sacks. He also advises that he can make only a 50 per cent, delivery of peas of the Greenfeast variety. The Vegetable Seeds Committee has an agent in New Zealand who is constantly making inquiries for seed, and any suitable lines are purchased and shipped as soon as shipping is available. The committee is prepared to purchase any satisfactory line that is offering. If West Australian firms will advise as to any source of supply the possibilities will be investigated immediately. Lasit year the committee arranged for a substantial production in Australia, and if this had not been done the position would have been hopeless. The committee has allocated the available """"d to seed merchants on a pro rata basis, there being a small allocation for Western Australia which has been held in Sydney for some time on account of shipping difficulties. It is unlikely will be sufficient Greenfeast or Massey pea seed to meet all demands before the next harvest. There is, however, seed of special canning varieties which has been reserved for the services, buit sufficient this can be released to meet all civilian requirements. The seed produced in Australia has proved to be of excellent quality, and there is no doubt that in the future we can produce all pea seed required. To give the honourable member an idea of the increase of production^ I direct - attention to the following figures:Variety. Pre-war. 1M4-M Season. Bushels. Bushels. Canners Perfection . 500 142,000 Less than 65,000 48,000 Massey Less than 62,000 10,000 Less than 75,000 200,000 NA MANUFACTURE. ONE - M AN BUSINESSES.",21
45,Mr HUGHES,RESTRICTIONS ON,"Will the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction state what restrictions, if any, are imposed on one man businesses in the manufacture of goods for sale?",21
46,Mr DEDMAN,RESTRICTIONS ON,"Unti l recently if these manufacturers were engaged in production during a certain base period, they did not require permits 'at all, unless, of course, they desired to produce certain non-essential goods, the production of which was prohibited during war-time. Recently, however, an amendment was made, whereby it is now unnecessary for these manufacturers to obtain a permit from my department, provided they have a clearance from the mian-power authorities stating that they are not required for any other essential work. HOUSING.",21
47,Mr CONELAN,RESTRICTIONS ON,"In view of the Government's extensive housing programme, will the Prime Minister take steps to have an investigation made of the increased cost of building, notwithstanding that that there wages have been pegged ?",21
48,Mr CHIFLEY,RESTRICTIONS ON,"That matter has caused much concern to the Government. As recently as this week I examined the of cost of building houses in the various States. In New South Wales, the cost appears to me to be unusually high, having regard to war-time conditions. I can assure the honourable member that the costs are being examined from all aspects, in order to discover whether anything can be done to assist in having houses provided at lower prices than seem to possible at present.",21
49,Mr SPENDER,RESTRICTIONS ON,Has not the output for each man employed diminished very introduce much?,22
50,Mr OHBTLEY,RESTRICTIONS ON,"I cannot say that that that is true. It has to be remembered that many of the men engaged in inmorrow. dustry at present are older than the majority of those formerly employed. In pre-war days there was a considerable proportion, if not a majority, of young men in industry. Where there is a siderable number of older men engaged in any work, or in any form of producan tion, we naturally do not get as much work done as formerly. SAXES TAX. SECOND-HAND MACHINERY. Mr BERNARD CORSER,-Will the the Treasurer state whether the Government, through the Directorate of Machine Tools and Gauges, is demanding sales tax at rate of 12$ per cent, on machines which, in some instances, have been in operation for more than three years? If so, it not a fact that sales tax is not normally imposed in respect »f second-hand goods? towns? Will the right honourable gentleman inform the House of the reason for demanding sales tax from prospective purchasers many of whom, for years, have been rendering valuable service to the nation in its war effort? Why is the tax collected in these cases, and will the vernment have the law amended ?",22
51,Mr CHIFLEY,RESTRICTIONS ON,"I regret that I cantion not supply offhand to the honourable memstruction, ber all of the details for which he asks. The Commissioner of Taxation is no doubt administering the law as passed by this Parliament. I shall have inquiries made into the points raised the honourable member, and shall endeclined, deavour to furnish a complete answer. FREMANTLE BY-ELECTION ",22
52,Mr SMITH,RESTRICTIONS ON,"Yesterday I asked the Prime Minister a 'question regarding votes for servicemen at the Fremantle by-election, and he said that he might be in a position to make a statement the matter today. Is he now prepared to do so?",22
53,Mr CHIFLEY,RESTRICTIONS ON,A decision has been be reached in the matter. The Minister for the Interior has given notice today of his intention to ask for leave to-iuorrow to a bill dealing with the matter raised by the honourable member. 1 hope it will be possible to let the House know the contents of the measure toNA VEHICLES.,22
54,Mr ANTHONY,MANUFACTURE OF MOTOR,"A statement has conbeen published in the press that the Nuffield organization is unable to accept invitation from the Government to establish its new works for the manufacture of motor cars at Orange, Bathurst, or any other country centre, owing to transport costs. With a view to effecting a decentralization of industry, will the Prime Minister state whether Government has considered offsetting the disadvantages with regard to transport which country centres present, by the providing a subsidy towards transport costs? Will the Government thoroughly examine the whole matter in order that is in the post-war era some of the post-war industries may be established in country",22
55,Mr CHIFLEY,MANUFACTURE OF MOTOR,"The suggestion of the honourable member that there should be decentralization of industry away from the big cities, is a very important one, which has been adopted in greater or les? Godegree as a matter of policy by different governments. The Secondary Industries Commission, which is under the jurisdicof the Minister for Post-war Reconhas had many discussions with various manufacturers, with the object of inducing them to engage in manufacturing operations in country munitions by establishments at which production has instead of confining their operations to the capital cities. Freight costs in relation to the transport of raw mate-rial to the works and the marketing of the manufactured article have been one of the greatest obstacles to the establishment of manufacturing industries in country districts. The Government, throusrh the Secondary Industries Comon mission and other channels, has been endeavouring to negotiate some concessions, or a re-arrangement designed to assist the decentralization of industries by their establishment in country districts. I shall ask the Minister for Postwar Reconstruction to give to the honourable member further details of the difficulties that have been encountered and the discussions that have taken place. BLIND WORKERS. Mr MORGAN.^-The . Minister for Post-war Reconstruction doubtless is aware that many blind workers engaged in war industries, who have performed splendid service in relation to the war effort, have been notified that their services are likely to be dispensed with account of retrenchment in various war factories. In view of the Government's policy of full employment, and as measure of repayment to these unforbroadcasting tunate members of the community, will the,Minister give special consideration their being placed in reproductive work? If the Commonwealth cannot do so, will he take the matter up with the State authorities?",22
56,Mr DEDMAN,MANUFACTURE OF MOTOR,"Disable d persons, including those who are blind, have dered excellent service to the community during the war, by assisting to increase production in munitions establishments. It is regretted that, as retrenchment occursi» government factories, it is not possible to retain the services of all those who are in that class. I have given very careful attention to this matter. certain countries, all firms engaged industries spread over a wide variety production must employ a given perspeeches, centage of disabled persons, the perbudget. centage being altered from time to time so as to ensure that the total number employed will be equal to the total numbroadcast ber seeking employment. Unfortunately, constitutional limitations prevent the Commonwealth Government from passing a similar law. It could, of course, pass law relating to the employment of persons who have been disabled in rendering vice to the Commonwealth. Such a proemotions of the people. vision is embodied in the Re-establishment and Emnlovment Act passed recently by this Parliament. It is intended to compile a register of disabled persons, and to make a regulation imposing unon all employers the obligation to employ given percentage of such .persons. I cannot see, at the moment, how that principle could be extended to include other than persons who have been disabled in the service of the Commonwealth. The remaining field must be covered by State action. I shall bring the matter to the notice of the States, with a view to determining whether they and the Commonwealth conjointly, can make provision for this very deserving section of the community. PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES. BROADCASTING.",23
57,Mr HOLT,MANUFACTURE OF MOTOR,"I ask the Prime Minison ter whether the recent installation of wireless apparatus in this chamber indicates an early intention to broadcast the a debates of this House? If so, is the to he experimental or permanent? Has the Government received to any information from New Zealand in response to the inquiries which it promised to make as to the experience of that Dominion in the broadcasting of parliamentary debates ?",23
58,Mr CHIFLEY,MANUFACTURE OF MOTOR,"In consequence of rencomplaints, particularly by members of the press, of inability to hear questions that were asked and* answers that were given in this House, Mr Speaker kindly consented to a small experiment being made to discover whether the acoustics of of the chamber might be improved by the installation of amplifiers. So far, the In matter has not proceeded beyond that in point. I have heen requested to agree of to the broadcasting of important such as those delivered on the I confess that my reaction has been that such speeches would be rather dry matter to try out on the puiblic in a of parliamentary debates. Mr. Speaker has complete jurisdiction, and I am su'bject to his direction. I am in favour of giving the proposal a trial a later, when speeches are being made on an interesting subject. A budget speech seris not likely to stir very deeply the MR. FRANK PACKER.",23
59,Mr CONELAN,MANUFACTURE OF MOTOR,"I ask the Minister for Information whether Mr Frank Packer, managing director of Australian a Consolidated Press, is contemplating a visit abroad. If so, will he make the visit as a lieutenant in the Australian Military Forces, or as an executive of Australian Consolidated Press? If the latter, has he been discharged from the Australian Military Forces? If so, on what date did the discharge take effect?",23
60,Mr CALWELL,MANUFACTURE OF MOTOR,"It is rumoured that Mr Frank Packer is contemplating a visit abroad. I am not in a position to say at the moment whether he will make the visit as a lieutenant in the Australian Military Forces, or as the managing director of Australian Consolidated Press. I shall consult the Minister for the Army, with a view to - being enabled to supply answers to the honourable member's two questions-(1 ) Whether Mr. Packer is going abroad as a lieutenant in the Australian Military Forces; and (2) whether he has been discharged from those forces.",24
61,Mr CONELAN,MANUFACTURE OF MOTOR,Bette r make it three and ask whether he is going as batman 1 to the honourable member for Parkes (Mr. Haylen).,24
62,Mr CALWELL,MANUFACTURE OF MOTOR,"I shall make it three and ask for the reason for his discharge from the Army, if he has been discharged.

MISS GRACIE FIELDS. VISI T TO CANBERRA. Mr WILSON"" - Can the Prime Minister say whether it is a fact that we are to be favoured in Canberra tomorrow by a visit from a popular entertainer in the person of Miss Gracie Fields? Has the Government arranged to tender a luncheon to her? If so, will the Prime Minister explore the possibility of broadening the scope of the arrangements so that members of Parliament and others may have an opportunity to meet this lady?",24
63,Mr CHIFLEY,MANUFACTURE OF MOTOR,"The Minister for it Air (Mr Drakeford) is in charge of transport arrangements for Miss Gracie Fields, who, I understand, is able spend only two or three hours in Cantions berra. It was felt that, in view of work which Miss Fields has been doin^ in entertaining the troops over a long period, it would be a gracious gesture on the part of the Government to entertain her at luncheon. It is not possible t< arrange a full parliamentary luncheon for that purpose; accordingly, she will lunch with members of the Government and. with the permission of Mr Speaker, tin suspension of the sitting of the House will be extended so that honourable members may have an opportunity to metMiss Fields in the lounge. NA COMMISSION. PRIORITY FOB EX-SERVICEMEN.",24
64,Mr SPENDER,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"I have been informed that in the United States of America, certain principles have been laid down under which ex-servicemen ma\ obtain, by an overriding priority, surplus military equipment which they require for their rehabilitation. Will the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Shipping examine those principles with a view to giving to Australian ex-servicemen, particularly those with overseas service, an overriding priority to obtain surplus Army motor trucks and other items that they may require on their return to civilian life?",24
65,Mr BEASLEY,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"So far, no plan of that character has been evolved in Australia. The procedure which we have followed is to make available surplus war materials to government and semi-government instrumentalities. Usually 'motor trucks are allotted to primary producers and other persons engaged in high priority production. The honourable member's suggestion is worthy of consideration, and I shall bring it to the notice of the Minister for Supply and Shipping. I am disposed strongly to recommend it? adoption. COAL-MINING INDUSTRY.",24
66,Mr JAMES,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Will the Minister for Labour and National Service say whether is a fact that the coal-mining industry is short of labour, principally because miners retire on a pension on attaining to the age of 60 years? Have regulabeen issued directing departmental the officers not to permit the employment underground of any person who has not had mining experience? I point out that youths, principally, are required for work in the mines, and at one particular pit, where stoppages have been frequent, 40 more employees are urgently needed. ""Will the Minister see that these regulations are repealed, so that youths may .be allowed to work in coal-mines?",24
67,Mr HOLLOWAY,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"If , in the early stages of the war, the Australian Coal and Shale Employees Federation had insisted on miners retiring on attaining the age of 60 years, the problem of maintaining production would have been greatly accentuated. However, the federation did not compel them to retire, although some of them may have done so. Because of the nature of the work, the man-power authorities have not directed persons to employment in coal mines. The honourable member knows that it would be dangerous to direct unskilled or inexperienced men to work underground. If the honourable member has in mind some labour that could be safely employed in the pits, I shall be glad to discuss it with representatives of the federation and himself. PRISONERS OF WAR.",25

Unless this suggestion is adopted, pritances soners of war will he at an advantage the labour market compared with Auswho tralians, including discharged service personnel.",25
69,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"As has been stated previously in this House, prisoners of war are employed under the terms of an international agreement. They receive only a percentage of the money payable by ithe employer for their services. Mr Holloway About 7^d a day. Mr .CHIFLEY - The difference between the amount that they receive, and the amount paid by the employer for the use of their labour, is paid, not to the Commonwealth Government, but. to the British Treasury. I do not remember having received representations from the Queensland United Council of ex-Servicemen's Association, but strong representations had been made by the Australian Workers Union that prisoners of war should .be paid award rates. Speaking from memory, I believe that the rate payable by the employer was formerly £1 a week, with keep, and was increased to £2 a week and keep. The House should clearly understand that the Commonwealth Treasury receives no benefit from these payments. I shall examine the honourable gentleman's request, and, if possible, obtain for him a more detailed reply. NA BILL 1945. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from the 24th July (vide page 4466), on motion by Mr. LAZZARINITliat the bill be now read a second time.",25
70,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"Barker) night, I dealt at some length, but not completely, with the position in which residents of the Northern . Territory are placed by the various legal tangles contained in this short measure. ' I pointed out that section 29 of the Lands of Acquisition Act will be suspended by clause 4 of the bill, and I referred to the of legal practitioners in the Northern Territory, and to the great disthat people must travel from outon back places to Darwin. Many people, are interested in this acquisition, are now dispersed throughout the Commonwealth, and if this bill is not amended, they will be obliged to take action in various courts throughout the country. Many of them have lived on their capital during the last three or four years, and are not financially in a position to institute legal proceedings at any time and in any place against the Commonwealth Government. Therefore, a tribunal should be established to deal with diswas agreements, if the Commonwealth Goany vernment and the freeholder are not able to arrive at a satisfactory settlement regarding the price of the land to be acquired. The position would not be so bad if it were not complicated by clause 2, which readsIn this Act"" the Act"" means the Lands Acquisition Ordinance 1906-1936, as applied Lands Acquisition Ordinance 1926 of the Territory, subject to any unimproved modifications of that Act in its cation to the Territory made by Ordinance or by any other Ordinance of the Territory, whether made or after the commencement of this by Act. Ln no circumstances can the Government claim to have a moral right to alter law in regard to acquisition after passage of this legislation. This sort thing cannot be tolerated. As the orable member for Bendigo (Mr Bankin) would probably say, even Ned: Kelly would not do it . He, at least, would stand by the conditions which on the day of acquisition. This point is of great importance to everybody conalready cerned in this unfortunate acquisition land. In justification of what I said yesterday, I quote fro m section 6 of the .Northern Territory Lands Acquisition Ordinance 1911Any application under section thirty-eight of the Act may be made to the High Court, or to the Supreme Court of the Territory, to any Court of the Territory in which action for compensation may be instituted in pursuance of this Ordinance and the Act. This indicates clearly that the CommonFund wealth Government, whilst taking away fro m the freeholder the safeguard which is contained in section 29 of the Lands Acquisition Act, still intends to impose upon him the obligation to appeal to Supreme Court of the Territory or the High Court of Australia, as specified i the ordinance. I have some observations to make about valuations in Darwin, because the statements made by the Minister in second-reading speech do not make sense when considered in conjunction with statements contained in official docuI ments supplied to the House. We truesense, know from the official documents that the rating in Darwin in 1939 9d. in the £ 1 . There has not been revaluation of any consequence since that time, if there has been any revaluation at all. The Minister said that the unimproved value of land in Darwin was £150,000, according to his estimate, and that the value of the improvements was £500,000, making a total of £650,000. The total rating on Darwin is shown by by the the - Mclnnes Report to be only £790. If 1911the rate was levied on the basis of the value, the unimproved appliassessment on Darwin at that time must that have been only £47,533. If the basis was before the improved value, which was stated the Minister to be £650,000, the assessment would be much less than £47,000. I do not know how the Minister can balance his figures the with those contained in the Mclnnes the Report. Either his figures are hopeof lessly wrong and the House has been honmisinformed - quite accidentally, no doubt-o r this job should cost much less than the estimate given by the Minister. The honourable gentleman said, in his operated second-reading speechAgainst this sum the Commonwealth is committed to an expenditure of about of £200,000 for damage by enemy action, fire, demolitions, occupation, &c. Thus it would appear that the net cost to the Commonwealth of the acquisition may not exceed £500,000. That is a very bad misstatement of the position. The cost of damage by enemy action, fire, demolition, occupation, & c , or requires examination. I have tried to an ascertain from the Minister for the Interior whether the Government proposes to use the War Damage Insurance to pay for the damage in Darwin and in other places which was not caused by enemy action. The statement made by the Minister for Works and Housing in his second-reading speech clearly enthe visages that compensation for damage not caused by enemy action will be paid n from that fund, and he estimates that the cost to the Commonwealth will be £200,000. If the money is to be drawn from the insurance fund , the cost to the his Commonwealth will be nothing. The money will be paid out of funds contributed by every landholder in Australia. t is not Commonwealth revenue in the but was specially subscribed by landholders for a specific purpose. The Government has no right, as far as I know, to use it for the acquisition of land. Parliament should have a voice in this matter before any firm decision is reached. Another interesting, statement by the Minister relating to the actual extent of damage in Darwin was as follows:In the town of Darwin proper 491 sections are held under freehold tenure, and 74 sections under leasehold tenure. Of these, 219 sections were unimproved at the 19th February, 1942, the date of the Japanese air raid on Darwin, and 214 sections had buildings standing on them at the 22nd April, 1944, indicating that 132 sections which were improved at the 19th February, 1942, carried no improvements at the 22nd April, 1944. [ do not believe that the Minister will' claim that the disappearance of buildings from 132 sections was due entirely to Japanese action, although that is. what he stated, in effect, in the passage which F have just quoted. He went on to sayIn the area suburban to Darwin Go sections are held under freehold tenure, and 121 sections under leasehold tenure. Of these, 97 sections were unimproved at the 19th February, 1942, and 59 sections had buildings standing on them at the 22nd April, 1944, indicating that 30 sections which were improved at the Iflbh February, 1942, carried no improvements at the 22nd April, 1944. One of the 'figures stated in that paragraph must be wrong because the totals do not agree-5 9 and 30 do not add up to 97. However, it seems that at least 162 buildings have disappeared from that area. The Minister spoke of compensation totalling about £200,000 for damage by enemy action, fire, demolitions, occupation, Arc. The amount arrived at by dividing £200,000 by 162 represents a substantial average amount of compensation for. a building. I do not claim that this figure is wrong, but, if it was right, the amount of .damage done per building in Darwin was much greater than Parliament has hitherto been led to believe.",25
71,Mr RANKIN,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,It is like the number killed in Darwin. We were told that there were only 19 deaths.,27
72,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"That is so. In any case, those figures do not add up correctly. I know, Mr Speaker, that you would not permit a general discussion on the future town management of Darwin, because that issue does not arise under the bill. Therefore, I shall refer to other matters, including amendments which ought to be made to the bill. I have already given notice of my intention to move that the bill be postponed until after the visit to Darwin of the two ministers concerned. That is not an unreasonable request. If it be rejected, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis) will, I understand, move that the bill the referred to the Public Works Committee. The Government, on its own showing, proposes to expend this large sum without authority, because the contemplated expenditure is eight times greater than the amount which may be expended on a public work without reference to the Public Works Committee. There is no point in the Government acquiring this freehold property in Darwin unless it intends to embark on a large programme of expenditure. If the cost of acquiring the land will be £650,000, that amount is 26 times greater than the sum specified in the Public Works Committee Act, and therefore the matter should be referred to the committee before the land-owners are dispossessed. I should like a definition in the bill as to the date of the proposed acquisition. The operation of section 29 of the Lands Acquisition Act is to be suspended, and the interests of the land-holders will not be safeguarded. After all, these men have certain property rights. I believe in the rights of private property, and I favour the freehold tenure of land. I do not believe in the leasehold system, except under limited conditions. A person who owns the freehold of his land will usually take a much greater interest in his property than if it is held under lease which gives him only tenant rights. Therefore, I oppose the leasehold system, particularly as applied to town areas. If the Minister for Works and Housing (Mr. Lazzarini) meant what he seems to have of said about unearned increment in his second-reading speech, he must have contemplated the application to Darwin of the system of rating on unimproved land values. If he means that, why did he not say so? My fourth request is that a special committee should be set up so that persons dispossessed of their land might be compensated. The unfortunate' land-owners may reside in any of the six States, and certainly the majority of them would be resident outside the Northern Territory. should be given an opportunity to present their case to a special tribunal, without being obligated, to appeal to the Supreme Court or some other legal body. [Extension of time granted.] The general problem of the replanning of Darwin was referred to the predecessor of the Minister for the Interior by the Northern Territory Development League, in a two-page letter dated the 29th May. Every member of this Parliament has received a copy of that letter, and its contents should be considered before the Government embarks upon this lavish scheme. I have received a letter from a former Public Servant in the territory, who has lived there until recently and knows the territory from one end to the other. In the course of his letter he state*The re-planning of Darwin-presumabl y a very expensive process, just as Canberra's beginning was-is going to increase the already heavy burden being borne by the taxpayer, and it is not right that the' development of the hinterland should automatically bring about - the development of ports and capital. But just at present the tax-payer's voice is lost by the clamour of the tax-gatherers and the tax-eaters. If the Minister proposes to expend £7,000,000 on a new township at Darwin, the tax-eater will certainly come into the "" show"". I am bound to have these apprehensions, because no Minister has clarified the position. If this vast expenditure is to be incurred, I am reminded of a man who builds for himself a lavish dining-room and allows native servants to cook his meals in a camp oven on the verandah. The usual practice in a newly developed area is to live under primitive conditions for a while, but in this instance it seems that the Government proposes to reverse the normal procedure. Apparently irrigation works, roads, railways and airways are to take second place to the development of Darwin. I desire a reply to the following seven points:-(1 ) I submit that the bill should follow and not precede an investigation, by the Public Works Committee. (2) Why cannot the Minister postpone this measure until he and the Minister forPost-war Reconstruction have visited thej^ Territory? (3) Why should not the date>?Government? of acquisition of the land be clearly They stated in the bill? (4) Why not'appoint a special tribunal, so that peaceful settlement of claims by land-owners may be reached? (5) The Government should state whether all land is to be resumed, and not only the freehold property. I have already referred to the freehold land situated in the town of Darwin and the suburban areas, but no statement was made in the Minister's second-reading speech as to whether other landholders will remain in possession of their properties or not. This bill deals only with freehold land. (6) The Government should offer freeholders the first chance of a lease under the new system in the event of the passage of this measure. (7) All reports regarding the future of Darwin should be tabled in this House. Never has a bill been brought before us involving so much money and with so little information proffered to Parliament. This is a proposal of a very radical kind. I have before me the Mclnnes report of 1937, and the report of the Payne Commission which was presented in 1939. The latter report, read in conjunction with parts of the Mclnnes report, shows that the Administration had passed certain ordinances to deal with the management of Darwin, but had not appointed the officers for which the ordinances provided. An explanation with regard to this matter should be furnished by the present Minister for the Interior. In this bill the Government appears to be putting the cart before the horse. We should have a fairly clear idea of the proposals for the development of the Northern Territory before we consider this measure. I do not know what the Government's intentions may be with regard to airways. In the Post-war period, certain naval, military, and air force installations will be required at Darwin, but, although these matters are of paramount importance, no indication is given in this bill of whether they have been considered. The Navy, the Army, and the Air Force should have as much of this land as may be required for the proper carrying out of the functions with which they will be entrusted in future. Has this matter been considered by the Certain committees have met and considered a number of matters in connection with the future of Darwin, but the Government has not paid the Parliament the courtesy of telling it what those committees are, when they sat, or what they reported. This is a most extraordinary way for the Government to act in depriving landholders in Darwin of their freehold rights, although they have been developing their properties over a long period of years. In many instances they have developed them despite many obstacles put in their way through the haphazard administration of the Northern Territory. This is referred to in rather cutting terms in both the Payne and the Mclnnes reports. I conclude by moving;That all words after "" That"" be left out, with a view to insert in. lieu thereof the following words:-""the second reading of the bill be deferred until the Minister for the Interior and the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction have accepted the invitation of the Northern Territory Development League to visit Darwin and hear the views of residents of the Northern Territory on this ibill"".",27
73,Mr RANKIN,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,I formally second the motion.,29
74,Mr HAYLEN,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"Parkes) [3.57] There are two approaches to the matter now before the House. It may be discussed from the point of view of a real estate ' agents' conference, or in its national aspect. The Government has attempted to create a national atmosphere in connection with the acquisition of land in Darwin, because this is a - Commonwealth responsibility. iSince the establishment of the National Capital in Canberra, land in the Australian Capital Territory has been held under the leasehold system. Various governments have been in office during that period, and not one of them has found any serious fault with the prevailing system of land tenure. Darwin is also in Commonwealth territory, and, by bringing the system of land tenure in the Northern Territory into line with that of Canberra, the Government has adopted a logical and sound policy. There are many other reasons why we should consider the future of Darwin from an Australian point of view. Prior to the war, persons travelling on the overseas air route noticed clean and well-kept cities in the Netherlands East Indies, but, when they arrived at Australia's "" front door "", they were confronted with something which looked like the "" dry r o t "" scene in White Cargo. Much work has been done with Commonwealth money in Darwin during the war, and the Government is well justified in carrying on where the soldier is likely to leave off. A great deal of money has been poured into the Northern Territory for the purpose of cleaningup Darwin and adjacent areas. When the troops first went there, malaria and dengue fever were prevalent. When I visited Darwin some time ago I was told by medical officers that splendid work had been done by the hygiene squads and* the malaria control units of the Army. Only three cases of dengue fever had occurred in the preceding six months, and these had been flown there from operational areas. As soon as malaria broke out, tie malaria squads cleaned up the breeding grounds. Planting operations in Darwin have helped to beautify th« town, which now presents an attractive appearance. This bill is the first instalment of a plan to polish up and make tidy the front door of Australia, demonstrating to the world that towns need not have a decayed' appearance merely because they are in the tropics. Mr D. H . Lawrence, a very shrewd and wise observer, wrote a book in which he said that our seaside towns, particularly the northern ports, look like odd bits of furniture that had fallen off the pantechnicon of civilization. Darwin, unfortunately, deserves to the limit the strictures that he passed, on the ugliness of our towns. Since this job has to be tackled, it can be made a great post-war project. Logically, the first task is to place land tenure on a satisfactory basis. By all acknowledgments, leasehold is the correct tenure for Darwin. [ disagree with the statement of the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) that this bill begins at the wrong end; that we should first say what we are going to do. In all the classic acquisitions of history, the first step has been to obtain possession of the land, and then to do something with it.",29
75,Mr FRANCIS,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,The formulation of » plan should precede the acquisition of the land.,29
76,Mr HAYLEN,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"I disagree with the honourable member. Having obtained possession of the land, the planning will he quite easy; in fact, it will follow almost automatically when the system of leasehold tenure has been applied. Darwin has been made more healthy by reason of its occupation by the troops, who have done a tremendous amount of cleaning up and have been the means of a much greater proportion of the war expenditure being diverted to the Northern Territory than would have been the case otherwise. It is logical for the Government to say now that, having progressed to such a stage, it intends to make of Darwin the city we have dreamt of making it, and a credit to the Commonwealth. Obviously, the development of air traffic after the war will make extremely important the consideration of the part that Darwin is likely to play in the future. This part will also be affected by possible future military operations. If considerable expenditure is to be incurred in connection with the development of the Northern Territory, it would be absurd if steps were not taken to ensure the progress of Darwin. The first step to be taken is the acquisition of the land in the town area. The planning will follow. The story of two soldiers who have lived in Darwin for four years has been related in Salt, the education magazine of the services. These men have planned a post-war set-up for the town on the most modern lines, with cool buildings, treelined boulevardes, and all other amenities, including the rehabilitation of the whole area, as well as the development of waterways, particularly the beaches. Their scheme, which has been exhaustively discussed in Salt, contains much matter which honourable members who are interested would do well to read. There is a definite desire on the part of the residents of the southern portion of the continent that the Northern Territory shall progress. Any Australian who has been abroad and has returned to this country by air must be animated by the desire to have at Australia's front door, as we are fond of describing Darwin, a greater spirit of progress and cleanliness than is evidenced by a staggered line of joss houses, with a tired dog leaning against a pub wall. Entering Australia after having seen the spick and span Dutch aerodromes and cities, an Australian who is proud of his country, finds that vision of Darwin like a "" slap on the face"". The Government is acting expeditiously, and is doing the right thing by making leasehold tenure in the Northern Territory a first requirement, proceeding therefrom to an organized plan, by means of which we shall have in the north the city we have dreamed about for so long hut have not previously bothered to implement. I am proud of the fact that the first task of the new Minister for the Interior (Mr Johnson) will be to do something for the Northern Territory, particularly Darwin. We could not leave the matter in any better Australian hands than his. He will ensure that the task will be performed well and truly.",30
77,Mr FRANCIS,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"Moreton) [4.5] - This bill, and the second-reading speech of the Minister, are notable not for the information they have given to the House but for what has been withheld. The Minister could not have givon less information, had he tried. The Parliament should not be treated in such a way. There are no details of future proposals, but merely a statement about the purchase of certain land. If land is to be purchased, the House should be given the reason. The Government should not purchase land merely for the sake of doing so. A clear' indication should be given of what the Government intends to do with the land that is to be acquired. The Minister merely saidThis short measure is designed to authorise the acquisition by the Commonwealth of freehold land in the town of Darwin and its environs. A full description of the area affected is contained in the schedule to the bill. It is proposed to acquire the land by either agreement or compulsory process, . . . The House should be fully informed of all the Government's proposals, in order that it may satisfy itself that the Government is justified in purchasing this land. I protest at the manner in which the affairs of the Parliament are being conducted. Probably, the Government, will refuse to accept any amendments that may be submitted in committee. If the Parliament is to function democratically, it is imperative that Ministers should give the fullest information, without which there cannot be 'proper deliberation. The Government will contribute to the failure of democracy if it does not furnish the information which the Parliament is entitled to have. The press has published the statement that the proposal is to expend £7,000,000 on the replanning of Darwin.",30
78,Mr JOHNSON,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,Where did the honourable member get that figure?,31
79,Mr FRANCIS,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,It was mentioned by the honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron).,31
80,Mr JOHNSON,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,Forge t it.,31
81,Mr FRANCIS,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"The Minister heard the honourable member for Barker make the statement four or five times, yet only now repudiates it. Can he say how much it is proposed to expend on the redesigning of Darwin? He refuses to answer, thus withholding information that this House is entitled to have. What does the Government intend to do with the land?",31
82,Mr CHAMBERS,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,What does the honourable gentleman think is going to be done with the land ?,31
83,Mr FRANCIS,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,I am not here to indulge in guess work. Guessing is futile. [ expect the Minister to supply the information.,31
84,Mr CHAMBERS,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,Does the honourable gentleman know what is necessary in Darwin ?,31
85,Mr FRANCIS,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"I am asking for the information to be supplied. All that the Minister says is ""forget it "" . [ reject his invitation, and shall exercise whatever rights I may have in order to discover the purpose of this proposal. We are entitled to a frank statement, and should not have to extract it from the Minister as a tooth is extracted. Under clause 4, it is intended to deny to the community in Darwin information as to the date which will form the basis for calculating the value of the land. By that clause, the normal procedure is to be suspended, because it providesThe value of any land acquired in pursuance of this Act by compulsory process shall, withstanding the provisions of Section 29 of the Act . . . If the normal procedure is to be suspended, what alternative will be adopted, and what date will he fixed ? How are the owners of land in Darwin to know the basis on which the value of their land will be calculated? The circumstances in Darwin are most peculiar. In December, 1941, most of the residents left the town because of the threat of attack by the enemy. In February, 1942, the military authorities required the evacuation of all who had remained. Those persons are now scattered throughout Australia. Many of them are today living on their capital. Their houses have been destroyed, and their disadvantages are greater than are suffered by any other section of the community.",31
86,Mr RUSSELL,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,Does the honourable member object to the re-building of Darwin ?,31
87,Mr FRANCIS,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"I object to the treatment that is being meted out to those who own land in Darwin. I make this plea on their behalf. Special consideration should be shown to them when the Government is determining the amount of compensation they are to receive for the land that is to be acquired under this legislation. It is merely prescribed that if they are dissatisfied with the compensation they may take proceedings in the courts. Darwin is isolated, and has no lawyers in whose hands these person? may place their case.",31
88,Mr CHAMBERS,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,There are lawyers in Darwin.,31
89,Mr FRANCIS,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"Thos e who are there are engaged in other activities. A sympathetic committee should be appointed to deal with the matter apart from legal technicalities. It should adopt the most direct means to obtain for these people the compensation they should receive. I appeal to the Government to appoint such a tribunal. In 1913, this Parliament passed the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act. That act was amended in 1927, and again in 1936. Broadly speaking, this act authorizes Parliament to order an investigation of any pro-posed work involving an expenditure of more than £25,000. The comnot- mittee reports, not to the Minister, but to Parliament itself, so that Parliament is made aware of the details of the proposals and the amount to be expended. When it prepares its report on a proposal, the committee makes recommendations and states its reasons in support of them. I ask that the expenditure posed under this bill be referred to the Public Works Committee for inhas vestigation so that Parliament, armed with the committee's report, may be in position to reach an intelligent decision. Unless the House is prepared to accept the earlier amendment moved by the honwas orable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron), I intend to move in the comand mittee stages of the bill that the proposal be referred to the Public Works Comport. mittee for inquiry and report. I - was in Darwin in 1937 as chairman of the Public Works Committee, which spent a considerable time there upon series' of inquiries. Much evidence was heard and members had an opportunity to meet local residents, to discuss problems with them and learn something of their difficulties. At that time, no one could feel pleased with Darwin nor, I suppose, could any one feel particularly pleased with the town as it is today. the time. I visited Darwin it was rapidly true. becoming an important airport, and aeroplanes were arriving daily from overbut seas. * I suggest that when Darwin is being redesigned provision should made for development over a period of years. The Public Works Committee recommended that a town planner should be appointed to draw up proposals development. We pointed out in our report some of the difficulties caused the presence of certain important public buildings, but if those buildings have since been destroyed, our proposals for the development of Darwin should be reviewed. I hope that consideration be given to the provision of suitable dromes at Darwin.",31
90,Mr CHAMBERS,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,They are there now.,32
91,Mr FRANCIS,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"There are military aerodromes, Ibut they are not suitable for civil requirements. That has been emphasized in many parts of Australia, and the recent tragedy at Mascot further reminder of the. need for modern aerodromes. Military aerodromes are was not suitable for very heavy aircraft of kind which will in future be used for transport purposes. Even today there are aeroplanes which can carry 100 people, and larger ones will be in in the future. We must make up our minds to fit Darwin to become' a city, proan airport, a naval base and a tourist resort. I believe that Darwin a big future, and that is why I want it to be developed as a naval base a and airport. It will the increasingly a first port of call for visitors to Australia. In the past, accommodation for visitors inadequate. People will be arriving at Darwin from all parts of the world, their first impression of Australia will be based upon what they see at that Although the Public Works Committee had given three months' notice of its intention to visit Darwin in 1937, when it arrived there five members had a to share a very small room. Such conditions are impossible, especially in a place with a tropical climate. I trust that in their future adequate hotel accommodation will be provided on suitable sites.",32
92,Mr HOLLOWAY,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,Thes e proposals represent the beginning of an effort to make At the honourable member's dreams come,32
93,Mr FRANCIS,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"I am glad, to hear it. I should like some more information about what part of the dreams are to be be realized immediately. The people of Darwin have always had a sense of grievance because they have been denied local for government. They feel that they have been pushed around from pillar to post, by without having any say in their own affairs. I know of the difficulties arising out of the fact that there are so few people to pay rates, but whether the rates are paid entirely by the residents, or supplewill mented by the Government, the people aeroliving in Darwin should be given some say in the administration of their own affairs. The previous isolation of Darwin has largely been broken down by the construction of new roads and aerodromes, and by the installation of an up-to-date radio station. If ever Darwin is to develop, residents must feel that they are free is a from government domination. Previously, officials were everywhere, and there no local civic life. I ask the Minister the to inform honourable members what thp Government proposes to do with the land which is to be acquired under this scheme, and I also ask for an assurance that the use people of Darwin, whose property was destroyed by enemy action, will not have to face lengthy court proceedings in order to obtain reasonable compensation. If satisfactory assurances could be given on these points the bill would have an easier passage through Parliament^",32
94,Mr MORGAN,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"Reid) [4.23] - 1 commend the Government upon its prompt action in taking steps to acquire land in Darwin so that that place may be converted into a model town. I congratulate the Minister for the Interior (Mr. Johnson) upon having launched a scheme which will usher in a new era of progress in the history of Darwin, which was the only Australian town to suffer destruction as the result of enemy action. We know that great damage was also done at Broome, but Darwin alone was completely devastated. Honourable members will recall the news of the first Japanese raid, and later information was given to them in private of the extent of the damage. I think it is time that the facts were released to the public. It would be a warning to us never again to allow ourselves to be caught in such a defenceless state. The only good thing arising out of the whole sorry episode is that, in the place of the old Darwin, a model city is to be built. In peace-time, there is often much squabbling as to whether slum areas in our cities could he reclaimed. So far as Darwin is concerned, that problem has been solved for us by the enemy. What used to be described as the back-door of Australia has now become the front door. As Winwood Reade said in his book, Martyrdom of Man, progress comes out of disaster. We should be thankful that we who lived in other parts of Australia did not have to go through the horrors of aerial bombing, and we should not begrudge the cost of building a new city at Darwin. No doubt mistakes will be made, but we shall have to proceed by trial and error. I desire to pay tribute to the young servicemen who, while serving in the Darwin area, drew up plans for the reconstruction of the city. I hope that the Government will consider setting up a construction authority on the lines of the Tennessee Valley Authority, in the United States of America. As the Northern Territory is administered directly by the Commonwealth, no constitutional difficulties would arise. In any case, I can see no reason why such an authority should not act in other parts of Australia under the Commonwealth's defence powers. The Tennessee Valley scheme was inaugurated under the federal government's defence powers, and was part of the New Deal programme for the relief of unemployment. Actually, it has proved to be of great benefit during the present war in the supply of power and munitions. If we were to set up such an authority in Darwin it should be possible later, as we acquired administrative experience, to extend the idea to other settlements such as Jervis Bay, Port Stephens, Twofold Bay, and places on the coast of Western Australia. The Minister for the Interior should be particularly interested in such a proposal. We thought at one time that Western Australia was the Achilles heel of Australia, the place at which the enemy would strike, and for that reason large military forces were sent there. Yesterday the press published a report which admitted that, at one period, Perth expected to be bombed by the enemy. Therefore, the launching of this proposal may represent the dawn of a new era of progress in Australia. If the establishment of an authority charged with the administration of these reforms should create any constitutional difficulties, the Commonwealth and the States should resolve all doubt by undertaking the work as a joint effort. That scheme would also give effect to the Government's policy of full employment. The development of Darwin as an airport and a seaport should proceed in conjunction with the development of the hinterland. One plan, which seems to be practicable, is the construction of a railway from Bourke to Darwin, connecting with the terminals of the railways in the hinterland of New South Wales and Queensland. That work would be a vital factor in the future development of those States, the Northern Territory and particularly the Barkly Tableland-the fertile area to which Mr Nelson T. Johnson, former United States Minister to Australia referred so favourably. According to expert opinion, the cost of that railway would be more than offset by the saving of livestock during drought. I hope that the Government will launch this scheme and that its present plans will be the forerunner of similar enterprises in other parts of the country.",33
95,Mr ABBOTT,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"New England) [4.33]. - The future of Darwin is bound up with the development of Northern tralia. In the past, the Northern tory has made very slow progress. I 1901 the population was 4,096 and in 1936 it had increased to only 5,454. The whole of the Northern Territory must be developed in order to carry stantially greater population and to much greater production. According to people with a thorough knowledge of conditions in the Territory, Darwin has one of the best ports in the north of this continent. Accepting their statements, I believe that the proposals for the planning of Darwin must be careGovernment fully examined. In his report for year 1943-44, the Administrator of the Northern Territory estimated that, the future, Darwin would carry population of 6,000 persons. Government should not be satisfied resuming certain portions of Darwin, but should embark upon a compreof hensive scheme to enable the planned development of the town in future. Eor that reason, I shall support the bill. Before this measure becomes law, the Minister for the Interior (Mr Johnson) should take the opportunity to visit Darwin for the purpose of seeing for himself the possible effects of the vernment's proposals. He brings to this matter a fresh mind, and we believe that he will conscientiously do his utmost for the Northern Territory. The bill provides for the acquisition of certain freehold land in Darwin at its present value. So far, that is satisof factory. But since the outbreak of the war, the Commonwealth has acquired substantial areas in various places, and often the compensation which has been paid to the owners has been most unsatispeople factory. From time to time, honourable members have produced evidence to supparticularly port that statement. The compensation that will be paid to the owners of freehold land in Darwin should be just. They should not be ""beaten down"" until, in despair, they accept the Commonwealth's offer. [159] The development of Darwin constitutes only a small part of the major plan that must be implemented in the future. Sir Harold Clapp, in his report on proposals for the standardization of railway gauges in Australia, suggested the construction Ausof a 4-ft. 8i-in gauge railway from TerriTownsville in Queensland, through n Dajarra, across the Northern Territory, through the Barkly Tableland, to link with the existing railway system at Birdum, and passing through Newcastle a sub- ""Waters and Daly Waters on to yield Darwin. This would involve the construction of 1,900' miles of new railway track and the converting of the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge line in the Northern Territory to the standard gauge. In 1864, Sir George Bowen, Governor of Queensland, suggested to the Imperial that a new colony should be the created in Australia, north of the twentieth parallel of latitude. In 1924, in the then Premier of Queensland, Mr. a Theodore, advocated detaching from The Queensland, for the purposes of a new with State in the north that portion of Queensland and. Western Australia north the twentieth parallel. That advocacy has been taken up by the Hon. V. C. Thompson, in the issue of the Northern Daily Leader on the 23rd July last. He recommended that additional railway facilities should be provided in the Northern Territory, joining with Wyndham and running across to the northGowest coast of Western Australia. In my opinion, the only way in which this country can be developed is by the provision of adequate transport facilities. When I look at the map, it is perfectly clear to me that Darwin is the central point in the vast northern area Australia and would be the hub upon which a new State would pivot in future. For that reason, I consider that the Administrator of the Northern Territory underestimated the potential number of who will ultimately reside in Darwin. He stated that North Australia, the Barkly Tablelands, contains excellent pastoral country, and could carry now 2,000,000 head of cattle and 3,000,000 head of sheep. He considered that with proper facilities the pastoral areas of the Northern Territory could carry up to 5,000,000 sheep. As the Army has discovered, certain areas of the Northern Territory are suitable for irrigation. Each of the three main rivers of the Territory is approximately 300 miles long, and has a large catchment area. For example, the Roper River has a catchment area of approximately 19,000,000 acres, an area which is 2,000 square miles larger than Tasmania. Its basin receives an annual rainfall of more than 25 inches, and its tributaries, the Waterhouse and the ""Wilton, have an average rainfall of 40 inches. The Administrator pointed out that large areas of river flats in the Northern Territory could be irrigated. To the north of Australia lie rich potential markets in the Netherlands East Indies, and if the irrigable areas were developed, fruit and vegetables could be grown there and marketed in the East Cndies, in the same way as fresh fruit is sent from .South Africa, via the east coast shipping route, and sold to the teeming millions of India, through the markets of Bombay and Karachi. Tremendous development is possible in the northern areas of Australia, but it will not be achieved until local autonomy is given to that part of the country. Mr. V. O. Thompson advpcated that the area to be known as Northern Australia should consist of all the territory north of a line drawn from a point just north of Bowen in Queensland, to Port Hedland in Western Australia. Having in mind the potentialities of the Northern Territory, I regret that the bill does not go a good deal further, and that a comprehensive plan has not been formulated along the lines that I have mentioned. The 130,000 residents of Northern Queensland should be given an opportunity to state whether they desire to be detached from the State of Queensland and absorbed in Northern Australia. If the proposed northern area were given local autonomy, I am confident that it would develop rapidly, just as Victoria and Queensland developed after they were detached from New South Wales and given local autonomy. Naturally, the Parliament of the Commonwealth would have to be prepared to face a big capital expenditure in developing Northern Australia. Progress has not been satisfactory Mr Abbott. to date because of the lack of communications. Australia has four reasons for attempting in future to develop this Territory to the greatest possible extent! The first is to ensure our defence. This door to Australia must not be left wide open in future. Fifty or 100 years hence, Australia may again he threatened with invasion from the north, and it would be a great safeguard if the northern areas were fairly well populated so as to absorb the first impact of the attack. The second point is that the northern area is capable of great pastoral development and has vast mineral resources. In addition, people could make a good living on the irrigable areas. The third point is that it would bring wealth to the country by increasing production there. The fourth point is that it would be a great area for settling the people who, we hope, will migrate here from overseas. Justice must he done to the people of Darwin by compensating them adequately for the acquisition of their property. I shall support the bill in the hope that, in future, the Government will bring down legislation for the development of that area by establishing railway communication with the rest of Australia and by adopting a policy for exploiting the latent wealth of the Northern Territory.",34
96,Mr CHAMBERS,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"Adelaide) [4.46] It was refreshing to hear the speech of the honourable member for New England (Mr Abbott), after listening to another honourable member opposite who spoke earlier. The honourable member for New England realizes that the bill has a definite purpose-the planning of Darwin for the future. Unfortunately, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr. Francis) was thinking of the pre-war Darwin. Darwin, today, is entirely different from the town we knew before it was occupied by the armed forces. Prewar Darwin was dirty. No other word could adequately describe it. It musl have been offensive to people who arrived in Australia by the Empire Air Service. I can imagine what they thought when their first view of Australia was Darwin, when I recall how Cavanagh-street and other dirty corners of that carelessly controlled town looked before the war Realizing the great importance of this Australian port, the Government desires to plan the development of Darwin on attractive modern lines. The Commonwealth now has a great interest in Darwin and the surrounding territory. It has expended more than £1,000,000 on the construction of a bitumen road between Alice Springs and Darwin. Before the war, few people ever considered travelling overland from Alice Springs to Darwin because they thought that the country was almost impassable by motor car. But today, convoys set out daily for Darwin from Alice Springs. During the war the Government has expended millions of pounds on the construction of aerodromes, bridges and other assets. The honourable member for Moreton said that he hoped that the Government would make provision for aerodromes to be constructed in and around Darwin in the post-war period. I was amazed, that any member of this Parliament should make such a statement. Aerodromes comparable with any in other parts of Australia have been built in the Northern Territory between Alice Springs and Darwin. The honourable member spoke of heavily loaded aeroplanes. The heaviest aircraft that have visited Australia have landed on the Royal Australian Air Force aerodrome at Darwin, which is one of the best in Australia. The Commonwealth Government has a very great interest in Darwin. Realizing how close we were to disaster through lack of properly organized defence when Japan struck at Darwin, we must appreciate the vital need to provide for the adequate defence of this front door to Australia and to encourage settlement in that area. The figures mentioned by the honourable member for New England were illuminating. They proved that, over many years, the population of the area scarcely increased because of the lack of development. It is the intention of this Government, as it should be the intention of every future government, to ensure that Darwin is developed according to' a proper plan. In order to do this, it is necessary to acquire land, and it is important that the. land-owners should be adequately compensated for the improvements which they have made, [f that be done, I do not believe that anybody will complain about this bill. I am certain that most honourable members visualize a greater and more importantDarwin with a vastly increased population. Improvements which have already been made in that area by the Commonwealth Government should be maintained. I am sure that the future importance of Darwin will encourage closer settlement, thus obviating the recurrence of the danger that faced us when Japan struck in that area earlier in the war. 1 believe that this bill heralds the growth of a modern Darwin of which we shall be proud, when its harbour and aerodromes will the busy with traffic from the outside world. I am pleased that the recently appointed Minister for the Inferior (Mr Johnson) understands Australia and Australian sentiment. I believe that he will be a great asset to the Government, and we are fortunate that he is in charge of this bill.",35
97,Mr RANKIN,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"Bendigo) [4.55] This bill to authorize the acquisition by the Commonwealth of approximately 90 square miles of land in the township area of Darwin is badly conceived. I congratulate the new Minister for the In terior (Mr Johnson) upon his recent elevation to the Ministry. ""We are fortunate to have as Minister for the Interior a man who understands conditions in the Northern Territory and the problems of its residents. I am confident that he will be sympathetic to the claims of Darwin residents', but he will be obliged to administer his department according to the policy of the Government, which, in this instance, is designed to destroy the rights of many people who have lived in Darwin for a long time. These people had' sufficient vision to realise that some day Darwin would be a great town and that land values would rise. They took up land and many of them have spent a great part of their lives there under unsatisfactory conditions. Now the Government proposes to take over their land. The bill is drafted purely to protect the interests of the Government and to implementits policy without consideration for the welfare of the pioneers of tie area. Unfortunately, the Government has the numerical strength required to pass the bill through this House. Certain additional provisions should be included in it. The people whose land is to be acquired have practically no representation in this Parliament, and, as far as I know, the Government has not consulted them regarding the lines on which the town should be rebuilt. This action is being taken at an inconvenient time for these people, because their representative in this House is not able to push their claims, having unfortunately been a prisoner of war for three years. In these circumstances, the Government should have conferred with the people who are vitally concerned in the matter. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Chambers) said that the Government had a great interest in Darwin. I agree with him. But the people who were responsible for its development up to the present also have a great interest in the town. The Government has already resumed large areas of land in the Darwin district. Erom information in my possession, and from the reports of people who have visited the town, I believe that the Commonwealth has almost sufficient land for aerodromes, public buildings, and public utilities. The Government says that it is essential, in the interests of town-planning, to take over the land referred to in this bill, even if it does so without considering the interests of the land-owners. However, the Townplanning Association of New South Wales, which was consulted on this matter on a previous occasion and which reported to the Commonwealth Government, says that the acquisition of this land is not essential. It claims that, under the building regulations, the Government has all the power that it requires to resume such properties as may be needed for the construction of roads and other utilities and the development of a properly planned town. Although Mr Mclnnes has made a good and comprehensive report, this matter should not be left in the hands of one man. The planning of our great national capital was the subject of a world-wide competition, which was open to all architects and town-planners. The successful competitor was an American. I believe that Darwin will he another great city. There is talk of expending £7,000,000 on its development. I imagine Mr Rankin. that the Government has no intention of expending this amount at the present time, because, obviously, it would be stupid even to consider doing so. One man should not be allowed to direct the planning of the future great city which will stand at the northern gateway to Australia. His plan may be reasonable, but it may not be the best. The Government should withdraw this bill, and consult the Northern Territory Developmental League, all organized 'bodies interested in Darwin, and the owners of the freehold of the land affected, who went there in the belief that they would eventually benefit from their own courage and foresight in pioneering the area. I do not expect the present Minister to be a pocket Mussolini, and I do not fear that he will do what the Department of the Interior did in connection with the resumption of land required for the Essendon aerodrome. One resident in my district had bought four blocks of land, for which he had paid £252, and, although he had paid rates and taxes on the land for years, he was offered the magnificent sum of £18 for his property. He did not even receive from the department courteous replies to his letters. In another instance, Mrs. C. S. Paynter, of Echuca, had bought land at Black Rock on the 4th December, 1933, for £300, and had paid rates and taxes on it, but had derived no income from it.. On the 10th May last she entered into a contract for its sale to Anthony John Rix for £177. When application was made to the Treasury for consent to the transaction, the delegate of the Treasury advised that on the information available the contract price wae regarded as excessive, but that further consideration would be given to the application "" should an intimation he received from both parties that they are prepared to proceed with the transaction at a price not in excess of £67."" The owner has held that land for eleven year.s, and a government official has decided that, although it cost £300 in 1933, the owner would be fairly treated by the payment of £67!",36
98,Mr SPEAKER,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,Hon. J. S. Rosevear). - The honourable member may not cite instances of that kind extensively.,37
99,Mr RANKIN,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"I could cite twentysuch cases, but I have given two typical instances of the treatment received by land-owners from two separate government departments. This treatment does not encourage men to believe that they will get a fair deal from government departments, or from officials who apparently have no sympathy for those who believe that the fact that they have assisted in the pioneering of the Darwin area justifies them in expecting a reasonable reward. The building regulations operating in Darwin are adequate, because no person may erect a building which is not approved by the Chief Medical Officer and the Administrator. I see no justification for the acquisition of this land by the Government and for the proposed alteration of the system of land tenure in the area. How would members of the Ministry like to build houses on leased land? T have a list before me of particulars of land, owned by the Government in and around Darwin. It shows the land held by the Department of the Navy, the Royal Australian A i r Force and the m i l i tary authorities, and all government buildings, schools, post offices, &c. W it h the leave of the House I shall incorporate the details in JJansard. They are as follows:Within 5 chains of the Darwin Post Office Post office and quarters, police station police barracks, government offices and Goforts have been constructed. vernment House, also Law Courts. Within 15 chains of the Post Office-Fore shore between Stokes Hill and Fort Hill, reclaimed area between same points. Within 20 chains of Post Office - Railwa station in Stokes Hill area on which oil were built. Within i mile of the Post Office Hill on which railway houses and oil tanks were built. Cavandah Square alongside of public schools. A large area between Mitchellhonorable street and sea frontage, football barracks, government servants' quarters and government officer's residence. Within 1 mile from Darwin Post Office Old hospital area, Point Emery area, comprisshould ing approximately 50 acres, now known as Lakarah Barracks. Within l i miles of the Post Office - Myill Point area, new hospital and research laborameasurestories, government houses are built on the Wireless-road area, wireless station, sanitary depot, civil cemetery and botanical gardens. The Two and a Half Mile-road and railway, the bill. within two miles-Rifl e range, large naval stores, Chinese cemetery, area comprising approximately 40 acres. Within 3 miles of the Post Office - Civi l aerodrome, Fanny Bay Gaol and race-course. Within 2-J miles North-South-road - Rail way workshops, coal depot and railway employees' houses, Two and Half Mile school, old cemetery, power houses. Within 3i miles of Darwin Post Office Area known as Home's Slaughter Yard, between railway and coast, ground acquired by the military and naval authorities, approximately 50 acres, on which was erected a magazine. Within 5 miles of the Post Office - Nativ e compound, Royal Australian Air Force aerodrome, comprising 640 acres, special Royal Australian Air Force wireless station. Within 7 miles of Darwin Post Office Along the North-South-road, 320 acres naval area. Within 8 miles of Post Office - Quarantine road branches off North-South-road 1 mile along, on which a very large military hospital has been built. Within 11 miles of the Post Office - An area' of 320 acres of government land acquired for use of services, on which a special wireless station has been erected. All the above distances and areas are approximate. I feel confident that when the Minister ascertains the area of land held by the Commonwealth in the Darwin area he will realise that only small areas of other land are required for national purposes. The Government owns practically the whole of the foreshore and large areas and where aerodromes, military barracks and The Government has acquired sufficient land to and meet probable needs for hundreds of years. The Government's action in introy ducing this bill is most unfair. The bill tanks provides for the adoption in Darwin of the policy of the Government with - Railwa y regard to land tenure.",38

I agree with the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie established Cameron) that the development of the municipality. whole of the Northern Territory is essential. If Darwin is to be anything more in progress. than a landing place for aircraft, it will be necessary to develop the hinterland 1937. which is now occupied mainly by pastoralists and miners.

One of the opponents. first essentials is to curtail the great assets of the companies which hold land there but have not an Australian outlook and which have no interest in the development of the Territory. Unless there is increased settlement in the Territory there will no firm foundation on which to develop the city of Darwin. I hope that the Minister for the Interior will visit the Territory and consult with the local representatives of the people. Many of them reside at Alice Springs and Tennant Creek. If the Minister visits the tory and affords the people an tunity to present their case, they will willing to meet him at almost any centre. The local residents are not very enthusin iastic about government control of local affairs. The Payne report states that, owing to the smallness of the revenue, residents desired the Government to take control. The Government eventually acceded to their representations, and administration of the town was taken over by the Commonwealth as from the 1st April, 1937. The people did not realise how slowly the Government would case. move, but they soon found out that they were in a worse position than previously. They had asked the Government to take over the control of local affairs because the municipality did not have good paths, drains, or proper public facilities. But they found that although £1,000 was in rates and the Treasury had t made £1,400 available only £150 was expended in the period to the 30th June, 1937.

Government is faced with the cost of the replacement of those buildings on behalf of the owners. According to the report the War Damage Commission, of DecemTheir ber, 1944, the claims in the Darwin area on account of damage caused by enemy action total £109,924. I believe larger amount is due as compensation for occupation and damage by Army and Air Force authorities. We have to consider the position of the owners of property, who were evacuated.

They need to know quickly, in order that of they may plan their future movements. lives have been upset for several years, and it is only fair that they should know what rights they possess in the that a existing circumstances. The honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) asked how payment the would be made by the War Damage Commission, the Army and other government They agencies. Under the War Damage to Property Regulations, practically all war damage up to the 31st December, 1944, a has been assessed and recorded and the owners know the extent of the damage. to Since 1944, the War Damage to Property Regulations have been extended and now make the commission liable for damage due to evacuation. The Army has been in occupation of many properties and will be liable to restore them to their former condition. The War Damage not Commission will be responsible for the deterioration of any property that not been occupied by the Army.",40
119,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,Will the War Damage Commission restore the buildings to their original condition?,41
120,Mr COLES,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"No . It will assess the value of the building, as declared by owner and agreed upon, and pay cash to him.",41
121,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,The value undamaged ?,41
122,Mr COLES,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"The value for the purplanning, poses of the War Damage to Property Regulations is the value fixed at the 1st January, 1942.",41
123,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,Surely the honourable member realizes that a buildachieved. ing cannot be replaced at that cost today.,41
124,Mr COLES,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,That does not concern me. I am stating the existing regulations and the liability of the War Damage Commission.,41
125,Mr JOHNSON,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,That is what the honSomething orable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) advocated last night.,41
126,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,It is not; it is the direct opposite.,41
127,Mr COLES,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"The Army is responswho ible for restoring the buildings it has altered or occupied, to the condition which they were at the commencement occupation. Surely I have clarified the matter sufficiently! It is important that these people shall know when and by whom they are to be paid compensation. The War Damage Commission is making payment at the present time in respect of their personal belongings and chattels in the expectation that they will prepare to return to and resume domestic life Darwin. Payment in respect of properestablish ties will be delayed unless this bill the northern ports. becomes law and the Minister decides whether his department will assume responsibility or the owners will be dealt with separately. I cannot agree to any delay, because it is very important that these people should have their minds at rest. I see some virtue in the bill by reason of the fact that it gives to Australia a chance to build a new town at Darwin. I recall that when I was in Coventry, long after that city had been bombed, the mayor of the city said to me: "" It is has not an unmixed blessing. We should long ago have destroyed and replaced many of these buildings."" Darwin was in much the same category as Coventry. Portion of the town-filth y Chinatownwas dilapidated, and not a good advertisement of Australia. My first visit to the Darwin was by air, when I returned to Australia from London, via Singapore and the Netherlands East Indies. I was not at all uplifted by my first sight of Australia's front door, which Darwin was then becoming. If , by virtue of reand controlling the class of buildings that may be erected, the - Government can give to the residents of Darwin some of the amenities and comforts that they require, much will be Proper amenities and comforts are more essential to the residents of a tropical area than they are to those who live in the more temperate zones. Australia seems always to have acted in reverse of that principle. The attitude has been: "" It was good enough for my father. else should be done first. Let us not do it today."" I say: ""Let us do this now"". Let us plan Darwin, and make it a clean, sanitary town, with an attractive appearance, healthy for those have to live there and act as Australia's welcoming agents to visitors from in aU over the world. It should be at least of as attractive as Rangoon, Bangkok and Batavia, which give some delight to those who enter them, because they,have broad, well-paved streets, and good lighting, are well policed, and appear to be prosperous. Darwin looked "" down at heel "" as though everybody there was living on » shoestring. The new town, erected under government auspices, should be one of in which Australia can be proud. It might a new standard of living in all I congratulate the Minister on his appointment to a very important office, and wish him success in carrying out this first assignment. I hope that, at some time in the future, I shall have an opporset tunity to visit Darwin in his company and see the fruits of his labours.",41
128,Sir EARLE PAGE,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"Cowper) [5.27] I. am glad to note the interest that is being displayed by the Government in the Northern Territory, and am pleased that the maiden effort of the new Minister for the Interior (Mr Johnson) should be connected with Australia's outback, with which he is so familiar. I congratulate him on his appointment, and wish him luck in his administration. But I regret that this is only a piecemeal proposal. It is worthwhile noting that there are two issues in the bill. The first, with which everybody agrees, is the replanning of Darwin. The second is the conversion from freehold to leasehold tenure of land owned by persons who had lived there for 40 or 50 years. Surely persons who have spent that length of time in the Territory are entitled to some voice as to the conditions under which they are to live in the future! If the Minister were proposing to deal not only with Darwin but also with the Northern Territory as a whole, one might agree to leasehold tenure being a part of the general plan. But when the proposal does not embrace action in regard to the development of Darwin's back country, the people should have a voice as to whether, after their evacuation, they shall return to freehold or leasehold tenure. That is particularly true because the residents of the Northern Territory are at present disfranchised, their representative being a prisoner of war. In default of Mr. Blain's presence in this Parliament to put their point of view, this matter of leasehold tenure might well the left in abeyance. If that were done, I should not oppose the bill. I have seen many false starts made in connection with the development of the Northern Territory. As Treasurer, I was responsible for finding the money for continuing the construction of the railway from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. We also introduced the legislation under which every ten years the big leases are reviewed with the idea of their being subdivided for the use of smaller holders. In the late twenties, we appointed a North Australia Commission which was to be an executive body to carry out proposals for the development of the area, but unfortunately it had just presented its proposals to Parliament, when the depression came, and nothing could he done. The population of the Northern Territory has grown very slowly. Indeed, at times, it has declined, as the following figures show:1901 .. 4,096 1911 .. 3,310 1921 .. 3,857 1936 ... .. 5,454 Thus, during a period of 35 years, the population of the Territory increased by only 1,350, despite the fact that considerable sums of money had heen expended on developmental undertakings. I maintain that if the value of property in Darwin has increased, those men who held out there through all t£e years should be entitled to benefit. The honourable member for Henty (Mr Coles) said that property-owners were entitled, to know under what conditions they would return to Darwin. I suggest that residents, who were disturbed by the war, are entitled to return under at least as good conditions as they enjoyed when they left. Indeed, the conditions laid down now may be a factor in deciding whether they return or not. Fifty years ago, when I first came to Sydney, land in the suburb of Neutral Bay was held under 99 years lease from the Ashley-Cooper family. Aa a result, the suburb stagnated for many years, while the contiguous suburb of Mosman, which was farther away from the city, developed by leaps and bounds because it was freehold. It was declared a municipality at least 24 years before Neutral Bay was, and Neutral Bay has never caught up with it, although freehold tenure was granted there many years ago. I agree that the leasehold system is satisfactory for pastoral purposes, but a man likes to own the freehold of the land upon which he builds his home, so that he may leave it to his family. This is a strong instinct in the hearts of all British people. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will give heed to the suggestion of the honourable member for Barker that before action is taken to acquire land the residents of Darwin should be given a hearing. Surely that is not too much to ask on behalf of people who are virtually disfranchised, and who have suffered the ravages of war as have the people of no other part of Australia. Residents of other parts of Australia have benefited from the provision of amenities, in the form of roads, &c., constructed as a part of the nation's war effort, but it has never been suggested that they should not be entitled to whatever increment accrues to their property as a result. The people of Darwin, alone of all people in Australia, are to have applied to them the doctrine that they shall not benefit from war expenditure. During the war, the Stuart Highway and the Barkly Highway have been constructed, giving access to Darwin. However, in his last report, the Administrator of the Norther Territory sharply reminds us that the maintenance of these two great highways is, apparently, to be a responsibility of the Northern Territory. The taxes paid by residents of Darwin, and of the Northern Territory generally, will be devoted to this purpose. Surely, therefore, they should be entitledto any beneCrown, fit accruing from increased property values. The area of the Northern Territory is 523,000 square miles, but only in Darwin itself is there any freehold. Only 40 per cent, of the Territory, or 226,000 square miles, has been taken up. Of the balance, 67,000 square miles is an aborigines' reserve, 77,000 square miles is unoccupied, and 150,000 square miles is desert land. In the circumstances, this rush to grah the 90 square miles of freehold land in thetown of Darwin savours somewhat of using a steam hammer to crack a walnut, especially in view of the report of Mr Mclnnes that, for town-planning purposes, it would be necessary to acquire only five separate blocks. The Government should, bring down,a proposal for the development of the whole of the Northern Territory, a proposal in which the development of Darwin wouldi find its proper place. When we started expending money in the 1920 s on the extension of the railway ? from Katherine to Birdum, and Oodnadatta toAlice Springs, we believed that the Northern Territory was too big to beadministered from one place. We divided it into twoparts, one of which was administered from Darwin and the other from Alice Springs. I hope that, after the war, railways will be constructed to connect the pastoral lands of the Northern Territory with Queensland in Sir Earle Page. the east and with Wyndham in the west. In this way, we may hope to create a seventh State in the north. This would have the advantage, among others, of allowing us to increase the number of members of this Parliament, and, perhaps, to reduce the size of the enormous area represented by the Minister for theInterior, whoseelectorate, I believe, is the largest in the world. With propei development, it should be possible to run sheep in parts, of the Northern Territory, instead of cattle only. Already, the isolation of the Territory is being broken u down by the development of air services and the building of roads. If the Government proceeds with an effective scheme of development, and expends £10j000,000 or even £20,000,000, which will have the effect of increasing land values, I should not object to a proposal that the increment should go to the but I do not agree that the Government should seize what increment has already accrued, seeing that it ha."" done nothing to develop the area. The people who have lived in Darwin for years are entitled to any benefits which might come to them as the result of their life's work, there. It is wrong that the freehold should be taken from them ai, this time, and in thisway. I am entirely in favour of town planning for Darwin, which must eventually become a' grea i airport as well as a naval base. Th'V town must be developed, so that peoplf who arrive there on their way to visit other parts of Australia will gain a good impression. In the meantime, the residents of Darwin should be consulted in order to learn their wishes regarding land tenure. It may be that they would prefer leasehold tenure, and, if so, I am quite easy about the matter. All sort? of proposals for post-war reconstruction will be put forward for all sorts of places. I believe that charity should begin ar home, and I hope that some of the postwar expenditure will take place in developing the Australian Capital Territory, as well as in the development of Darwin and the Northern Territory, so that both Territories may be shining examples to the rest of Australia.",42
129,Mr MCDONALD,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"Corangamite) [5.44] - I support the amendment of the 1 honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron), mainly because the people who are most concerned, namely, the residents of Darwin, have not been consulted regarding the Government's proposal, although opinions have been obtained from high Army officers, members of the War Damage Commission, the Surveyor-General and all sorts of other people. I believe that had the present Minister for the Interior (Mr. Johnson) been in office when this proposal was first mooted, a different scheme would have been drawn up, because he understands the people of the outback, having been associated with them for so many years. Regarding assets, the honourable member for Henty (Mr Coles) explained that under the regulations the War Damage Com,mission may pay only the prescribed amount of compensation, and I agree with that statement. But if that payment is the total amount that these people will receive, a grave injustice will be done to them. This is a special case which calls for additional compensation. A considerable portion of the money collected by the War Damage Commission will never be required to compensate the owners of property damaged or destroyed by enemy action; and the Government should accord generous treatment to those who desire to return to the Northern Territory, and erect residences similar to those which were destroyed. During the war, building fiosts have increased by from 50 to 75 per cent., and the amounts for which these people insured their homes will not defray the cost of rebuilding or replacing them. Many country people of a careful disposition have, during the last five years, increased their insurances on houses and buildings. They know that the cost of replacing those structures would substantially exceed the amount for which they were previously insured. The properties to be acquired in Darwin will be valued; and many owners of land and buildings throughout Australia have complained, with good cause, regarding valuations made by the Central Hirings Committee. Probably every honourable member can recall instances in his own electorate where he considered that an owner had been most unjustly treated. In one case, several acres of a property - the best portion-were acquired, and a dehydrating factory was erected on the land. Onions have been treated therean almost noxious trade-and the value of the remainder of the property has been affected. Although the factory has been in operation for two or three years, the owner of the land has not received any compensation for the area which was compulsorily acquired. He was entirely dissatisfied with the price that the Central Hirings Committee offered to pay for it. The Minister for Air (Mr Drakeford) has experienced in his own electorate dissatisfaction caused by the valuations placed on acquired property. All honourable members consider that those valuations were unfair. In Victoria at.present protests are being voiced because land belonging to servicemen has been compulsorily acquired by a Housing Commission. If this bill be passed in its present form, the Government will meet endless trouble. Before proceeding with this legislation, the Minister for the Interior and the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) should personally view the whole situation in Darwin. Possibly, the Minister for the Interior had no part in preparing this bill, and in his own interests, and because of the magnitude of the task which he has undertaken, he should agree to postpone the passing of this legislation until he obtains first-hand information about the situation. I am satisfied that the information which he would glean would be worthwhile, and every honourable member would be prepared to listen to his opinion of the .position, and probably agree with it. For that reason, the amendment moved by the honourable member for Barker should be accepted.",43
130,Unknown,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,Sitting suspended from 5.50 to 8 p.m.,44
131,Mr JOHNSON,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"Kalgoorlie-Minister for the Interior and Minister assisting the Minister for Works and Housing) [8.0]. "" - I am justified in saying that this bill, which provides for the acquisition of certain lands at Darwin, has had a fairly good reception. The criticisms that have been levelled at it relate more to what has happened under war-time regulations than to what is likely to happen under the bill. It has been suggested that, if the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr. Blain) could be present, he would oppose the bill. In my opinion, the honourable gentleman would give his support to bill. I do not say that lightly, when first came into this Parliament I assopast. ciated a great deal with the honourable member owing to the fact that he also represents an outback electorate. should not make that statement if I did not believe, from conversations that had with the honourable member, that was just as anxious as anybody else to see that part of the Commonwealth ning developed. The Government cannot accept the amendment moved by the honstrategically orable member for Barker (Mr Archie he established. Cameron). To do so would delay considerably the implementation of the posals contained in the bill, which are necessary for the development of Darwin. I am particularly anxious to avoid delay, because I am eager to stimulate the ploitation of our northern areas. This bill represents the first step in that tion. Because of my long association with the northern areas, I claim to have some knowledge of what is necessary to foster their development. I also claim to understand and sympathize with the people who, for many years, have carried on under the most difficult conditions, notwithstanding the neglect of previous governments to reduce the disabilities which they have suffered. In many under instances, only sheer determination enabled these people to keep going. I see in this bill an opportunity to make available to them some of the amenities that are enjoyed by the residents of closely settled areas. ' Consequently, I am happy to be closely associated with the measure in my capacity as Minister for the Interior. Most of the criticism levelled at it has been, to express it mildly, not well founded. The honourable member for Barker, for instance, was most suspicious of the Government's tentions, but, in spite of his criticism of office. its proposals, he offered not one practical alternative to them. Surely the honorfor able member, like most Australians, is anxious to see the Northern Territory and adjacent areas developed and ceases populated. This development is of urgent national importance. The people who have been courageous enough to tackle the problems associated with development of the area should not allowed to continue any longer without Mr Johnson. the the assistance and encouragement that I have been withheld from them in the The bill seeks authority to acquire certain lands for the purposes, as stated in clause 3, of replanning and developing I the town of Darwin and its surroundings, and of instituting a system of leasehold I tenure for the Crown in respect of such he land. This will ensure that proper supervision will be given to the replanand development of the area so tha; a town worthy of the beautiful and valuable port of Darwin will This move will have the most beneficial proresults to the whole of Australia. Its influence will be felt not only in the Darwin area but also across the borders of the Territory in the rich Kimberley exdistrict of Western Australia and in the rich Barkly Tablelands of Queensdirecland. I know a great deal about the country on the Western Australian side of the Territory, and I have also travelled through the Barkly Tablelands. I am sure that these areas have great potentialities awaiting development. The honourable member for Barker is disturbed over the provision made for owners of land to appeal against the terms of acquisition. I remand him that, the Lands Acquisition Act, appeals has may go to a court, and that there is nothing to prevent the Minister from referring them to an independent tribunal.",44
132,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,There i.= more nothing' to compel him to do so.,45
133,Mr JOHNSON,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"I repeat that there is nothing to prevent the Minister from referring appeals to a special, independent tribunal. In cases where the circumstances can justify it, that procedure will receive my earnest consideration.",45
134,Mr RANKIN,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,The honourable gentleinman miay not always be in his present,45
135,Mr JOHNSON,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"I shall be Minister the Interior when this bill comes into operation, and I may be still in office when the honourable member for Bendigo to be a member of this Parliament. However, that is by the way. Irrespective of whether the honourable member and 1 remain in this House, the development the of our northern areas must not be rebe tarded. For this reason, I am most, enthusiastic about this bill and I hope that it will have a speedy passage, so that it can be put into effect at an early date. I realise that difficulties will have to be overcome. ""We cannot carry out our plans, either in the Northern Territory or elsewhere, with the 100 per cent, support of the people. However, most obstacles can be overcome, no matter how great they may be. On the subject of prices, I point out that these can be fixed by collaboration between the Department of the Interior, the War Damage Commission, and the Central Hirings Committee, always keeping in mind the fact that owners may appeal against decisions to the Supreme Court of the Territory and that I have already undertaken to consider appointing an independent tribunal where circumstances justify such action. I remind the honourable member for Barker and others who have criticized the bill that they are not alone in their sympathy for the pioneers of the outback country. I lived amongst those people for many years, and therefore I am conversant with their problem® and the disabilities from which they suffer. The development of this northern area will be a great advertisement for Australia. The honourable member for Henty (Mr Coles) has told us that, when he entered Australia through Darwin, all he saw was a little old tin "" Chinatown "". That was a bad advertisement for this country. Under the bill, with properly supervised town-planning we can make a garden city of this town in its setting of a beautiful harbour and attractive surroundings, so that it will be a great advertisement for Australia. Criticism has been levelled at clause 4, which provides that the values of the land acquired will be assessed according to the values' prevailing at the date of acquisition. The calculated cost of acquisition is, as was stated in the ' second-reading speech, merely an estimate made by the Central Hirings Committee which may be varied according to circumstances. Action will be taken as soon as possible after the enactment of this bill to acquire the land under the Lands Acquisition Act. It has been stated that the cost of acquisition may involve the Commonwealth Government in expenditure amounting to £7,000,000. That statement did Dot originate from any Government source, as far as I have been able to ascertain. Naturally, a great deal of expenditure will be involved in the development of Darwin, but it is not possible at this juncture to forecast the amount of that expenditure. I have been asked when I will visit Darwin in company with the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman). I ami unable to speak for my colleague, but I shall take the first opportunity available to visit the area accompanied by the Secretary of the Department of the Interior, in order to discuss problems and disabilities with the people on the spot. During the short time in which I have been Minister for the Interior I have received a number of inquiries from persons who are anxious to return to the Territory. Neither the Government nor the Opposition should suggest any delay in implementing this measure. I urge that the bill be passed, and I give an assurance that even at this late period a genuine effort will be made further to develop the Northern Territory and increase its population, as a result of the expenditure proposed to be undertaken in Darwin and adjacent areas.

136,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"Barker) [8.24J - Before the committee is asked to vote money, it is usual for a Minister to state what amount is proposed to be expended, and for what purpose it is required, hut we have not been told how much of the total expenditure is to he incurred at Darwin. I compliment the Minister for the Interior (Mr Johnson) upon his maiden speech as a Minister, but, like most of his colleagues, he is singularly uncommunicative on matters on which members of the Opposition desire to be informed. Only this afternoon I submitted seven points, and I asked that information on them be supplied in the Minister's reply to the debate on the motion for the second reading of the bill, but no attempt has heen made to answer my questions. The nearest approach to dealing with any of them was the Minister's statement that at some time convenient to him he proposes to visit the Territory. The committee is at least entitled to some enlightenment as to the NOES. amount which the Government expects to expend in the reconstruction of Darwin, and for what purposes the money to be provided by this bill is to be used. We have not been informed what the total expenditure will be. I have never known the members of this chamber to he so inadequately informed regarding financial matters as during the last few weeks. PAIRS.",47
137,Mr HOLT,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION, T deeply regret that my former colleague on the War Expenditure Committee has so early been corrupted by bad practice. As chairman of that committee he would have looked askance at any government proposal which afforded so little information as has been furnished in connection with this proposed large expenditure of public money. Will the Minister give an indication of the amount which it is estimated will be required under this bill ?,47
138,Mr JOHNSON,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"Kalgoorlie-Minister for the Interior and Minister assisting the Minister for Works and Housing) [8.27] - Neithe r the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) nor the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. Holt) appears to have studied clause 5 of the bill. The Minister who introduced the measure estimated that the cost to the Government would be about £500,000, and in referring to the matter to-night I stated that that sum could be regarded as only an estimate. Clause 5 sets out the purposes for which the money is to he voted. It is seldom possible to give a precise estimate of the cost of undertakings of this kind, particularly a proposal such as the acquisition of lands in and around Darwin. Therefore, I claim that the case in support of the bill has been properly presented to honourable members.",47
139,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"Barker) [8.28] - I claim that the proposal has not been presented to us as it should have 'been. In the course of his second-reading speech, the Minister for Works and Housing (Mr Lazzarini) said It is not possible at this stage to give a firm estimate of the cost of the proposed acquisition, but the following tentative figures, prepared by the Central Hirings Committee,, wil l give some indication of the post involved: - Unimprove d value of 'and, £.150.000; value of improvements, £500.000: total, £650,000. Against this sum the Commonwealth is already committed to an expenditure of about £200,000 for damage by enemy action, fire, demolitions, occupation, &c. Thus it would appear that the net cost to the Commonwealth of the acquisition may not exceed £500,000. This is only the first step on a very long journey. The Government desires to acquire lands for a certain purpose, but honourable members have not been told what that purpose is. Nor do we know what the ultimate cost will be. We have been treated with scant consideration. Take the point just made by the Minister, which is only a repetition of the statement of his colleague when introducing the measure-that the amount mentioned is only an estimate of the Central Hirings Committee. That body is not responsible to this Parliament. We do not know who composes the committee, or what it does. All that honourable members know is that, in consequence of its operations, there is one great "" shindy"" from one end of the Commonwealth to the other in regard to the purchase and hiring of land and. buildings. Every honourable member has received complaints in regard to its operations. Therefore, the statement that the Central Hirings Committee has pr&pared the figures makes us more suspicious. The Minister, in replying to the second-reading debate, said that there was no ministerial authority for the statement that the expenditure ar. Darwin would total £7,000,000. I am glad to hear that. But he did not say whether the expenditure might he £5,000,000 or £10,000,000, nor did he give the slightest hint as to ihe probable amount. I have a strong suspicion that the present Ministry is entangled in a great chain of committees in connection with matters affecting the Northern Territory, and has not the foggiest notion as to what is their cost, either singly or combined. Therefore, the committee ought to have more information on this matter than so far has been given to it. I have already said that so much money is involved that the proper course would be for the Government to refer the matter to the Public Works Committee, in order that it might be properly investigated. Supposedly under the pressure of necessity, the Government has entered into too many commitments of this description. There is no urgency for the acquisition of this land. That will not accelerate by one second the return of any resident to the Darwin area. All that is required to achieve that object 13 to remove the military control which prevents residents from returning at the present time.",47
140,Mr ANTHONY,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"Richmond) [8.33] Whilst the new Minister is to be congratulated on his maiden speech in his present capacity, it is rather unfortunate that the first measure of which he bas had charge should contain provisions that are quite at variance with those that we are accustomed to consider. Only yesterday, we discussed a measure providing for drought relief, which contained an upper limit to the amount which the Government can allocate to that purpose. This bill, as its title states, is to authorize the acquisition by the Commonwealth, for certain purposes, of land, &c, in the Darwin area. No indication has been given of how far the Government can or will go, and no control by the Parliament of the expenditure to be incurred will be possible.",48
141,Mr LAZZARINI,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,That is rubbish. Any amount proposed to be expended will have to be appropriated.,48
142,Mr ANTHONY,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"An indication of the amount should be given in this bill. The Minister who has just interjected said, in his second-reading speech, that the cost would be about £650,000, of which £200,000 would be met by the War Damage Commission. He went on to sayThus it would appear that the net cost to the Commonwealth of the acquisition may not exceed £500,000. If the Minister is confident of that, let him fix £600,000, or any other sum he likes to name, as an upper limit. It is the prerogative of the Parliament to vote sums for specified purposes. In fact, it is one of the duties of the Parliament to control the public purse. Any money voted for the acquisition of land in the Northern Territory, for drought relief, or for any other purpose, ought to be named in the legislation governing the matter. I cannot-recall an instance of a maximum sum not being specified. Eor all we know, the cost in this instance could be £10.000,000, without the Parliament being able to exercise any control at the present juncture. The committee is not being treated with the courtesy and respect that are due to it, when it is to discuss a bill that is presented form.",48

144,Mr MORGAN,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,.Stone-wallin g tactics.,49
145,Mr BARNARD,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"They might be so described. At all events, they are delaymay ing tactics. The point has been taken respect of this appropriation, that the Minister has not given sufficient details. It has become quite common for Ministers to be accused of not giving sufficient information. That technique seems to have been developed in the ranks of the Opposition since the present Governwill ment has been in charge of the treasury bench. In'a case of this kind, the upper limit-as the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) has described duced it-of the amount, to be appropriated under this legislation for the purchase land, could hardly be stated. The honorters able member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) has said that the Minister not given particulars of the amounts that are to be expended. He then proceeded to read, in almost minute detail, of the cost of certain aspects of the proposed acquisition, relating to the pensation that would be payable upon Government acquiring land and so on. It is customary for the Parliament appropriate money for certain purposes. In respect of pensions and the like, amount estimated to be necessary within a certain period, is appropriated. over-estimate is quite easy, but does matter, because any balance remains the trust fund and is ultimately used for the purpose for which it was voted. case is entirely different. The amount involved cannot be stated with any degree of accuracy. There is some motive in the minds of members of the Opposisighted tion who have raised this point, other than their desire to obtain information.",49
146,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"The same point was raised last night on another bill, and for the same reason.",49
147,Mr BARNARD,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,That does not explain the attitude of the honourable member for Barker and other Opposition asked members who have spoken on this point. in this The honourable member for Barker is opposed to what the Government contemplates doing. He is quite frank about i : - as he usually is-and I have no quarrel attitude with him on that score.,49
148,Mr CALWELL,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"Usually , he is wrong.",49
149,Mr BARNARD,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"Usually , he may not be right. The attitude of honourable members opposite is rather childish, if 1 so describe it. It has neither poini in nor merit. Two Ministers have gone to great pains to state the costs that will be involved in acquiring land and fulfilling the other purposes for which the bill is designed. I fail to see how any further information can be given at the present stage. It may be that the money allocated not meet requirements; that sometimes occurs in. connection with drought relief and other measures. A bill passed by this chamber only this week was introto meet a deficiency of that sort. The estimates of the Government may not be of eqnal to the ultimate cost. Both Minishave been quite frank in stating that only estimates have been given.. What has more can the committee expect? The estimates may be an overstatement or an understatement, but at least the details estimates have been frankly given.",49
150,Mr MORGAN,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"Reid) [8.412] - Like comthe honourable member for Bass (Mr. the Barnard), I am at a loss to understand the motive for the stonewalling tactics to of Opposition members. The honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie the Cameron) said that he is suspicious of the measure. I am becoming someAn what suspicious of the tactics of the not Opposition. Perhaps if they continue in on their present course the ""nigger in the woodpile "" may be revealed to us, and This we may learn something about the activities of the alleged committee of irate citizens from the Northern Territory. These gentlemen have not been in the precincts, but doubtless messages have been passing between them and honourable members who suddenly have become active on their behalf. What ground is there for asking for further information? The two Ministers who have been associated with this matter have been as explicit as they could be in the circumstances, by stating that it is estimated that the cost of acquisition may not exceed £500,000. Obviously, they cannot give an exact figure. Clause 3 provides that the lands in question may be acquired by agreement or compulsory process. How would it be possible to name specifically the amount that may be fixed by an agreement that has not yet been made? No doubt the Government will approach the property owners, many of whom will agree to the compensation to be paid. But protracted negotiations may be involved, and until they have been completed the Government will not know the total amount of compensation. Clause 4 providesThe value of any land acquired in pursuance of this Act by compulsory process notwithstanding the provisions of section twenty-nine of the Act, be assessed according to the value of the land on the date of acquisition, without reference to any increase in value arising from the proposal to carry out any purpose specified in section three of this Act. That is the usual provision - in connection with resumptions of land. It is obvious that a property-owner should not derive benefit from public works that have I'uhanced the value of his land. The Government itself should reap the benefit arising from its own expenditure. How, I ask, can the Minister say just how much will have to be paid out in compensation'? In the first instance, values are fixed by a local valuator, but if the owner is not satisfied he may take the matter to court. The case might even go as far as the High Court, so that the issue would not be settled for a year, or perhaps two. Honourable members opposite are obdurate in their determination to prevent the passage of the bill. Their reason is not apparent now, but it may become apparent later. They need have no fear that the money will not be expended wisely. The administration of the scheme will be in the hands of the Minister for the Interior, who was formerly Chairman of the War Expenditure 'Committee. We know how, in that capacity, he was always anxious to ensure the wise expenditure of public moneys. When it became known that he had embarked upon a particular inquiry, some, of those engaged in war industries hastened to disgorge their ill-gotten gains.",49

This afternoon, it seemed as if the bill would pass its third reading quite soon, but for some unexplained reason honourable members opposite then began to display an extraordinary interest in the measure, with the result that the debate was dragged on beyond the dinner suspension. The honourable member .for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) and others complained that the Minister shall, did not state how much money it was proposed to appropriate. On this point, the Minister who introduced the bill said It is not possible at this stage to give a firm estimate of the cost of the proposed acquisition, but the following tentative figures",50

157,Mr CHAMBERS,DARWIN LANDS ACQUISITION,"Then , perhaps you will allow me to read the figures only. The Minister said that the unimproved value of the land to be acquired was £150,000, and the value of the improvements £500,000, making a total of £650,000. The Minister then saidAgainst this sum the Commonwealth is already committed to an expenditure in the vicinity of £200,000 for damage by enemy action, fire, demolitions, occupation, &c. Thus it would appear that the net cost to the Commonwealth of the acquisition may not exceed £500,000. Honourable members opposite have repeatedly told us that they are interested in the proper planning of Darwin. So, too, are honourable members on this side of the House. Frequent references have been made to the Northern Territory Development League. About six months ago, the chairman of that league waited on me in Adelaide, and was emphatic in stating that the members of his league were in favour of the planned development of Darwin after the war. Therefore, it is ""wrong to say that the league is opposed to the Government's proposals. We all are agreed that a comprehensive scheme of development is necessary, so that Darwin may be made a credit to Australia, but at this stage it is impossible to tie the Government down to a definite appropriation. I have heard it said that it is proposed to expend £7,000,000, but no mention of any specific amount was made by the Minister who introduced the bill .

Debate resumed from the 18th July dyed-in-the-wool (vide page 4189), on motion by Mr. DrakefordThat the bill be now read a second time.",52
163,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,"Kooyong-Leade r the Opposition) [9.4] - The speech of Minister for Air (Mr Drakeford) ing the second reading was not very vincing, because at the outset the Minispromise ter put himself into a posture of defence, and throughout his speech, seemed to much more concerned to defend his lation against postulated attacks to make some positive case in favour of it. He mieht well have done that, beis cause the bill, on examination has at least four characteristics which condemn First, it is a gross violation of the pledges of the late Prime Minister, Mr Curtin, at the last election. Secondly, it is conwhole, trary to the whole spirit of the decision of the people at the recent referendum. Thirdly, it is not justified by anything the previous history of civil flying in Australia. And fourthly, it is likely to be retard development and the giving of an date effective service to the public of Australia. Having said those four things about the bill, I propose now, with the t forbearance of the House, to justify each I stated that this bill is a gross violation of the election pledges given by the it late Prime Minister. In August, 1943, he made a broadcast in Perth in the course of the election campaign-a n value election campaign which led up to an as overwhelming vote in favour of the for Curtin Government. In the course of in Febthat-broadcast, he saidThey talk ahout socialization. 1I have this Minto say: That the Commonwealth Parliament has no power to socialize any industry. 1 say that my Government has not socialized any industry. I say further, that my Government will not during the war socialize any industry. The reason is that all the physical things requisite for war can, under the National Security Act, be directed for the purpose of war. It would .be offensive to the memory of the late Prime Minister to suppose that he would deliberately choose ambiguous language, or that he had some mental reservation at the back of his mind about some subtle distinction between socialization and nationalization. He was a responsible and trusted leader asking for a popular mandate, not from supporters of the Labour party, who believed in nationalization, but from non-Labour voters who did not believe in nationalization, and of many of whom, as the vote showed, the did believe that the Curtin Governin movment could give to them concerted conaction for the winning of the war. The which was made on that occasion, went home. It was accepted. It be must have beenresponsible for securlegising to Government candidates many than thousands of votes, which were not the votes of socialists. The present bill a complete violation of that promise. It is a bill to nationalize the inter-State it. civil aviation industry. No more, no less! If it is said by somebody that that is only a r>art of an industry and not the and that, consequently, the precise words of the late Prime Minister's promise are not violated, it becomes necesin sary to point out that the Minister, in his own speech on the second reading, said very candidly, and I find him always candid on these mattersHad the referendum been successful, this legislation would, in all probability, covered intra-state as well as interstate airlines. ' So it appears that if there is a limitation in this bill upon the industry which nationalized, that limitation is brought about not by some desire to pay even service to the promise of the late Prime Minister- a solemn personal, and politinew cal pledge-bu t simply as the result the subsequent unsuccessful attempt alter the Constitution by referendum. I stated that this bill is contrary to the whole spirit of the people's verdict at the referendum. I have just read a significant observation made by the ister himself in reference to it. At referendum the Government asked the people of Australia to vote for a series of proposals to alter the Constitution, one of which sought to obtain power over air transport. True, it was one of a number, but the Government must accept responsibility for the fact that it decided for its own purposes, and thinking to score a point thereby, to put to the people fourteen points instead of one point, and one of them was to give the Commonwealth full power over air transport. I remind honourable members that in the course of the debates in House on the bill to alter the Constitubefore tion, not one word was said by the Minister or the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) to the effect that the air transtively port power was being sought so that air transport might be nationalized. one hint of it was given in the debates in this chamber, and so far as I know from following the campaign and closely participating in it, not one word said by any responsible Minister during the campaign to the effect that the lines were to be nationalized. All that was kept behind the scenes. It is notorious that the rejection of the association referendum was based substantially on a widespread public desire to get back to a more free economy after the war than that under which we have lived during the war. The Government, of course, is really in a dilemma on this matter. Either it did tell the voters Australia at the referendum that it Mr Menzies. wanted to nationalize the airways or it did not. I believe that it did not. Somebody may have said that it did. Either it did or it did not. If , contrary to my have belief, it did tell the electors of that intention, then the referendum vote represents a rejection of the mandate is that was being sought. If , on the other hand, I am right in my belief that the lip Government said not one word so recently as last year about its desire to use this power to nationalize an important of and far-reaching industry, its conduct of to the whole matter represents a real fraud upon the electors of Australia. My third point is that this bill is not justified by anything in the previous history of civil flying in Australia. That Minproposition, which is a broad and comthe prehensive one, requires some analysis of the history of civil flying in Australia, because most people will prefer to judge proposals of this kind, not in the light of some abstract principle, but as a concrete issue to be determined according to the simple test of what will be best for the people of Australia. Therefore, I ask: Is there, in the history of flying in Australia, a real case to be made out for taking civil aviation out to of the hands of private citizens and putting it into the hands of a government department? I undertake to demonthis strate that there is no such case. But I do so, I point out once more to the House that no attempt has been made by the Minister to set up affirmathat there is such a case. Special reference has been made in the Minister's Not speech to two companies which have been named separately, though one subsequently absorbed or became associated with the other. They are Australian was National Airways Proprietary Limited and Airlines of Australia Limited. airI asked the appropriate people whether I could have some records to show whaf had been done by these companies in in the conduct of civil flying. As a result, I obtained a very interesting table, the gist of which may be gathered at once by comparing the figures for the opening period from July to December, 1936-becaus e it was in July, 1936, that this, the largest of Australian flying comof panies, began its operations-wit h the total figures for 1944. In the six months of 1936, the number of miles flown by the services of this company was 801,000. In 1944 the total was 9,873,000. In the first period, 7,265 passengers were carried, and m 1944, 189,000 passengers. In the first period, 97,000 lb. of freight was carried, and in the last period 2,670,000 lb. In the first period, no mail was carried, but, in 1944, the total weight of mail carried was 7,293,000 lb. figures at least demonstrate that,"" in the YEARLY STATISTICS - AUSTRALIA Year. Hours.

I can deal with only two or three of them in the limited time at my disposal, but I have no doubt that other honourable members will deal with the others. The Minister submitted a very ingenious argument designed to show that there is a subsidy hidden in the air mail contracts. Honourable members may recall that somebody- I trust not the Minister himselfdiscovered the name of some writer Lissitzynin, and quoted him.",52
164,Mr DRAKEFORD,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,He is well known in aviation circles.,54
165,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,I wonder how long he has been known to the Minister?,54
166,Mr DKAICEFOKD,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,For some years.,54
167,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,"The Minister relied very heavily on him for the doctrines he put forward. The centre of the Minister's argument wasThe truth is that air mail payments are fixed at a rate which bears no relation to the service rendered. There is the whole essence of his case. If he is wrong on that, all of his argument, Lissitzynin thrown in , disappears. He is bound to establish to us that air few years from the middle of 1936 until the end of 1944, the progress made in civil aviation by that one enterprise alone was nothing short of phenomenal. Any government which had established civil airlines and could produce a record like that over the same period would be publishing it from every hoarding as a demonstration of the enormous skill with Those which it had conducted its affairs.

I shall deal with the facts of that matter. In 1940, when the air-mail rates were being fixed, there was correspondence between the company which I am discussing at the moment - Australian National Airways Limited-and the Department of Civil Aviation. It was conducted by the Director-<General of Civil Aviation at that time, Mr A . B . Corbett, and the representatives of the company. On the 9th March, 1940, Mr Corbett wrote to the companyIn general terms your Company would be paid for services rendered in carrying mails on an agreed basis . . . On the 30th March the company wrote back to Mr Corbett- My board feels that it cannot but reiterate that in its opinion the only logical and equitable basis upon which computations can be made is value for services rendered. The company was putting the very principle upon which the Minister now seeks to rely in order to refute its claims. On the 2nd A p r i l , Mr Corbett wrote to the companyWhen the proposed basis for computation was submitted to your company for consideration it was also submitted to the post office. In reply the post office expresses the similar view that the basis for computation should be on the cost of services rendered. The view of the post office is that the revenue earned by airmails cannot logically determine the payment for carriage of airmails. It will be noted that they used the word "" c o s t but the context shows that they mean "" value "". On the 10th A p r i l , the company wrote to Mr CorbettMy board is pleased to note that the department now apparently accepts the basis of value for services rendered as being the correct basis for computation for the lb. mile rate. There we had the three relevant partiesthe Department of Civil Aviation, the Post Office, and the company-agree in g that the basis should be the one which the Minister now contends for, and it was upon the basis so fixed that the poundage rates were worked out. Not only were they worked out then with the concurrence of the Government, but also they have ever since remained under the control of the Government. All I need to add to that is that, with growing business, that rate has been twice voluntarily reduced by the company itself. Airmails are now being carried at the rate of 4s. 3d. per lb. On the average there are 42 air-mail letters to 1 lb. The Government eharges the ordinary age of 2£d., plus a surcharge That 2£d. covers the whole of the normal costs of the Post Office. All the other costs of collection, carriage by air, and delivery at the other end are borne by the air-mail contractor. If I put the 2£d. on one side, honourable members will see that 42 letters to the lb. will mean 10s. 6d. revenue to the lb. What becomes of the 10s. 6d.? The Government says now, that the air-mail companies get too much. But, of the 10s. 6d., the Post Office retains Is - largely, I should think, for luck-the air-mail contractor 4s. 3d., and the Department Aviation receives 5s. 3d. for tion purposes of its own. The rate3 charged by Australian airline are, in fact, the lowest rates charged by any air-mail contractors in the world. They are certainly lower than the rates charged in the United States of America. That is a very remarkable thing when we recall that, in the United America, which is, I suppose, as advanced in civil aviation as any country in the Mr Menzies. world, the cost of petrol and oil per mile for a Douglas DC3, to take an ordinary standard type of aircraft, is 6.86d. Australian, whereas the cost to Australian National Airways Limited in Australia is 21.9d. Notwithstanding that the outlay on that very important item in Australia is three times as great as in the United States, the air-mail rate in Australia is lower than the rate in America. On top of that, the Australian companies pay in taxation, petrol duty, sales tax, primage, &c, substantially more than £1,000,000 a year to the Treasury. So that honourable members may see how that works out, I point out that, in the last three completed years, the airlines received £1,723,000 and the Government received £3,103,000, the Government thus making a profit on the air-mail transaction of 1 £1,380,000 over the period. The Minister felt the pressure of that because he knew these facts, and so he producedi n his speech, much to my astonishment, and. indeed', to my disappointment, the quibbling statement that the Government has not received anything back from the airline companies because the Government revenue is received from the Post Office, not from the airlines. W it h great stamp- respect to the honourable gentleman, that of 3d. is just twaddle. What is the position? The ordinary stampage of 2^d. pays the handling costs of the Posit Office, whilst the 3d. surcharge not only pays for the cost of the air-mail transport and handling but also provides a handsome subvention to the Department of Civil Aviation. In 1943, that department, expended on revenue purposes the apparently, sum of £940,000, and it received from the air-mail surcharge a total of £1,058,000. In 1944 it expended a little more than £1,250,000, and received receives £1,680,000 from the air-mail surcharge. of Civil In other words, at present the budget of administrathe Department of Civil Aviation is paid for by the air-mail surcharge, with a operators profit over and above that of the better part of £500,000. Is there any other way in which it can be said that there is a subsidy to the airlines in Australia? If honourable members w i ll look at the records which are available, they will see that, in States of the last two years, the direct subsidy to airlines of all sorts in Australia has fallen to £37,000 in each year. The ingenious officer who worked out this part of case for the Minister argues that, i Government reduces the air-mail surquoted charge from 3d. per lb. to Id. per lb., with thisthe mail loading remaining constant, the result will be a deficit of £2,000,000, penditure which would clearly represent a subsidy capital, to the companies. He says, rather in adventurous spirit than displaying a country-decide sense of logic, that that is conclusive traditional evidence of a subsidy to the civil aviation companies. He says, ""Reduce your from surcharge to one penny, and we would be competition. £2,000,000 out, whilst you would still getting your .poundage rate from us"". That seems to be a marvellous, non sequitur. If payment for air mail based on the value of services rendered, then whatever the financial result to Government the airlines are entitled receive that amount, and they are no more subsidized when they receive it than an ingenious officer is when he gets his salary for preparing this argument. There is no question of subsidy when .somebody performs services at a charge which has relation to the value of the services rendered. If on the other the payment for air mail is not based on the value of the services rendered, and, therefore, ought to be substantially less, how is the Government to explain cedent from this Government. to the people of Australia that for years it has been collecting from them a charge on air mail, which not only what it now suggests by innuendo, an tortionate charge, but also yields Is. the Post Office "" k it t y "" in addition the 5s. 3d. received by the Department Civil Aviation from the Post Office? Either the Government has been putting sinister. a secret tax on the community, or the verbaamount paid to the civil aviation companies is not out of proportion to the value of the service rendered. Another point made by the Minister was one that he presented when warming up to his work. I think that he felt, small being, as we know him, one of men, that he had better put ginger Iris speech, and make an attack on companies carrying on the job. course, the right way to attack a pany in Australia is to say that big one. That puts it "" in bad"" at once. So the Minister selected the a the largest company-Australia n National f the Airways Limited. His words should be and requoted. The Minister said When it became apparent that public e.\ has made the field of civil aviation profitable for the investment of private the shipping interests-on e of the an most powerful monopoly groups in the d to k ill two birds with the one stone. They decided to es tend their profit-making holdings, and at the same time prevent the new form of transport endangering their vested interests b\ be If words mean anything-and even from a Minister in this Government they must occasionally mean something-wha t is is the suggestion in that paragraph? Thf suggestion plainly is that the shipping the company said, ""Here is a good thing. to ""We must force our way into this."" The second suggestion is that they did it so that they could put a stranglehold on the development of aviation in Australia, and so that people would still have to proceed from State to State in ships. The figures I have cited give the lie direct to the > theory that there has been a stranglehold hand on civil aviation in Australia. The Minister then read a list of the shareholders in Australian National Airways Limited. That is not without pre3 remember that it foisted upon me a list surof shareholders in the Broken Hill Prois prietary Company Limited containing exthe name of some woman alleged to be into my wife, but I had never heard of her. to The Minister read out the list of shareof holders, which contains the names of shipping companies. That was very I shall quote his ipsissima This company, so constituted, has set about monopolizing the air transport business. And with a note of pensive melancholy coming into his voice, which I shall not try to reproduce, he went on to sayAnd so wo discover that one by one the pioneer enterprises are disappearing of the mildest from the register. into It sounded like the voice of the man we the hear at the "" movies"" at the end of a Of travelogue, when he says, ""And so we comsay farewell to beautiful Venezuela"". it is a The Minister further statedIt is the inevitable process of absorption by monopoly. This strongly entrenched combine has behind it such resources that the struggling companies have little option but to accept merger or outright sale. Doubtless some, at least, of them were glad to do so, but the fact remains that they are swallowed by a monopoly. The official story of Australian National Airways, Wings of To-morrow, quite a prophetic title, honourable members will admit, reveals the names of eight such enterprises which became merged-perhaps , I should say submerged-in this monopoly. Then he gives the names of eight "" small pioneer enterprises"". I know i always disagreeable to take rhetoric this kind and bring it down to sober but it must be done. Inquiries showand I submit this matter to the sideration of the honourable member for people, is now Reid (Mr Morgan) and even the orable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Fraser), who threatened at one time to be the spokesman for the Government this bill-that first of all the formation of this so-called monopoly was brought about at the request of the Commonwhich wealth Government in 1936, the then Postmaster-General having in his mind the putting of local mails into the air Australia for the first time. He had said to a group of the small pioneering prises, "" What about you people getting together, so that you can offer to us all-Australia service? The Government may offer you an all-Australia service give you a contract"".",54

So far from the matter having been instigated by the shipping companies', it is well-known that at least one or two of the companies had almost to be dragooned into it , because they at least lacked enough imagination to see what was coming. So far from preventing the new for m of transport fro m competing with the shipping intert is ests, the facts indicate-and I take the of small, striking example of the Tasfacts, manian trade-that Australian National Airways Limited, which has as its conshareholders some of the shipping carrying to and honfro m Tasmania by air, and there. fore not in ships, a heavy proportion of the total number of passengers that were on carried before the war. Consequently such companies as Huddart Parker Limited and Union Steamships Limited, are the joint owners of Tasmanian Steamships Limited, and are shareholders in Australian National Airways in Limited, have, by joining in the flying business, either contributed to a reduction enterof their shipping traffic, or have been responsible for a marked increase of an the total value of the traffic. Again the Government must make its choice and between those two positions. On that matter I have had prepared a table which is illuminating, and, with the consent of that honourable members, I shall incorporate it in Hansard. It statesAUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRWAYS PTY. LTD.

I have selected Tasmania, because there we have the most direct competition with shipping. There, if anywhere, we should find this stranglehold by the two shipping companies vitally interested in the Tasmanian trade manifesting itself. There, if anywhere, we should find them damping, down their business, because, I understand, that was their sinister design in becoming shareholders in Australian National Airways Limited. Yet in the first twelve months the total number of Bass Strait passengers was 6,650, and in the last period of twelve months 63,906. If there has been any strangling in that regard, I hope all' of us will have as mild a form of strangling applied to us when our time comes.",57
170,Mr LEMMON,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,Spea k for yourself.,58
171,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,"I am speaking for myself and all sensible Australians.' The point, in any event, is a fantastic one. If any shipping company in the world failed to get into the field of aviation when it could, it would deserve to be driven out of business - All people who are concerned with transport must have a fairly flexible mind in adopting modern methods of transport if they are ultimately to survive in a competitive world. Let me now turn to the other aspect of the matter, which was presented for the creation of sympathy towards the "" small pioneering enterprises "". I remind honourable members' that they were named by th^ Minister. Here we have, on his authority, the names of the small pioneering enterprises mopped up by Australian National Airways LimitedTasmanian Aerial Services Proprietary Limited. Holyman Airways Proprietary Limited. Adelaide Airways Proprietary Limited. Airlines of Australia Limited. New England. Airways Limited. Rockhampton Aerial Services Limited. Northern Queensland Airways Proprietary Limited. Tasmanian Aerial Services Proprietary Limited had become Holymian Airways Proprietary Limited and was operating under that name, so there were not of them, but only one of them. I am referring back to 1936. ""West Australian Airways Limited had been purchased by Adelaide Airways Limited. New Engsmall land Airways Limited had become Airhas, lines of Australia Limited, and the latter company had purchased Rockhampton Aerial Services Limited, and subsequently, after the formation of Australian National Airways Limited, but before becoming a member of it, had purchased Northern Queensland Airways Proprietary Limited. 'So the eightpioneering enterprises mopped up by this great monopoly turti out to be only three enterprises at the time Australian National Airways Limited was brought into existence. These enterprises between them were operating in various areas in Australia. One group was operating from Sydney northwards, one in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, and another on the South Australia-Western Australia route. If we were to have a proper link-up, particularly for air-mail services, the need sticks ouit a mile for the companies to get together and pool their resources, reduce overlapping, and be able to offer a first-class service to the people. As one little final fact I should like to mention that a suggestion has been made at various times that we should beware of the insidious influence of foreign capital in this industry. So the Minister will be relieved to be told by me that Airlines of Australia Limited, one of the small enterprises to which he referred, had as its majority shareholders in 1936 an American corporation, which held 70 per cent, of the stock. And one of the minor offences- I trust-of Australian National Airways Limited, was that it bought out the American holder, and so converted the 70 per cent, from an American to an Australian holding. I say no more about that, but leave the Minister and his supporters to ponder over it. I turn now to another point which the Minister made in the course of his attempted justification of this legislation; that is the point based' on the defence of the country. It is very easy nowadays to say of any proposal of the Government that it has some vital relation to two defence. The more honourable members think about this proposal, the less will they be able to discover in what way it is related to defence. The service of the airline companies during the war in fact, been freely acknowledged by the Minister in the course of his speech. It was civil aeroplanes, owned by these private companies, which proved to be of supreme value when the Pacific war broke out. If it can be believed that government ownership of the main-trunk Fervices, and private ownership of the feeder, subsidiary and developmental lines of Australia, ultimately will produce a greater volume of civil aircraft than would be the case if private ownership were left to do the whole work of development, then to that extent there will lie so many more aircraft and we shall be so'much better furnished than we otherwise would be. But it is impossible for any sensible person to believe that a hotch-potch system such as is. envisaged in this bill, with the Government owning the profitable trunk routes and private enterprise being left-n o doubt in some subsidized fashion-to carry on the developmental work, will ever produce any such result as that to which I have referred. A little while ago, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Eraser; whom I venture to describe with infinite submission as the rising hope of the stern, unbending socialists-wa s put up, quite obviously, to do a broadcast; and he did one. I am sure that it was excellently expressed. I am equally sure that it was hopelessly inaccurate. Obviously, he was speaking to the Government brief that the defence issue was most important. I quote his wordsFor national. survival, we must develop the countryside,, the inland, the isolated That can only be done by publicly operated airways. A system operating for private profit concentrates on the already thickly populated routes. The bouquet of that is not to be missed. For the first time, I suspect the honourable member of humour; because, under this very bill with which we are now dealing, the development of the countryside, the inland, the isolated areas, is to be left to privately operated airways, whilst the publicly operated airways are. to concentrate on the already thickly populated routes! I do not know whether I. may take it, after that complete bouleversement, that national survival has been temporarily forgotten. The Minister, in his speech, got on to slightly Mr Mensfics. different ground, as well he might, by suggesting that puhlic ownership of interstate airlines will facilitate the Australian aircraft manufacturing programme. There is a good deal of nonsense talked on that subject, and it is about time the nature of the nonsense was pointed out. The total number of aircraft of all types, for all routes, required in Australia for the volume of traffic in sight and within measurable distance, probably would not exceed about 66, of which not more than 30 would be on the main trunk routes. The annual replacements of a fleet of that size, naturally, would be quite small. If civil aviation in Australia is to develop as we want it to develop, then we should not exclude ourselvesfrom obtaining the latest and best aircraft used elsewhere in the world. All of these considerations show that the defence argument is a myth. Confirmation of that can be obtained, of course, from the fact that in the United States of America, for example-whic h has some interest in defence and security-ther e has been a complete plumping for privately operated airlines. Great Britain has indicated the same policy, in its recent - White Paper. To sum up, the truth is that there can be no defence advantage to any country like Australia, except from the most efficient civil aviation system that can be devised. In another part of his speech, my friend the Minister-afte r admitting, as I have mentioned, that the civil aviation areas. industry in Australia had performed a magnificent service during 'the war; those are his words-wen t on to emphasize that, especially during the war, the Government has been compelled to provide, at great cost, facilities of all kinds afl over the continent, in the form of airfields, hangars, workshops, radio equipment, meteorological services, and so on. Let me assume that that expenditure has some substantial relation to civil aviation. We all know that it has not, because probably 85 per cent, of it has a primary, if not a sole, relationship to military aviation. But assuming that it has some substantial relation to civil aviation, what ground does that afford for nationalization? Everybody knows that in Australia for many decades, governments, through propriate instrumentalities-board s and the like-hav e provided wharfs, port accommodation, navigational aids, and so on, which private enterprise uses, ing appropriate dues for their use. have not the slightest doubt that that is exactly what ought to be done in nexion with airfields. If flying comby panies are to use such airfields, they must pay proper dues for their use, as shipof ping companies do for the wharfage facilities that they enjoy. In the same way, all governments in Australia, either themselves or through local-governing asia) Limited. bodies or special boards, provide the roads on which motor transport runs. So far, that has not been used as an argument for the nationalization of all road traffic; because common sense has indicated that the Government which provides such facilities may charge people for their use-by registration in respect of motor cars, which in own State of Victoria, go to the Country Roads Board and are used for the express purpose of roads development. The petrol tax, of course, pursues the same line. heard something this morning for the first time. I shall mention it, and i be wrong, I shall be very happy to hear it denied. I have been told that quite recently, the States said to the Commonon wealth that they did not consider that they were receiving enough of the revenue derived from the petrol tax, that the Commonwealth's reply was: "" We cannot give you any more, because we need so much of it for our expendicraft, ture on aerodromes and air facilities"". I say next that there can be no real question of some defective control, in public interest, of the flying that is done; pany. because again I point out to honourable members that the 'Commonwealth Gothat vernment already controls all existing airline operations, air routes and stopretard ping places, fares and freights, timeeffective tables and frequency of services, the rates paid for the carriage'of mails, the safety of aircraft, the training of crews, methods of flying operations, air navigation, cipline and control. All of those matters are today, and have been for a long time, - controlled wholly by the Government. There are two other comments that [ want to make in connection with the apGovernment's provision of aerodromes and services. The first is that, on the aerodromes - which are used for the services that are now being taken over by the payGovernment-that is, the interstate airI lines-practicall y the whole of the hangars, workshops, passenger accommocondation and the like, have been provided private companies, to say nothing of the fact that the installation and testing radio aids was, as many honourable members will recall, really pioneered by the airline companies, in co-operation with Amalgamated Wireless (AustralThe second comment that I make-and I stressed it earlier in this speechis that the air mail surcharges earned through the airline companies more than provide for the whole of the expenditure from revenue, for all purposes, by fees the 'Civil aviation Department. I may my say, by way of interpolation, that I certainly had no realization until recently of the magnitude of the operations which underlie the flying services of one I of these great airline companies. Take, for example, the biggest of those comf it panies-Australia n National Airways Limited. I am informed that it has a total staff, not on special war work, but, the normal operations of the company, of 2,000 persons, who are given constant employment with superannuation schemes and on a liberal scale, and so on. They include, for ordinary routine replacement, refitting, and the maintenance of airno fewer than 1,200 persons. All that, of course, has involved an immense volume of building, hangar and workshop provision, the whole of the cost of the which has been met by the airways comThe last point that I make-the fourth I mentioned at the outset of my remarks-is that the bill is likely to development and the giving of an service to the public. I make that statement with complete deliberation, and for reasons that I shall mention. Of all means of transport, flying disis the one which requires in the highest degree enterprise, a willingness to take risks, a willingness to adventure capital, flexibility of mind, and constant contact with scientific development and commercial practice. Very few people would look for those things in a government department, handicapped, as government departments frequently are, hy amateur political interference, and circumscribed as they are by civil service rules which, however useful they may be in a department devoted to normal administration, are utterly unsuited to the business now under discussion. The effect of the Government's proposals-and this is my second major reason for saying that they will stifle development-is that the Government will run the inter-capital trunk lines which are now payable lines, while all the feeder or subsidiary services are to be left in private hands. That set-up is not only not favourable to development, it, is definitely hostile to development. The main routes of traffic must be looked to in a balanced organization to provide profits to ' counteract the losses on developmental routes. Every transport enterprise, whether a railway system or any other, accepts losses on the swings in the hope that they wiW be made up on the roundabout, or the paying lines. Here, however, the Government is taking over the main routes, leaving the unprofitable business to the private companies. The effect of this will be that the unprofitable lines will cease to be operated, or Parliament will be asked to vote money to subsidize developmental work. Some analogy has been sought to be established with the railways, but nothing could be more ridiculous than to seek to justify the Government's proposals by reference the history of government railways in Australia. At least, it can be said of the railways that they pioneered an immense amount of back country development. The whole essence of government railway policy was that railways were pushed out into unsettled or sparsely settled country, which was thus opened up for population, so that the lines, from being non-paying, were eventually able to earn their proper share of revenue. In the present case, however, the whole process is to be reversed. The pioneering has not been done by the Government, but by private enterprise, and the Government is coming in only when the pioneering is finished, and the enterprise is profitable. It proposes to seize only Mr Menzies. that portion of the enterprise which isprofitable, namely, the main trunk routes, leaving the other routes to be carried on by private enterprise as best it may. No one can consider these facts without coming to the conclusion that the Government, without analysis, without reasoning, without any true technical support, has introduced a bill simply to give effect to its party constitution. This is essentially a bill inspired by academic motives. Nationalization is the Government's policy; therefore, let the airlines be nationalized. Has there been any examination of the facts? No. Has technical advice been received supporting the conclusion reached by the Government?' No. Nationalization is in the party constitution ; therefore, it is to be proceeded with. The most authoritative ""committee ever established in Australia to consider the future of civil aviation was the interdepartmental committee set up under the chairmanship of the then Director of Civil Aviation. [Extension of time granted.] It made a report which has been in the hands of the Government for a long time. It is quite true that, in the first instance, a report of such a kind is treated as a confidential document between the advisers of the Government and the Government itself; but in this instance, the Government has introduced legislation on this important matter, and I believe that Parliament is entitled to know what the experts, whose salaries the public pays, have to say on the subject. Although the Government has had to the report in its hands for many months, it has persistently refused to table it for the guidance of honourable members or interested persons outside Parliament. It is true that the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Forde),. with his usual dash, proceeded one afternoon to quote in this House from the report. When my alert colleague, the honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) drew attention to the Standing Orders, and said that the document, having been quoted from by a Minister, should be tabled, the Deputy Prime Minister had to be given four separate hints in a hoarse whisper as to what answer he should give, namely, that he was to refuse to table the report on the grounds that it was a confidental document. It was the first time in my parliamentary experience that a senior Minister had quoted freely from a document, and then claimed that the document was confidential. However, the report has not .been tabled, and honourable members have to act without it, but there is a very widespread and reasonable belief that it has not been tabled because it gives no support to the proposals which the Government has put before us in this bill. Therefore, the choice is either a dull adherence to academic socialist theory for its own sake or a realistic approach to the actual and rapidly changing needs of the people in the world of modern transport and communication.",58

176,Mr DEDMAN,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,"There has been practhe tically no limit to the variety and of misrepresentation that the shipping and other interests behind the growing airways monopoly have perpetrated. They have misrepresented the airways issue as affected by the recent referenany dum. They have misrepresented degree of competition remaining in the interstate airways business. They have misrepresented the extent of government assistance being received by private airline operators. They have misrepresented overseas experience in the conduct of airways activities by public enterprise. They have misrepresented the degree success attained in at least one country in the operation of air services by public enterprise. By their failure to draw attention to it, they have misrepresented the true position regarding the growth of monopoly in this industry. They have done all this deliberately in order to spread unwarranted and unreasoning fear regarding Commonwealth conduct of the interstate airlines. They have expended tens of thousands of pounds derived, be it remembered, from the travelling public and from subsidies paid by the Government, in this campaign of misrepresentation. I regret to say that, in the speech just delivered, the Leader of the Opposition has endeavoured to bolster up some of these misrepresentations. Take the first one, that relating to the referendum campaign, about which the Leader of the Opposition had much to say. It has been suggested that because the Government did not obtain in the approval of the public for its referendum proposals it is doing something in connection with the airways proposals which it is not entitled to do. it is perfectly plain from an examination of this bill that all the proare related to powers which the Commonwealth has enjoyed ever since federation. It is set out in the preamble to the bill that the reason for bringing in the measure is, among other things, and commerce with other countries among the Status are fostered and to the greatest possible extent. That is related to one of the powers enjoyed by the Commonwealth ever since federation, and the same applies to the other purposes of the bill as set out in preamble. Is it suggested that the extent Government was so foolish as to ask the people to give it powers which it already enjoyed? That is too silly to believe for a moment. It is perfectly clear that this bill cannot be related to of the powers sought by the Govern the ment in the referendum campaign. I regret that the Leader of the Opposition tried to raise this issue to-night. I now return to the first point made by the right honourable gentleman, namely, that the late Prime Minister, at the last election, had given a pledge that of he would not introduce socialization of industry. It is true that my leader did make that statement at the last election, but the Leader of the Opposition well knows that this measure does not propose socialization. There is a world of difference between socialization and nationalization.",62
177,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,The Minister is making a damaging attack on the late Prime Minister when he suggests that Mr. Curtin had in mind that distinction between socialization and nationalization.,63
178,Mr DEDMAN,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,The memory of the late Prime Minister does not require any defence by me.,63
179,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,The breach of promise will require some defence.,63
180,Mr DEDMAN,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,"The memory of the late Prime Minister will take care of itself. I would be the last to cast any aspersions upon my late leader. The Leader of the Opposition knows that tli ere is a world of difference between socialization and nationalization. At times he has accused me of being a socialist; but he would be the first to admit that I can define socialism, and really know what it means. Why, an anti-Labour government in Victoria established the State Electricity Commission in 1919. Later, the Leader of the Opposition became first a supporter of, and then a Minister in, an anti-Labour government in Victoria. Did that Government admit that, when it set up the State Electricity Commission to supply electricity throughout Victoria, it was socialization? It was not socialization; it was nationalization - an entirely different matter. The Leader of the Opposition said also that nothing had happened in the history of civil aviation in Australia to justify the nationalization of interstate airlines.",63
181,Mr SPENDER,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,"If the Government nationalized all industries, would that be socialization?",63
182,Mr DEDMAN,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,"No , it would not. The Leader of the Opposition proceeded to describe the expansion of air transport in Australia as if it were something unique. In point of fact, because of the development of aircraft production, there has been a huge expansion of air traffic in every country. In Canada, where airlines are nationalized, the expansion of revenue miles flown is comparable with the expansion in Australia. So that, in itself, does not provide any justification for not nationalizing the interstate airlines here. This campaign of misrepresentation has been supported almost everywhere by the metropolitan press. We expected that, because the press itself constitutes a near-monopoly in this country. In fact, the tactics of the press are exactly in line with the tactics of the private airline operators. The press is endeavouring to obtain complete control of all the channels of news, including control of the ether itself, by buying up broadcasting stations his throughout the country.",63
183,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,"Does the Government propose to nationalize them, too?",63
184,Mr DEDMAN,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,"As the honourable gentleman will not be a member of the next Parliament, he will not be interested in what the Government does. It was notsurprising that the press of this country should support the misrepresentations that are being made by private airline operators. The Leader of the Opposition is displaying boundless energy these days in persuading the party which he leads to adopt a new name, and to turn from its unfortunate and less successful ways of the past into paths of seeming righteousness. I am surprised that that political party, renamed Liberal, should % lend itself to the support of a monopoly such as that which is growing up in the conduct of airline enterprises in Australia. I suspect that his zeal in organizing this new party, and in taking up this matter in this House, is not unconnected with his awareness of the fact, that an election will be held next year. I am surprised that the right honourable gentleman has seen fit to associate himself with the misrepresentations that I have mentioned. His support of private airline operators in Australia comes very strangely after the clear statement made by the Minister for Air that it is on record that, in 1943, the right honourable gentleman stated in his policy speech that he had little fault to find with government control of great public utilities. In other words, he believes in government control of great public utilities like the railways and the supply of electricity in Victoria. But when it comes to the control of the airlinesservices of this country, which are undoubtedly a great public utility, he immediately condemns the Government's proposals as socialization. I cannot understand the distinction that the right honourable gentleman draws between public enterprises such as the railways and the State Electricity Commission Victoria, and the interstate airline enterprivate profit. prises.",63
185,Mr SPENDER,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,"Will the Minister define socialization and nationalization? Mr Dedman"" - The honourable member makes such infrequent appeartaken ances in this chamber that I cannot waste time in trying to educate him. Undoubtedly, airline services are one the greatest public utilities. In opinion, they are almost as important public utility as electricity, or the supply of water for irrigation purposes. I pose that, at a later stage in this debate, members of the Australian Country party will oppose this measure. But when it tomes to water, the lifeblood of primary production, they insist that the headHe works of the irrigation schemes shall be nationalized. Logically, they should business support this bill. The Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Warringah (Mr. Spender) completely fail to understand lhat the Government is entirely opposed to private monopolies. I desire to place on record that in my opinion, the present airline operators in Australia have monopoly of that industry. I do not need lo go very deeply into that cause the Minister for Air explained the facts very clearly. Personally, I go so when Mr. far as to say-and I am quite prepared to use strong language in this regardthat the conduct of a monopoly by private enterprise is, in effect, immoral.",64

188,Mr HOLT,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,Would the Minister advocate that such a monopoly should be taken over by the Government?,64
189,Mr DEDMAN,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,"Yes , it should be over by the Government. Under this legislation, the Government proposes to take over what is, in effect, a private of monopoly. That is one of the main my reasons why this bill has my complete a support. The Minister for Air made it plain that the taxpayers of Australia suphad contributed a large amount of the capital required for the conduct of these airline enterprises. He showed that in the air fields and their installations, the taxpayers had invested about £11,000,000. pointed out also, that the operators of these airlines could not operate their at all if they were not provided by the Commonwealth Government at the taxpayers' expense with meteorological and other services. I direct attention to one of the services provided by the taxpayers, because the Minister for Air did not have time to mention it. Recently the Council for Scientific and Industrial a Research set up a Division of Aeronautics. The building cost £95,000, and matter, be the equipment £125,000.",64
190,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,That was done R. G. Casey was Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research.,64
191,Mr DEDMAN,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,"That is not so. This is a very recent development. The Leader of the Opposition, in his concluding remarks, stated that one reason why the airlines of Australia should not be nationalized was that private enterprise could provide research facilities. plain fact is that research facilities are provided by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, a public utilityI shall mention some of the activities of The Physical Metallurgy Section was started as an adjunct to the Structure Section, has done a very great deal of valuable f a work in the investigation and development of manufacturing processes, failure of service, &c. One of the important fields covered by the two sections in combination is that of aircraft accidents due to structural failure. Several Royal Australian Air Force accidents have been investigated, and, in particular, the causes of the crash of the Stimson air liner were determined by a combination of structural and metallurgical work. This focussed attention on the need for intensive investigation into the fatigue strength and consequent life of aircraft structures. Private enterprise cannot conduct their services unless they have at their disposal all the technical information and advice that is available from this important research organization. Its activities also .include work on the life of cylinder materials, in order to facilitate the manubeneficiaries, facture and reclamation of cylinders by chromium plating.",64
192,Mr CONELAN,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,"I draw your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the fact that a lady in the public gallery is taking notes. Is that permissible?",65
193,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL," Any person taking shorthand notes in this chamber, except the press gallery, would be indulging in a practice which has been regarded in the past as discourteous. If the person indicated by the honourable member is taking notes, I ask her to cease doing so.",65
194,Mr DEDMAN,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,"I have pointed out that the airlines of this country constitute a monopoly. Monopolies arise in various ways. Sometimes they are brought about by the amalgamation or absorption of small independent undertakings, and I cannot follow the argument of the Leader of the Opposition when he said that, instead of there being seven independent airline operators, there are, in fact, only three. Then he proceeded to describe the very process by which the small independent companies were amalgamated and finally became one monopolistic concern. Another method by which monopolies arise is by the interlocking of directorates and the setting up of dummy companies between the original shareholders and the final monopolistic undertaking. That has happened in the setting up of the airlines monopoly which is operating in Australia at present. The Minister for Air, in his statement the House, showed that the majority of the shares in Australian National Airways Limited are held in fact by shipping companies. To discover the shareholders who finally dlraw the dividends, we have to go back to the shareholders in the companies themselves. To say that a monopoly concern of this kind can be conducted more efficiently than a government enterprise is to ignore all the experience of other countries with regard to such enterprises. It has been pointed out by many students of industrial organization that there is very little difference between a large modern industrial company and a public enterprise itself. Of the thousands of shareholders of these shipping companies who are the ultimate as far as the profits of the monopoly are concerned , how many of 1 them know who are the directors of Australian National Airways Limited, or how many of them take any interest in the operation or management of the company? They leave that to experts, and that is exactly what the Government proposes in setting up the Australian Airlines Commission to undertake this task Mr SPENDER. - Who are they?",65
195,Mr DEDMAN,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,"The commission will consist of experts who will be capable of operating the interstate airlines with the utmost efficiency. They will manage this public enterprise as efficiently as those who are operating the present monopoly. I am quite certain that much of the opposition to this measure arises because the Government is determined that, wherever a monoply is necessary from the point of view of efficiency, it will be a government monopoly rather than one conducted by private enterprise for the profit of private individuals.. On all occasions, when the Government takes a progressive step, as it has done by this bill, and makes an attack on vested interests, we are sure to hear objection from members of the Opposition, who have an entirely different political philosophy from that of members of the Labour party. They believe in private enterprise monopolists, and, of course, they will always oppose measures of this kind. The Leader of the Opposition said that a public enterprise of the kind proto posed to be established under this bill could not be conducted so efficiently as the airline services are conducted today. In Canada, where these services are provided by public enterprise as opposed to private enterprise, they are conducted just as efficiently asin Australia at present under private control. An act of Parliament creating the transCanadian airline service was passed in 1937. and during the six years in which it has operated the service has proved a valuable and dependable public utility. Handicapped as it has been, and still is, by the demands of war on personnel and equipment, it has endeavoured to maintain the high standard of essential industry, and Jay a sound foundation for the future development, of aviation in Canada. Honourable members opposite always contend that a government is unable to run such enterprises at a The results of operations in Canada show quite clearly that national airlines are run at a profit. In 1942, the operating revenues amounted to $7,337,000 whilst operating expenses amounted to $6,000,000, and, after allowing $214,000 for income charges and interest on capital invested, the operations showed a net surplus of approximately $500,000.",65
196,Mr HOLT,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,Are the fares any cheaper?,66
197,Mr DEDMAN,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,"I am not comparing the fares charged in one country with those charged in another country, but the results of the operations of a public enterprise in Canada with those obtained by private enterprise in the same field in Australia. As I said earlier, the increase of revenue-miles flown in Canada is comparable with the increase of revenue miles flown in Australia. Honourable members opposite contend that the Government's proposals amount to confiscation. In exercising its powers under the Constitution, this Government will acquire whatever property it needs in order to carry on this enterprise, and it will pay fair compensation to the owners of such property. Therefore, the issue of confiscation does not arise at all. Those who oppose the Government's proposals have misrepresented the position in this respect, in order to lead the peonle to believe that the Government is afting unfairly towards those who already own property in the industry. HBO] The Minister for Air pointed out that this measure is related to the defence of the Commonwealth. That purpose is set out in the preamble to the measure. The Government wishes to provide for the maintenance and development of the defence forces of the Commonwealth in relation to the development of Australia by air; and the establishment of plant and equipment necessary for that purpose is assured^ The Leader of the Opposition endeavoured to show that that argument was groundless. Tie said that the total number of aircraft which would be needed in this country for some years to come would be only 66, and that the number of replacement machines which would be required annually would be very small indeed. That may be true. I do not know whether the figure cited profit. by the Leader of the Opposition is correct; but it is obvious that a position might arise whereby the production of that number of aircraft, however small, plus the production of aircraft required for military purposes might be sufficient to build up in this country a very efficient aircraft production industry. The Government has that objective in mind. I believe that the Government, by taking over control of interstate airlines, will provide a substantial inducement for the production of aircraft which, together with production required for defence purposes, will provide the nucleus of an aircraft production industry. In that way it will keep the industry going in ihe years following the war. The maintenance of such a nucleus will enable us to expand the industry in years to come should such expansion be necessary to the future defence of Australia. Criticism has been levelled against the Government's proposals on the ground that efficiency of management and service to the public suffers because public enterprises are too careless, and in this respect do not compare with private enterprise. My experience of the running of airlines by private enterprise in Australia has not been happy. The service rendered by existing companies, and the attention they pay to the needs of clients, could be very greatly improved. Time and time again, although the operating company knew that I could easily be contacted by telephone, I have gone to the aerodrome at Essendon only to be obliged to wait up to two hours before being allowed to take my seat. On those occasions the company could quite easily have advised me that the plane was running behind schedule or, for some other reason, would not take off at the appointed time. A very great improvement could be effected in that respect, and I believe that such an improvement will be effected when the airlines are taken over by the Government. That is another reason why I wholeheartedly support the bill. The measure is directly related to the Government's policy of providing full employment. Honourable members will recall that the White Paper on full employment sets out that employment depends upon expenditure of various forms on capital goods and consumption goods by the public at large and by governments. The paper pointed out that one of the strategic forms of expenditure is that undertaken by governments, and that should other forms of expenditure fall off at any time, with a consequent threat of unemployment, expenditure by governments could arrest that tendency and obviate unemployment. Civil aviation is one avenue in which public expenditure could be incurred in such a contingency in our economy. Expenditure on the development of more airlines and up-to-date aerodromes could be undertaken in relation to a policy of providing full employment. That is another reason why I believe that the control of airlines in this country should be transferred to the Government. The Leader of the Opposition, as I have said, supported some of the misrepresentations that have been made in the press during recent months with regard to the Government's proposals. The press has misrepresented the degree of competition in interstate airlines. That is amply borne out by the actual development of this industry in recent years, as revealed by the Minister for Air. The main reason for the introduction of this bill can be stated briefly, and be approved by the people. It is that when an industry develops to the stage amendments. Mr Dedman. at which naturally a monopoly can gjvia more efficient service than can be given by a number of independent companiet it should pass from private ownership to control by the Government. That i * when it should be nationalized'.",66
198,Mr SPENDER,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,For that reason alone?,67
199,Mr DEDMAN,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,"That is a sufficient reason. Anyway, it is the main reason why this bill finds in me a strong supporter. The Leader of the Opposition tried to belittle the arguments of the Minister for Civil Aviation. In advanc ing his own arguments, he indulged in what I regard as misrepresentation of at least two matters. If the case in opposition to this bill cannot be better put and is not stronger than that presented by the right honourable gentleman, I have no fear about the outcome. In any case, there is no fear, because the Government and its supporters are unanimous in their desire that this measure be passed and implemented as soon as possible. They believe that it will help in the development of this country, help to bring about decentralization, and help to establish the nucleus of an industry that will assist in our defence should a need ever arise. For those reasons this bill should 'be strongly supported by many honourable members opposing it now merely for political purposes. It is too much to ask them to set aside political prejudice and do what is best for the country; but I appeal to them to reconsider their attitude. The honourable member for Gippsland wants water supply scheme? nationalized, but, when it comes to the airlines utility, equally important in the development of Australia, he, for some reason beyond my comprehension, is opposed to its being nationalized. He is not consistent, and I am afraid that it is useless to appeal to him for support. Fortunately, we do not need it. We have the numbers and the stronger arguments. When the measure becomes law I am sure that it will have the overwhelming support of the people. Debate (on motion by Mr SPENDER) adjourned. it will . SUPERANNUATION BILL 1945.

The following answers to questions were circulated:OVERSEAS TRAVEL PERMITS.",67
200,Mr ABBOTT,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,"the Minister for the Interior, upon notice I. Is it a fact that wives of servicemen abroad who are anxious to come to Australia to set up their new homes have met with a blunt refusal when they have applied for transport? 2. Is it a fact that the vice-president of the Eureka Youth League, Mr Williams, was able to leave Sydney last week by boat to attend the London Youth Conference? 3. If so, who was responsible for granting a passport to this gentleman and who arranged hie transport! i . Is it a fact that Mr Ernest Thornton was refused a travel visa by the United States Consulate because of his membership of the Australian Communist party, but was granted a passport by the Commonwealth and has left for Paris? 5. If so, in view of the attitude of the United States Government, will he inform the Souse of the whole of the facts in connection with Mr Thornton's trip abroad?",68
201,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. This is a matter for the Minister for Repatriation, who has advised that it is not a fact that they have met with a blunt refusal. Six hundred or 700 have already arrived in Australia and following the cessation of hostilities in Europe more are now coming out. Arrangements are being made to bring out the remainder at the earliest possible moment. Under the regulations to the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Act provision is made for passages to Australia to be granted to the wives (and widows) and children of members of the Australian forces who. during the war, have married abroad. The whole question of granting such passages is governed by the availability of transport facilities. preOwing to the shortage of shipping, it has been most difficult to secure accommodation for the large number of persons who are awaiting passages. The shortage has been so acute that it has been ueeessary to introduce a system of priorities. Under this system first priority is granted to the wives and children of members who have been discharged from the forces and who are thus in a position to set up housekeeping. 2. Mr Williams left Sydney during this week for the purpose mentioned. 3. The issue of a passport was authorized by my predecessor. I do not know who arranged his transport. 4 and 5. I understand that Mr Ernest Thornton was refused an American visa, but I have no information as to why it was refused. Mr Thornton was granted passport facilities by my piv 'ecessor to enable him to proceed direct to the United Kingdom and thence to France as a delegate of. the Australasian Council of Trade Unions to the World Trade Union Congress to be held in Paris in September, 1945. DIVISION OF IMPORT PROCITEEMENT.",68
202,Mr HOLT,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,"the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice What was the total revenue received by the Division of Import Procurement for each of the financial years 1941-42 to 1944-45 inclusive as payment of administrative costs incurred in procuring goods for (a) government instrumentalities, and (6) private industry?",68
203,Mr FORDE,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,"The Minister for Trade and Customs has supplied the following answer:The revenue received by the Division of Import Procurement in reimbursement of administrative costs for the financial years 1941-42 to 1944-45 was as follows:£ 1941-42 50,017 194243 385,208 194344 733,478 194445 880,149 2.049,453 This revenue was obtained by including » small percentage charge in the selling price of goods invoiced by the division of State government departments, other State government instrumentalities and private firms to cover the administrative costs of procurement and distribution. The division does not include any administrative charges in the selling price of goods invoiced to Commonwealth departments. The records of revenues received in reimbursement of administrative costs do not provide for any segregation of the amounts charged to State government agencies from those, charged to private firms. BBITISH MOTOR VEHICLES.",68
204,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,"the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Shipping, upon notice I. Did the Government negotiate during the last year or so for the purchase of some 18,000 utility trucks from the United Kingdom? 2. If so, what number and what numbers of each make were imported? 3. Was any arrangement as to purchase price made before purchase was effected? 4. Are there arrangements in existence for the importation of utility chassis? 5. If so, have some of these chassis arrived? 6. Have arrangements been made with any local manufacturers to produce bodies for them? 7. If so, what firms have these contracts in hand ? 8. Does he propose to make a statement on this deal in all its aspects? 9. When will prices to retail traders be fixed? 10. Will prices be subsidized?",69
205,Mr BEASLEY,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,"The Minister for Trade and Customs has supplied the following answers:1 and 2. The United Kingdom authorities indicated about May, 1944, the possibility of 8,000 u t i l it y vehicles and 10,000 passengercar chassis becoming available. Subsequently, the United Kingdom authorities advised that the man-power and materials position in the United Kingdom precluded the production of cars at that stage and also that only 2,500 utility type vehicles were available for export to Australia. The Commonwealth Government negotiated for these 2,500 utility type vehicles, of which 1,200 were fully assembled vehicles, including the cabs and bodies, and 1,300 were unassembled chassis only. The 1,200 f u l ly assembled u t i l i ty vehicles comprise-Austin , 10 h.p., 200; Morris, 10 h.p., 350; Hillman, 10 h.p., 250; and Standard, 12 h.p., 400. The majority of these have already arrived in Australia and the remainder are expected shortly. The unassembled vehicle chassis consist of 12-h.p. models and 1,300 were originally allocated to Australia. Of these, approximately 120 units have either already arrived in Australia or are due very shortly. As regards the remaining 1,180 unassembled chassis, the Commonwealth Government has indicated to the overseas authorities that it has no objection to importation proceeding through normal commercial channels. 3. The vehicles were obtained out of British Ministry of Supply contracts on a cost-plus basis. The final cost figures are not yet available. Endeavours were made to obtain details of purchase price immediately the negotiations commenced and over subsequent months. Price indications have been ohtaincd from the British Ministry of Supply through the High Commissioner's office, hut these are subject to adjustment on completion of the costinsr. At the time of commencement of the negotiations there was an urgent need for this type of vehicle. As the production lines were being changed over, it .was necessary to indicate at once whether Australia was prepared to accept these vehicles. 4. Other than the above there are no arrangements in existence for the importation by the Commonwealth Government from the United Kingdom of u t i l it y chassis for civilian sale. It is understood that arrangements are being made for commercial importation from the United Kingdom of utility-type chassis. Certain utility-type chassis of. greater carrying capacity and horse-power are, however, coining forward from Canada under Government to Government arrangements. 5. See answer to 1 and 2. Approximately 130 utility-type chassis have arrived from Canada recently. 6. No contract has been entered into by the Commonwealth with local manufacturers and/or distributors for the production of bodies for utility-type chassis. 7. See answer to 6. 8. A number of statements covering this particular transaction have already been made in the House, the most recent being the reply by the Right Honourable the Prime Minister to questions asked by the honourable member for Wide Bay, Queensland, on the 18th July, 1945. These statements, together wit h the reply now being given cover all the relevant aspects of the transaction in question. 9. The retail prices of the British f u l ly assembled vehicles have been fixed and these were advised to the trade on the 18th July, 1945. 10. It is not the general policy to subsidize the importation of motor vehicles. However, the 1,200 f u l ly assembled Britis h u t i l it y vehicles were produced to Army specifications and included army-type cabs and bodies. Army-type equipment is not entirely suitable for civilian purposes, but the vehicles were obtained in view of the acute shortages of this class of vehicle in Australia. In view of these factors, the retail selling prices have been fixed in relation to the relative value of the vehicles on the Australian market and under thes« selling prices the Commonwealth will not fully recover costs. PETROL: SYNTHETIC PRODUCTION.",69
206,Mr FOHDE,AUSTRALIAN NATION AL,"On the 4 t h J u l y , the honourable member for D a r l in g (Mr C l a r k ) asked whether the Governmen t w o u l d interest itself in the method of p r o d u c in g synthetic p e t r o l , u t i l i z in g in for m at i o n w h i c h m i g h t be gained from G e r m a n y for this purpose.
