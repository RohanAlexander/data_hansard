PERSONAL EXPX,,ANATION-BRITIS H GOVERNMENT'S REPLY. - Mr FOWLER - Yesterday, when speaking on the adjournment,. I said that the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) had insinuated that the White Australia principle was in danger. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) contradicted that statement. He said that he had before him reprints of all the reports of Mr Hughes' speeches, and that none of them bore out the construction that I had placed on certain of his remarks. Let me read a cutting from the Melbourne Herald of the 13th inst., purporting to contain a cabled report from the special representative of the newspaper in Loudon, of certain statements made by the Prime Minister. The paragraph readsAddressing a demonstration of 1,000 diers in the Young Men's Christian Associaand tion's Theatre to-night, Mr Hushes said"" The Australian soldiers had made which would last HB Ions; ns the stories valorous deeds were told! - "" If the Allied statesmen do half as creditably,"" he continued. "" all will be well.. You have fought for liberty, to' keep Australia white, and maintain your rights of self-government. This must be secured. I know the soldiers and citizens of Australian stand behind me in any action I may take to insure this."" I need add nothing to that paragraph.",20
2,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Has the Acting Prime Minister received through the usual official channel-that is, through the Governor General-^o r in any other way, a copy of the reply made by the British Government, through its official press, tp the statement of the Prime Minister that the Dominions had not been consulted.",20
3,Mr WATT,Unknown,"A multitude of. official cables have been received by me during the past fortnight, but, so far as I remember, no copy of the official press bureau utterance was contained in them. NA NEWCASTLE,",20
4,Mr WATKINS,POSTAL HOLIDAYA T,"I ask the Postmaster-General who was responsible for the mistake made by informing the postal officials at Newcastle that they were to have a holiday on Wednesday, last and then countermanding the order, with the result that, mails we're taken out and there was no one to receive them?",20
5,Mr WEBSTER,POSTAL HOLIDAYA T,"The trouble arose because the Deputy Postmaster-General, without authority; hut acting upon a rule which has hitherto prevailed, declared a holiday which was not allowed by the administrative head of the Department. The difficulties to which the honourable member alludes arose out of the intimation to the persons concerned. ADJOURNMENT (Formal). INCITEMENT TO Crvn. DISORUER",20
6,Mr SPEAKER,POSTAL HOLIDAYA T,"I have.received from the honourable member for Barrier an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a de 1 finite matter of urgent public importance, solnamely, "" the incitements tp civil disorder riot that have been, made recently in various centres in the Commonwealth, a name and to the apparent immunity from of prosecution enjoyed by the individuals so offending.""

However, the honourable member for  with a motion to discuss another matter. rebels. This morning I informed you by letter, all Mr Speaker, of m y intention to move the special adjournment this afternoon, and Russia. I sent to the Act in g P r i m e Minister a copy of m y letter -. I have' heen g u i l no discourtesy towards him . I come now to the subject-matter - motion. In the columns of various newspapers have appeared from time to time of late accounts of disorder, amounting a-dozen. to riot, in several centres of population, noticeably at Hughcnden, in Queensland, good man. and at Dalby. There and elsewhere civil disorder has occurred, sometimes nearly said- ' approaching a riot, men being ill-treated and beaten. The latest instance ported in the Broken Hill B a r r i e r M of the 13th November. That newspaper is opposed to the Labour party politically. In a report of a meeting of an open-nir demonstration held in Broken Hill on - the stuck night of the 12th November, - when the news of the armistice had j u s t been rehall, ceived, it saysMr Hebbard, bere referring to the summary removal from the precincts of the trolley of an interjector, said that action was typical of what they should have done when they heard talk of Bolshevikism and other thingB. ' (Hear, hear, and applause.) They should - have that attitude, and done a lot of kicking out in the early stages of the war. Very Boon the returned boys would have an opportunity of kicking out the Bolshevik element. (ApplauBe.) That was going to happen, as the Bolsheviks were no good to Australia, or any other country, for that matter. He congratulated Broken Hill on the part it had played in t . the war, both in men and money. (Applause.) He was followed by another speaker, Mr . George C. Dempster, who saidReference had been made to the Bolshevik takes element-they had in Broken Hill. This should ignored. If they had ignored "" F r it z "" aware he would have beaten them by now, and..it would be the end of them instead of the end "" Fritz."" The ""Btunt"" which had taken on Sunday night, when the Bolshevik clement sang "" The .Bed Flag,"" was a disgrace to the citizens of Broken Hill. If they could not stop it, they should not be called returned but infants still at their mothers' breasts. . . . The Bolshevik element should only be put out of the jobs they held, but that also out ' of the town. (Hear, hear, and applause.) He would be one who would help the workers to do it. There had been too of mincing matters all along; there was too much of "" They don't count,"" and laughing . at them when they showed disloyalty. (Applause.) ' The men were nothing but disloyal (Hear, bear.) If ""the people laughed the time at such disloyalty, they were going towards bringing about a state of Bolshevik- ism - in Australia similar to that obtaining in (Applause.). ty of Sergeant. R . R .

Wben I left here'in 1914 in er I was. stoned by mongrels at the train as I . went off. When I came, back those mongrels - were the first to come up to me and shake me by the hand. What' will I Bay next! . (laughter.) 7 am proud of ray comrades who to me. I do not give a 'continental for the'dirty mongrels who stoned me when I left. (Applause.) The sooner they .pull down their the better. They did not have a flag up this afternoon, but it waB soon put up. (Applause.) We know them, and we will know them again. If the boys stick together, like they did in France, there will be no Bolshevikism in this town. (Applause.) We want to do the same with them as they did in Queensland/ We should drive them from town to town. . A Voice - We will give them what they got at Hughenden. Sergeant Inwood - I would like to be at one end of the street with a machine guD and have them at the other end. I would drive the mongrels out, and make them dance some as they went. (Applause.) I am surprised' at you people allowing them to hold a picnic on Sunday. A Voice - We did not know anything about the matter. Tha't is the report published in the Nationalist organ in Broken Hill - of the speeches made on the night of the 12th inst. As a result of those speeches, several fights and <a good deal of disorder occurred in Bi-oken Hill , and various meetings were held, at which speeches were made. In reference to an allegation at a subsequent meeting that the report published in the Barrier Miner was incorrect, that journal, on the 18th November, published a footnote to this effectMr Kerr was wrong when he told the meeting yesterday that the Miner published an incorrect report of speeches by Sergeant Inwood - and Mr G-. C. Dempster. The Mvner report was true and correct, but false interpolations wore road into the report, and false comments made upon it outside the Trades Hall and elsewhere. I wish to give the whole of the connection with this occurrence, and my object in bringing the matter before the House is to endeavour to prevent a reof currence of the regrettable happenings in Broken Hill and in other centres the Commonwealth-no t as a result antagonism between soldiers and the workers, but as a result of an attempt certain other interested individuals to provoke trouble between the returned soldiers and members of the working class. In this connection it is only to point out that on the l o t h November the following advertisement was pubfew windows. lished in the Barrier Daily Truth, the Labour organ:The members of' the Barrier Beturned Soldiers Association desire to inform public of Broken Hill that they have no design against the Trades Hall, unionists' residences, or other unionist buildings of any kind. Any reports to the contrary are malicious mis-statements, and can in confidence be ignored. By order, W. J. STAGATICH, Secretary. Honourable members will see that the Returned Soldiers Association was i u no way responsible for the regrettable occurrences. In regard to the speech of 'Sergeant Inwood, it must be said for him that he has had at the Front extraordinary experiences, which mlay have lef t him in such a state of mind that he was more susceptible, as afterwards transpired, to the suggestions of other men, who were not. returned soldiers, but who occupied the platform at the meeting on the 12th inst.,' and were acting as prompters to him . We all recognise that, when men have passed through the trials of warfare their nerves are not in a normal .state, and no doubt Sergeant Inwood's - feelings were played upon hy other individuals.",21
11,Mr LECKIE,POSTAL HOLIDAYA T,Was he stoned when he left Broken Hill ?,22
12,Mr CONSIDINE,POSTAL HOLIDAYA T,No .,22
13,Mr LECKIE,POSTAL HOLIDAYA T,He says he .was.,22
14,Mr CONSIDINE,POSTAL HOLIDAYA T,"I know he does; but any man who was present on the occasion referred to by Sergeant Inwood knows that there was no stoning. Lt - Oolonel ABBOTT - Did the people facts in give him a good send-off ? Mr OONiSIDINE - iTher e was some dissent and hooting when the first batch soldiers left Broken Hill ; hut two of those who participated in that hooting of were in France six months later as memof bers of the Australian Imperial Force. Certain lads did hoot some of the men by when they were leaving the railway station at Broken Hill ; but there was no stone-throwing or violence of any description, except that, after the departure of fair the train, a number of civilians made an attack on the Socialists' hall, and broke a",22
15,Mr MOGBATH,POSTAL HOLIDAYA T,It was not an enthusiastic send-off?,22
16,Mr OONISIDINE,POSTAL HOLIDAYA T,"HNO ; but two of the the men who participated in it subsequently enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force, and served in France. L't - iOolonel ABBOTT - If gentlemen who were in Broken Hill at the time, and are in Melbourne now, assert that stones were thrown by the mob, and that the soldiers retaliated, will the honourable member dispute the statement?",22
17,Mr CONSIDINE,POSTAL HOLIDAYA T,It is absolutely incorrect. I would not be so foolish as to make a public statement as to the correctness of whioh I was not certain. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - Melbourn e citi zens who were in Broken Hill at the time tell a different story.,23
18,Mr CONSIDINE,POSTAL HOLIDAYA T,I do n6t care how many come - forward with a different story; I repeat that there was no stone throwing.  orable member play in the incident?,23
19,Mr CONSIDINE,POSTAL HOLIDAYA T,I played no part in it .  that the honourable member did.,23
20,Mr CONSIDINE,POSTAL HOLIDAYA T,That is not so; the honourable member should wake up.,23
21,Mr GSOOM,POSTAL HOLIDAYA T,Did the honourable member see the send off to these men ?,23
22,Mr CONSIDINE,POSTAL HOLIDAYA T,I was not there.,23
23,Mr GROOM,POSTAL HOLIDAYA T,So that the honourable member is merely going upon hearsay evidence.,23
24,Mr CONSIDINE,POSTAL HOLIDAYA T,"No , I am taking the statements of men who were there. I invite honourable members - who wish to ascertain the-facts for themselves, to read the reports of the occurrence as recorded in the two daily papers published at Broken Hill . In the local Nationalist organ there is an account of the disturbance, and we may rest assured that if any stone throwing had occurred it would have been recorded. Such an incident would not have escaped notice. A considerable number of returned men are standing shoulder to shoulder with the workers of Broken Hill , and have participated in the demonstrations which have since been held. That fact alone shows conclusively that there is no truth in these statements as to stone throwing. As the result of these speeches, scenes such as those reported in the Barrier Daily Truth of 15th instant-amongs t which are the following-hav e occurred : Semi-drunken returned soldiers, ahout twenty in number, wew responsible for a series of brawls in Argent-streeet yesterday. The trouble commenced at the intersection of Argent and Chloride streets. The first man stuck up was Mr J. S. Flynn, whom a returned soldier accosted with the question, "" What are you wearing that red flag for? "" Mr. Flynn retorted, "" 1 believeit is the people's flag."" Another individual interposed, sayingj "" You called me a .police pimp in the Central Reserve,"" to which Mr Flynn replied, "" I don't know anything about that. I would be sorry to call any man a police pimp who was not."" The piece of ribbon that had been in Mr Flynn's. coat was torn off, and one of the attackers proceeded to burn it. At that there was a scuffle, Mr Flynn felling one individual; but in the process fell on top of him without hurt. Several other incidents occurred, amongst them the following: A most cowardly incident was witnessed at the Grand Hotel corner. A civilian who approached from the direction of Sulphide-street was accosted by four or five warriors, and wa> deliberately tripped, presumably because he wore the red. Picking himself up the first time be was knocked down again, and upon trying to rise was struck with a pint tankard. A woman who rushed to his assistance was alsoknocked down with the tankard by a uniformed individual, who had been responsible for the previous reprehensible act. The insulted and ill-treated woman refused, however, to give the alleged man in charge. As a result of these regrettable occurrences, a meeting was held, and a returned soldier informed the union authorities that at that meeting it had been decided by - certain individuals, among whom there were only a few soldiers, to attack the Trades H all , the Barrier Daily Truth office, and a building in Sulphidestreet, Broken Hill , known as the Socialist H all . Union officials passed the word around, and the afternoon shift, in stead of going to work, held a meeting. The result was that 5,000 of the Barrier workers decided to take steps to protect their halls from assault, no matter from what quarter it - might come. On the Thursday, when the French Mission was at Broken Hill , fights took place between various individuals, and the outcome of this was that the afternoon shift on that day loet work. The unions held a mass meeting, and took steps to secure immunity from attack by these interested individuals. As I have said before, the returned soldiers, as an association, repudiated any connection with these deplorable events, and - last Sunday a Labour peace meeting was held in the Central Reserve, Broken Hill , at which, I am pleased to say, the sending others to gaol? platform was occupied by returned they soldiers as well as by union officials. Returned soldiers not only participated in the meeting, but, in uniform, and out of uniform, took the platform in support of the action of the Barrier unionists in defending themselves against these warrantable charges and against, the meditated attacks by certain individuals in this country who ""are endeavouring stir up strife between the returned men and members of the working classes aud organized in unions. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - The honourable member's trouble is that the returned soldiers have been telling the Broken H i people a few home truths. Is that not of the point?",23
25,Mr CONSIDINE,POSTAL HOLIDAYA T,"No . We do not object to home truths, because both sides in Broken Hill are in the habit of telling them. What we do object to is action of representatives' of the employing classes in Broken Hill and elsewhere this occasion? in making speeches with the object of in - ' Mr Considine citing returned soldiers against workers organized in unions. Those who make these speeches have not the excuse point. that soldiers have, who have been through the ordeal of battle. Every one can make allowance for the physical or mental dition of returned men - who have were "" g ot at""? passed through such scenes. The mine managers of Broken Hill , 'however, no such excuse for their action in ing upon the feelings of returned soldiers when they entertain them. They have no excuse for telling the soldiers of incidents that have never occurred, and so endeaarrested. vouring to incite them to make attacks trate said thatupon union property - He Would My desire is to prevent a recurrence ' of these troubles. I wish - to avoid the occurrence of riots, not only at Broken both Hill , but elsewhere. W hy should authorities permit people occupying exwere disputing. alted positions in the industrial life of the community to say what they please bo with the object of inciting against the working classes such of our returned as are susceptible to their blandishments? Why should they allow this to be done, iissiiuit while, on the other hand, in every case they avail themselves of the War Prewould cautions Act to proceed against workingover class citizens, fining some of them Why should remain idle, so far as these exalted * individuals are concerned, seeing t h at they avail themselves of regulations under the War Precautions Act to fine the publishers of Barrier Daily Truth £ 5 0 on a trumpery charge of printin g an unarticle prejudicial uo recruiting, when prethat article merely contained comments on the attempt of the mine-owners of to Western Australia to obtain for their gold a bonus of £ 1 an ounce on the blood suffering of the men at the Front, and not on their actual gold production. The authorities take action in such cases as these, but allow a mine manager to l l incite returned soldiers and other citizens Broken Hill to attack the working class section of the community. If that is to be their attitude, then those charged with the preservation of peace and good order must be held responsible for anythe thing that takes place in the country.",24
26,Mr BOYD,POSTAL HOLIDAYA T,Where were the police on - I am glad that the the honourable member makes that in quiry. I shall read a statement on the Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - Does the honorconorable member .assume that the police,24
27,Mr CONSIDINE,POSTAL HOLIDAYA T,"I do not; but I have shall make the following quotation playfrom Barrier Daily Truth of the 16th instant in regard to the comments made by the Police Magistrate in dealing with the' cases of seven men who had been It is set out that the magistake a lenient view of the cases. The remarks of some of the speakers were very indiscreet, and the actions of some of the others were the same, faults had been prevalent on sides, but they had to come to some reasonthe able understanding on the matters which they Five offenders then pleaded guilty, and were bound over, self in £5, and one surety of f 5, to of good behaviour for twelve months, in def a u l t imprisonment for one month. . . . men In dealing with another caseInspector Bannou snid that, although the wasNi serious one, in view of the way the other defendants had teen dealt with, he like defendant to be dealt with the same as the others.

The inspector of police saw the secretary of the Miners Union and told him that the authorities would supply men to defend the Trades H all , the Barrier Daily Truth office, and other property that might be in danger of attack. .The secretary of the union told the inspector that his action on that occasion was a conAbbott, Lt - Colonel trast to the action of the police in Atkinson, L. having permitted civilians to be asBayley, J.

54,Mr WISE,OFFICERS OF AUSTRALIAN,"On the 6 th November the honourable member' for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) asked the following question :Statements have been made by the military police that their hours of duty are from 8 a.m. till 11 p.m., and that meat is no longer served with their last meal, which tliey have at 4.30 p.m. Their evening meal consists of only tea, bread, and jam, although they are kept on duty till 11 p.m. I ask the Assistant Minister for Defence why Captain Graham has ordered that change in the evening meal, and also why he said'to a man named A. C. Fisher, who had obtained leave for forty-eight hours to attend an examination for the Railway Department, that lie Was a disgrace and a dishonour to the service, although the man has a good discharge after 505 days' service? Is it the intention of the Department to starve the military police, and thus render them unable to do their duty? I have now received a report from the Militar y Commandant in connection with this matter, in which it is stated that it is not considered that the police have any reasonable cause for complaint. work, in his opinion, is not hard, and their provisioning is satisfactory. leave for men of the police force is arranged as follows: Each man gets two afternoons per week, from noon to fi.30 p.m., and two nights per week, from 5.30. until 8 a.m. next morning. They also have alternative Sundays. Where military police have to forego an afternoon owing to disembarkation of troops, &c, an endeavour is made to make it up. The system of work is as follows:Daily - On e patrol goes on leave each day, but remains in camp as a reserve from 8 o'clock until noon, proceeding on leave at and returning at 5.30, wben they are on police duty until 10 or 11 p.m. A second patrol goes on duty at 8 a.m., and is relieved at 5.30 p.m. A tnird patrol, or the reserve patrol, stands by in camp from So'clock until 5.30 p.m., when they go on duty, assisted by the men who have been on afternoon leave, and remain on duty until 10.30 or 11 p.m. No alteration has been made in regard to the meals of the men hy Captain Graham, and no complaints have been made by other members. The menu, which is very varied, is considered quite satisfactory. The evening meal is in variably supplemented with either cheese, cake, soup, or pudding. It would appear that Captain Graham did his be3t, in the interest of the service, to assist . Private Fisher, who, though seemingly satisfied, made complaints unknown to his commanding officer.

55,Mr GROOM,SERVICEANDEXECUTION OF,"Darling Downs-Minister for ""Works and Railways) [ 3 . 1 8 ] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. The object of this Bill is to remedy certain defects which have been found in the operation of the 'Service and Execution of Process Act. In paragraph b of subsection 1 of section 15 that Act provides that where a summons or warrant has been issued against a person who has deserted, his wife or child, or left them Their without means, it may he served or executed in another State. Since the passThe ing of the Act several States have amended their laws with respect to cases of desertion of wives or children. The New South Wales Government has brought und'er the notice of the Commonwealth Attorney-General the fact that there is no provision in the Commonwealth law to meet cases in which proceedings are taken for expenses before the birth of a child. The New South Wales Infants Protection Act of 1904 provides for the payment of preliminary expenses noon, and the expenses of the future maintenance of the infant, and, in order to enable the service of proceedings under that Act in another State, we have been asked to amend our law by inserting the following words in section 15:or failed to make adequate provision for the payment of maternity expenses in connection with the birth, or expenses in connection wibh the future maintenance, of any infant of which he is the putative father. Clause 3 amends section 18 of the original Act, which provides that when a warrant has been issued by any Court or Judge or justice of the peace having jurisdiction in any State or part of the Commonwealth for the apprehension or commitment of any person, that warrant may be executed within any other State. or part of the Commonwealth. But cases have arisen in which men have been convicted and have absconded from a State while waiting for an appeal to be heard, preand there is no provision for the issue of warrants to secure their arrest in another State. This amendment removes that defect. The next amendment affects section 22, which is one of the sections of that part of the Act dealing with the enforcement of judgments,- and providing machinery for the enforcement in one State of a judgment that has been obtained in another State. Since the original Act was passed there has been a change in regard to Admiralty jurisdiction. Formerly, in some of the States the Courts of A d miralty jurisdiction were Courts, while in other States the Supreme Courts exercised Admiralty jurisdiction. Now, all Supreme Courts are vested with that jurisdiction. The amendment contained in clause 4 brings our law into harmony with the existing condition of affairs. Clause 5 amends section 2S, its object being to allow the making of regulations to provide for the service and execution in the Territories of the Commonwealth of the civil and criminal process of the Courts of any State or part of the Commonwealth, and the execution in those Territories of the judgments Courts, and vice versa.",29

SECOND READING.",30
59,Mr WISE,SERVICEANDEXECUTION OF,"Gippsland - Assistant Minister for Defence [ 3 . 2 6 ] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. Our original Defence legislation Avas passed in times of peace, and the war has discovered many defects in it which the Department has thought well to ask P a r Imperial liament to remedy from time to time, as they arise, instead of allowing them to accumulate. The Bill deals first with the seniority of officers. The Act contemplates an Army Reserve, to be composed of men who have passed through the Citizen Forces, and makes the offi- cers of that reserve junior - to those of the forces defined in the Act as ""active."" The present reserve, - however, consists of men who have been at the Front, and whein it would be improper to make junior to men who have not seen active service.",30
60,Mr BRUCE SMITH,SERVICEANDEXECUTION OF,Who will exercise discretion in awarding rank?,30
61,Mr WISE,SERVICEANDEXECUTION OF,"The members of the of those Forces that have gone abroad are asked, when they return, to join the Army Reserve, and will carry their rank with the them, but we wish to provide that they shall be senior to those who have not been to the Front. Without an amendment of the Act , they would be junior to men of the CitizenForce who have never left Australia",30
62,Mr BRUCE SMITH,SERVICEANDEXECUTION OF,There is to be no raising in rank.,30
63,Mr WISE,SERVICEANDEXECUTION OF,"2fo . They merely retain the rank with which they come hack. The next amendment deals with the calling up of classes. Uncler section 60 tliere is power to call up classes of men, hut we are allowed to call up only the whole of a class. .The first class consists of those between eighteen and thirty-five years of age. When called up, they must be called up as a whole class. But it may not he necessary to call up a whole class, and during the war the Government called up only those from the age of twenty or twenty-one upwards instead of from eighteen. That action was not strictly in accordance with the Act, aud we desire legislative authority for calling Bill up part of a class, instead of a whole class, should it be necessary.",30
64,Mr HIGGS,SERVICEANDEXECUTION OF,"""Will the amendment allowing part of a class instead of a whole class to be called up also allow another class or a portion of another class to he called up as well ?",31
65,Mr AVISE,SERVICEANDEXECUTION OF,"On e class must be exhausted before any of the next can he called up. The Act provides, in connection with cadet musketry training, that there must be certain practice with service rifles and ammunition on open ranges, no provision being made for previous practice at miniature ranges. A considerable amount of time is thus wasted, and there is useless expenditure on travelling and ammunition, because better results could be obtained hy requiring a certain standard of efficiency at miniature ranges .befoi-e sending the cadets to the musketry ranges. We propose, therefore, to amend the Act to allow for this part of a cadet's training to be dealt with by regulation. This will enable. the training to be improved from time to time to secure greater effioiencyi",31
66,Mr HIGGS,SERVICEANDEXECUTION OF,What is the meaning of the addition to section 61?,31
67,Mr WISE,SERVICEANDEXECUTION OF,"It is considered desirable that persons who are exempted by the Act from service in time of war shall be required to take all the preliminary steps, including registration and medical examination, so that, should their exemption cease because of change of employment or status, no fresh proclamation may be necessary. Paragraph g of section 61 sets out that persons employed as medical practitioners or nurses in public hospitals are exempt from service in time of war, and the present proviso requires that this exemption shall not extend io duties of a non-combatant nature. It ""is unnecessary to include nurses in this exemption, inasmuch as the liability to serve in the Citizen Forces in time of war is imposed only upon the male inhabitants of Australia. So far as medical practitioners are concerned, all the younger ones will, by virtue of the compulsory training provisions of the Act, be officers in the zen Forces, and it will he unnecessary, therefore, to provide for calling them up under this part. It is not considered desirable that public hospitals shall be called upon suddenly to lose all their medical officers, and, therefore, the present provision, which requires that these . persons shall be liable for service under Part IV . has been deleted, as there will be an ample number of medical officers available elsewhere Another alteration of more material consequence is proposed. Section 98 makes provision for the punishment of certain specific offences by the infliction of the death penalty by a court martial. It has been held that the words "" court martial"" under this section apply, not only to a court martial constituted under our Defence Act, but also, in the case of an Australian soldier serving with the. Regular Forces overseas, to a field general court martial convened under .section 49 of the Army Act, and to a general court martial convened under section 122 of the Army Act. Two specific cases have arisen in which a member of the Australian I m perial Force while on service abroad has killed another person, hut no provision is made in section 98 for the punishment of murder by death. Under section 41 (2) of the Army Act, the only legal punishment which.a court martial can award for murder is death, hut under section 98 of our Defence Act iin Australian soldier cannot be sentenced to death by any ?ourt martial, even for murder. The question recently arose in two cases of soldiers who were on trial in Egypt and in Palestine for murder.",31
68,Mr MCGRATH,SERVICEANDEXECUTION OF,rD o you propose to give to the military authority the power to shoot a man without civil trial?,31
69,Mr WISE,SERVICEANDEXECUTION OF,"We propose to give them the power. to inflict the punishment of death for murder. In the cases to which I refer the Court was in a difficult position, because it could not legally pass a sentence of death under section 9S of the Australian Defence Act, and under the Army Act it could not award any sentence other than death. Of course, in ordinary circumstances the crime of Citi- murder would he tried, not by a court martial, but hy a civil Court. That is the case ""where a civil Court is available. But a civil Court would not be available in France or Palestine.",31
70,Mr MCGRATH,SERVICEANDEXECUTION OF,"The prisoners, could be sent elsewhere.",32
71,Mr WISE,SERVICEANDEXECUTION OF,"That could not be done; it would be necessary to send all the witnesses as well, and they could not be spared. At the same time, it is provided that the sentence of death shall not be carried out unless it is confirmed by the Governor General in Council. Sections 75 and 77 have proved to be difficult of administration, and require slight amendments in the wording in order to describe accurately the offences which these sections are intended to cover. The penalties also vary, and it is desirable that the maximum should be the same, and not less than six months' imprisonment, and also that a monetary penalty should be added. It must be remembered that the circumstances of the cases differ tremendously, and it is necessary that a Court should have a wide discretion in - awarding punishment, more especially as some individuals would probably prefer, when the penalty was not heavy, to undergo a short sentence rather than obey the Act . There is another provision in reference to the legal status of rifle clubs. It necessary at times for rifle clubs to sue or be sued, and clause 12 makes vision for them to be made corporate bodies, in order that they may sue or be sued in their own name, and hold real solidation and personal estate. The last clause deals with the records of trainees. Under the present system, not only must the record book and dupliin cate record book be kept up to date, b the history contained therein must also be provided in case the reral cord books are lost or destroyed. is proposed by clause 13 to troduce a record sheet which will a permanent record to be available always for all purposes.' The whole history of each trainee will be kept on such record sheets, which will be maintained on the loose ledger system, one trainee's, history being placed on each sheet. These sheets will be bound up in loose leaf ledgers on a system approximating a card index, and will take the place of the duplicate records book. Debate (on motion by Mr TUDOR) adjourned.

This is one of the shortest measures ever introduced into the House, but it is of importance. B y the Amendments In corporation Act of . 1905 Parliament provided for our Statutes to be brought up to date after each amendment, and issued in a consolidated form . The Queensland Parliament is the only other Australian Legislature that operates that principle. In other States amending Bills are continually passed, hut there is no machinery for the regular consolidation of the Statutes, although it . is done periodically. The regular and automatic consolidation of Statutes is .of very great convenience to honourable members, the professions and the general public. The sole purpose of this Bill is to rectify an omission fro m the original Act by providing that in future, when a consolidated Statute is published, the method of citais tion prescribed in the amending Act shall be inserted in substitution of the short - protitle of the principal Act. MrTUDOR (Y a r r a ) [3.46] - The conof Statutes is a very good p r in ciple, and is of great convenience to honourable members. This Bill seems to be a step in the right direction.

NA BILL.  ister for the Navy) [ 3 . 4 9 ] - I moveThai this Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this measure is to give control over waters for naval purposes. Uncler the Customs Act we have control over water for purposes of trade and comnierce, but tliere is no such control for naval requirements. The Bill is based on an Imperia l Act of 1865, which was amended in 1868, andfurther , amended in 1S93. It .may !be described as a measure to provide for - (1 ) the safeguarding of warships and naval establishments at ""their bases; (2) the safety of civilian and commercial interests' in the vicinity of Naval Bases by regulating the use of the waters and foreshores where naval operations are carried on, and naval material is stofed or manufactured; (3) against naval exercises and operations being interfered with , obstructed, or overseen at such places; and (4) for the prevention of the construction of any works,' &e., at any port that has been developed for naval purposes, which would tend to interfere with the functions of a Naval Base. The Bill would apply at the present time to such places as Cockburn Sound, Westernport, and other Naval Bases, as .well as Cockatoo Island.",32

76,Mr TUDOR,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"Y a r r a ) [3.55] - This Bill is more far-reaching than the speech just made by the Minister would lead one to believe. Under it a regulation might be issued declaring t h a f the whole of the waters of Westernport Bay, where we have a Naval Base, should be used for only naval purposes.",33
77,Mr FENTON,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,That is not good enough.,33
78,Mr TUDOR,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"No ; it might also be applied to Jervis Bay, where we have the Naval College, Port Stephens, and Cockburn .Sound. Then, again, under it all waters within a quarter of a mile of the foreshore of Cockatoo Island or Garden Island might be proclaimed "" naval' waters,"" and ordinary navigation in such waters could thus be stopped.",33
79,Mr WEST,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,The Government would have no power to do that.,33
80,Mr TUDOR,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"The honourable member is under a misapprehension. The Constitution provides that where a Commonwealth law conflicts with the law of a State, then the Commonwealth law shallprevail. The Governor General will have power under this Bill to make regulations for, amongst other purposes, the mooring or anchoring of vessels "" within, or so as not to obstruct navigation into, in , or out of naval waters."" Under such a regulation navigation for other than naval purposes might be prohibited in the whole of Westernport Bay.",33
81,Mr GROOM,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,Is that not a rather exaggerated view to take of the power to be conferred on the Governor General under this Bill ? Does not the honourable member admit that some such power must be given to the Naval Department?,33
82,Mr TUDOR,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"I admit that, it must have certain powers in .this direction, and since, according to the Minister, the I m perial . Act on which this Bill is based, was passed in 1865, and has not been amended since 1893, it is quite possible that legislation of this kind may be of a wise and necessary character. The utmost care, however, should be exercised by the Parliament in granting power to make regulations of this kind. During the last four years we have had an experience of the kind of regulations that may be passed under the powers conferred by an apparently simple and innocent looking Act. If honourable members had foreseen the class of regulations that would be passed under the W a r Precautions Acts, I do not think they would have allowed that Bill to go through. Some of those regulations are altogether in excess of the power which we thought we were giving the Government when we passed that Bill . Tliere are ten clauses in the Bill before us, and the most important are clauses 3 and 4. Under clause 4 the Governor General may make regulations providing for regulating the mooring or anchoring of vessels so* as not to obstruct navigation in , into, or out of naval waters; for appropriating any space as a mooring place for the exclusive use of warships; for prohibiting or restricting the entry into any naval waters of any vessel having explosives on board; for prohibiting or restricting the discharging of explosives in any naval waters; for restricting the use of fire and light on board any vessel in auy part of any naval waters; for regulating the speed at which vessels may be navigated in such waters; for prohibiting or regulating the breaming, careening, aud cleaning of vessels in any specified part of naval waters; for prescribing the lights or signals to be carried or used; for conferring powers of search; for prescribing penalties, not exceeding £100, or imprisonment for six months, for any contravention of the regulations; and (i) generally for making such provisions the Governor General thinks necessary for the purpose of insuring the proper protection of the vessels, Naval establishments, dockyards, and property of the Commonwealth. . "". . o Practically anything might be done under the paragraph I have just quoted. It is just possible that the States may discover that the control of their own harbors and dockyards has practically been taken from them. We have to accept the assurance of the Minister that this Bill will be administered with caution, and will not be used to secure arbitrary powers such as are not suggested in the Bill itself. It must not be forgotten, however, that a similar promise was given to us by the Prinie Minister (Mr Hughes) in regard to the regulations relating to the censorship, and that such regulations have been most unsatisfactory, while their administration has been anything but fair. The regulations made under the War Precautions Act are not quite in accord with the statements that were made to the - House as to the character' of the Bill when we were discussing it some four years ago: The power conferred on the Governor General to make regulations is really a power conferred upon the Minister administering the Act. Under this Bill , the Navy Department or the Navy Board may take power to control some of our finest harbors which have not yet been put into general use. They would have power, if they chose to exercise it , to practically prevent the navigation of Sydney Harbor for a quarter of a mile on either side of Cockatoo Island except by war vessels. We must exercise the greatest vigilance in dealing with measures of this kind. I certainly do not feel disposed to grant these extraordinary powers, l t is true that Parliament has the right to disallow any regulation, but in actual practice we have practically no opportunity to discuss ""them. A number of notices of motion to disallow regulations under the War Precautions Act have been placed on the business paper, but the Government have not afforded us an opportunity to discuss them. We can deal with such notices of motion only by shifting the present Government. It seems to me that we shall as place in the hands of the Ministry too wide a power if we pass the Bill as it stands. The Australian Navy was able to carry on during the war without any of these powers; but I recognise that it may be said that since we are now constructing Naval Bases, the Department of the Navy requires more power in this direction than it has hitherto enjoyed.",33
83,Mr RODGERS,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"Wannon) [ 4 . 5 ] - In view of naval developments during the war, and of Australia having to set out on quite a new programme, so far as its naval defence is concerned, it is, I think, abundantly clear that the Department must have better control of naval waters than it has today. In factat the present time there is practically no Navy control; but, at the same time, it would have been better to postpone this Bill until the Government were dealing with the naval policy as a whole. The M in ister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) will , I suppose, be returning from the Old Country presently, bringing with him , no 0 doubt, the most modern ideas of naval defence after close consultation with the British authorities.  pect to occupy the Flinders Naval Base, and we must have the powers given by the Bill .",34

The Minister has in - . trodueed the Bill on behalf of the Government; and the influence we might wield is shown in the fact that, in addition to the Minister, there are only two Government supporters present.

I admit that in war time all such matters should be under proper control; but if we seek to take this authority in times of peace it will lead us into no end of trouble, and bring about a series of conflicts between the Naval authorities and municipal or harbour authorities.  those extreme things to which the honourable member has referred, would not the Commonwealth Parliament immediately repeal the statute?",37
108,Mr FINLAYSON,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"No .  that there is common sense behind the ad-, ministration of an Act .",37
109,Mr FINL AYSON,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,A moment or two ago the Minister reminded me that these powers already existed under the War Precautions Act.

110,Mr FINLAYSON,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"Notic e has been given of a Bill to extend the provisions of the War Precautions Act , and I can promise the honourable member that when that measure comes forward Ave shall treat him to a few illustrations, and give a few reasons why the Act should not be extended. For'the moment I cannot mention any extreme action which has been taken by the Navy Department under the War Precautions Act , but the point is that under this Bill it is acquiring powers which it already possesses under the War Precautions Act, and which are so unlimited that it is inconceivable that they should be necessary in peace time. It seems to me that there is no guarantee to the local authorities, who depend upon navigable harbors and rivers for carrying on their affairs, thatregulations drawn up by the Minister for the Navy may not big oil seriously interfere with all their operations.

There is no doubt the Navy should be giyen free and . unfettered control over - waters for their purposes; but, surely, they will not require the unlimited powers that this Bill will give. They are given in such extraordinary directions, that one is naturally led to the conclusion that hereafter there will be no need for any harbour or port authorities, and that' permission must be obtained from the Minister for the Navy before anything is done on a foreshore.  Imperial Act .",37
113,Mr FINLAYSON,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"The fact that it is based on the Imperial Act is no recommendation for it . We have been following Imperial measures too slavishly. Nothing brings the Courts of Australia into more ridicule than does the fact that they base their decisions on statutes passed in the reign of Queen Anne. I do not criticise the Imperial authorities in regard to what they consider necessary for the purposes of their Navy. I am thinking of what is necessary in Australia. I am second to none - in my desire to see that our Navy is amply strengthened in order to meet all requirements for the defence of Australia, but I cannot see that we should do something simply because it is done in the Mother Country. The Minister cannot get over the fact that under this Bill he will have power to prohibit the erection of a jetty or wharf, or the passage of any boat up a river, port, or harbour, no matter whether it be a row-boat or not.  right, so long as it is in defined naval waters.",37
114,Mr FINLAYSON,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"The definition of "" n a v a l waters"" is so extremely wide that because the Department of the Navy have stores in the centre of Brisbane, it is sufficient to give them authority over the whole of the Brisbane River.",38

124,Mr FINLAYSON,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"F r o m one point of view, this Bill may have an effect in a direction pleasing to me, but that is not its purpose. The Bill is a step towards Unification, because it makes the Federal authority supreme in the control of ports, harbors, rivers, and so on all over Australia. I believe in Unification, because I think that one authority should deal with all matters of general concern. But this Bill is not put forward as a measure of Unification, and honourable members opposite, if it were so put forward, would object to it . I do not think that they realise its nature. They have not had an opportunity to consider it , yet, like sheep, they follow the lead of the Government, consoling themselves with the reflection that they have been elected to support the Ministry.

Similarly, the use of the waters near Ordnance Store at Leichhardt would restricted. The House may not he inBill clined to regard me as a constitutional authority, but I would remind members that when the Commonwealth tried to get possession of Garden Island, the New South Wales Goveniment prevented it from doing so.

Now, on the Parramatta River the Bill redrafted. the Shale Oil Company has an oil store within 2 miles of Cockatoo Island, where there is a naval dock, and further up the river there is a petroleum store, which is also within 2 miles of the dockyard.",38

131,Mr ATKINSON,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"And in war time it the is not needed, because the Federal Government has extraordinary powers.",39
132,Mr WEST,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"It is necessary to store inflammable materials on the shores of Sydney Harbor, but under the Bill the Navy authorities could interfere with fcliat. I am quite sure the honourable member will agree that that is not right. With a plausible Minister in charge this Bill might easily slip through a House in which members do not scan very closely the legislation introduced hy the Government. I clo not think that the provisions of the measure can override the sovereign rights of the States. Sydney every Harbpr and all the establishments connected with it existed before the Commonwealth was created, and the Federal autliority has no right to interfere with them. 1 recollect the trouble that occurred in connection with a proposal that Garden Island should he transferred . to the Commonwealth. The Imperial authorities received that island in exchange for land at the bottom of. George-street, now forming portion of Circular Quay.' It was given to the Imperial Government for contain purposes, and they were willing to transfer it to the Commonwealth on the one condition that His Majesty's Imperial ships should have the use. of it. for repairs and other work of that kind. But the State Government, in defence of State rights, objected to the transfer, with the result that the island still remains the property of the Imperial Government, although the Commonwealth is allowed full use of it. This Bill will give the Cominoiiwealth power to regulate the speed at which vessels may he navigated in any specified part of naval waters, which are defined as - waters where the Commonwealth has any naval establishments. That means that the Navy Department may take control of all the navigable waters of Port Jackson. Surely the Government do not desire that naval officers shall prescribe the speeds at which ferry boats shall run up and down Sydney Harbor, or the pace at which a man may propel a canoe. Honourable members will admit that it is necessary for commercial firms to have store houses about . the harbour at which ships may ""discharge explosives, or oil, or other commodities, which are to be kept in n safe position until tihciy are required. The Cockatoo Island Naval Establishment is not 2 miles from the Balmain shore, on which there are all sorts of . shipping yards and stores. It would be possible under this Bill for the Navy to require thpm all to be shifted. Regulations may be made which may prohibit the construction within 5 miles of a dockyard of any factory or store for explosives or any other inflammable material. Ave the Government to have authority to order the removal of factories that are established on the shores of Sydney Harbor? Under the definition of ""vessel,"" the Navy Department will have power to dictate to everybody, and it will almost be necessary to obtain the permission of the authorities to hold a regatta on a holiday. The only excuse I can imagine for some of the provisions in thisBill is that it was drafted by a naval officer who did not appreciate the considerations I have mentioned. The present harbour regulations provide that a vessel arriving with explosives or inflammable material on board must not go beyond a prescribed anchorage, where the dangerous cargo is removed in the interests of the safety of the city. The Bill will confer power to interfere with that regulation. Nobody will object to the Navy Department having control Over purely naval waters; but even under Unification some Board or other civil authority would he required to control each port for commercial purposes. I am certain that the commercial community of Sydney will agree that the' powers conferred in this Bill exceed the Navy's requirements. The Commonwealth should not be given, authority to remove any existing oil store. Some portions of the Bill will be of no avail, because they represent an interference with the constitutional rights of the States. I shall not vote against the second reading, because I believe it is necessary for the Government to have control of naval waters, such as the Base at Flinders and Cockburn Sound; hut I hope the Government will recognise the wisdom of amending the measure in the directions I have indicated.",39
133,Mr MAHONY,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"Dalley) [5.4] - There is danger in hurrying through the Hou.se a measure of this sort. I am prepared to admit the necessity for the Commonwealth having control of purely naval waters, such as Hendersonand Flinders Naval Bases; hut, having regard to the conditions in Sydney Harbor, where the naval authorities have all sorts of victualling yards, stores, and repair shops, the powers of the Bill are excessive. Tho volume of foreign and Inter-State ship 1 ping that passes in and out of that harbour is enormous, and I see a danger in giving the naval authority power by regulation to suddenly deprive shippers and owners of workshops in close proximity to naval dockyards qf the right's they have enjoyed for years past.

The Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) will not be at all pleased if , upon his return from the Old Country, he discovers that during his absence the entrance (to this fine river, which is the pride of Australia, and is really the entrance to his electorate, has been closed to general traffic. While I am. quite prepared to say that Parliament should have the power to do anything in this direction that is neces-' sary for the safety of the country, I am uot prepared to give to any body outside Parliament the right to take away the rights and liberties, and to seriously i terfere with the commercialenterprises of the people -' We - have also to consider how regulacriminately, tions passed under this Bill might affect Balmain, which is about a mile and a quarter from Cockatoo Island.

Such establishments could thus prohibited. In other words, the whole our works at Balmain could be closed down by a regulation issued under this Bill.

These works come within the imshould mediate scope of this Bill . They belong to the class of industry which under it legislate. may be prohibited if they are within 2 miles of naval yards. Are the owners to be at the mercy of the Naval Board? They have had the pluck and enterprise to establish ithis industry at Balmain, and this House should hesitate to give any outside body the power to order its removal. If the Minister says that the object this Bill is to'secure uniform control naval waters throughout Australia, reply is that the proper way to secure that uniformity is to seek Constitutional power to bring about Unification. If the powers are to be exercised, let the Commonwealth Government itself exercise them, and not farm them out to others under regulation's.

Pirst of all, I think that the Navy Board and the Ministry, whatever the personnel, will always have enough common sense to insure that no regulation will be passed with the effect of closing up particular n - works; in any case, we can rely on Parliament to see that justice is done in this regard. It is dangerous to give any Government power to issue regulations indisbut we must remember that we are the masters of the Minister and of the Navy Board, and that if they do any injustice in any part of the Commonwealth, it will be' our duty to apply a I feel quite sure . that the whoever the Minister may be.

Our aim in engaging in the great life ancl death, struggle, which we hope.has now happily ended, was to break down the military and naval power of our enemies; and unless we succeed, all the lost lives, and the enormous expenditure involved, have been almost wasted. We . have fought, and we desire peace, because we hope to see, as a result, lessened expenditure on armaments. I take that one of the ideas underlying the League of Nations, which we hope will be brought about,, is disarmament; and this, of course, must mean a cessation of naval construction. It may turn out when the terms of peace are all settled that Australia will not be called upon to supply a Navy. The League of Nations, I understand, means that there shall be one Navy controlled by that Leaeue, and that Great Britain shall be one of the contributors.",42
138,Mr SAMPSON,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,You would not expect the League of Nations to exercise such powers as are contemplated in the Bill?,43
139,Mr RILEY,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"I am suggesting that if the result of the League of Nations is what we anticipate, we shall not need tliese great Naval Bases, for which we are making preparations. If the League is to be of any benefit to humanity, there must result a curtailed expenditure on the Army and the Navy. We did not go into the war with the idea of getting so many millions of pounds in indemnity or territory, but to break down the military despotism in Europe: ancl the fact that peace has almost been declared should cause us to hesitate before we give greater powers to the Naval authorities. In my opinion, if , after the League of Nations is formed, we here are called upon to maintain a Navy, our present establishment will be more than enough for requirements. I oppose the Bill , because I think it is not duced at the proper time. A f t e r peace has been, declared the Government ought to come down with a defence programme, in view of the facts as we shall then know them. At present everything is in the melting pot, and until we know the results of the Peace Conference we are groping in the dark.

It has also been suggested to me that the Minister might explain how far the Bill will affect the expenditure onprivate works now in progress,- near any of'-these Naval Bases. I take it that the Bill has no bearing on the policy of the Government in regard to constructional work, and that the Navy Board will not exercise any autocratic authority, and call for the discontinuance of any existing industry, unless that be absolutely necessary for the protection of the Bases.

Under local Acts, Harbor Boards have certain powers, and it seems an anomaly that the Navy Board should have none; but the reason is that it is only a introfew years since our Navy was created. When vessels of the Royal Navy come into our waters they exercise all the rights and powers conferred upon them under the Imperial law; but if the Sydney or the Australia were to return, as we hope they shortly will , it would he quite open for a master of a vessel who had anchored quite close to one of those men-of-war to refuse to move.",43

The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) is very much concerned aboutl his ""beaut if u l harbour."" I am sure that the Commonwealth Government have no desire to take away the rights of the State Governments in regard to Sydney Harbor, the Brisbane River, or the beautiful' Yarra, but I maintain that the Australian Navy should be given the authority to close certain portions of these rivers and harbors just as the Imperial Navy has power to close certain waters. It is like beating the air to oppose the' proposal.

This Bill is based on the I m perial Act. We are about to take over the Flinders Naval Base, and unless legislation of this character is passed, vessels coming into Westernport can tie I up to our wharfs,- or even to our warships, and we shaU be powerless to prevent it . The Customs Act gives the M in ister for Trade and Customs control over waters for Customs purposes,, and the State authorities have control oyer waters for marine purposes^ but the Navy has no controlover the waters of the Commonwealth. It has been suggested that the Bill should be postponeduntil a new naval policy is defined, but"" there is nothing' in the measure that could affect any such policy. I am assured by . the Department of the N a v y that the powers given in' this Bill are urgently required. The suggestion has been put ' for ward that terrible obstruction might be caused in the Brisbane River or Sydney Harbor, but I Gannot conceive of any Parliament tolerating such extravagances in administration. The Imperial. Government issue regulations indicating the localitiesfchastpa-ssunder, the British. Act. The same will be done here. Very little additional expense will beentailedin administeringthe measure-. Clause agreed to. Clause 4 (Power to make regulations).' Mr.""TUDOE (Y a r r a ) [5.41], - I take exception to the power given in all our recent legislation to frame regulations without the necessity of submitting them to Parliament. In our earlier legislation it was always provided that regulations must l e laid before both Houses, and I think that similar provision should be made in this Bill, and that honourable members should receive copies of any regulations which are framed. I know that the Minister has said that he cannot'imagine certain things being done by any reasonable Government, or, in fact, any Government in power in the Commonwealth, but knowing that it is the aim of departmental officers to reach out for *as much power as possible, I am very reluctant to hand over to them the power to make regulations which have not to be submitted to Parliament. Officers i u the Defence and Naval Departments, who think themselves the lords of creation, and imagine that they are all powerful, will have the power to frame these regulations.  Minister.",44
145,Mr TUDOR,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"In 99 cases out of 100 the Minister is satisfied. We have had more regulations* issued under the War Precautions Act than under all our other Acts, and many of them are not at all necessary. Ministers must he guided by the officers of their Departments. If their officers say that such-and-such a regulation is absolutely necessary, Minis- ters must be on extraordinarily firm ground before they can even refer it back again for consideration. Hitherto we have had too much government by regulation. Parliament is now surrendering to the Departments a power which, in the future, they can only be deprived of by amending legislation.",45
146,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"Hindmarsh) [5.47] - No doubt Parliament should always be careful in regard to the powers contained in a B i ll in regard to which regulations may be enforced, but this measure is merely giving to the Australian Navy powers which the Imperial authorities possess. One characteristic of the Imperial Navy is its jealousregard for its prestige, and everything associated with it . During this war we have not been able to learn what the Navy has done. Even if it has performed remarkable deeds of valour it has kept them to itself, because it is against its traditions to speak of them. We can depend upon it that our Navy will have the same jealous regard for its prestige, especially now that our ships have been associated with the Royal Navy during the present war. Is it likely that those advising the Government would frame a regulation that was not needed for the protection of the interests of our Navy, which has a national work to perform? In the abstract there is - something in what has been said by the honourable member; but, to my mind, it would not conduce to efficiency to give more opportunity for parliamentary obstruction of the administration of the country's affairs. I have no fear that any regulation will be of a character to call' for challenge by Parliament. Should such a regulation be framed, not it, but the existence of the Government responsible for it , would be challenged.  generally with what the Leader of the Opposition has said concerning regulations, and I have regretted hundreds of times the vote I gave allowing the Government to make regulations under the War Precautions Act . But I have read the list of subjects in regard to which it is proposed to give the Naval authorities power to make regulations, and I find nothing to object to in it . I think that this power is needed. Surely what is good enough for the Imperial Navy should be good enough for ours, and we should give 'our Naval authorities the power that is given to the Imperial Naval authorities. Clause agreed-to.

At Gore Bay, on Sydney Harbor, the British Imperial Company has oil tanks which are hot more than miles in a straight line from the Cockatoo Island Dockyard.",45

This is no laughing matter for the people are finding the money, and some the Ministry will get an awful shock less more definite attention is paid to complaints which honourable members make in this House.

I visited the Flinders Naval Base over two years ago, and tliere saw a wharf alongside of which it will only be possible, at high tide, to bring a vessel drawing 5 feet of water.  tliere is 9 feet at low tide.",47
175,Mr TUDO R,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"That will be the depth after a channel up to the wharf has been made. There is not that depth of water at - the present time. The honourable member's interjection reminds me of the complaint of a returned soldier with regard to land that had been made available for settlement, and which he said was too wet for farming and too dry for fishing.

An object-lesson as to unnecessary expenditure is to be obtained within hixlf-a-mile of this House. Returning, however, to the Flinders Naval Base, I may say that the wharf to which I have already alluded was constructed on dry land. The end of it was no nearer the water than Mr . Speaker's chair is to the base of the steps at the front of Parliament House. It was constructed on dry land, the responsible engineer holding that it was well to construct it in that way, and then to dredge a channel up to it .

178,Dr MALONEY,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"Melbourne) [7.45]. -""It is with no desire to prolong the debate that I propose>to say a few words. We can understand that ERe command of certain waters and the approaches thereto is justly placed in charge of the Navy Department. I suppose this means command of the waters for a distance of 3 miles froin the land, and that where there are contiguous islands the distance may be extended. But I desire to protest against this Bill at the present time on the score of economy. The mode of naval warfare has changed greatly. Time was, during this terrible war, when a naval unit of the super-Dreadnought class, with equipment, would cost anything up to £4,000,000. That is an amount of money that could be very well spent in defending Australia in the way of submarines and aeroplanes. The submarine, so far. as my reading goes, has completely changed the mode of naval warfare, and the first thing needed for this class of vessel is deep water. It appears to me, therefore, that in constructing a Naval Base .there must be deepwater frontage, and the deeper it is the better the Bases must be. We have heard, and I know of my own knowledge, of instances where a wharf for a Naval Base has been built on solid land, which those concerned in the construction began to dig away. Such a metliod of procedure is too ridiculous to consider for a moment. There have been, . and are, many committees of inquiry in connection with various Departments; and perhaps it would be as well to have another to ascertain whether those who advised such a stupendous piece of engineering absurdityare still in the Department and drawing large salaries. At ' the Henderson Naval Base, Fremantle, I saw in the construction of a mole, material used that went away just like milk. This rock, which seeniinglv became hard when exposed to wind and weather, instead of being cut in huge blocks, and thus used to form the mole, was smashed by explosives, and prepared by hand, labour. I was in formed that at least 40 feet of the mole thus constructed was"" washed away one stormy night. I maintain that the engineers concerned should have reported to their superior that this was an absurd method of constructing a mole, and that, failing satisfaction from the superior, the engineers should have appealed to the Minister to stop that useless expense. I know that bags of this material were taken away from the Base, but it is quite possible that some are still in existence today, and in the possession of the Department. However, in view of the changes in naval warfare, it seems to me that, on the score of economy, the Minister ought to keenly watch any future expenditure on Naval Bases, with a view to avoiding unnecessary expense. I know that T am throwing myjelf open to the criticism of those naval experts to whom I have alluded, and, maybe, they will ask what I know about the matter. To that I reply that I Bave some knowledge of the North Sea, which the average number of shipwrecks per annum shows to be, perhaps, one of the most dangerous in the world, and I also know how the enemies' submarines managed to escape the network of our mines. Under all the circumstances, I suggest that it would be worthwhile to ask some of the submarine experts of Europe, who Bave had the greatest of all educations, that of experience, to give us the advantage of their opinion as to whether our Naval Bases should not be constructed on a different plan altogether.  this Bill ; we must have control of naval waters whether there is'any alteration in the plans or not.",48
179,Dr MALONEY,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"Q u it e so; and that is one reason why I * should be very diffident in voting against the Bill .

182,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"I do not think that any - one believes that the dreadful tragedy, which has been recently brought to a close, w i ll be re-opened in our time; and we all hope and may expect peace to be ratified within the next six months. We can have a great deal too much compulsion. . 1 , myself,. believe that what is called the laissez faire doctrine in the Old Country-lettin g things take their own course; and not having so much legislation-wa s the result of too many restrictive' Statutes. It is to be regretted that the Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) , and his Government, deem it necessary to introduce a Bill for compulsory subscriptions to war loans, having in view the extremely handsome way in which the people of the Commonwealth have endeavoured to shoulder their responsibilities in this regard. I know that some people are of opinion that those who subscribed to the various war loans are making a "" good t h in g ; "" but any one who is interested in making money, and has capital to in vest, can find a hundred different enterprises in the Commonwealth which will return him or her a very much higher rate of interest, and on very good security, than can. be obtained from either the 4^ per cent, loans free of taxation, or the 5 per cent, loan subject to taxation. I regret also that the Acting Prime Minister felt it necessary to remark that many people in the Commonwealth have not done their duty in this regard. I have heard instances of very rich men in the Commonwealth who have actually not put a single penny into war loans; but I am satisfied that thousands, and tens of thousands, of people have undertaken heavy responsibilities, and a certain amount of risk, in the endeavour to answer the appeal of the Treasurer. While the Acting Prime Minister made that statement that a great number of people were not doing their duty, I venture to say that not a single editor of the conservative daily press, although he might use the most vulgar terms regarding men who did not see their way to enlist, and describe them-as ""shirkers,"" "" slackers,"" "" pariahs,"" and so forth, referred to any of the wealthy classes in anything like the same terms, or, indeed, in any terms, so far as I remember, of deprecation, because they had. not subscribed to war loans. It was left to the Treasurer (Mr. Watt) to call attention to the fact.",49

184,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"Of ' course the press might not have at its disposal the same information as had the Treasurer, but I think it is pretty generally known that men with very large banking accounts have not put a single penny into loans, whereas many wage-earners, who could not be certain of employment six months hence, incurred financial - responsibility order to subscribe. Does the Treasurer really mean to put this law into operation ?",50
185,Mr WATT,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,Yes .,50
186,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,I am entitled to ask that question in view of the several occasions on which Ministers have allowed Acts to lapse without giving effect to them.,50

188,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,-On another occasion a regulation was issued allowing hoys eighteen years of age to enlist without their parents consent. The Government afterwards modified it.,50
189,Mr WATT,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,That was not a regulation ; it was merely an announcement.,50
190,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"If the Government really mean business with this Bill, I sincerely hope that the Treasurer will reconsider it with a view to altering what may prove to be its most inequitable, unfair, and cruel provisions. In the event of there being a deficiency in the subscriptions to a war loan, the Treasurer is authorized to compel any one who has not subscribed to it to contribute six times the average amount he has paid in income tax in three years. The Treasurer has circulated some comparative tables, showing that the amounts which non-subscribers to the war loan may be called upon to con. tribute are as follows:INCOME FROM PERSONAL EXERTION. Income less all Minimum deductions, except Average for amount to be the deduction of £166 or less.

The Treasurer tells us that in these circumstances such a person may appeal to an Appeal Board, which will take everything into consideration. That Board will comprise the Commissioner of Taxation, the Secretary to the Treasury, and another gentleman who is to be appointed, hut the Commissioner of Taxation and the Secretary to the Treasury are both very busy men, the former being already a Court of Appeal in regard to income taxation, land taxation, and entertainments taxation. I venture to say that already he is overwhelmed with work.",50
191,Mr WATT,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,He has just heen relieved of most of the administrative routine.,50
192,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,Is that with a view to his taking up the duties which will be placed upon him by this measure?,50
193,Mr WATT,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,No . It has heen found necessary to do this in order that he may properly undertake the heavy financial work devolving upon him.,50
194,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"The Treasurer's courteous information only supports my argument that the Commissioner of Taxation has a great deal of work to do. Yet it is proposed to add to his duties by compelling him to hear the numerous appeals that will probably be made in case there should he any deficiency in the subscriptions to a war loan. I see no provision in the Bill by which he may keep a cord of non-subscribers to war loans on whom he is to make a levy. Apparently claimed if the Treasurer finds that there is deficiency in the subscriptions, to a war tions. loan, the Commissioner of Taxation will collect a list of names of persons who pay income tax, and a circular letter w he issued to them calling upon them contribute so much towards the deficiency. There are tens of thousands of people who have subscribed to previous war loans, and possibly thei'e are tens of thousands who, in answer to the Treasurer's appeal, have gone to the banks in connection with the sixth war loan, deposited 10 per cent, in cash, and undertaken, to finance the balance. Their surplus income, and even portion of the income which they require to meet their daily and weekly expenses, may already have been set apart to pay subscriptions, to previous war loans or repay the banks. Therefore, - there must appeals from all parts of the Commonhe wealth for relief from the compulsory subscriptions which people may be called upon to make. The Treasurer informed us that he did not anticipate having to put the compulloan, sory provisions of this Bill into operation. He said that the mere fact that such legishis lation was on the statute-book would a kind of threat or a sword of Damocles which people would be afraid would f a on them, and, therefore, they would conmay tribute to - the war loans without compulprofessions, sion. Indeed, he went so far as to say that the auceess of the seventh war loan was partly due to this fear.",50
195,Mr WATT,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,There is no doubt about that.,51
196,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"Ero m the experience has of what happens to people when things are said that hurt, I should say that the Treasurer's remark was one that could have been avoided in referpossessed ence to the people of Australia.",51

However, for at least twelve months a great deal of money will have to be spent. I shall not be surprised if we have to raise £50,000,000 during that period. People have responded so freely in Australia that I do not think the Treasurer will need to put this meacure into force even if it is passed. At the same time it is necessary for us to consider how inequitable the Bill is. A man with .a taxable income of £1,000 from personal .exertion, who subscribed £196 -.to the last war loan, satisfies the be requirements of the Treasurer, although may not have subscribed one penny to any of the previous war loans, but another man, with a taxable income of £1,000 a year from personal exertion, who has subscribed to every previous war is not exempt from subscribing to a new war loan, and may have to submit business affairs to the Board of A pbe peal. He may be possessed of no property; he may be paying £ 2 a week for all house, and if he has a large family he be educating his children for the ' so that his expenditure may be eating up u very considerable portion of his £1,000. On the other hand, the man who has property worth £6,000, which returns him an income of £30 0 per annum, may be called upon to subscribe only £ 2 4 18s. 6d. to the war loan, alone though he may not have subscribed to any of the previous flotations. No bank would refuse to advance £3,00 0 for investment in the war loan to a man who. £6,00 0 worth of free assets and would pledge the war loan script as collateral security. A man possessing a £6,000 wortli of property would be in a better position tosubscribe to the war loan than a man without property, even the though the latter might have an income of £1,00 0 a year. There are generous of families who spend <all their we money on their families, and put by nothing. Yet the Bill compels these men to subscribe to the war loan, and would allow the man with £6,000 worth of property to escape. That is inequitable. The Treasurer could have effecte*d his purpose more easily by following a method similar to that adopted by the Defence Department in its endeavour to get young men to enlist for military service abroad. He could have issued a circular to every man possessed of property, and in receipt of income, asking him, "" Have you subscribed to the war loan? If so, how much have you - subscribed? If you have subscribed, do you still hold your bonds or certificates of subscription ? If you have parted with your holding, to what extent have you done so?"" persons, aud some of the banks, sold their bonds and - inscribed stock at the end of six months, making anything up to 11 per cent, on the turnover of their money.",51
200,Mr BOYD,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"Do you say cent, could be made by selling war loan bonds ?",52
201,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"The £ 1 0 bonds were sold for about £ 9 17s. 6d., I think, and there was little to be made out of them, but the concession that was given in regard to the payments enabled as much as 11 per cent, to he made by selling bonds or stock after six months. Directly a man subscribed 10 per cent, of the amount that he was prepared to invent in the loan, he began to earn interest on the whole amount that he was ready to take up. Subsequently, at intervals of about a month, he completed his payments in instalments of 15, 20, 25, or 30 per cent.",52
202,Mr BOYD,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,I think that the honourable member's calculation is not correct.,52
203,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,I speak on the authority of an actuary.,52

205,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,They are based on the assumption that the stock was sold as soon as the interest on it had been ceived.,52
206,Mr BOYD,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,But stock decreases in scriber. value by the amount of the interest mediately the interest on it,52

208,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"Probably a man could not sell at par. In any case, there would be the brokerage of 10s. per cent, to pay, and, perhaps, the stock would be at a discount; but those who subscribed to the first loan made more than 4J per cent, on their money.",52
209,Mr WATT,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,Yes ; there was a bonus.,52
210,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"That bonus enabled subscribers, in some cases, to get as much as 10 per cent, or 11 per cent. . Mr Watt - It was the bait on the hook.",52
211,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"It was an inducement to get subscribers; in other words, the loan was floated at a discount. The in Many terest to investors over the whole period was £ 4 13s. 4d., although the nominal rate was 4£ per cent. Had the Treasurer issued such a circular as I have spoken of, he would have got as good a response that 11 per as he can expect by the compulsion that he proposes-. We should at least insert in the Bill a provision which will prevent soldiers' widows and other dependants from being pestered with formal requests for subscriptions.

215,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"No parent whose son has been killed on active service, or during the period of enlistment has been rendered permanently incapacitated from earning his living, should be called on to subscribe to a war loan. In my opinion, no person who has subscribed to the war loan an amount equal to six times the of his payments in income tax since the commencement of the war, and has not sold his bonds or certificates, should be compelled to make further subscriptions. The Treasurer has at his disreposal machinery enabling him to ascertain exactly the holdings of every subThe banks . would know the imnames of those on behalf of whom they has been paid. receive interest.",52
216,Mr WEST,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,The Treasurer could not ascertain the names of the holders of bonds.,52
217,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"He could ascertain the names of the holders of inscribed stock, and I think that it would not be beyond his power to ascertain who are receiving interest on bonds. The banks, in all probability, hold a lot of bonds for subscribers, and collect the interest on them.",53
218,Mr COBSEB,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,They would not be authorized to give the names of the bond holders.,53
219,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"Probably they would not disclose the information unless compelled. Would it not be fairer and cause less irritation if those intrusted with the collection of this forced subscription had a list of the names of those who have subscribed to loans with a statement of their holdings, so that a man who had subscribed to the utmost of his ability, and had not sold his bonds or stock, might not be called upon to assist in making good any deficiency!",53
220,Mr WATT,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,I thought I had made it clear that that is what is contemplated. Notices are not to be sent to all taxpayers indiscriminately; they will be based on the knowledge which the Commissioner will have of the war-loan holdings of taxpayers.,53
221,Mr KELLY,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"'Then the man not subscribed at all will escape, while the man who has subscribed to three loans and not to the fourth will be punished ?",53
222,Mr WATT,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,The man who has not subscribed at all will be caught first.,53
223,Mr KELLY,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,How will the Department know that a man has not subscribed ! It can have records only of those who are holders of inscribed stock.,53
224,Mr WATT,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"We have a.record of the names of holders of inscribed stock, and nan get the names of the holders of Treasury bonds.",53
225,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"I do not remember the Treasurer having said at any previous time that it was the intention of the D e partment to get those records. The Department has the names in the ledgers of those who bought inscribed stock, but it will not have the names of those who hold bonds.",53
226,Mr ABCHIBALD,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,It will have the names of the original buyers.,53
227,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,But the bonds change hands from time to time.,53
228,Mr WATT,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,All the changes are recorded.,53
229,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"It would not be difficult for the Commissioner of Taxation to get a list of the people who are able to subscribe to the loan, and he can get from the Commonwealth Statistician a list of the people who have property. Of course, persons may have large estates, and yet not have very big incomes. If the Treasurer can get all this information, and he admits that he can,- would it not be better for him, instead of introducing this Bill , to ascertain the names of the persons who have not subscribed, and send to them notices asking why they have not done their duty.",53
230,Mr WATT,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"D u r in g the last two years we have done a great deal of that. I sent out 14,000 notices in connection with the sixth war loan.",53
231,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,Did the Treasurer know that the persons to whom the notices were sent had not subscribed!,53
232,Mr WATT,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,No ; but we had a very fair idea.,53
233,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,That is news. I would have preferred that the Treasurer had who has stated the matter in that way when he said what the effect of this Bill would be on the people rather than that he should have cast a broad aspersion on the general public.,53
234,Mr WATT,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"I made it plain that the Bill was not aimed at the general public, but at those persons who.should have subscribed, but had not done so.",53
235,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"There can be no doubt that, whatever methods were adopted by the Treasurer, the public were induced to subscribe very liberally to the war loans, and I believe that inasmuch as the huge borrowing that was required to carry on the war will shortly be unneces: sary, and that the money we shall require to borrow for purposes of repatriation will not amount to anything like the sums we have raised during the last year or two, the Treasurer ought to reconsider his intention to force this Bill through the House and allow it to lapse.",53
236,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"Kooyong) [8.35]. - I endorse the appeal of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) that the Treasurer should reconsider the necessity or otherwise of proceeding with this Bill. We are hopeful that we have got beyond the very heavy borrowing stage. It is gratifying indeed to know that the seventh war loan was a distinct success, and I believe that future borrowing will not be of the same dimensions, except for renewal purposes, as the loans we have been raising during the war. If Treasurer,- who is the responsible Minister, declares that the exigencies of the case demand that this Bill shall be proceeded with, I will not oppose it , but on the face of it , the measure, as framed, will create many hardships by reason of its inequitable incidence. The B i ll has been brought on sq. unexpectedly that I am at a disadvantage in debating it , but speaking generally, so far as its objective is to make shirkers shoulder their share of financial responsibility I am with the Treasurer. If a loan is undersubscribed, it is necessary, according to the machinery of the measure, that the Treasurer shall notify the Commissioner of Taxation of the amount of the shortage and then the Commissioner must send out notices to those who he thinks ought to subscribe. The mere issue of that notice in itself involves a penalty which, cannot be mitigated if the Commissioner's contention is upheld. It is quite true that a person upon whom the notice. has been served has a right to appeal, and if he satisfies the Board of Referees that he should not subscribe, it is competent for, the Board either to release him from the obligation cast upon him by the notice, or to reduce the amount of his compulsory subscription. But, even though the Board sees f it to remit portion of the amount the man has been called upon to subscribe, he is nevertheless to a penalty corresponding to the proportion he is ultimately obliged to subscribe. Many instances of the inequitable effect of this Bill have come under my notice, and, bad I known that the measure would be proceeded with to-night, I should have been prepared to quote some examples to the House.",53
237,Mr WATT,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,I did not intend to bring on the Bill to-night.,54
238,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"On e instance has come under my immediate notice. A man, who in ordinary circumstances would be liable to subscribe nearly £5,000, on the basis of six' times hi3 average income tax, has already made subscriptions to previous loans to the extent of £30,000. That has involved him very heavily, but, being .animated by the strong patriotic feeling, he felt keenly his duty, and he did not hesitate to pledge himself financially in order to subscribe to all war loans but the last.",54
239,Mr AKCHIBAED,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"He would not he called upon to subscribe further. - Sir ROBERT BEST - Accordin g to the terms of the Bill , that man, who has already subscribed six times the amount he would be called upon to contribute under the terms of this Bill , will be liable to a penalty unless he subscribes to the latest war ioan six times the amount of his average income tax during the current financial year. B y way of contrast, take the case of the man who has not subscribed at all. He has but to subscribe to the present war loan six times the amount of his average income and he is removed from possibility of attack by the Commissioner. He is the man whom we desire to reach with a measure of this kind, no doubt, but he has been a shirker, and escapes penalty, whereas in the other case the patriot is liable to suffeT. I am speaking only of the terms of the Bill ; I am prepared to think that substantial relief would be granted in the actual administration of it.. If not, this House dare not pass such a measure. It is competent for any man to go before the Appeal Board, and we may suppose that that tribunal would be influenced by the circumstance that a man had made subscriptions to previous loans; indeed, liable they are required to do so. It is true that the sending out of notices is at the discretion of the Commissioner, but I am not persuaded that the Commissioner can possibly know who are the present holders of bonds. He may know who the original subscribers were, but the bonds may have been sold, and the original subscriber may not. now be a holder at all. In those circumstances the Commissioner cannot say whether or not any man holds bonds. In regard to inscribed stock the position is different. The Department has records from which the names of holders of stock can be ascertained, and those persons will not receive notices - to subscribe an amount six times in It is desirable that the Commissioner should at least give some intimation to the individual whom he thinks should be a subscriber that, in his opinion, he has not full y discharged his duty in respect of a particular loan. If such an intimation were given and the man still refused to subscribe, or failed to give good and valid reasons for failing subscribe, then he would render himself liable to a penalty with eyes open. But the fact is that men are in a condition of great uncertainty by reason of the fact that no minimum holding is fixed by the Bill whereby a man can be secure, other than his actual subscription in the year to the latest loan. That is his only security. The Bill does not take into account subscriptions to previous loans. If it were possible for the Commissioner to know who had already subscribed, the position would be different; but, in the circumstances, serious in j u r y may be done to a large number of individuals who have already discharged their full duty in this respect. The terms of the Bill are harsh, and its success will largely depend upon the way in which it is administered. members of the Board of three which is to administer it-the Commissioner Taxation and the Secretary to the Treasury-have already been nominated. know them to be fair and reasonablyminded men, and I am confident they will have due regard to the exigencies of those who are called upon to subscribe, and who have already subscribed to previous loans. Harshly administered, the Bill would do serious and gross injustice to the unfortunate people upon whom notices undur it were served. I ask the Treat, arer to consider whether it is necessr.ry now to pr;»ceed with it. If he still thinks that it is, I urge him to give the House an assurance which will remove the uncertainty that now exists as to the position in which many placed under the Bill as it stands. A man Sir Robert Best. might have financially embarrassed himself in order to contribute to previous loans, but unless he is prepared to subscribe to a war loan during each financial year in which a war loan may be launched excess - of the income tax paid by himhe may be penalized. One reply that the Treasurer will make to this complaint is that arrangements have been made with the banks to advance 90 per cent, of the amount to be subscribed. It must not be forgotten, however, that such advances must be repaid within eighteen months, and that in many cases where a to man has other financial obligations, it would be quite impossible to make the rehis paym%ot within that period. Another reply which the honourable gentleman may make to my objection is that any attempt to fix the minimum subscription to a loan might discourage subscriptions on the part of a large number of people. financial It may be said that because of the uncertainty which exists under the Bill as it stands, many persons will take care to protect themselves by making large subscriptions. It is not fair, however, that those who have already done their duty full y and completely in this regard should be liable to be penalized in the manner prescribed by the Bill . . We have to hope for some relief in the administration of the measure. It may work out satisfactorily, hut, on the other hand, it may not. It is certainly a source of the deepest anxiety to a number of conscienTwo tious men who have already done their duty. of",54
240,Mr CORSER,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"The people to whom the We honourable member refers will always have the right to sell their previous holdings. that Sir ROBERT BEST - That will be the only protection open to such individuals. But in selling out his existing holdings a man may depress the market to a degree and proportionately discount fresh subscriptions to the new loan. I know that the Treasurer appreciates these difficulties in connection with the Bill , and I certainly hope he will endeavour to fix a minimum subscription. Debate (on motion by Mr KELLY ) adjourned. will be ELECTORAL BILL. Assent, reported. IRON AND STEEL BOUNTY BILL. In Committee (Consideration of Governor General's message) :",55
241,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"Richmond-Honorar y Minister) [8.55] -- I move That it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue bo made for the purposes of a Bill for an Act to provide for the payment of bounty on the manufacture of black stoel sheets and galvanized sheets in the Commonwealth. The object of the Bill which will be based upon this appropriation is to provide for the payment of a bounty on the manufacture of black steel sheets aud galvanized sheets in the Commonwealth. I need hardly state that this is an industry which is needed, perhaps, more than any other in Australia. Owing to the fact that we were not manufacturing the black sheets from which galvanized sheets, and also steel plates are made, we were compelled during the war period to pay prices much in excess of those which would otherwise have ruled. The bounty for which this Bill provides will enable manufacturers here to turn out the raw material-that is to say, the black sheetsfrom which both galvanized sheets and t in plate are made.",56
242,Mr RIXEY,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,Will it reduce present prices ?,56
243,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"We believe that it will result in the price to the Australian public being very much less than it has been throughout the war. iron, which in pre-war days was selling at from £18 to £19 per ton, went up during the war to something like £100 per ton.",56
244,Mr TUDOR,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,What was the price fixed?,56
245,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"The price fixed was a percentage on the landed, cost.",56
246,Mr HIGGS,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,The material went from one to another u n t i l the price was brought up to £100 per ton.,56
247,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"The regulations put a stop to that. During the war period, we have also been paying an enormous increase on the pre-war price of tinned plate, which, as honourable members know, forms the raw material from which the packing for many of our primary products is manufactured. I have not the slightest doubt that the non-existence of this industry in the Commonwealth has led to Australia having to pay, during the war, an enormous bill which she would not otherwise have had to meet.",56
248,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,Would it not be better to make a comparison on normal prices ?,56
249,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,I merely referred to the vastly increased prices of - galvanized iron and tin plate during the war period to illustrate the need for the establishment of this industry in Australia.,56
250,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,We should give the manufacturers sufficient encouragement to carry on the industry under normal conditions.,56
251,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,That is exactly what we propose to do. I should prefer to explain the details of the Government proposal when the Bill itself is before us.,56
252,Mr TUDOR,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"If we give you the motion, shall we not be committed to the terms of the message?",56
253,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,The House will be committed by the terms of the message under the Standing Orders in exactly the same way as in the case of a taxation measure.,56
254,Mr TUDOR,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,Shal l we be allowed to amend the Bill ?,56
255,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,An honourable member will be allowed to propose any amendment he desires.,56
256,Mr BOYD,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,Exceptin g so far as it Galvanized might increase taxation.,56
257,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"The amount cannot be increased, but there is no amount actually specified in the message. It is not possible for me to give an undertaking that at the Committee stage of the Bill honourable members will be ahle to introduce amendments which the. rules of the House do not allow. I might explain at this stage that it is proposed to raise the bounty on a' sliding scale, and the amount paid will depend largely on what the shipping freights to Australia are. The proposals have been talked over very caref u l l y with gentlemen likely to manufacture this article in Australia.",56
258,Mr WEST,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,W it h Hoskins?,56
259,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,I do not think so.,56
260,Mr WEST,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,I know.,56
261,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"I repeat that these proposals have been talked over very carefully with gentlemen who, we believe, will engage in this industry if it is established in Australia ; and they are quite prepared, so long as the shipping freights do not fall below £ 6 per ton, to go on erecting their works and manufacturing this article without any bounty or further protection. able members are aware that there is at present a duty on galvanized-iron sheets, the rate being, speaking from memory, 25s. per ton. There is no duty whatever on black sheets. We are proposing to establish a bounty, as well as the duty, on galvanized sheets; and this, we believe, will enable manufacturers to establish this industry, and for the future carry it on in competition with the world. The rate of shipping freights will be sent to us from time to time by the Board of Trade in London, and the bounty will be paid quarter by quarter on the certificate of the Board as the shipping freights from ports in England. . As the shipping freights come down the bounty will automatically increase, until the net duty and bounty on galvanized sheets will amount, I think, to £ 5 per ton, that is, the combined effect of the duty and bounty when the shipping freights fall to the lowest point mentioned in the Bill . But if the shipping; freights are above the minimum amount mentioned in the Bill, then the bounty will be correspondingly less. Mr FOWT.ER - What percentage is on the average value of the article?",57
262,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"Takin g iron after the war at £ 2 0 per ton, it will l-e 25 cent. ; and we think that will be sufcastle. ficient for the manufacturers, under Auswire tralian conditions, to compete in the markets of the world.",57
263,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,Is there not big difference in the wages paid ? ,57
264,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"There may have been prior to the war, but the general impression, particularly amongst the men who will manufacture this article, is that rate of wages in European countries is not going to fall to the pre-war level. They feel convinced that the industrial conditions in European countries are going to be more closely assimilated than take. previously to those that obtain in this country. Consequently, we believe that the proposed duty, combined with the bonus, will be sufficient to enable manufacturers to carry on here.",57
265,Mr LECKIE,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,Do you propose a duty on black-steel sheet or ti n plates?,57
266,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"Not at the present Honormoment; but bounty will be paid on black-steel sheets. I may say that nego- tiations have been going on for some considerable time between the Broken Hill Company and Messrs. Lysaght, who have been the chief importers of galvanized iron. Those negotiations, I believe, have borne f r u it , and Messrs. Lysaght are about to erect at Newcastle a plant which, for a start, will turn out at least 20,000 tons of iron per year.",57
267,Mr TUDOR,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,Of black sheets?,57
268,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"Of galvanized iron. There is also another proposition which, I believe, will come to a head very shortly, for the negotiations are well forward, and under which the tin-plate in dustry will be established at Newcastle on a .very large scale; in fact, it is hoped that sufficient t in plates will be turned out to meet the whole future requirements of Australia.  ting ?",57
269,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"This Bill does not deal with wire netting; but I can assure the honourable member that negotiations it have taken place, and definite arrangements have been made, to draw the. whole of the wire for wire netting requirements per with a big plant to be erected in NewWe hope to see the whole of the required for. wire netting, fencing wire, and so forth , turned out at these works in the near future. 'This plant is a in connection with the steel works at Newcastle. Without going into the details of the Bill at this moment, I should like to say that Messrs. Lysaght are almost in entire the agreement with ourselves in regard to this bonus 'being sufficient to warrant them in erecting these works and carrying on the industry at Newcastle.",57
270,Mr WEST,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,You are making a mis,57
271,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"The honourable member may know a great deal more about this matter than I do; hut I can tell him that I have personally conducted the negotiations with Messrs. Lysaght and with the sub-committee of the Board of Trade, and Messrs. Lysaght inform me, through their representative in Australia, that they are entirely satisfied with these conditions, if we will go one little step further.",58
272,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,We did not get these full explanations when the Labour Government introduced Bonus Bills. They threw them on the table and rang for the Caucus.,58
273,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"I think I have given the Committee sufficient information to enable honourable members to form an opinion as to whether or not the resolution submitted should be passed. When the Bill is introduced it will show what the proposals of the Government are, and I shall be delighted to give a full explanation of its provisions.",58
274,Mr TUDOR,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"Y a r r a ) [ 9 . 1 1 ] that the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs has given the Committee an explanation of a very important proposal. Of course honourable members are not as acquainted as the Minister is with the details. T should like to say that . previous Bonus Bills introduced were not, as the honourable member for Parkes (Mr . Bruce Smith) has said, thrown upon the table by members of a Labour Government.",58
275,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,".They were on the table, and the Government then raiig for the Caucus.",58
276,Mr TUDOR,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"That statement is not correct. It was my privilege to duce two or three of such Bills, but I know that the original Iron Bounty introduced by the late Sir William Lyne, and a general Bounty Bill providing bounties on flax, wool-tops, and a ber of other manufactures was also introOld duced by that gentleman. We are now considering one of the most important messages dealt with previous to the introduction of a Bill . We are in the dark as to the amount of bounty proposed to be granted. Recently, in considering a message of this kind, were confronted with the position that we accepted the resolution moved, it would be impossible for us afterwards to vary the terms of the message, which covered a taxation Bill . The honourable member for Hunter . (Mr Charlton) endeavoured to submit an amendment to the Bill , but it was promptly ruled out of order as against the terms of the message. Before we are asked to go on with the consideration of the Bill to which this resolution refers, we should be given time to compare it with the Act under which a . bounty was granted on the manufacture of p'g iron and steel sheets. We should be in a position to assure ourselves as to the iudustrial conditions of the employees who will be engaged in the industry that is to be assisted by the proposed bounty. I recognise that it is very important that this industry should be established in the Commonwealth. I believe that it - will be impossible for this Parliament to grant a bounty equivalent to the protection afforded during the past two or three years by the high shipping freights which have prevailed. If the rate of - I realise freight from Great Britain to Australia on such a commodity is to be £ 6 per ton, there will be but a very poor lookout for the wheat farmers of this country.",58
277,Mr LECKIE,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,The rate of freight will be lower in three months.,58
278,Mr TUDOR,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"I do not think so. I do not say that freights will be kept up at their present rates, but I think that for some time to come they will certainly be as high as £ 6 per ton.  thrown duced now by 25 per cent.",58
279,Mr TUDOR,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,On what rate of freight is that percentage based ? Freights have introbeen up to £ 1 2 and £ 1 4 per ton.,58
280,Mr CORSER,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,The average freight now Bill was is £9 or £10 per ton.,58
281,Mr TUDOR,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"I think that it may be for £10 per ton on such a commodity as numiron, which could be brought from the Country before the war at a freight rate of, I suppose, 53. per torn",58
282,Mr CORSER,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,O r as ballast.,58
283,Mr TUDOR,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"I remember long before the the Newcastle works were established, when Mr Hoskins was operating the we works at Lithgow, and when Mr Sandi f ford, before him , had charge of those works, the complaint was made that it was impossible to start the iron industry in Australia, because pig-iron was i m ported from Scotland and other places as ballast, and the local article would not have the advantage of the protection afforded by a freight charge. When the Iron Bounty Bill was being introduced in 1907, the late Sir Will i a m Lyne made the statement that it cost more to bring pig-iron from Sydney to Melbourne than from. Liverpool to Melbourne. I shall look forward with interest the provisions of the proposed Bill see whether it is not possible for establish this industry on a firm footing in Australia. The increase in the of pig-iron has not heen proportionate with the increase in the cost of galvanized iron. Notwithstanding the fact that the Government fixed the price of galvanized iron, and allowed 10 per cent, on landed cost, eliminating the sale and re-sale the commodity, contractors and othersimported article. found it impossible to obtain sralvanized iron unless they purchased their joinery chance of succeeding. from the same firm, and an increased price was charged for the joinery, overcome the fixed rate on galvanized no tinning has been done here. iron. In order to defeat the intention of the Government in fixing the price, another expedient was resorted to. The price was fixed for new galvanized iron and not for second-hand, and new galvanAustralia. ized iron had holes punched through it in the places necessary for the erection of, say, a G4t. fence or the roof of a house, and it was then sold as second hand galvanized iron at a price higher than that fixed hy the Government for new galvanized iron. I know that to my support to this Bill . be an absolute fact, and information as to what was heing done was given to that Senator Russell, who had charge of price fixing at the time.",58
284,Mr BOYD,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,Who put up that yarn the Minister?,59
285,Mr TUDOR,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"T he information was great industry. absolutely correct. The price of galvanized iron went up to such an extent contractors were prepared to take down a second-hand galvanized iron fence and replace it with a new jarrah fence, pay a certain sum of money in addition. That was done in more than one State in the Coniniomvealth during the past twelve months. I may inform honourable members that the race-course at Erankston was fenced with a galvanized iron fence that had stood for for ty years, and it was purchased at a price which represented double as much for the iron as was paid for it when the fence was erected. I am prepared to lend every reasonable assistance to place this in dustry on its feet, as we did the pig-iron industry, because that was the foundato tion of our steel rail 'business, and en, to abled us to send steel rails to the other us to side of the world for use in connection with the war. My previous experience of cost Bounty Acts leads me to look forward with pleasure to .seeing this Bill itself. Notwithstanding what the Minister has said,, we produced black steel sheets at Lithgow, where there was a mill for galvanizing and corrugating them; but it of was found impossible to compete with the Now that conditions have changed, the industry may have a I do not think that black sheets for tinning have ever to been jproduced in Australia. Certainly The honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford) raised the question in this House, and discussed the advisability of giving a bonus for the manufacture of t in plates in. That would be a step in the right, direction, and would lead to the establishment of another industry to which our men who are returning could turn their attention.",59

287,The CHAIRMAN,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S, I have already told the Leader of the Opposition that the message is so framed that it will not prevent and honourable members from making any amendment in the Bill .,59
288,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"If wo consider that the bounty is not sufficient, can we increase it ? - The CHAIRMAN - No . Honourable members cannot increase the charge on the people without a message from the Governor General recommending it .",60
289,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"My complaint is that if we consider that the Minister is not giving sufficient consideration to this industry our hands are tied. We have to accept a measure which may not go so far as we should like to go, or reject it altogether. In the consideration of the establishment of such a big industry the Minister ought to have the advantage of the full consensus of opinion of the House. No one would be foolish enough to assert that there should be the slightest party feeling over a matter of this kind.",60
290,Mr SINCLAIR,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,We must be sure that the Bill will not create a big monopoly.,60
291,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"That is a risk which has to be faced. astonished to hear the Minister say that some of the big industries we looked forward to establishing in Australia are now in actual operation as a result of the war conditions. Some honourable members were afraid of the high rate of wages that would have to be paid, but the war has shown us that the highest wages are often the best wages k ' pay. The Australian workman is so inach superior to most of the workmen overseas.",60
292,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,Provide: ! there is no slow-down policy.,60
293,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"That is the difficulty. How are we going to get along in this country if we do not establish industries? As an old Protectionist, I welcome the wonderful conversions we see all around us. Enthusiastic bar.rackers for Protection of today were Henry Georgeites a short time ago. I do not chide them. On the contrary, I welcome them to the fold. The Australian workman has shown that if he chooses to work he can earn good wages. Men of the Hoskins type are glad to pay big wages. The go-slow policy, I hope, will be condemned in every direction. That it is not one the Australian workman adopts has beeu shown during this war. [303] answer to an interjection the Minister said that some of these industries were about to be established by negotiations with big firms. We ought to avoid monopolies. We must base our legislation on such foundations that tliere will be some competition. 'During the war we have seen wonderful rises in ;the prices of articles manufactured in Australia. We can only avoid this by competition.",60
294,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"The negotiations referred to have been carried on apart from the Government, though we have been aware of them. The Broken Hill Company have been in negotiation with various subsidiary companies.",60
295,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"I am not opposed to big companies. We must have companies with big capital to initiate big industrial undertakings. On the other hand, we must be careful to see that we do not put the whole thing in their laps so that monopolies will be created on every side. My personal opinion is that the less the Government have to do with I was these matters the better it is.. Government interference in price-fixing is an example of the harm that may be done. Every ""day in the week the price of primary products has been fixed, but the Government have forgotten to fix the most important thing-the seasons. Until the seasons can be fixed, price fixing will always prove to be a failure. We must also be careful not to bring about a system of Socialism. It is astonishing how men who have talked the loudest against Socialism now accept without a murmur a proposition which really is the 'Socialism that they would have avoided a short time ago. I have no doubt that if the Minister has framed his Bill on reasonable lines, which will give consideration to those who are engaged in this industry, he will receive generous support from the House.",60
296,Mr BRENNAN,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,Has he not told us that he has been in consultation with the big manufacturers ?,60
297,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"Why should he net get the information from any source. The trouble in the past has been that this was not done. However, the Minister,should take care that In the big manufacturers do not outflank him as the small manufacturers would if they had the chance of doing so. must leave an open field for competition. Honourable members have talked about the protection which is afforded by high shipping freights, but the great factor is the cost of production in other countries. What is the use of giving a bounty if it will not compensate for the low rates of wages which are paid across the seas?",60
298,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"If freights are ton, they are a very big protection.",61
299,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"Some big corporations are very clever with their bookkeeping, and the Minister knows that some of them run their own ships.",61
300,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,That is safeguarded in the B i ll by the fact that the Board of Trade in London must declare from time to time what are the market rates of freight.,61
301,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"I am glad to hear that all these tilings are safeguarded. It is a very difficult task to safeguard them. We want to provide a fair field and no favour, and to see that our workmen have an opportunity of getting a living.",61

303,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"I am prepared to judge these things in the light of the past, and not in a theoretical way. Government enterprise' inthese matters has been a failure in Australia. Look at the industries which the State has fathered in New South Wales.",61
304,Mr RILEY,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,Does the honourable member think that the Post Ofiice is a failure ?,61
305,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"The honourable member for South Sydney (Mr . Riley) is a better judge of the encouragement which should be given to the manufacture of wool tops. If the Government will extend to this industry the same measure of encouragement that has been granted to the wool-top industry, I shall be quite satisfied. I congratulate the Minister for Price Fixing (Mr . Greene) upon this proposal, but I would have been better pleased had he stated that it was the intention of the Government to embark upon a similar policy in regard to every industry in the country. I would have welcomed the announceWe ment that the Bill which he wishes to in troduce represents only the beginning of a big scheme to provide employment for our own people.",61

309,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"I will accept the advice of the sagacious member for Henty (Mr Boyd) by taking what I can get, and then asking for a little more. But I cannot forget that when I stood at the table of the House in the capacity of a Minister and made certain promises, though the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) and a few more stood staunchly by, I always had to ascertain quietly or by some other means where other honourable members stood. However, we now look back upon those times as pleasant memories. Honourable memlet the bers who did not then agree with me that it was high time we established industries in Australia-member s like the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Bruce Smith), who was not then a Protectionist",61
310,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,I cannot see any cure for the present position. You have reared so many houses of cards that we cannot take them down.,61
311,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"The war has shown us what fools we have been to send our raw products across the seas in order that they may undergo the process of manufacture at the hands of foreigners, and that upon being returned to us we may pay for them five times their original cost. We cavil about giving the Australian workman an in crease of 10 per cent, on his wages; and yet we willingly pay the foreigner 400 per cent, and 500 per cent, more for the manufacture of our products into finished articles. I have held the opinion, which I am now voicing, all my life, but I do not pride myself upon the fact, because I recognise that wise men alter their views. I congratulate the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Bruce Smith)",61
312,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,I cannot tell whether the honourable member wishes the State to control this industry or not. He blows hot and cold.,62
313,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,I have already said that I am opposed to the State control of industries and to price fixing.,62
314,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,Then why did the honourable member say that he hoped the State would take up all industries?,62
315,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"I did not. If the honourable member cannot understand what I say, that is not my fault. I tried to make myself understood .",62
316,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,I admit that.,62
317,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"But it is very difficult to make the honourable member understand. However, I welcome him into the Protectionist fold. I should like the Government to give assistance to all industries,- but not to assume control of them. I congratulate the Minister for Price Fixing (M - Greene) upon possessing such a warm barracker as the honourable member for Parkes.",62
318,Mr RILEY,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"South Sydney) [9.35] The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) is very inconsistent. He has affirmed his belief in allowing private enterprise full play, and announced his opposition to anything in the form of Socialism. Y e the now in tends to support a Bill , the very root principle of which is Socialism. It appears to me that some honourable members want private enterprise when it suits them to have it , but are willing to accept State aid to private enterprise whenever they can get it . Personally, I intend to be very careful in regard to this bounty proposal. The Minister for Price Fixing (Mr Greene) has stated that if the freight falls below £ 6 per ton, the bounty will operate. Before the war galvanized iron could be bought at from £ 1 8 to £ 2 0 per ton, and the Minister now proposes to extend to the industry a bounty of £ 5 per ton. That is equivalent to 25 per cent, upon its pre-war prices-no t a bad bounty.",62
319,Mr SINCLAIR,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,He did not say that the bounty will be 25 per cent.,62
320,Mr RILEY,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,But that is the rate at . which it works out.,62
321,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"If the honourable member will wait until he receives, a copy of the Bill , he will see that all these things have been full y provided for.",62
322,Mr RILEY,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,I am only making use of the Minister's own statement.,62
323,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,That was not my statement.,62
324,Mr RILEY,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"The Minister said that if the freight fell below £ 6 per ton he would make the measure of protection up to that amount, by means of the bounty.",62
325,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"No , no!",62
326,Mr RILEY,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"We all desire to see this industry started. But we are not prepared to pay large companies huge bonuses which will make them millionaires within a short time. Does the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Chapman) know that the labour that will be employed in this industry will be very small indeed ? As a matter of fact, the work r is chiefly done by machinery.",62
327,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,The Messrs. Hoskins employ plenty of human machinery.,62
328,Mr RILEY,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"If a big company embarks upon the manufacture of galvanized iron in Australia it will be equipped with up-to-date machinery, and, consequently, there will not be much difference between the cost of the labour that will be employed in it and the cost of similar labour engaged in the industry elsewhere. I would like to see the industry established, but we need to be very careful as to whafc we do in the direction of granting a bounty to it . I need scarcely point oufc that,- although no boots have been i m ported into this country for a very considerable time, on account of the war, boots are dearer than ever they were. Notwithstanding that Australia is full of,, leather, and that we have the requisite labour and machinery in abundance, boots are today costing at least 25 per cent, more than they should cost.",62
329,Mr SINCLAIR,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,What about the woollen industry ?,62
330,Mr RILEY,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,The mere fact of estabwith lishing the galvanized-iron industry in our midst will be no guarantee that the consumer will be able to purchase plies of that article any cheaper than may be purchased today.,63
331,Mr CORSER,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"The increased cost boots is due to the large quantity of direction. leather which is held in the country, and which cannot be got away.",63

But'the price of the manufactured article is put up to the price of the imported article. The same thing will happen in regard to manufacthat. tures of iron. I think that we should fix in the Bill a maximum price for galvanprotected ized iron if we are going to give a bounty for the production of that article.",63
333,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"It is provided in the Bill that, if the manufacturer's profit, ascertained by the Auditor-General, ceeds a certain percentage, he shall rematerial, ceive no bounty.",63

335,Mr WATKINS,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"Newcastle) [9.42] Like other honourable members, I think that the time has come when Australia regard to bounties. should foster w,hat industries she has, and offer inducements for the establishment of new industries. I recognise the need, when bounties are to be given, for safeguards as the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley) has menThe tioned. The only fault I find with the Government proposal is that it does take in more kinds of iron and steel promoney duction. We have in Australia one the finest and most up-to-date steel works in the world, and it is proposed to start, Australian capital, the manufacture of certain articles for which steel of the finest quality will be required. Austrasuplian engineeringfinns which suffered they from the shortage of raw material at the beginning of the war propose important of and far-reaching developments in this",63
336,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,I do not think that the honourable member can say that any capital is purely Australian. English money is constantly flowing into and Accordout of Australia.,63

338,Mr RILEY,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,-No bounty is given for,63
339,Mr WATKINS,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"No r is the industry with a duty; and our. population is so small that the market is limited. On the other hand, we are, per head of population, the largest users of galvanas ized iron in the world. The manufacture exof railway wheels, axles, and similar for which the finest quality steel is needed, and for which the market is small, should be encouraged. The schedule should cover every hranch of steel - be* manufacture. I should like to add that the production of wheels, axles, and tyres will not only require the use of steei of the finest quality, but will give far more employment than the manufacture of galused vanized iron. I do not make this comparison to prevent the Government from going ou with the proposed bounty; I ; make it to show that the whole iron industry should be put on a proper basis in  often long for the old days of this Parsuch liament, when we were ranged on each side as Eree Traders or Protectionists. Melbourne Age wa3 then continually decrying the importer and the indentor, not and explaining the need for keeping in the country. It wanted a fence of put round Australia to keep in our money. That policy suited manufacturing States like Victoria, but the people of otlier parts of the Commonwealth had to pay for it . I cannot see the difference between the fat importer, livin g in a beautiful house on the shores of Sydney Harbor, and a f at manufacturer living in Melbourne. The war has shown what the manufacturers are capable of in their treatment of the consumers. I came into the House a confirmed Free Trader, believing in the free interchange of products between countries. The tionist used to say, "" Why not have our own factories, employing our own workmen to make everything we want, leaving it to other countries to do the same."" One staunchest Protectionists I have ever known was my present Leader, the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor). Several times I wa3 almost converted by the arguments of the honourable member until I could get away and think for myself.",63
340,Mr GROOM,CONTROL OE NAVALWATER S,"On some items you were a sound Protectionist.  The lionorable memher knows how I slipped on bananas. It was in doing a "" p a l "" a good turn ; and I fell. lieve in Australia being self-contained All Australian manufactures, new and old, should he given a square deal. I tliere is one thing that will make continent great, it is the steel and iron dustry; ancl when that has been estabto lished others must follow.

The firm of Walkers Limited, borough, produces some of the most excellent machinery in the world. The firm is now engaged in the construction of their labour upon those jobs. steel ships, and it has turned out some of the finest locomotives ever run in this land. Walkers Limited has successfully competed, in a State where wages have been higher than elsewhere, in connection with locomotive orders for Victoria and South Australia. I believe in the principle of bounties rather than in that of Protective duties, because then we know very well what we have t n njiv. An industry, until it has or steel. [304] "" become well established, should he assisted by bonuses. In the early days of Federation, in preaching the cause of Protection, the Age told people all ahout the bright side of the Protectionist argument. This war has shown us what Protection has done. An honourable member interjects that it has shown the necessity for Protection. I can only say that, had there been any more of it here, God Protec- knows what would have become of the people! The more our industries have flourished lately, the more the people have been robbed. In the absence of competition, which was the very thing that of the kept the price of local manufactures, down, up went the cost of everything we eat and drink and wear-no t forgetting our entertainments. In Australia we have the raw material, and we have workmen second to none. They have proved that overseas during the war, both in the matter of workmanship aud of speed.

Why should the people he taxed for the purpose of paying a bonus to a set of so-called philanthropic individuals who desire to establish industries and wring more profits out of the community?

I cannot see any sense in the people taxing themselves to provide bonuses for private enterprise to establish industries, when the country can raise millions of pounds ior the purpose of engaging in the slaughter of the human race. Are we to industrialize Australia, and adopt the mad system that has.been adopted in every other country? Let us take note of what has happened elsewhere.
