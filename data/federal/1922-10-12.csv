1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Eon Sir Elliot Johnson) took the chair at 11 a.m., and read prayers. ARMISTICE DAY,.",14
2,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minister observed in .this morning's newspapers a cablegram from London, to the following effect:An Lnfluentially signed petition has - been gent to Mr LLOYD - George, suggesting that he should confer forthwith with the Dominion Prime Ministers and the Secretary for India with a view to advising His Majesty the King to appeal to citizens throughout the Empire to observe November 11 as an occasion for . special prayers for the Empire's peace and prosperity. It was on the 11th November, 1918, that the Germans publicly acknowledged defeat, and that fighting in the Great War oeased. Will the Prime Minister support the suggestion contained in' this message!",14
3,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I have not seen the cablegram. The honourable member does not suggest that we should take this action except in conjunction with other parts of the Empire?,15
4,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I suggest that we should do so, even if other parts of the Empire do not.",15
5,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I shall ascertain what the Prime Minuter of the United Kingdom intends to do in the matter. My own view ie that, in any case, the idea is a good one. PUBLIC SERVICE INCREMENTS.",15
6,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,Ther o is a fear on the part of the public servants of the Commonwealth that increments within the grades are to be withheld this year. Will the Prime Minister see that such increments are paid ?,15
7,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"My honourable colleague, the Treasurer, states that the Estimates make .provision for. their payment. ' NA "" PILLAGING "".  that the question of pillaging is of carinquiries dinal importance to the commercial comDepartment munity, and that a Royal Commission which was appointed to inquire into the subject cost £1,746, I desire to know whether the attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs has beendrawn to a question on notice whioh I ' put yesterday to the Minister, inquiring whether a mise had <been. given that, as soon as the recommendations of the Commission had speculators? heen considered by the States, a Federal Conference would he called; and, i when it would be convened. The Prime Minister referredme to the honourable gentleman, and I ask that he furnish me with an answer tomorrow.",15
8,Mr RODGERS,PEDERAL CONFERENCE ON,"Speakin g from memory, I think that all the States are not in accord in regard to this matter, so that effect cannot 'be given to the original proposal that simultaneous action should be taken by all the States, if the report of the Commission proved the necessity for such a step. I understand that some of the States do not admit that general pillaging takes place, and consequently uniform action is not likely. SUGAR: INCREASED DUTY.",15
9,Mr FENTON,PEDERAL CONFERENCE ON,"I desire to ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether, if the Parliament agrees to the proposal to increase to £14 perton the duty on sugar, that will mean the immediate docontrol of the sugar industry in Australia?",15
10,Mr RODGERS,PEDERAL CONFERENCE ON,No control exists at present in respect of the sugar to which the proposed new duty of £14 per ton relates. That duty applies only .to beet sugar. NA LLNE OF STEAMERS.,15
11,Mr MAHONY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Some six weeks ago, I asked the Prime Minister a question in reference to repairs to the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers, and he promised to obtain certain information for me. I desire to know whether that information will be available to the House before we go into recess.",15
12,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I cannot say. We have sent to the head office for the information, and if it comes to hand in time, it will he. made available. I shall make as to whether it has reached .my during .the last day or two. NA NA PAYMENT OF COMPENSATION.",15

14,Mr BRUCE,AFRICA,"Yes ; the payment has f so, been made through 'the Treasury. SITTINGS OF THE HOUSE.",15
15,Mr BAMFORD,AFRICA,"Has the Prime Minister made new arrangements with regard to the sittings of the House this week? Most honourable members have made arrangements to leave for their homes by train on Friday afternoon; but there is a rumour that the Prime Minister proposes that we shall sit on Saturday. Will the right honourable gentleman make a statement to the House, so that we may, if' necessary, alter our' travelling arrangenot ments?",16
16,Mr HUGHES,AFRICA,"I want to give an authoritativedenial to the statement that I am going to sit here on Saturday. Some of my honourable friends may do so. As for me, my fate is settled. I go with my honourable friend, Mr Wise, to Gippsland. We shall be away; but honourable members will be able to get on without me. AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORT.",16
17,Mr LAVELLE,AFRICA,"I ask the Treasurer when will the Auditor-General's report be available to honourable members? - Mr BRUOE - The paper was laid on the table last night, and was ordered to be printed. SUGAR DUTIES.",16
18,Mr RILEY,AFRICA,I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs to say iby how much the price of sugar to the consumer will be increased or decreased in the event of Parliament agreeing to the proposed duty of £14 per ton?,16
19,Mr RODGERS,AFRICA,It is quite unusual to answer questions affecting matters already before the House in another form.,16
20,Mr FENTON,AFRICA,"Assumin g that both Houses of this Parliament agree to the schedule of sugar duties submitted by the Minister for Trade and 'Customs (Mr. Rodgers) last night in this Chamber, will the Minister inform the House, and sugar consumers generally, whether that will involve the immediate decontrol of sugar?",16
21,Mr RODGERS,AFRICA,"I do not, propose to answer hypothetical questions. Honourable members will' have every opportunity to discuss this matter. SOUTH AFRICA. ODUTT ow MAIZE.",16
22,Mr WISE,AFRICA,"I ask the 'Minister for Trade and Customs if he has. any further information to give the House on the subject of communications with South Africa, concerning the duty on maize? Mr Rodgers.:-The honourable member has been a very persistent advocate of a re-arrangement of this matter, not only in this Chamber, but with me privately and on deputations. Unless by the exercise of bad faith on the part of the Commonwealth, the existing arrangement between South Africa and Australia canbe varied except by negotiation. I can, however, promise the honourable member that in the negotiations with the Government of South Africa steps will be taken to effectively protect the maize growers of Australia. INITIATIVE , REFERENDUM, AND RECALL. L»r. MALONEY - I ask the Prime Minister if he ean see his way to bring bef ore the members of his Cabinet a proposal that the acceptance of the policy of the referendum, initiative, and recall shall be. placed before the electors at the coming general election?",16
23,Mr HUGHES,AFRICA,"Whils t I am very willing to meet honourable members in every way possiblej I must say that there is something about the proposal of the recall which is opposed to some of my most settled and earnest principles. I want to tell the honourable member, as man to man, that I am against the recall. I am in favour of as much of the initiative as possible, and shall endeavour to induce my colleagues to see eye to eye with me on that point, but on the question of the recall I feel that they are obdurate. NA PROPERTY.",16

If so, will he consider the question of allowing these Australian-born women to retain their own property,, such as. small amounts in Savings Banks?",16
25,Mr HUGHES,EXPROPRIATION OF ENEMY,"The answers are1. The terms of the Treaty of Peace provide for this being done. 2. In many cases,, after consideration of special circumstances! relief has been given in the way suggested. Property similar to that enumerated has heen released from control. So far as expropriated property in New Guinea is concerned, each case is decided on it3 individual merits, and in every case dealt with the property of rJritish or Australian-horn women married to German nationals has heen released from expropriation. POWER ALCOHOL.",16
26,Dr MALONEY,EXPROPRIATION OF ENEMY,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon noticeWill he inform the House what stage the experiments in power alcohol, &c, have reached ?",17
27,Mr RODGERS,EXPROPRIATION OF ENEMY,"Experiment s conducted by the Couunonwealth analyst, and also by the Institute of Science and Industry, have shown that no practical difficulty exists in using alcohol as a motor fuel. WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY. ISSUE OF REGULATIONS NA (AUSTRALASIA) LIMITED.",17
28,Mr CUNNINGHAM,DIRECTORS OF AMALGAMATED WIIBELESS,"for Mr BRENNAN) asked the Prime Minister, upon notice I.

If not, when, if ever, arc such regulations to be prepared?",17
29,Mr HUGHES,DIRECTORS OF AMALGAMATED WIIBELESS,"The new regulations will be issued in about a week. Yesterday, the honourable member for Maribyrnong asked the following questions:1.

What quantity of wheat and other farm produce has been carried in the said steamers, and the probable value thereof? 3. Will the Commonwealth steamers be used for the conveyance overseas of the next season's crop of wheat and other Australian products? 4. Has the presence of the Commonwealth steamers, acting in competition with the ShipFEES OF ping Combine, beneficially affected the Australian producer? 1 5. If so, can he say, approximately, to what amount?",17

34,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation, upon noticeIs it a fact that married men, incapacitated from following their usual occupation, who, in order to learn their trade, have been attending a repatriation trade class, have 'been in receipt of only 57s. per week, including all pensions?",17
35,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The answer isNo. Allowances are paid as will insure a weekly income as follows:(a) For a married man and wife-60s . per week.

36,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Cowper) [11.19]. -""When we adjourned last night, I was pointing out how impossible it is for the House in the dying hours of the session to settle the basis on which we might provide for the stabilization of the sugar industry. It would be unwise for the House, in the limited time at its disposal, to attempt now to do anything of that nature. All that the industry can expect at the present time is some definite assurance from the House that the traditional White Australia policy of the Commonwealth will be maintained, and that those engaged in the industry will receive a fair deal. It seems to me that the Government's proposal to increase the duty on sugar, ns indicative of that assurance - is of some value; but, as a matter of fact, it can have no CUSTOMS TARIF F (SUGAR DUTIES). Jn Committee of Ways and Means: Debate resumed from 11th October (vide page 3630), on motion by Mr. RODGEBSThat the schedule to the Customs Tariff 1921-1922 be amended as hereunder set out and that on and after the twelfth day of October, One thousand nine hundred and twenty-two, at nine o'clock in the forenoon, Victorian time, duties of Customs be collected in pursuance of the Customs Tariff as so amended : British Intermediate Genera) ' Prefei entlnl Tariff.

Similarlv the adoption of the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), which has snecial reference to the renewal of the Sugar Agreement, which does not expire until 30th June next, can bind neither the Government nor the next Parliament. Seeing that its renewal must beratified by the next Parliament, the definite statement or assurance of an honourable v ember would have just as much weight as would the carrying of the honourable member's amendment in this respect. Nevertheless the renewal of some arrangement is a vital matter upon which honourable members' opinions should be freely expressed at the present time, because the issue will be fought out at the forthcoming elections. That there should be a permanent solution of the sugar problem is absolutely essential. There are many factors in connection with this problem, and the most important of them is the position of the growers. Without the growers tliere would be no sugar industry in Australia. Unless those men who carry on their operations in the tropical parts of Australia, living there through the hot' and wet seasons, are assured of an absolutely fair deal and of conditions that will enable them to see some permanency ahead of them, everything associated with sugar-growing must fal l to the ground. Therefore, Parliament in determining this question must recognise it as a basic fact, that the interests of the grower must be preserved. The other factors in the industry-the payment of casual labour employed in the cane-fields, the profit secured by the millers, and the conditions under which the refiners carry on their operations-ar of secondary importance, as compared to the grower. Prom a national point of view the defence of northern Australia depends upon the continuous settlement of sugar canegrowers, arid that, in turn, depends upon the permanency of the industry. Something more is needed to stabilize the industry beyond an agreement which may have to come up for redetermination in a few years before a hostile people, or Parliament, - when for some reason or other public opinion may be hostile to some particular factor in - the industry. Eor .that reason I have said repeatedly that the making of an agreement, which is subject to renewal every three or five years, will not properly stabilize this industry. The sort of stabilization I wish to see is one that will enable the grower who goes on to scrub land, and does the pioneering work of transforming it from a useless to a productive state, or the man who buys cleared sugar farm land in a sugar growing district, to recognise that he will have an asset with a permanent value. On the other hand, the making of an agreement which simply provides for a renewal in three years under conditions which no one can forecast is the surest way of unstebiiizing the industry, especially if in drawing it up no consideration is paid to the consumers of sugar, who, of course, are more numerous than the producers. The present Agreement was made as between the Commonwealth Government, the Queensland Government, and those actually engaged in growing, milling, and refining sugar, no consideration whatevei being given to other industries for which supplies of sugar are absolutely necessary. I have shown that an agreement such as that which is now in existence is riot sufficient in itself to stabilize the sugar industry. Nor in my opinion will a duty by itself be sufficient. Unless it is associated with internal organization of the industry it will press harshly cn» those other industries of Australia which use sugar in large quantities. For instance, a duty which may be considered necessary to protect the product of sugar cane grown in Queensland from competition from sugar grown in other parts of the world by coloured labour, and pere haps under conditions more favourable to the growth of the cane than are to be obtained in Australia, may easily press very harshly on the f r u it and milk industries. Therefore, it is absolutely i m perative . for 'Parliament to considersome alternative or additional means of dealing with the whole position and assisting in the organization of the sugar industry which, while' enabling a duty to be imposed which will sufficiently protect the growers of Australia from outside competition, will at the same time provide means by which those who are engaged in Australia in the jam and milk industries may be in a position to 'get their requirements at a price a good deal lower than that which they would otherwise be obliged to pay. The Country party'has brought forward a policy which takes into consideration the whole of these conditions.",18
37,Mr MAXTWEJX,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Does the honourable memher seek to protect the Australian sugar-cane growers from all outside competition or simply from unfair competition? Dr EARLE PAGE' - We desire to protect the Australian sugar industry from the competition of sugar grown by coloured labour.  protection from unfair competition.,19
38,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That is so. It is not fair to ask the white workers of Australia to cultivate their sugar-cane farms under conditions that apply in places where coloured labour is availableat a very cheap rate, and where those who work live under conditions that would* not' betolerated in Australia or in any other British community.",19
39,Mr FOLEY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Does the honourable member propose to be consistent in his fiscal policy in that respect? - Dr. EARLE PAGE - I regard the sugar industry as differing from any other. Australian industry. First of all, it is one of the most, important arms of national defence we have, and just as I am. prepared to vote huge sums of money for the. upkeep of the Navy or for the purpose of assisting the Imperial Navy to - conduct. Imperial defence, so am I equally prepared to go further in relation to the sugar industry of Australia than I would in connection with any other industry, - especially as it is associated with the maintenance of our White Australia policy. Furthermore, there is no other - primary industry yet developed in Australia, which' has produced the same - degree of close settlement or. has had associated with it. the same.' growth of township communities. For instance, wherever a mill is. established in a. sugar growing district - it must have associated with it foundries' that are not requisite in. any township in the centre of a dairying district. Relatively, Bundaberg, and Mackay arebigger towns than are any - other towns in the whole of the Commonwealth which are - wholly dependent on agriculture for their support and growth ""The Country party's policy in this respect was formulated at a conference of representatives of the fruit, wheat, dairying, pastoral, sugar and all other primary industries, held at Adelaide a little while agOj and was adopted after a full and free discussion of the. whole of the points at issue. The resolutions carried were as follows: -: The maintenance of a "" White Australia "" 'being .the established policy of the Commonwealth and this association, it is necessary to - maintain a white population in the nortbern .parts of Queensland. This con only be done by the establishment of industry capable of - employing a considerable population'. - sugar industry being established for the purpose of fulfilling the national ideal of a white continent, it is necessary1. That the growers of cone shall ^receive itheir product such a price as will recoup them tortheir cost of production, plus a reasonable margin of profit 2. That the workers in the industry shall re' - cei've a wage commensurate with the class of work paid to white workers in other parts of - Australia. 3. That millers and refiners shall receive as remuneration in the price of sugar such a sum as will insure them a reasonable profit, the payment to have a direct bearing on theeffi- 0 ciency and economic value of their work. v 4. That a Federal tribunal consisting of representatives of ' growers, millers, refiners, workers, and consumers be appointed, to have jurisdiction to enable the above objects, to be put into operation. - Mr MAXWELL - Does the statement of the policy ""of the Country party show where it stands in. regard to the duty that has been imposed?",20
40,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I shall come to that matter: The resolutions also stated'5. That the basis of the price determined shall be subject to alteration from time to the> and that particulars be published for the general information of the public. 6. That the high retail price of sugar at present' being charged is due to the Government's heavy losses on importations of foreign sugars, and is in no way attributable to Queensland sugar producers, who from 1916 to 1920 received less than the world parity for - their sugar.. The losses made on. those imported sugars ore being recouped by the Government from the consumers by ths maintenance of the present retail price.",20
41,Mr FOLEY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That is an admission that the 'Country party had no policy, and that one had. to be f ormulated by these people for them.",20
42,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"We have had a definite policy for the conservation of the industry. We supported the present agreement as the only method whereby, at that time, the industry could be stabilized. Unlike the-honourable member for Kalgoorlie, who, having fixed his mind on one particular proposition, wants to stay there all the time, we have put forward definite proposals, as the result of careful consideration from all points of view, including that of the producers and the consumers* for the successful development of the industry. The next resolution carried at the Conference was to this effect7. That sugar necessary for industries having an export trade shall be available for this trade at a price not exceeding that at which The sugar is available from other countries. Should Australia be unable to supply those industries, either as regards price or quantity, then the importation of a sufficient quantity of sugar to for meet the requirements of those industries shall be allowed.",20
43,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,".But suppose that Australia could supply the quantity necessary, but not at the price. What would you. propose, to do then?",20
44,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"In that case there would be only one thing to do, <- namely, to pool the whole of the sugar, and to give a rebate to the manufacturers.",21
45,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"And then the domestic user would pay a premium to the manufacturer, as he has been doing all through this Agreement.",21
46,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,There does not seem to be very much difference so far as the domestic consumer of jam is concerned in his paying for the sugar contents of the article either on its home manufacturing basis or on its Tariff - basis; he always gets the benefit of the rebate allowed to the manufacturer.,21
47,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,But the domestic user does not get any of the rebate on sugar used for the manufacture of jam. The exporter gets that.,21
48,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"As regards the export manufacturer our attitude is clearly defined. As a primary producing country, we are endeavouring to settle many thousands of returned soldiers on the land, but if we are not going to make provision to enable them to market bheir product at a remunerative price we are not going to get anywhere with our policy of land settlement.",21
49,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,But the domestic user should not he called upon to pay for that policy. If the burden fell on the taxpayer that would' be another matter.,21
50,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"This is what our party has agreed to with regard to that matter8. That in order to assist home fruit-preserving and jam industries, a pooling system be established, to enable such industries to be supplied with sugar at the most favourable prices possible. 9. That to permit of the establishment of such a permanent scheme as outlined above, the system of regulation supervision of the industry be continued for a reasonable period, subject to such modifications as investigation of the condition may prove to be justified without injustice to the sugar producers. recognised that to secure that end the whole industry must be brought under Federal jurisdiction.",21
51,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,That means Government control.,21
52,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,No ; tribunal control.,21
53,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The last resolu-, tion reads10. That the sugar policy of Anstralia should be to preserve Australian markets for internal consumption for Australian-grown white sugar.",21
54,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,How does the honourable member propose to give effect to the proposals of his party?,21
55,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"On e reason why so much "" tosh "" is,talked about this matter is that the conditions in the sugar industry are not understood. I have been fortunate enough to have been chewing sugar cane almost since I could walk, ancl so I ought to know something about the conditions of the industry. The objections that have been raised in regard to our proposals to help the sugar-grower, and the suggestions that propositions such as that which I have just outlined would necessarily mean Government purchases, are quite wide of the truth. In tha Clarence River district, in my own division, for many years under the operation of an ordinary fixed duty the Colonial Sugar Refining Company have been in the habit of making agreements with sugar-growers for three or five years for the purchase of their cane at so much per ton, the grower usually being given an alternative choice, either of accepting a fixed price corresponding to the price of sugar, or perhaps £ 1 or £2 per ton less than the ruling price. If during the currency of the agreement the price varies, he will get a corresponding increase or decrease for his product. That has been the practice in my own district ' for many years, and a large number of growers have availed themselves of it . A similar method for dealing with the whole of the sugar crop of the Commonwealth could be adopted, for, after all, there are only thirty-four sugar mills in Queensland and three in New South Wales, and there are only two big refining companies. One reason why some of these mills have been somewhat inefficient hitherto, as is stated in the report of the Tariff Board, is that up to the signing of the last Sugar Agreement the sugar inindustry had never had a fair deal from It is the Commonwealth Parliament, and as a result there was never enough return on the money invested in the industry to insure the necessary improvements in machinery to perfect methods of treatment. But there has been marked progress in recent years. Several mills in Queensland are spending practically the whole of their profits earned during the past two or three years in .bringing their equipment up to date in order to insure ths utmost' efficiency, capable of competing with the up-to-date mills in Java, Honolulu, Cuba, and other sugar-producing countries. I know the honourable member* for Wide Bay will bear me out when I say that very many of the men now engaged in the industry are up-to-date in every respect, and have had experience in sugar manufacture ' all over the world, and that the experts employed by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are amongst the leading experts in the world, not only in the matter ol handling and refining of the product, but in the management of the entire business. There are two things to be considered in connection with this scheme-the export trade, to which the honourable member for Balaclava has drawn my attention, and home manufacture. We object to the present Agreement, because we do not believe in the Government purchasing of the crop, and consequent risk of loss and bungling which must eventually be borne by the industry. The investigations carried out by a Committee of this Parliariient, and the revelations which have been made in the House, show that in connection with Government purchase there is always the possibility of bungling, waste, and loss.",21
56,Mr COBSEB,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"How , otherwise, would the honourable member control the sales? - Dr EARLE PAGE - The price should be arrived at by a tribunal representative of all the interests concerned, and that body should recommend to the Government what duty should be imposed.",22
57,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Does the member mean that the tribunal should fix the price at every stage ?,22
58,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It would be only necessary to determine the proper price at the raw stage and the refined stage. The tribunal would arrive at a price which would enable the grower to pay reasonable rates of wages, and yet give the consumer reasonably priced sugar. At the present time the industry is controlled from top to bottom by State enactments. There is a Sugar Cane Prices Board in Queensland, which determines the proportionate amounts of the total price paid for raw sugar which the miller, the grower, and the wage earner respectively shall receive.",22
59,Mr COKSEB,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,How would the honor- able member guarantee the miller a certain amount if there were no Government control ?,22
60,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"f-The, tribunal would determine a price sufficient to enable the industry to be carried on at a reasonable profit ; having done that, they should recommend the r>rice to the Government, who should ask Parliament to insure it by imposing an adequate duty. The duty would be the controlling factor of the situation, and would permit prices to be fixed as they are at the present time under the Sugar Cane Prices Act.",22
61,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The honourable member would be content to ascertain the rate of protection by arbitrarily fixing the price to be paid to the producer.,22
62,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I would regard the price fixed by a representative t r i bunal as fairer than one arrived at arbitrarily by prejudice. The tribunal would come to' a determination after hearing the whole facts of the case and lookins; at the question from every 'angle.,22
63,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,That is a serious reflection upon the unbiased report of the Royal Commission.,22
64,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I make no reference to the findings of the Royal Commission. I am not reflecting upon any vote given in this House upon sugar duties. A certain number of members have first-hand and full information, some have very little information, and others base their conclusions entirely upon sentiment.",22
65,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The honourable memhonorable ber's proposal would surrender this Parliament's authority to interested people outside.,22
66,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"When the t r i bunal had decided what duty was necessary to protect the industry and maintain a White Australia, the Parliament could say that the policy of the country was or was not to pay such a large price for the defence of the Commonwealth in the North. The responsibility will be placed upon this Parliament; I do not wish to deprive it of its authority in this matter. But we desire to be able to bring to Parliament a full f u n d of information gathered from all sources, that would enable an absolutely just Tariff provision to be made to insure the carrying on of the industry. . Mr Rodgers - The honourable member suggests that the interested parties should meet together and fix the price of sugar, and that Parliament should fix accordingly. Would the honourable member have the consumers represented tribunal ?",22
67,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It would be representative of the growers, millers, finers, workers, fruit-growers, jam facturers, aud consumers.",23
68,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,What a circus!,23
69,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"At any rate, condition there would be a much better chance arriving at the true price in that way than there is at the present time. The ouly question is whether the people of Australia are prepared to maintain Uhe sugar industry. If they are they must to fix a standard. be prepared to give it such consideration as will enable it to be carried on ciently. Ever since the Commonwealth was inaugurated, the industry has been living from hand to mouth; consequently, nobody had any heart in it, for a time the acreage under cane decreased, and the mills were allowed to get into disrepair, or, at any rate, were not maintained in Prices have fallen considerably. such an efficient and up-to-date conthough dition as they might have . been. travelled through the sugar-producing tricts in 1918, and again this year, the improvement was evident to even the most casual observer. Practically every mill-owner was spending money, some to £150,000, to completely renovate modernize his mill up to the most modern standard of efficiency. Many of the niillfor ow-ners had made no reasonable profits thing more than that is necessary. for years till the agreement of 1920; now they have an opportunity of wards doing so, and, instead of pocketing profit and getting out of the industry, they are re-investing it in improvements. That is a characteristic of primary proagainst duction throughout the world. The probringing fits are not spent extravagantly, nearly always applied to the improvement of the stock or the introduction of more modern plant. If this Parliament does give adequate protection to the Australian sugar-cane growers, it will be quite competent for it to insist that a high stansimultaneously dard of efliciency shall be maintained throughout the whole industry. The proposals of the Country party indicate that the proportion paid to the miller the price fixed for raw sugar should be dependent upon the efficiency of his mill. By that, method a certain amount of conthe duty trol may be exercised. Mr MCWILLIAMS:-TJnfortunately , the on the growers do not owu themills.",23
70,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"There are ten or eleven co-operative mills, and only refive owned by the Colonial Sugar Refinmanuing Company. The others are owned by local residents, whose whole capital is invested in the cane-growing districts. Thus the sugar industry brings about a of decentralization that iis not of achieved by any other industry.",23
71,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,No country in the world has been able to police manufacture ' in the way that the honourable membersuggests. All that-has been done has been,23
72,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"In regard to the duty proposed by the Government, my investigations in the Orient and Java lead me to believe that £9 6s. Sd. per ton will not be sufficient protection to enable Australian suga'r-grOwers to compete satisfactorily with their rivals in the East Allabour costs are not so high as I they were during the war period, yet disthey closely approximate pre-war rates and and conditions in Java. There so much labour is. available that plant canes' are used instead of ratoons. I am going to up support the proposal of the Government and for a duty of £9 6s. 8d. on raw sugar as an indication that it can look to me a. fair deal; but, in my opinion, someI merely, wish to indicate my attitude to the industry, and give it my full the assurance of support.",23
73,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Yarra) [11.51] There is veiry good reason to protest the action of the Government in a measure such as this down at but are the present juncture.,23
74,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,We did not see the Tariff Board's report until last night.,23
75,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The report could not be made available earlier than it was.,23
76,Mr SCTJLLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It was circulated with this proposal, and we are expected to follow the sp'^ech Of the Minister (Mr Rodgers), read the report of the Tariff Board at' the same of time, and then give a decision as to the proper duty to be granted for the im-, provernent of the sugar industry. We should uot allow the measure to go through in a slip-shod manner simply because there is a general - desire to conclude the business by tomorrow night. We have been given no information as to why this particular duty is the one that should be imposed. No opportunity has been afforded for showing whether it is or is not necessary to increase the duty to £ 1 1 6s. 8d. If the question were only that of fixing the necessary protection, we ought to protest most emphatically against the method by which the proposal has been brought down, but it is more than that. The whole of this session the Government have been defending the Sugar Agreement, against which, so far as the growers and millers are concerned, there is not much to be said, although I think some modification of the Agreement is desirable. So far as the Government's administration goes, however, a good deal can be, and has been, said against it . The real issue is not the protection of the sugar industry. It is not a matter of whether the duty should be £ 6 or £ 1 1 . The question before us, although the Minister has not openly said so, is one as to whether we should have Government control in future or not.",23
77,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,That point is i volved.,24
78,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That is the practical question, although it is not expressely stated. There should be a definite policy therefore, announced in regard .to this industry. tax, Everybody agrees that it needs .to be posal stabilized, and yet the 'Government come real down with a proposal, the meaning of which, honourable members have to guess. We have to guess whether it means decontrol, whether it is to be regarded temporary measure, or whether the perno manent policy of - the Government is provide a dirty of this description.",24
79,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I rise to order. - to know if the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) is order. I think I shall be able to show British Hansardthat it is not. This is a Committee of Ways and Means, which is expressly formed for uhe purpose of introducing Committeeproposals of taxation. It has been ruled that no amendment may be moved, on a resolution introducing a taxation proposal, that is of an abstract character, and I submit that this amendment is of such a character. May, in the tenth edition at page 588, dealing with the Committee of Ways and Means, says The established usages of the House, in the form and method of dealing with amendments, and not the practice - in - use in the Committee of Supply (see page 581), is. followed in the Committee of Ways and Means, and every motion for amendment must relate to the matter submitted to its consideration, and i» governed by the rule of relevancy. The resolution is a taxation proposal, and, consequently, any amendment moved thereto must be relevant to taxation.",24
80,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,It must bear the test of relevancy.,24
81,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"On the question of "" relevancy,"" May has a footnote, which saysAmendments formerly offered to substitute for a resolution proposed by the Government, an abstract resolution condemning in argumentative terms either their financial proposals or the imposition of a tax, are not according to existing practice. The footnote mentions a ruling of the 27th A p r i l , 1893, to which I shall refer in a few moments. May goes on to s a y Though it is the function of the Committee of Ways and Means to impose rather than to repeal taxes (see page 556), examples of the repeal of taxation effected in this Committee are to be found upon the Journals. Proposals for the variation or modification of taxation n - can therefore be made in the Committee; but these proposals must be drafted upon the financial scheme submitted by the Government, and must not affect the balance of ways and means voted for the service of the year. Amendment, con be proposed to substitute another of equivalent amount, for .that proposed by the Government, as, for instance, a proto substitute probate and legacy duty on property as an alternative for an inhabited house duty, the necessity of new taxation, to that extent, being already declared on behalf of theCrown. as a What May makes perfectly clear is that amendment in the Committee of Ways to and Means, except an amendment relative to taxation, is permissible. The footnote on page 588 of May refers to a I wish ruling given in the House of Commons on 27th A p r i l , 1893, and that ruling is in shown in the following extract fropi the In these circumstances, he proposed to movt as an amendment to the proposal before the "" Tbat, having regard to the provision of the Government of Ireland Bill, under which the produce of the income tax collected in Ireland is devoted 'to the Irish local purposes, it is inexpedient to provide for increased Imperial charges 'by taxation to which, if the Government' ot Ireland Bill should become law, Ireland will contribute no part, and the whole burden of which would fall on England and Scotland.""",24
82,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I must call the right honourable barouet's attention to the fact that he is proposing to move an abstract resolution, which would be out of order in Committee of Ways and Means; but, as has already been explained to him, it is competent to bim to move to reduce the sum in the ^income tax resolution. Ib is quite clear that the amendment before us is not relevant to the subject ol taxation.",25
83,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Why not? ,25
84,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It has nothing whatever to do with taxation. The motion is for the establishment of a duty-for the levying of a duty on sugar which is imported. It is ataxation proposal as properly understood; there is no question about that. It is quite clear that this amendment has no relevancy whatsoever to taxation, but - is an abstract proposal which, as laid down in May and in the authority to which I have referred, cannot be submitted in Committee of Ways and Means. I submit, therefore, that the amendment is out of order.",25
85,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The Acting Leader of the House (Mr Greene) has shown no reason to justify the point of order he has raised. To me our Standing Orders are quits* clear. Standing order 246 statesResolutions of the Committees of Supply and' Ways and Means reported to the House are read a first and second time, and agreed to; or may be amended, postponed, recommitted, or disagreed to. The motion before the Committee has reference to the imposition of certain taxation. It proposes a duty on imported sugar, and I submit that my amendment, according to that standing order, is perfectly in order. The amendment in no way increases taxation, but it docs provide a way whereby there will be no necessity to impose taxation which may be a heavy burden on the people of the Commonwealth. The amendment simpily states that, in place of imposing this burden hy way of taxation, an agreement should be entered into which would have the' effect of protecting the community, and also those who grow sugar and are otherwise engaged in the industry. Standing order 247 saysNo amendment whereby the charge upon the people will be increased may be made to any such resolution, unless such charge so increased shall not exceed the charge already existing by virtue of any Act of the Parliament. These two standing orders appear to ma quite clear on the point. The amendment does not increase the charge in any shape or form, inasmuch as it removes the necessity for any charge. Conditions would continue practically as today, with the exception that provision is made to enable the Government to renew an agreement which will prove more satisfactory to all concerned, protecting all engaged in the industry and also the general public. I , therefore, fai l to understand why - the Minister took this point of order, and I feel sure, Mr Chanter, that your ruling will be against the honourable gentleman.",25
86,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"A l t h o u g h , I do notintend toi vote for the amendment which has been proposed by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), I submit that it is quite in order. Every quotation read by the Acting Leader of the Houst (Mr Greene) deals entirely with direct taxation, and the object of this motion of the Government ie not a tax. Every word uttered by the Minister, and everj word in the report of the Tariff Board, shows that the object is to protect the sugar industry.",25
87,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,To assist it .,25
88,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The sole object of the motion is to give protection to the industry. Every honourable member who ha.? spoken up to the present has regarded the proposal as one, not for an impost on the people, but for the protection of an industry of Australia; and I take it that honourable members who follow willtake the same view. The amendment merely says, in effect, that the niotion before U3 being one to protest the sugar industry, another method is suggested by which, in the opinion of the mover of the amendment, the industry can be protected in a wider and safer way. W it h out discussing the merits of the question, I submit that the amendment is quite in order; uot only with reference to our own Standing Orders, but also with reference to the procedure of the House of Commons. As I say, every case cited by the Acting Leader has to do with direct taxation- a direct impost levied entirely as a taxing measure, and not intended, as the motion before us is, to afford protection to an industry. . Mr Watt - I tliink that the issue as stated by the Acting Leader (Mr Greene) is quite' clear to you,' Mr Chanter, and the Committee generally. It strikes me, having looked at the references which the Minister quoted, that this is mainly a question of whether this particular procedure can be adopted in Committee of Ways and Means-no t anywhere else, but in a Committee of Ways and Means. The purposes of the Committee of Ways and Means have been set clearly forth by the Minister, and are well k n o w to honourable members, although they sometimes escape our recollection when in Committee. While the procedure adopted by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton) might be quite competent in any other form in which the House sits as a whole, 1 think that the specific purpose for which this particular Committee is constituted and authorized by a full House, is voided if we allow abstract resolutions that are even doubtful of relevancy to impose on questions of taxation. It does not seem to me to make any difference whatever whether the proposition is for a direct or an indirect tax; this clearly is a tax whatever its purpose or whatever its effect may be.",25
89,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,It is a taxation measure.,26
90,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"rl t is a taxation measure, and nothing else.",26
91,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Not for purposes of revenue.,26
92,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I do not know what the purpose or effect will be. The honourable and learned member will see that we can only speculate as to the intention or probable effect of a taxation Bill.,26
93,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,True .,26
94,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"We are too often wrong in our hopes and predictions in that regard. However, technically this is a taxation Bill. I do not think that in a Committee of Ways and Means we can impose abstract or diverting proposals as amendments, proposals which in themselves are not relevant to the taxation motion before the Committee.",26
95,Mr ISCTJLLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I do not think quotations read by the Acting Leader of the House (Mr Greene) have any bearing on the question before the Chair. The Minister's contention is that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) has ""submitted an abstract amendment ta a taxation proposal; but I submit that the [147] 0 amendment embodies a concrete proposal, and one which is relevant.",26
96,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,And similar amendments have been accepted in Committee of Ways and Means on various occasions.,26
97,Mr ISCTJLLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Yea . The Minister referred to the case of an income tax collected in Ireland when an amendment which was quite foreign to the question of taxation was submitted, and which opened up the whole question of policy. The amendment of the Leader of the Opposition embodies an alternative proposal of a protective nature, and is, in my opinion, relevant. I do not wish a ruling to be given which will interfere with the power of a Committee of Ways and Means, and I confess I do not know, at this juncture, whether it would or not; but I intend to contest the point of the Minister that the amendment is not relevant. ' The object of the motion, as the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MoWilliams) said, is to protect the sugar industry, and the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition has been submitted for the same purpose. It is only a question of which is the better method to adopt. We believe that the best w-y to protect the industry is by an agreement, and the Government have suggested protection by imposing duties. I submit that the amendment is not an abstract one, but a concrete proposal, and one which is relevant to the question before the Chair.",26
98,Mr HIOGS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"We have no Standing Orders to guide us in this matter, and the Acting Leader of the House (Mr Greene) has quoted the practice in the House of Commons. Our Standing Orders, of course, provide that where we have no standing orders which apply, the practice of the House of Commons shall be adapted. This seems to be an alternative proposal, and an opportunity might be given of establishing a precedent.",26
99,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,In defiance of the practice of the House of Commons?,26
100,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The motion is quite clear, the and there can be no doubt as to the object of the Leader of the Opposition, who, in framing his amendment, was doubtless assisted by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin). The intention of the amendment is to provide for the socialization of the sugar industry. At present the cane-growers, millers, refiners,. wholesale merchants, and retail grocers are all obtaining a profit .",26
101,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I rise to order. I desire to ask, Mr Chairman, if the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), in speaking to the point of order raised by the Acting Leader of the House (Mr . Greene), is allowed to deal with the opera-tions of the industry to the extent of referring to the profits made by those concerned ?",27
102,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT, The honourable member f o i Capricornia will be in order if he can connect his remarks with the point before or disagreed to. the Chair.,27
103,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I am endeavouring to point. e&tablish that the proposal of of the Opposition is of an entirely different character from, that submitted by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr . Rodgers). The Government propose to protect the industry by imposing a duty of £9 .6s. Sd. per ton on raw sugar, £11 6s. 8d. on refined sugar, and £14 ton on beet sugar. The socialization the industry is,-of course, a plank of Labour party's platform.",27
104,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT, The honourable member is now getfirst ting beyond the question under discussion.,27
105,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I support the honourable member in his contention that this is relevant proposition,' although it is distinct from that of the Minister, is to protect the industry by means duty, a duty which I support. The proChair is:posal of the Leader of the Opposition is to place the production and distribution of sugar under socialistic control.",27
106,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The arguments adduced as to whether the amendment will in crease or interfere in any way with the question of taxation are quite irrelevant to the point. We are in Committee of Ways and Means, and the Minister (M Greene) wishes us to follow a certain course in connection with the protection of statesthe industry. The amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlform ton) provides that another method should be adopted, and it has nothing whatever to do with increasing or decreasing taxafor tion, but merely indicates that a certain course should be followed in of the industry. I cannot see that can be any doubt as to its relevancy.",27
107,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT," The Acting Leader of the House (Mr Greene) has asked for ' m y ruling on several grounds, and particularly on the statement made by him that the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) is not relevant to the motion before the Chair. The Leader of the Opposition has directed my attention to standing order No. 246, which reads: Resolutions of the Committee of Supply and Ways and Means reported. to the House are read a first and second time, and agreed to; or may be amended, postponed, recommitted, There is no difference of opinion on that He also quoted standing order the Leader No. 247, which reads:No amendment whereby the charge upon the people will be increased may be made to any such resolution, unless such charge so increased' shall not exceed the charge already existing; by virtue of any Act of the Parliament. . Both of these standing orders must be per read in conjunction, with others, which of provide that all amendments must be the relevant to the motions proposed; and the standing orders quoted, in my opinion, dorelate to this question at all. O u r standing order provides that where we have no standing order governing the matter under consideration, we shall re-a sort to the practice of the House of Comquite mons. In the short time at my disposal, which I have looked up the tenth and twelfth of a editions of May. The motion before the That the schedule to the Customs Tariff1921-1922 be amended as hereunder set out, and' tmft on and after the twelfth day of October, One thousand nine hundred and twentytwo, at nine o'clock in the forenoon, Victoriant - time, duties of Customs be collected in pursuance of the Customs Tariff as so amended. I ask honourable members to note that the resolution deals with duties of Customs, r . and with nothing else. May, in both of the editions to which I have referred, The established usages of the House, in the and method of dealing with amendments, and not the practice in use in the Committee of Supply (see page 581), is followed in the Committee"" of Ways and Means; and every motion amendment must relate to the matter submitted to its consideration, and is governed by the interests the rule of relevancy. there I have endeavoured to bring my mind' to bear most carefully and impartially upon the question whether the amendment of the honourable member for Hunter is relevant. I can find therein no allusion to the Tariff, or to a rate of duty. The amendment deals with 'an agreement; it states that an agreement should be made, but it does not indicate by whom. Then it proceeds to suggest the imposition of other conditions. I have always given full consideration and libertv to honourable members in Committee of Ways and Means in the matter of their rights to increase rates of duty, and on one occasion, when the subject-matter of review by myself was referred to Mr. Speaker, he endorsed my ruling. I regret that I have not had more time to examine this very important question, but I am bound in the present case by our Standing Orders to refer to the practice of the British House of Commons. That clearly indicates what I have already stated; ancl a footnote to the extract which I have quoted points out that an abstract resolution is not in order since it can have no connection or relevancy with the direct matter before the Chair. It is not the province pf the Chairman to inquire whether the imposition of a rate of duty is for protective or revenue purposes, or for any other purpose. As this amendment does not deal with the question submitted in the resolution, I am reluctantly compelled to give my opinion that it is not in order. Mr Scullin"" - We bow to your Tuling, Mr Chairman, but I am bound to point out that the object of the Minister in raising his point of order was to save the faces of a good many of those who sit behind him. The attitude adopted by the Opposition is precisely that which many Government supporters in this House strenuously argued and advocated only a few weeks ago. One honourable member behind the Treasury bench was so keen in his support of that which the Opposition is now advocating that he actually had himself expelled from a public meeting in this city in order that attention might be drawn to the fact that he was, and is. an outand-out supporter of Government control. Some men adopt very drastic methods of securing publicity; but it is not often that a member-of this House, in pursuance of advertisement, deliberatelv sets - at defiance the chair at a public meeting-especiall y when the chair is occupied by a lady-and has a limb of the law escort him out of the building.",27
108,Mr CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Order ! I ask the honourable member to discuss the matter before the Chair. Mr iSCULLIK- I regret that I may not draw further attention to the wonderful somersaulting of certain honourable members upon the subject of Government control. I am sorry that some members with whom I had found myself in agreement-that is, with their views, but not with their conduct in public places-shoul d now part company with - me. Notwithstanding the ruling of the Chair concerning what may, or may not, be done in Committee of Ways and Means, I submit that the resolution is not a question of taxation, or of raising revenue, or of providing' a new protection for the sugar industry. It is a question of providing an alternative to the existing agreement. .Those members who vote upon the resolution should do so with their eyes open. They must perceive that they are voting for or against the continuation of Government control of the sugar industry. It is the duty of the Government to make that clear. If there is one industry more than any other which requires to be stabilized, it is the sugar industry. If the Government were to announce straight out what they intend, the industry would know where it stood: But the Government will not announce whether or not they stand for the continuance of the agreement. The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) interpreted the intention of the Government-probabl y having a little more inside knowledge than I possess; and I think he interpreted it correctly. I believe that the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) will indicate that he has made a similar interpretation, namely, that the proposed duties are an alternative-indefinitel y stated-to tha renewal of the sugar agreement.",28
109,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Hear , hear! And that should have been admitted.",28
110,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I congratulate the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) on his temporary conversion to the socialization of industry.,28
111,Mr EOLET,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,And to a high Tariff also.,28
112,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Not to a high Tariff, but to a prohibitive Tariff. I stand for a prohibitive Tariff in respect of an industry such as this, which can supply all our needs, and which furnishes the only white-grown sugar in the world. I stand for the prohibition of the importation of the product of black labour; and I am glad to find myself, upon this principle, in agreement with the Leader of the Country party. The fact somewhat compensates me for the loss of the moral support of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), who, on this occassion, has so egregiously deserted his principles. The Leader of the Country party stands for the socialization of the sugar industry.",29
113,Mr CTBSON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I do not think so. Mr Scullin"" - Yes , with the details laid down and perfected, and with all the wheels of the machinery well oiled and greased. He has everything in the machine complete for the socialization of the industry by the Government, with democratic control by those in the industry. In fact, he has torn a leaf out of the book of the Labour objective. I congratulate him on his conversion to that extent. I congratulate him with greater emphasis, because it is only two months since he rose in his place and opposed a motion that I moved to protest against selling the Geelong ""Woollen Mills-that wonderful profit-making concern which, at the bidding of vested interests in this country, is to be sold by the Government. When I looked for support from the Country party and the Leader of that party-fro m those who were interested in the production of wool and other primary products, and who might be expected to advocate that Australian wool should be worked up by our own factories under Government control- I did not receive it. The honourable gentleman opposed the motion, not because he oould see anything against it, not because the factory was not efficiently managed or was not making good profits, but because - hu was against the principle of Government control. In order to prove that Go-envment control was bad, he instanced aome things which he said had happened in connection with the railways. I put the relevant question to him, "" Would you sail the railways?"""" He'replied, ""Yes, I would, if we could sell them on the same basis as that-on which we are disposing of the woollen mills."" - The honourable member, who supports the 'selling of the woollen mills, which are a profit-making concern, and who would sell our railways, now enthusiastically supports the socialization of the sugar industry.",29
114,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Not at all.,29
115,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I am not condemning my honourable friend; I am congratulating him. I have considerable admiration for him personally. I have had it in spite of his very Conservative aud antiSocialistic views. I am delighted to find myself in agreement with him this morning, and his political views on this question make his personal qualities the more endearing to me. I hope it is the beginning of a new era for him. I trust he is beginning to see the light, and that we shall soon have the spectacle of members of the anti-Socialist party, and the de-control party, occupying the gaps left by such people as the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), who has deserteti the policy of control, which he supported at considerable personal selfsacrifice on an important occasion. Honourable members, by their vote on this question, are asked to vote out the agreement, and vote in a Protective duty. Honourable members on the other side of the House say they stand for a duty as against control, because they are opposed to the principle of Government control. They are prepared to advocate a free hand to big interests, irrespective of what the consequences may be. I ask honourable members to recall the position that existed in Australia when we had an effective Tariff to protect the sugar industry and there was no. Government control. I invite the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes), particularly, to throw his mind back to that time, because there is no man in public life today who played a bigger part then in discussing the sugar question, and the control of the industry by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, than he. The Labour party sat on the other side of the House from 1910 to 1913, and during that time there was adequate protection, because £6 per ton then provided as adequate a degree of protection as £9 provides today. Will anybody in the House today say that we then had conditions in the industry which were - desirable ? Honourable members now want to go back to tliose conditions. I invite tbem to refer to the columns of the Melbourne Age, which sent special .representatives . to Queensland to inquire into the conditions in the industry. They said that from the growing of the cane to the last final act of putting the sugar into bags, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company completely controlled the industry from end to end of the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister repeated those statements throughout the Commonwealth, and he advocated an alteration of the Constitution to give this Parliament power to establish nationallyowned sugar companies. There was a big contest at that time between the Melbourne Age and the Prime Minister, who was then Attorney General, as to whether Parliament had the constitutional powers to enable it to do so. The Prime Minister argued that it had not, and the Age contended that it had, but both were in agreement that the industry should be nationalized. In 1915 the first attempt was made by Parliament to overcome the monopoly. A Labour Government was in power in Queensland for the first time, and Labour was in office in this House. An agreement was entered into which provided, for the first time, some effective relief. 1 Arrangements were made under the agreement for something like adequate payment to the men in the-industry, protection was given to the growers against the squeezing operations of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and sugar was provided to the consumers at 3d. per lb. Labour Governments were in power in Queensland and the Commonwealth, and for the first time in the history of Australia the Colonial Sugar Refining Company was effectively controlled. A clear profit of £415,000 was made, but as soon as the split came in the Labour party, and Labour went out of office, almost complete control was handed back to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. The profit of £415,000 waa confiscated from the sugar account and spent by this Government. We know what has happened as a result of control by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. The whole of the condemnation of Government control today is not reailly because of Government control in itself, but because of alleged control by a Government which has really transferred trol to the biggest monopoly Australia. When the Labour . party advocatesagreements and control of the sugar industry, it does not advocate a continuation of existing conditions, but a return to the effective control which the Labour party exercised in 1915 and 1916. In order to give honourable members an idea of the position obtaining in the industry in 1912, I will read a very interesting quotation. The Prime Minister was then Attorney-General, and was one of the Leaders of this House. Hehad no greater critic than the Minister for Defence (Mr Greene), and nobody gave the Minister for Defence nastier turns than did the Prime Minister. I quote from Hansard of the 28th August, 1912, pages 2697-8. The present Minister for Defence made a severe attack upon the late Mr Tudor, whoi was then Minister for Trade and Customs. This is what he said' The Minister for Trade and Customs has, in the most arbitrary way, suddenly taken it upon himself to raise the wages of those employed in that (the sugar) industry from 26s. to 36s. a week and keep. . . . Further, the Minister, by these regulations, has shortened the hours of work from fifty-six to forty-eight per week. I think the regulations have been issued .with an utter disregard of the interests of the industry. . . . The growers in <my district have met and 'have, through me, sent a telegram to him declaring their determination that unless the rates are altered, no more cane shall be planted in New South Wales this year. . . . These regulations have been issued more from the point of view of political bribery than anything else, and with an absolutely callous disregard of the interests concerned. Strange to say, while I do not agree with the castigation that the honourable member thus administered to the late Mr . Tudor, I do agree that there was in . i sense some justification for his protests. Although the regulations issued by the Labour Government at that time provided for what after all was only a miserable pittance, it was an injustice to the growers that they should have to pay 36s. per week and keep to their men in view of the conditions under which they were forced to work by the monopoly. That was the situation with which we were faced. As a Labour Government we had to try to get decent conditions for the workers. And who will say that in 1912 a wage of 36s. per week and keep was too much for men who had to work con- in ' the canefields of .Queensland ? The in present Minister - for Defence (Mr . Greene), as a representative of the sugar growers, was convinced, however, that the payment of such a wage would be ruinous. I believe that, to some extent, it was a hardship on the industry. Our answer to the honourable"" member's complaint was, not that the men should be sweated to make the sugar iudustry possible, but that the vice-like grip of the monoply should .be removed. It was, for -!the first time, by the agreement of 1915, and the industry was given a chance. It Vis, however, the agreement of 1920 with which we have to deal. What has happened under it ? We have had in connection with the sugar control one of the most miserable spectacles that any Government could nresent. We have had, cn the part of this Government, the sorry admission that they have not kept books, or documents relating to the control of the sugar business, and know nothing about it. They had almost to go cap in hand to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to obtain the facts for which we asked. They had not kept any books, but the people with whom they had made the agreement had. A most loose business system was adopted by the Government. I do not say that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company conducts its business in a loose way; as a matter of fact, it is one of the most efficient panies in Australia. It is, indeed, alto- ber? gether too efficient for this Government. During the last two years the company has almost doubled its profits. jumped from £289,565, or a return of 8.90 per. cent, for the twelve months ending March, 1920, to £452,191, or a return of 17.39 per cent, for the twelve months ending March, 1922. The company has just about doubled its percentage of profits since the last agreement entered into, and this is because they have been allowed to do as they please. While the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) was speaking last night, the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Rodgers) interjected that this agreement was ratified by the Queensland Labour - Government. I ask whether he is prepared to repeat that statement today. The agreement, so far as it fixoss the charges to be made by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, has nothing to do with the Queensland Labour Administration. Mr Scullin.",29
116,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It was ratified by the Sugar Council, on which the Australian Workers Union is represented. Mr SOULLIiV- The honourable gentleman is not putting the position fairly. The agreement ratified by the Labour Government of Queensland and the Australian Workers Union fixes the price of £30 6s. 8d. per ton for raw sugar, aud has nothing at all to do with any of the "" perks "" that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company gets out of the sugar control.",31
117,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The whole of the conditions had the approval of the Australian Workers Union.,31
118,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"U p to the point of the production of raw sugar at £30 6s. Sd. per ton, that is so, but the conditions as to the refining, distribution, and other charges, which have enabled the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to double its profits, have not been ratified by the Labour Government of Queensland. Those conditions are covered by a wholly different arrangement.",31
119,Mr GREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Inasmuch as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company in 1915 received the same amount per ton as it received in 1920 and 1921, how did they come to double their profits in the comperiod mentioned by the honourable mem",31
120,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I have quoted figures from the company's balance-sheet showThey ing that they have doubled their profits.,31
121,Mr GREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"But not out of sugar. Mr (SCULLIN - I ask the honourable gentleman to answer his own question. We should like very much to know how the company has been able to make these profits. I have read some of the press was reports of the proceedings before the Public Accounts Committee,, which has been inquiring into the question of sugar control, and I notice that it has been nnable to extract any information from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. I well recollect that the present Prime Minister, when Attorney-General in a him Labour Administration, said that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company would furnish no information to the Royal Commission on Sugar. As Attorney-General he forced the company to the Privy Council with the object of compelling its representative before the Commission to answer certain questions put to him,.but he was unsuccessful. Let me give honourable members ""the following quotation from the report of .the Commission,' which was made in this House some years ago by the' present Prime Minister, who was then Attorney-C-eneral. It relates to the examination of Mr Knox, who was representing the company ibefore the Commission. He was 'askedDid the Colonial Sugar Refining Company contribute £50,000 to support the opposition the proposed law to alter the Constitution lating to monopolies which was submitted to the electors on 26th April? Mr Knox repliedThat is a matter I am not prepared to give information upon. Then he was askedYou did not make the contribution? His reply wasI do not say we did not make the contribution; we did not make that contribution. The right honourable gentleman's comment on this quotation was, "" I will leave it to honourable members to draw their own conclusions."" The Trime Minister read this extract from the evidence of the Commission when he was submitting for the consideration of the House Bills providing for. a second referendum on a proposal to so amend the Constitution as to give this Parliament power to deal with monopolies. What is responsible for the change that has again come over this Government? Only two months ago I referred to the remarkable change that had come over the policy of the Government with regard to the Commonwealth Woollen Mill. A . year ago they proposed to douible the output of the mill, , and the sum of £45,000, to enable its plant to he duplicated, was provided on the Estimates. Later on they came along with a proposal to sell the mill. The power that forced them to do that has forced them to take this action. It is only two months since the Minister for Trade and Customs in this House eloquently defended the Sugar Agreement, and spoke of its success. Apparently the agreement is now to be thrown overboard. It is apparent that the Private - Industries League, or some other power behind the Government today, has decided that all Government control 'of industry must go. The sugar industry is again to be left to the tender mercies of a company which the present Prime Minister some years ago described as "" the most rapacious monopoly Australia has ever, known."" That was his description of the Colonial Sugar Refining 'Company.",31
122,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"And he was quite right, too. Mr Scullin"" - He was. By voting to for this Bill honourable members will wipe re- out the possibility of future agreements for control; they will be voting to return this industry to the position it occupied before the first agreement was signed. The duty then in force was as adequate for the protection of the industry as is that to which we are now asked to agree. Compared with the price in other countries, we were paying, even then, too high a price for our sugar. No one proved that fact more conclusively than did the Prime Minister.",32
123,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Why does the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, want to abandon the control if , as the honourable member says, they have made under it twice as much as they made before? Mr 'CHARLTON - They will make a lot more if this proposal is agreed to.",32
124,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I would answer the honourable member by saying that a monopoly can make as much profit when it is controlled by its friends as it can when there is no control over it , and probably the company could make more money when the importation of sugar was prohibited, and when it could handle the whole of .the requirements of Australia, than it could prior to the-period of control, *when there was some slight competition.",32
125,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"But the honourable member tells us that as the company have "" cracked the whip,"" control is to cease.",32
126,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Yes ; because they fear a change of Government and the prospect of a different class of control. Members are informed that the duty pro* posed amounts to l d . per lb., but it is 'really more. The protection which the Colonial Sugar Refining Company will get is £11 6s. 8d. per ton, whereas the grower will be protected to the extent of only £9 6s. 8d. per ton.",32
127,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"All white sugar re/finers will get the advantage of a protection of £ 1 1 6s. 8d. per ton. ' Mr Scullin - Outsid e the Colonial ""Sugar Refining Company's operations i there is. very littl e sugar refined in Aus'fcralia. There are some mills making m ill whites, but most of the sugar consumed in Australia percolates fro m the Colonial . Sugar Refining Company, and it is they who are getting this extra protection. The Tariff Board recommended a duty of JB9 6S. 8d. per ton all round, but the (Government come to this House and say, in effect, "" While we give the growers a duty of £9 6s. 8d. per ton, we are adding a further £ 2 per ton in order to protect a big monopoly."" How can honourable members be expected to support such a proposition ? Those who vote for the resolution will be voting to hand over the sugar industry to the clutches of the worse monopoly we have yet experienced in Australia. We have been prevented from submitting one amendment, but in order that the matter may be tested, I jnoveiThat all the words after "" That"" be left out, - with a view to inserting the following words in .lieu thereof:- "" the question of imposing a duty on sugar be postponed until the House is tn receipt of the report of the Public Accounts Committee regarding the Sugar Agreement.""",33
128,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Balaclava) [12.53] The procedure adopted by the Government i h bringing down this resolution in Committee of Ways and Means is very unfortunate. The honourable member for Y a r ra (Mr Scullin) has condemned its introduction in the dying hours of the session, and it is perfectly clear that the action of the Government in submitting without notice, within the last day or two of the House' rising for a general election, and at a time when dissolution is not only in the air but is actually prepared for, a proposition as important as this is not fair to Parliament nor to the interests affected. Particularly is this so because it is only a few days since we were discussing, at the invitation of the House, with the Prime Minister and the Government, the business that had to be decided before the House rose, and the Prime Minister himself gave a list of questions that he considered ought to h i .dealt with.",33
129,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I . did not say 'the list I gave would be exclusive of other measures. I said that those I mentioned were all that I knew of at the time.,33
130,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The explanation of the righ t honourable gentleman is not sufficient. As Leader of the House, he must know everything about the business-sheet. But even if he did not know of this matter when he spoke the other day, it is equally unfortunate that we, without being apprised of the intention of the Government, should find ourselves suddenly plunged into the consideration of an important problem, with fresh matter launched for the first time by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Rodgers), who is in charge of this resolution, and should be expected to debate it the moment the Minister sat down. The position is trebly unfortunate, because I understand. that at the present time in this building the Joint Committee of Public Accounts is examining some phases of the sugar problem. How far it has gone in its deliberations we are not informed. How long it will be before we can get the Committee's report, we do not know. Whether it will bear upon the future of the sugar industry, as the M in ister's resolution is designed to do, no ordinary private member is in a position to say. Some of the members of that Committee, who are in the Chamber now, feeling possibly that the question is one that should be dealt with here and not in a Committee room, are the only persons who can tell how far their Committee has gone. I do not accuse the Government of having taken this step with deliberation, but, as a private member who has endeavouredto study this problem,' and has not pronounced flam- boyantly upon it one way or the other, I have found it almost impossible to decide the issues in that calm tempered and reasoned way which their importance demands. The Minister, in submitting his resolution, was unfai r to himself and the Committee in not being more f r a n k as to its purpose. Honourable members, by interjections, have endeavoured to elicit from him an acknowledgement that the adoption of the resolution meant the abandonment of the old agreement system, or that the imposition of a higher duty upon sugar was to be regarded ae a substitution for the polioy hitherto adopted by the Government. But the Minister would not say whether that that was so or not. He lef t himself open. He gave what T regarded, and then said, was an evasive answer, which was not fair treatment of those Queenslanders who are vitally interested in this matter, of the consumers who aire in another way equally interested, or of honourable bers who carry the. responsibility"" ciding the matter here and then going to their constituents.",33
131,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Does not the honourable member think, after all, that ter of some importance to the man who going to plant .cane that he should know where he will stand ?",34
132,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I do, and after the memorable trip of Ministers to Queensnexion land, where months and months ago they collected their impressions on this questo tion, surely Parliament was entitled to expect them to submit their proposals bound to consider. earlier than they have done, soi thab question might be judged calmly and without the terror of an election death before honourable members. Dealing with the question as to whether the carrydustry; ing of this resolution does mean a substiis tution of policy, one phrase in ths report of the Tariff Board, which the Minister submitted for the consideration of the Committee, makes it clear that the Board considers it to be an abandonment of trol and a proposal to protect the try by means of imposing a duty. I the first page of its report the Board' these words!As a means of protecting the sugar industry the Board strongly endorses the granting protective duty in preference to the extension of an agreement. I am. prepared to vote on this question as if the two things were alternative methods of dealing with the one probut blem., and I think that every honourable member, no matter how he votes, must inevitably take that view. Whether be advocates of the southern consumers, ignorant of the wants of the northern producers and millers ox otherwise, it clear that if this resolution be agreed the Queenslander must regard it as an announcement that there will be no furcess, ther agreement, and the consumer will know that henceforth the industry must live on its protective duty, just ""as other industries are bound to do. That is the frame of mind in which I propose to discuss the resolution, and when the opporsugar, tunity is provided later in Committee, shall move certain amendments to the schedule.",34
133,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Later ?,34
134,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Yes ; there may be a good deal done later. The right honourable gentleman cannot say that I have consumed too much of this session's time. memThe only occasions on which I have of despoken this week were when I endeavoured to help his own Treasurer to get a very important Bill through the Committee, and there was no obstruction in it is a matany of my efforts. is. Sitting suspended from. 1 to 2.30 p.m",34
135,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I was endeavouring tn show that the procedure adopted in conwith the introduction of this motion was unfortunate. I am afraid think that - it has also to some extent prejudiced the interests that we all feel To us southerners the this is-a very complicated problem. It is comparatively simple to those who ban been reared in the north, and are famiiia with the cane-growing and milling it. but all we in the south caii.dt to listen to all that can be said, reac what is authoritatively .written, and form the best judgment possible upon that data. I frankly admit that I have never been in the cane-fields of Queensconland, and I am conscious, as all we who induslive in the southern States must h be, of some disability in judging this uses question on the information that is in our hands. However, I wish to consider it not as a political question, but as a of a purely economic one, for it is that, and all subjects dealt with by a Tariff should be so regarded. Having studied the question as best I am able to do, I am opposed to any extension of the Sugar Agreement, I am in favour of increasing the duty. As to the Agreement, I have always we regarded purchase by the Commonwealth and governmental control to the point of consumption as a war expedient. I think is it succeeded in, perhaps, a larger measure to than most people had expected. If one wishes to assess the measure of that suche has to think of what would have been the position of Australia during the war without any arrangement of that kind. . There would have been periods in the middle and later stages of the war .when we would have either been without if we had not grown it in the I Commonwealth, or we would have had to ask the Empire or the shipping interests associated with it to withdraw vessels from important work in the war zone in order to supply us with sugar. Broadly SDeaking, the prices people paid for sugar, the manner in which the scheme was operated, and the result to the consumers during the war period, may be regarded as a complete success. But now that we are returning to normal times-at any rate, the war is past, and we are hoping that its economic aftermath will shortly disappear-Government s in this country should be able, in the near future, to get out of trade. I have made no secret of mv view that in normal times the Government are not justified in embarking on enterprises which are best conducted by private interests, and that, broadly, is why I am ooposed to an extension of the Sugar Agreement. As to the proposed duty, the sugar t industry, like every other industry in Australia, is entitled to protection. This one is, perhaps, specially entitled to it than a great number of other industries, because by its stabilization we increase our holding and the productive power of our sub-tropical regions. We render a White Australia safer by increasing the population in the north, and stimulating the production of crops of this kind, which in most, if not all, other countries are produced by black labour. We are entitled to give the sugar industry a sufficiently high duty to enable it to live and thrive. That is my view as a' Protectionist. We should take into account all the circumstances in which the industry originated, its present stage of development, and the fact that its competition comes from countries where the bulk, if not all, of the operators in the sugar industry are coloured people. But honourable members who come from Queensland, and who advocate either a higher duly or a renewal of the Agreement, will admit that the onus is on every industry to prove that it requires a duty and to demonstrate to the satisfaction of Parliament how high that duty should be. That has been attempted by the sugar interests. But in recent years, judging from public agitation, they have pinned their faith to a renewal of the agreement rather than to an increase of the protective duty. Mr 'COBSEB - The sugar interests throughout. Queensland have asked for duty of £14 per ton. Mr Watt.",34
136,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I am aware of that. Apparently the Tariff Board were intrusted hy the Government with the task of reporting as to whether the duty should be increased, and if so,"" whether the amount should be the £14 for which the sugar interests asked. The Board have Submitted a very interesting report. Their meaning is quite clear, and it seems to me that the report, prepared quickly as it apparently was, is a testimony to the ability of th» men who constitute the Board. But clearly the Board have not had time in which to investigate on the spot the conditions of the industry. They have judged by representations, documents, and figures, and have made, their calculations accordingly.",35
137,Mr BURCHELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,They do not claim that they have been to Queensland.,35
138,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"No , hut I am stressing more that fact lest the report be regarded as the result of an examination on the spot. They apparently realized the disability under which they suffered in that regard, and I think they also realized that a thorough examination of such a problem as this would occupy a long time, which, because of their other multifarious duties, they have not been able to spare. But # even when they did report, they were not explicit enough on one particular point of the problem. That fact is proved by the figures which are included in the motion now before the Committee. The Board recommended a maximum duty of £9 6s. 8d. for cane sugar. The Minister for Trade and Customs has told the Committee that that duty is meant to apply only to raw sugar, and he has brought along another proposition to impose a further £2 of duty on imported mill whites and refined sugar. I see nothing in the report of the Board to justify the Minister's assumption that they did uot mean £9 6s. 8d. to cover all forms of sugar.",35
139,Mr BBESTNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"-On the contrary, they were against a duty of l^d. per l b",35
140,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Yes ; but the Minister has submitted a proposal that is almost equivalent to l^d. per lb. My own impression is that the proposed duty of £9 6s. 8d. is intended to be substituted' for £6 in the existing Tariff schedule, and to apply to a all forms of sugars, because the present schedule does not differentiate between sugar in its different stages of manufacture. In the absence of better information than we have at the present time from the Tariff Board, or any one else, I am not prepared to vote for the duty proposed hy the Minister, on his assumption that the Tariff Board made a mistake. I am prepared, however, to vote for the figures recommended by the Board,' and 1 give notice that, at the proper time, I shall move an amendment to make item 2S r e a d Sugar, the produce of sugar cane, per ton, £9 6s. 8d., British, intermediate, and general. That wording will be clearly in line with the recommendation of the Tariff Board.  able member also amend item 29 ?",35
141,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I am not in a position tn discuss that item. I assume that the Minister will supply the Committee with whatever information is necessary in regard to it. So far he has not explained the items of the schedule seriatim. I am dealing only with the governing item of cane sugar, upon which a duty of £9 6s. 8d. has been recommended by the Board. I am prepared to support that proposal, and to treat it as a substitution for an oxtension of the Agreement, knowing that it cannot operate until the present Agreement expires on the 30th June, 1923.",36
142,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"If the increased duty is not to operate until then, what is the necessity for proposing it now?",36
143,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The explanation given quite frankly by the Minister is that the cane-growers are entitled to some assurance before the expiration of the existing Agreement which will encourage them to plant up their areas and keep the canegrowing industry going. They are being given, at least, seven or eight months' notice of the new duty, and I think that a big industry of this kind is entitled to that consideration. This question is complicated to many of us by the position of the big company in the sugar operations of Australia. I refer to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. It has been attacked most vigorously by honourable members opposite, particularly the honourable members for Darling (Mr Blakeley) and Yarra (Mr Scullin). I am not here to defend the company, and I know little about it, except from what appears in the press and public documents in relation to this matter; but I suggest that there may be another side to the argument advanced by the two honourable members whom I have mentioned. I cannot believe that Australia would ever have had a big sugar industry but for the establishment of some such organization as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. Whether or not it is monopolistic, rapacious, or cruel, it has played its part in building up a great industry, and I am led to believe, by published matter, that in the past, by its advances to growers and the general assistance and stimulus given to the industry, it has contributed to the development of sugar production in a more marked way than honourable members opposite apparently' know of or will admit.",36
144,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Eve n the slave-owner will feed his slaves.,36
145,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I have not heard any suggestion that the cane-growers have been slaves. It may be that the company has received more profit than the grower thinks it should have, but there is no suggestion of servitude.",36
146,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The growers have been serfs in the past, and may be so again if we are not careful.",36
147,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I am not prepared to accept, without proof, the figures showing the enormous increase in the company's profits, amounting to probably more than 17 per cent, per annum on the paid-up capital. It has been pointed out already that as the company does business over a much wider area than Australia, yet brings all its profits into the parent company's balance-sheet, therefore, one might easily be misled as to what profit it is making on its Australian operations. Queensland members who have studied that phase of the sugar problem should explain it to the Committee, in justice to all the interests concerned. If, as some honourable members opposite suggest, by refusing an extension of the present Agreement, and allowing the industry to depend entirely upon a protective duty, we shall place the growers at the mercy of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company,, there is a clear remedy available* It is not the business of the Common-, wealth Government to provide a remedy of the kind, but it is the business, and within the power, of the State Governments, as the Queensland Government has already shown by its attempts at regulation by legislation, to decide and adjust all those relationships.",36
148,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The arm of the States is not so long.,37
149,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The arm of the States may be shorter than that of the Commonwealth, but within its area it is much stronger. In matters of this kind, if it be found that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is inflicting in j u r y on the basic men engaged in the trade, who are growing and harvesting cane, it is the duty of the State authority to apply a remedy. I have now only to deal with another phase, relating to the sugar used in the manufactures for export purposes. The Minister (Mr Rodgers) has, I think, made it clear that it is his desire-w e have had no such announcement as a Government intention--'to see that the manufacturing interests connected with the production of export jam, milk, and so forth , which calls for large quantities of sugar for the purpose, should get, under any arrangement of this kind, the world's parity or its equivalent. ,",37
150,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That has been the practice, and I do not think any Government would refrain from following it . It is the practice in other countries.",37
151,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I do not see how any Government, without great in j u r y to associated industries, could refuse. I think, will give great encouragement to men engaged in these operations, and I hope that whatever is the result-a n agreement or a. duty-the y will get what tha Minister desires. It would be more satisfactory, however, if it ' were announced as the definite intention of the Government, instead of as the desire of one Minister, which conveys less assurance than a declaration of policy by the Government as a whole. This is the point on which the consumer has strong views. We have hitherto given substantial concessions to enable an increased export of those lines, at the expense of the domestic users of sugar. The man who buys his pound of sugar is helping to give his quota of that assistance; and this is the only industry where that sort of thing is clone. I think the Minister should consider the question that, if it is going to cost a substantial sum to give these concessions, the burden should be distributed in another way.",37
152,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,It will be done under a duty system.,37
153,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"And probably by a bounty. However it is done, it is not fair to the domestic user of sugar, as a user, to have tp pay the whole of the amouut. Consumers in the southern States have been excited on the question. Though much of the agitation may have been ill founded, it was largely due to the fact that full information relating to the sugar accounts was not dug up in time to f u r nish, the facts.",37
154,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I think the housewife knew. She was paying 6d. a lb.,37
155,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Peopl e knew what they were paying, but they did not know what it was costing to distribute the sugar to them; in fact, the last and the only authoritative information is in the in terim report of the Public Accounts Committee, which tells us that the price can- 1 not be lower than a certain figure u n t i l 1st November, as the Government propose. However, it is the undoubted duty of this Legislature, led by the Government, to reconcile the interests of the producer and consumer of sugar. If we can do that, and thus keep t h r if t y , prosperous, and efficient a great industry such as this in the northern part of Australia, it is our duty to make the attempt. I shall support the proposal for a duty, but I shall hope to make it what the Tariff Board recommends, namely, l d . per Ib., or This, £ 9 6s. 8d. per ton.",37
156,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Bendigo-Prime M in ister) [2.49] - It is very unfortunate that at this stage of the session a matter so contentious and so provocative of discussion should have been laid on the table. I sympathize with those honourable members who seem to find it so difficult to detach themselves from this seductive, and adhesive subject. I am sorry, indeed, that there is not more time, but I shall try and set an example of brevity in dealing with the position. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) expressed surprise, not that we are doing this, but that we have chosen such a stage of the session at which to do it . He said that if it were a thing . to be well done, it ought to have been done long ago, and that, fortified as some of the Ministers were by their visits to, Queensland, the (Jovernnient should have introduced their policy when there was more time to discuss it . I am sure the honourable gentleman does not really suffer from loss of memory to such an extent as he would have us believe. S e must be able to remember what has taken place in this Parliament during this session; he must remember the time that has been taken up in the consideration of relatively unimportant matters which had, as the best excuse for their introduction, a desire not to benefit the public but to displace the Government. I stated recently that the number of motions of censure proposed was fourteen or fifteen, but I am informed by my staff that there have been no fewer than teen. The honourable member been too long a member of Parliament not to know what these votes of censure mean. I think the Government have done very well, considering all the circumstances, to have advanced so far and to have placed to their credit on the statute-book so much valuable legislation. I have shown one reason' why we have not done what the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) , in his ample leisure, would have had us do, namely, bring down 'at an earlier stage of the session this most important matter. The second point I wish to make is that the appointment of a Tariff Board renders it incumbent on the Government to seek the advice and aet on the recommendations of that Board in all matters relat ing to the Tariff. The Government cannot be expected to utterly ignore the Tariff Board, which has been most busily engaged' since its appointment with matters of vital importance. The Board has, I thinlc, earned the encomiums of the commercial community for the which manner in which it has carried out duties though it has not censure-non e can. The reason business was introduced only night is that it was only on the precountry, vious day that we received the report and recommendations of the Board. That, I think, is an answer to the honourable member for Balaclava. Now I come to the question-Why do we introduce this proposal at all? withstanding that the Board recommends what is being done, why do Ave introduce the matter now? We do so because have no right whatever to leave in suspense those men who have committed their fortunes to this industry. The honourable member for Balaclava referred to a White Australia, and suggested that we ought to attempt to do something to preserve it . Surely we ought to dosomething more than attempt to preserve it . We ought at all hazards to preserve a White Australia, for if a White Australia falls we fall with it . It is not a question of how much we can afford to pay for. a White Australia, for.there is nothing that we must not be prepared to pay for it . That, at all events, is my doctrine, and I shall stand by it , no matter what comes or goes. Those who are in seven-. terested in this industry point out that has they have an Agreement which terminates on 30th June next, and they wish bo know what their position will be after that date. They ask us what are we - going to put in the place of the Agreement - a renewed agreement, a substituted agreement, or a higher duty ? The policy 0 f the Government being to afford adequate protection to the industry, and the time being clearly inadequate to even consider the question of an agreement, if such were thought desirable, there remained only the one thing to do, and we are doing it . We have said to those in the in dustry, "" You shall not be the football of circumstances, the plaything of party,"" for it has been shown dearly that that is what some honourable gentle1 men in this House would make of the sugar industry of Queensland. We desire that those engaged in the sugar i u dustry shall have the same assurance as that which every other industry in Australia receives. We, therefore, undertake to place on the statute-book a duty . will protect the industry if the new its Parliament does not renew the existing escaped agreement or substitute another. In this this we are doing that which common sense, last and our duty to those men, and to the prompt us to do. We believe that land settlement is essential to Australia, and unless the cane-growers know where they stand, they will abandon the industry which is the only industry which has been experimentally proved to be fit for Notthe tropical parts of Australia, What I have said will , I think, clear away all preliminary objections to the we proposals of my honourable colleague. As to the amount of duty we stand by the commendation of the Tariff Board, and we require no other support. satisfied that the recommendation is well grounded. The honourable member says that the Tariff Board has not had suffijects cient time to .thoroughly consider matter. Well, it may be that had greater time been afforded, the Board might made more exhaustive inquiries. There is, however, a simple way in which orable members may satisfy themselves to whether this industry is receiving protection than is granted to other dustries. That is by a comparison present conditions with those existing when the duty of £6 per ton was imposed. . posed. Taking the value of money, when the £6 duty was imposed, at 100 per cent., it is today 66 per cent.; quently £6 today is only equal to about £4 when the duty avas imposed. have by increasing the duty to £9 6s. 8d done very little more than place the industry in the position, relatively, it was in before the fall in the value of finitefactor in the trade. the sovereign. We have had to consider also the increase in the cost of producpetition tion arising from causes other than deflation of currency. Yesterday dressed an argument to this House which failed to move honourable members, though, on a previous occasion, it moved them very strongly. I refer to the argument .that an increase in the parliaa mentary allowance was justified by decrease in the purchasing power of money. There is not an article in comit mon consumption or use but has apprea ciated in value and, of course, in price, as a result of .the depreciation of money. The Government are giving a guarantee of 3s. 8d. per bushel on the next season's wheat, thus advancing a higher price wheat has brought over a period of twenty years; and so we might run the gamut of all the industries. Prices.genecomment. rally have advanced. Everything costs more to produce. A higher Tariff has - been imposed upon all other commodities open to foreign competition. In the case of sugar alone nothing has been done meet the altered conditions. The amount of the duty is satisfactory-it an amount at which any one can cavil It will enable sugar to be sold underi most adverse circumstances at 4^d. per lb. If you say that is too much to Mr Hughes. refor a White Australia, let us ""clear ther in g "" for action, so that we may know We are where we stand. I now come to another point raised by the honourable member for Balaclava. He obto a distinction being raised be1 the tween the one rate of £9 6s. 8d. upon raws and of £11 6s. 8d. upon whites amd have refined. The Leader of the Opposition, and other members opposite, affected to honregard these proposed duties as a sop to as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. more The one honourable member who has dein-' fended the company has not urged that of view-point as a reason why he desires that the rates of duty should not be imHe is concerned, apparently, with the effect of differential duties on differ-, ent classes of sugar upon the consumer. conseRoughly, the proportion of sugars imported before the Agreement was 75 per We cent, of raws, and 25 per cent, of whites. - Eor all practical purposes, refined sugars sugar are not imported, and they never have that been; Java whites, however, are a deThe canegrower is concerned mainly with the comof imported raw sugar. By far the the greatest quantity of imported sugar I adcomes in as raw. Imported whites compete with our own mill whites, and also,, of course, with the sugar refined from had Australian raws. In otber countries a distinction is made between the two, and. higher duty imposed on whites than on the raws. The Government is resolutely determined in protecting the sugar industry; believes that this cannot be done unless higher duty is imposed upon whites. Honourable members are not directing their attention, as I thought they would, to the very serious gap which exists bethan tween the duty oin cane raw sugar at £9 6s. 8d. and on beet sugar at £14 a ton. The latter imposition passes without I do not understand the attitude of honourable members. I could appreciate the fact of their holding fast to one flat rate of duty, as a protection against the importation of all kinds of to sugar; but I cannot understand what may be behind the distinction drawn between is not beet sugar, protected up to £14 per ton. - whic h rate they accept without comthe ment-and Java whites and refined, protected to the extent of £11 6s. 8d. The pay latter duty they profess inability to swallow. But £14 on beet sugar meets - with their hearty approval. The Government have considered the whole matter very carefully; and those concerned in all phases of the industry have done the .same. The duties proposed are the result of the views of the growers and others submitted to the Government. The sugar industry has as much right of consideration as any other. Certain persons interested in the fruit-growing industry approached my colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Rodgers) and myself, and drew an obvious distinction between soft fruits, berries, and other kinds of fruits. They advocated one kind of treatment in respect of one - class of f r u it , and another method for - the remainder. And the Government, - conceded their desire; we took the view that they knew their business beet. We have advanced to the fruit-growers a very great sum of the taxpayers' money. At this moment we are guaranteeing wheat growers to an extent which will certainly be not less than £20,000,000. Ye t nobody raises his hand in protest or criti-cism. All industries have a righ t to be - treated fairly. Because Queensland is a. long way off, men whose idea of Australia is confined to a vista of Collins-street, with occasional jaunts to the seaside in 'this semi-arctic climate, affect to regard ithe sugar-cane area as a foreign country. And they talk about a spoon-fed industry. More onerous labour is performed in Queensland in one day by a man who «cuts cane than is done in a week by a man working in this climate. Honourable members opposite have sought to make this lesolution a party matter, and 'to secure capital out of it . They - desire the Committee to range itself into two camps-no t into opposing sides, the - one being for and the other against the imposition of these rates of duty; but into two camps, the one side favouring the duties and the other declaring for the Agreement. I shall not say now what is the policy of the Government in regard to this matter; but, whatever may be its policy, the proposal to impose these rates of duty stands on its own merits. Whether there is an agreement or not, the people of Queensland have an absolute right to the protection afforded by these rates of duty. I am astounded by the complacency with which honourable members opposite rtalk about the Agreement and declare themselves now to be its champions, in view of the fact that, only the other day, they could scarcely find sufficiently scathing epithets with which to bespatter it. The honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) went along, with the honourable member for Y a r r a (Mr Scullin), to Mrs Glencross' meeting, and he ranked himself as one of her chief supporters; The two honourable gentlemen attended as advocates of cheap sugar. If there are any men in Australia who can be called the champions of black-grown sugar they are those two honourable members. They held for t h about the high price of sugar, and they demanded cheap sugar. But when-as on the following day-the y received a strong reminder that the Australian Workers Union was not dead, they said, "" We are in favour of the Agreement/' They favour what they are told to favour; but this Agreement owes nothing to them, either in its conception, its provisions, or its acceptance. The Agreement was forced down .their throats, and they had to swallow it with an appearance of good grace, despite a ll the efforts they had made to defeat it . They would have opposed it at every stage; but they were confronted by an agreement which-despit e what the honourable member for Yarra has said-wa s signed by representatives of the Australian Workers Union. There, at the conference, where every penny of the sum of £30 6s. 8d. per ton was allocated, were the representatives of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and of the Australian Workers Union. These ancient foemen sat side Iby side and signed the Agreement. They saw where every penny of (the £30 6is. 8d. was being allotted. They were witnesses each to the other getting his _ sham The Australian Workers Union agreed to every penny which it was determined the Colonial Sugar Refining Company should have; and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company agreed to every penny which it was decided that the Australian Workers Union should get. What humbug, what sickening hypocrisy it is, for honourable members opposite now to raise this bogy of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company! I draw the attention of honourable members opposite to the report of the Royal Commission on ithe sugar in dustry, which made its investigations i a 1912. One of the Commissioners was the friend of honourable members opposite, namely, the Hon. Albert Hinchcliffe, M.L.C. What did he and his fellow Commissioners state? They were against the nationalization of the industry. said that such proiits as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company made on its refiningare made under existing conditions-condi tions which give to its plant a value in excess of earning capacity under the altered conditions which would be involved in nationalization. In the general result, we cannot avoid the conclusion that the Commonwealth Treasury would be involved in a heavy financial loss, unless it were prepared to make higher demands ou the consumers than is necessary under a system of private-owned industry subject to appropriate regulation. Further, the Commissioners statedThe suggestion has been made that, since refiners are in a position to control prices in the sugar industry generally the Commonwealth might enter into competition with existing concerns, with * view to keeping down the price of refined sugar, while raising the price of raw sugar. W.e cannot recommend the adoption ot this suggestion. The suggestion is probably due to an exaggeration of refining profits, i'lie profits of the Colonial Sugar iielining Company are largely due to items other than refining. This company, as the honourable member for Yarra admitted, is an admirably managed business. I have run at i l t against it many a time, as I would agaiust anybody who got in my road. But, when I find my friends, Messrs. J . W. Dunstan, W. J . Riordan, and M . Harland, for the Australian Workers Union, sitting cheek by jowl with Mr . Knox, for the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, shall I stand aside, haughty and aloof, and not be prepared to shake the preferred hand ? Not at all ! Let brotherly love continue! What we have to decide is not the question of Agreement verms Duty , but whether the industry shall be any longer the football of party politics. Those engaged in .the industry have a right to be told where they stand. They are not going to be left in the position, at the next election, of having to vote for this party or for that, or perish. The in dustry ought to stand on its own bottom; and that represents the policy of the Government. We intend to give the in dustry these duties. I desire to deal with one other point. These rates of duty cannot operate, as has ilr. Hughes. been pointed out, until after the 30th June, 1923. ' Nor. can they come into effect, as a matter of fact, u n t i l long after that date, because the coming crop will have first to be consumed. One cannot say They what will happen as a result of the election; but it is certain that the new Parliament wil l have ample time to deal with the situation. I say to those who are concerned about other industries, such as the f r u it , and jam, and preserving industries, that the Government are as much concerned-and have shown their concern in very substantial ways-as are the people actually engaged therein. The f r u it growers have never come to the Government for aid and gone away emptyhanded. They are, at this moment, dependent upon the Government so completely that if we were to withdraw our support, their industry would be thrown into a condition of chaos. But we are not likely to go back on it . And , although the sugar duties will not come into material effect until several months after the end of next June, I say that the jam-making and various preserving in dustries may rely on receiving the same kind of treatment as they got under the old system, before the days of Government control and ever since. Let me put the position plainly: where there is a shortage of Australian sugar, and there are importations from abroad, they will get their supplies, naturally, at the world's price-les s the duty, which will be returned as a rebate. Where tliere is a sufficiency of Australian sugar, so making importations unnecessary, the Consolidated Revenue must make up to the jam manufacturers any handicap which may be imposed upon them by these duties. That applies to all goods with sugar contents that are manufactured for export. Manufacturers of such goods will be in no worse position than they are under the present arrangement. They will bo in exactly the same position with regard to imported sugar that they occupied before the Government control. I propose now to refer briefly to some statements made this morning by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin). Posing, in one of his lightning transformations, aa one of its friends, the honourable member spoke of the virtues of theSugar Agreement as opposed to the duties that we now invite the Committee to i m pose. Neither the honourable member nor his friends are entitled to any credit in this matter. For the first time in its history, there is peace, tranquility, and prosperity in the Australian sugar industry. That is due entirely to the Agreement, in the malting of which honourable members opposite had no hand. In spirit they were opposed to it . If they did not smite it hip and thigh, it was not because they would not, but that they dare not. f ar as they dared oppose the Agreement, they did. They have hit it under the f i rib at every convenient opportunity. They have lurked in dark corners to strike it a mortal blow"", yet they now claim credit for the Agreement. Absolutely no credit is due to them. They say that under a Labour Government in 1915 the Colonial Sugar Refining Company for the first time received a rude rebuff. If it did, I was the man who administered the rebuff. No credit is due to my honourable friends opposite for the Agreement then made. They knew nothing about it . They did not conduct the negotiations, nor did they determine - the terms that should be fixed. They had nothing whatever to do with the matter. I simply told them what was to be done, ancl they said "" Yes."" They know perfectly well that that is so. Honourable members opposite' have talked also about the amendments of the Constitution which were proposed by the Labour party. They were not responsible for even a comma in the proposed amendments. 1 framed them; I wrote the arguments in support of them. What did they know about the matter? Nothing. Let us look for a moment at the Agreepresent ment made in 1915, which, according to honourable members opposite, contains many excellent provisions, and by means of which, they say, a rude rebuff was ministered to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. M v answer to that statement is that the conditions imposed by the 1915 Agreement are imposed also in the Agreeof ment made in 1920. Under the Agreement of 1920, organized Labour for the first time had a hand in determining the conditions of the industry. The grower, the millers, the representatives the Commonwealth and Queensland State Governments, approved the Agreement which we had made beforehand the Australian Workers Union. I am not conditions. sure whether it was Mr Theodore or M Gillies who joined with me in making the arrangement; but the position of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company under the 1920 Agreement is. the same as it was under the Agreement of 1915. It is true that under the 1920 Agreement the Colonial Sugar Refining Company charged more, but it charged only the actual cost of coal and labour. As the price of coal and other things f all , its charges f all . So Under the Agreement of 1920 it was paid the same fixed amount for refining as f t h under the Agreement of 1915, which provided thatWhen the sugar referred to in clauses 3 and 4 has been refined and sold, the company shall account to the Government for the money received for the sugar nnd syrup produced therefrom after charging the cost of the raw sugar at cost and the expenses for bags, freight, &c, at not exceeding 26s. per ton of raw sugar, the cost of refining 30s. per ton, and the expenses of sale 7s. per ton-in all not exceeding £3 3s. per ton, together with a charge of 20s. per ton of raw sugar as representing depreciation and interest on plant and stocks and the payment for the services of the company in connection with the refining of the sugar. [.Extension of time granted.""] That condition is' repeated in the subsequent Agreements. In 1921 the company received 22s. 6d., instead of 20s., per ton on all raw sugar on account of in terest on plant, & c , but that has since been reduced to 20s. per ton, so that the company is getting under the 1920 Agreement exactly what it received under the 1915 Agreement. It is said that under the Agreement made in 1915 the Government controlled the sugar business, but that under the Agreement the Colonial Sugar Refining Company controls it . There is not so a word of truth in that statement. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company, under adthe Agreement made with the Labour Administration in 1915 controlled the sugar business, just as it does at the present time. I was the Minister in charge the sugar control, and I did exactly the same in each case. I know too much to pretend to know more than I do. In connection with all three Agreements I canesimply took Mr Knox's advice with of respect to sugar. If we made a profit of £415.000 under the 1915 Agreement, it was due to the fact that we had not at with that time to deal with abnormal market We have done exceedingly r . well right through the currency of' these Agreements, and the fact that we made a loss which had to be made up by paying a higher price for sugar has nothing to do with the sugar control. That loss was due to chaotic conditions in the world's markets, which no one could foretell. It had, nothing to do with the Agreement. If an agreement had not been entered into, the same position would have arisen. I shall not detain the Committee longer. We are asking the Committee to agree to the imposition of this duty in order to give an assurance to the industry. Those engaged in it want to know at once that they will be protected, no matter what may be the constitution of the new Parliament. They want to be no man's slave; they desire to have a perfectly free hand in the coming election, and not to be a mere football of the political arena.",37
157,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Hunter ) [ 3 . 2 6 ] should not have risen but for the speech just delivered by the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes). Those who heard it will not wonder that the newspapers and the public generally declare that Australia is governed by one man. The r i g h t honourable gentleman, if he succeeded in proving anything at all, said sufficient to convince the general public that, with him, it is a case of "" A l o n e I did it . "" He says, ''The Labour party had nothing to do with the Sugar Agreement. I arranged it in 1915, when I was a member of a Labour Administration, and the members of the party had meekly to follow."" No one knows better than does the Prime Minister himself that all such matters had to be submitted to a meeting of the party, and had to be decided by a majority of the party. Evidently the right honourable gentleman has overlooked that fact. His new-found friends probably obey his every behest; whatever he submits to the House has to be accepted by them without challenge. That, however, was not the position when he was a member qf the Labour party.",43
158,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The Agreement went before the meeting of the party, it is true, and the party said ""Yes.""",43
159,Mr OHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Of course it said "" Yes,"" because it embodied a part of the policy of the great Labour movement. Are we not asking today for a renewal of the Agreement on f a ir terms to the producer, the worker in the industry, and the consumer, because we believe in Government control as opposed .to a monopoly like that of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company? I well remember the time when the Prime Minister used to freely denounce monopolies. He used to tell us, a few years ago, that all monopolies should be under State control, and he has just taken to himself credit for having brought the sugar monopoly under control. Why, then, this change of attitude on his part? Why does he desire now to do away with the control of the in dustry ? Why is he net prepared to stand behind the Agreement? The Labour party is ready to assist the Government to make an agreement on terms satisfactory to all parties concerned. That being so, I fail to understand why the Prime Minister is not prepared to. act. Is it because sitting behind him are the representatives of. vested interests who say that there shall be no further State - I control of the sugar or any other in dustry ? If the right honourable gentleman followed his own desires in this matter, I ventureto say he would still adhere to control by the Commonwealth. It is quite true, as he has said, that the Agreement has enabled employment to be found for white labour in the sugar industry in Queensland. That is one of the objects we had in view in making the original Agreement of 1915. The imposition; of these duties, however, will not guarantee to the producers of cane sugar that they will be protected as tihey are under the existing Agreement. I have a quotation of £ 1 9 3s. per ton for Java sugar, so that even with a duty of £ 1 1 . per ton that sugar could be brought here for £30 3s. per ton. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company, if it so desires, will be able, despite these increased duties, to import sugar at a cost of £ 5 or £ 6 per ton less than the growers are getting for their sugar under the existing Agreement. I invite the representatives of Queensland to consider for a moment the position in whioh they are proposing to place the sugar-cane growers of that State. The Prime Minister has Said that our demand for the State control of the industry is due merely to a desire to catch votes. As a matter of fact, our object is to protect the people engaged' in this industry in the tropical parts of Queensland. '",43
160,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member said that Java sugar, quoted at £ 1 9 3s. per ton, could be landed here, after payment of this duty of £ 1 1 per ton, for £ 5 per ton less than that received by the growers. How does he arrive at the calculation? The price paid under the agreement is £30 6s. 8d. per ton.",43
161,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,That is for raw sugar.,44
162,Mr GREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,There is no refined sugar in Java.,44
163,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The duty of £11 per torn is on raw sugar ?,44
164,Mr GREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,No .,44
165,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"We have been led into all this difficulty because the Go* vernment could supply Parliament with no information as to why sugar should cost the consumers 6d. per lb. Two years ago, when my predecessor, the late Honourable Prank Tudor, Leader of the Labour party, submitted a motion in this House, the Prime Minister gave him to understand that the price of sugar could be reduced within six months, but subsequently the Government had to import heavily, and the consumers were still obliged to pay a high price for this commodity. During the present session, when the matter was ventilated in this Chamber, we still could get no information-w e were simply told that the price of sugar would be 5d. per lb. in November-and , being dissatisfied, we directed the Public Accounts Committee to inquire into the question. Yet, without waiting for that Committee's report, and when this Parliament is at the point of death, the Government have come down with a proposal to place higher duties on sugar, the effoct of which, in the absence of an Agreement, will be to place the growers absolutely in the hands of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. The duties will afford no protection to the man who grows the cane. In the absence of an Agreement, he will be obliged to take whatever price the Colonial .Sugar Refining Company choose to give him for his product. (What will become of the fine ideals to which the Prime Minister has just given utterance in talking about the necessity for protecting the sugar industry? That fine class of people he said he found when travelling through the sugar districts will be thrown to the wall. The growers will have nb guarantee that they can pjant their next year's crop with success. Instead of imposing these increased duties, we should be seeking to renew the Sugar Agreement, which alone will give to the planters a guarantee that success will follow the planting of their crop. The Government's proposal leads us nowhere; it is simply a sop put forward for the purpose of getting votes at the coming election. Communications have come to hand from Queensland planters pointing out that an Agreement alone will serve the best interests of their industry, and that the im^ positiou of increased duties will not do so. Why should we impose duties which will prove unsatisfactory to every one but the Colonial Sugar Refining Company? At any rate why should we not await the report of the Public Accounts Committee so that we may not be voting in the dark? Honourable members would be in a better position to decide the matter if they had that report before them.",44
166,Mr COBSEB,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,But the growers would not be in a better position.,44
167,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Many growers differ from the honourable member. They would rather have a renewal of the Agreement. 'Mi. COBSEB -'And so would I if - we could get it.,44
168,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member is now supporting what T am saying/ As a matter of fact, every one knows that a renewal of the Agreement is essential, and that is why we are fighting for it . The proposal which the Government have put forward is not supported except by those who are closely in touch with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. We declare our opposition to the Government's proposal, not because we do not want to afford protection to the sugar industry, but because we believe that the only way to save Australia, and keep it white, Ts by having an Agreement in regard to sugar, and because we know that outside influences which favour the decontrol of industries are compelling the Government to take up their present attitude.",44
169,Mr COBSEB,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,It will be better for the sugar-cane growers to have these duties than to have nothing.,44
170,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member's statement is tantamount to an admission that there is not a majority of honourable members on his side of the House to support him in securing a renewal of the present Agreement, and that the majority opposite favour de-control. There is no escape from the facts. The only reason for the proposed increased duties is the fact that the Government may be in a position to tell the people of Queensland at the forthcoming election that they have endeavoured to do something even in the dying hours of Parliament to protect the sugar industry.",44
171,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Something must be done. ' Mr Charlton"" - The - honourable member is prepared to vote for these duties, although he admits that the Government have not adopted the right course, or, at any rate, that their proposals do not go far enough, and that there are lurking in them many dangers to the people he represents, inasmuch as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company will be able to make larger profits at the expense of both the people who' grow cane and the people who consume sugar. All the Prime Minister's rhetoric to which we have listened, and all his talk about what happened in the Labour party count for nothing. It is our duty to study what has led up to the present position of the sugar industry, and see what is best to be done to preserve it.. Every ""one interested in Queensland affairs recognises that there must be an Agreement in force to enable the man who grows the cane to know how much per' ton he will get for it, and to let the workers know what wages they will receive. The imposition of increased duties wi]l benefit no one but a 'big ""octopus."" Unfortunately, my amendment, which would have committed this Parliament to a renewal of the present Sugar Agreement, has been ruled out of order; but we shall watch the result of the voting upon the Government's proposals, because it is very evident that a majoi'ity of honourable members do not regard the imposition of increased duties as a satisfactory way of dealing with the question, and yet are not prepared to vote against them, because . they want to be able to say to the people of Queensland, """"We did something to save the industry for Australia by imposing increased duties."" .",45
172,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"""We cannot have any Agreement until we first get the Queensland Government to exercise control.",45
173,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I am not concerned as to what any State Government does. My sole concern is as to what is done in this Parliament. The responsibility is cast on every honourable member in this Chamber to do all he can in the interests of his country. . As the Minister for Defence has questioned my figures, let me point out that the price of Australiau refined sugar is. £37 16s. 8'd. per ton, made up as follows:-At the mill, £30 6s. 8d.; freight, &c, £3 3s.; refining charges, £4 7s. On the other hand, Java sugar can be landed here and refined at a cost of £32 8s. 8d., made up as follows:-Pric e in Java, £17 10s.; freight, £1 5s.; duty, £9 6s. 8d.; refining charges, £4 7s. Therefore, I was absolutely correct when I said that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company could land sugar from Java and sell it at a' lower price than that at which Australian sugar could be placed upon the market.",45
174,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The honourable member's figures are not correct. It does not cost anything like £3 3s. per ton to bring sugar down from Queensland.,45
175,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Whether my figures are correct or not, it is not a question of Customs duties. There ought to he an Agreement, so that the people who are growing the sugar-cane and those who are employed in the industry may have their interests safeguarded, and so that' the consumers may get sugar ae cheaply as possible. The increased duties will not help to do this. They will simply leave all concerned in the hands of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. I remember the circumstances under which the first Agreement was made. What the Prime Minister was saying this afternoon in reference to this matter does not go down with those men who knew all about the position at the time. The Agreement was drawn up in ocder to fix the price to be paid to the sugar-cane growers who were not getting sufficient from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to enable them to pay a living wage to the workers employed in' the fields. The company was bleeding the cane-growers white, although the consumers of Australia were paying more than a fair price for the sugar, at the time. This will be the position of affairs again if there is no Agreement. If the cane-growers have no fixed price for their cane, and they find themselves entirely in theghands of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, will there be any desire on their part to grow cane? We are so earnest in endeavouring to get the Sugar Agreement renewed in a modipolicy. fied form because we believe it will i ustice to all concerned, and because are aware of the cry which has been raised by the people who support the party opposite that there shall be no vernment control of any industry. If Government were assured of a majority favour of control of industries, these duties would not have been submitted day. It is because the Government realise that they cannot get sufficient support a continuance of the policy of control they come down with proposals which are only a subterfuge, lead nowhere, and afford no protection to the growers.",45
176,Mr MCWILLIAM S,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Franklin) [3.44]. - W it h other honourable members. I enter a most emphatic protest against the way in which we have been called upon to deal with this matter. The whole world over the position of sugar has occupied' the minds of leading statesmen. On another occasion I gave a list of International Conferences which had been held to deal with the subject, the last of which was presided over by Mr Chamberlain. I have not been able to study the report of the Tariff Board closely, but fro m my observations of it I find that the Board has given the question very close and minute attention. I have previously complimented the Minister for Trade and Customs on possessing in the T a r i ff Board the ablest body of men to be found on any Board in the Commonwealth. They must have studied this question for weeks and weeks, but the Minister only distributed their report on sugar when he was submitting his proposals yesterday, and those who are keenly interested in the question were asked to come to an immediate decision. I cannot compliment the Prime Minister- (Mr . Hughes) on the speech he has just delivered. It turned the - whole subject into a burlesque. He asked whether the man in Queensland who is growing sugar should not know where he stood; but I defy such a man to gather from the remarks of the Prime Minister any oertainty as to his position; or to learn where the Government stand in this matter. Are the duties to be a substitute for the Agreement? It is an insult to the House for the Government, on the eve of an election, to say, "" We will not tell you our We will wait until after the do election."" There are men behind the we Prime Minister who were not made at all happy by hearing his speech. During his campaign for votes in Queensland the Goright honourable gentleman described me the as the arch enemy of the sugar-grower, in a statement far which there is only one word in the British language, and that tois a word of three letters. The enemy to whom I have been opposed all through, for and the curse of the sugar-growing in that dustry, as the honourable mam ber for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) once ably described it in this House, is the Colonial sugar-cane Sugar Befining Company. Mr GREENE;-The honourable member does not know what he is talking about.",46
177,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I refer the M in ister to his Leader's speeches condemning the Colonial Sugar Refining Company as the' enemy of the industry. If there is any misconception about that company, those at the head of it are to bflame, because whenever a Royal Commission or a Committee has '- inquired into its profits and their source, the company's officials have absolutely refused to disclose any in formation. I believe in the principle of a White Australia. No one who has read the history of racial complexities and knows what i has happened in the United States of America as a consequence of the introduction of coloured labour there, would bequeath such an inheritance of difficulty and danger «to his descendants in Australia. It is because I am a believer in a White Australia^ and because I think that the sugar-cane industry is the chief means of keeping population in northern Queensland, that I support it , or, rather, that is one of 'my reasons for supporting it . I think, too, that the Australian nation, believing in a White Australia, should be prepared to pay to keep the country white. I accept the recommendation of the Tariff Board of a duty of £ 9 6s. 8d. per ton on sugar; but I wish to point out how the fruit-growing in dustry can b.e saved without doing in j u r y to the sugar-cane grower. For the ten years ending with 1920 the average production of sugar in Australia fell short of the demand by over 60,000 tons per annum. If the f r u it growing industry is to be saved, the policy adopted towards it during the past three or four years must be altered. The balance-sheets of three of the largestpreserving companies in Australia, published this year show a very bad state of affairs. A Sydney company has been compelled to write down its capital by one-half, the Victorian Producers Union shows a very heavy loss, and another company is in process of liquidation. I believe that when the balance-sheets of all our preserving companies have been published, it will be seen that their loss has been nearer £2,000,000 than £1,000,000. Because of the high price of sugar, the companies have been compelled to send to Great Britain large quantities of pulp which would otherwise have been converted into jam or preserved.",46
178,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The preserving companies give smaill prices for f r u it .,47
179,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That is not so. Under an agreement with the Government, the maximum price paid has been 3d.; and 5d. or 6d. was paid last year for berry f r u it from one end of Australiai to another. Had not the Government assisted the industry with a guarantee of £20,000, to enable pulping operations to be undertaken, three-fourths of the berry f r u it of Tasmania, during the last two years, would have rotted on the ground.",47
180,Mr HECTOK LAMOND,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,-What proportion of berry f r u it to other f r u it in Tasmania?,47
181,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"B e r r y f r u it and apricots make up almost the whole of the preserving and canning"" f r u it . I do not think that any Queensland representative desires to embarrass the f r u it growing and preserving industries, nor do I think that any fruit-grower wishes to injure the cane-growing industry. I represent by far the greatest fruit-growing district in Australia., and on its behalf I am> prepared to vote for a duty of l d . per l b . on sugar, provided that the Government will make an arrangement which, while benefiting the fruit-growers, will not in j u r e the cane-growers, though it will reduce the revenue from the sugar duty. In respect of the numbers affected, the f r u it industry is enormously bigger than the sugaf industry. Between 1910 and 1920, the acreage of orchards in creased from 178,798 acres to 271,894 acres, and the value of their production from £2,441,795 to £5,809,045 . During the same period the area under vines increased from 58,151 acres to 73,326 acres, and the value of their production fro m about £1,000,000 to just over £3,000,000. The combined area of orchards and vines increased from 236,949 acres to 345,220 acres, and the value of the production from £3,496,187 to £8,870,262. The production of jams and conserves last year was barely one-fifth of that of previous years. Unless something is done for the fruit-grower his industry will be ruined. There are 152 preserving factories in Australia., employing 6,974 hands, to whom were paid wages amounting to £371,473. The value of the raw materials worked up is £3,757,611, and the value of the output £5,487,960, the value added in processing being about £1,750,000. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Lair d Smith) knows that in these factories a large number of persons have satisfactory and profitable employment. If this industry is thrown out of gear, not only will the man on the land be crippled, but in the States where the manufacturing factories are operating, thousands of people will be thrown out of employment. I am certain the Committee does not realise the serious position of the fruit-growing and preserving industries today. While the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has nearly is the doubled its profits in recent years, the balance-sheets of manufacturers of jams and preserves show enormous losses.",47
182,Mr COKSEK,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Does that remark apply to Henry Jones and Company? Mr M o WILLIAMS - H is losses this year will be very great. I say. deliberately that, the people of Tasmania wish to help the cane-growers. I wish to see the sugar-growing industry maintained, and I am prepared to assist it , but the Australian people as a whole should pay for a national policy with which we all agree; it should not be made a tax upon one class of the community. I shall move an amendment to that effect at a later stage. I accept the recommendation of the Tariff Board, one of the ablest bodies of men I have met in any part of Australia, and whose report shows evidence of considerable research. But I plead with the Committee that, while assisting the sugar industry, we should not crucify the fruit-grower, whose i m portance in Tasmania is equal to that of his brother working in the cane-fields of the north. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Eodgers) said that the proposed duty was not for the purpose of raising revenue, and that it was in tended only to protect the cane-grower. To that policy I give my whole-hearted support, but make the duty a burden upon the whole nation. A duty of l d . per lb. is equivalent to a bonus of about £275,000 per annum. The people of Australia are prepared to pay that amount for the maintenance of a White Australia policy. The people whom I represent in the south of Tasmania are ready to contribute their share of the cost of a White Australia, but they aud their industry should not he sacrificed. Both the Minister for Trade and Customs and the Prime Minister have said a good deal about the rebate in respect of sugar used in exported commodities, but that rebate is not of very great i m portance, because 80 per cent, of our manufactured goods are consumed in Australia, and to them the rebate does not apply. I wish to help the canegrower and the other interests in the sugar industry, because regards Queensland as one of its best - customers. Only recently a direct shipping service from the island to Queensland was established.",47
183,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That was because this Parliament imposed an embargo on carbide. Mr M o WILLIAMS - The establishment of the shipping, service had nothing ,to do with the embargo on carbide.",48
184,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Without it that line of .ships could not have been established.,48
185,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I assure the Minister that that statement is not correct; the line was brought into existence by those interested in the fruit-growing - industry. We welcome this direct service. There are some products of -.Queensland which the Tasmanian people want, and they produce other articles for which there is a market in Queensland. I am sure that the Queensland members welcome the establishment of a direct line of steamers between the most southerly and ithe most northerly States. The export of apples has not helped the Tasmanian fruit-growers much this year. Some men will get a small return for their year's labour, and some of them :none at all. An expert has told me that he does not think 'that the profits upon apples exported to England this year will average more than about 2s. a case; others estimate that the return will be much lower. I ask honourable members to consider carefully the serious position of the small-fruits industry in Tasmania and ""Victoria, and I say in all sincerity that the fruit-growers are prepared to assist the cane-growers to get a duty of £ 9 6s. 8d. per to n ; but they ask that their industry be not crushed out of existence. 'Duringthe last ten years the average importation of sugar has shown a deficiency of over 60,000 tons; of that amount the f r u it preserving industry would not consume more than two-thirds. Let the manufacturers have their sugar duty free, and thus, while putting one industry on a sound basis, help to build up another. If the Government impose a duty of l d . per lb. on sugar it will mean a tax of over £ 1 1 per acre per annum on the currantgrower, over £ 1 2 per acre per annum on the raspberry-grower, and nearly £ 4 0 per annum per acre on the apricot-grower. Tasmania I am sure that that is an injustice which this Committee will not tolerate. These facta need only be pointed out for the Committee to see the justice-of the claim I am making. If the W h it e Australia policy is to be maintained, let the whole of the Australian people pay the cost. The fruit-growing industry in Tasmania and those other industries associated with it are of even greater importance to that State than is the cane-growing industry to Queensland. In helping one industry, do not crucify another.",48
186,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Capricornia) [4.10] - As a Queenslander and one of a deputation of Nationalist members who waited upon N the Prime Minister on several occasions to urge the imposition of a duty of £14 - per ton, and the extension of the Commonwealth Agreement for a period of five years. I consideri t . my duty to say a few words. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) has spoken in favour of thecontinuation of the present Sugar Agreement. Why are we not able to secure thab? Because the honourable member sent two members of the Labour party to a public meeting, of protest in. theAssembly H all , Melbourne,, to? inflame the public mind against the renewalof thei Agreement.",48
187,Mr CHAHLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,That is absolutely untrue.  untrue!,49
188,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I refer honourable members to the report that was published in the Melbourne Age. The Leader of the Opposition cannot deny that he sent to Mrs. Glencross a letter stating that the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) and the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) would represent the Labour party at the public meeting.,49
189,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,But they did not go there for the purpose of saying that there should be no Agreement.,49
190,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member for Yarra "" let the cat out of the b a g "" today; his colleague, the honourable mem to keep in the background the fact that the Labour party aims at the socialization of industry. He wishes to persuade the farmers of Hume that the party with which he is associated is still the old Labour party, whereas, in fact, it is a new Labour party that is bent upon socializing the farming industry. The Leader of the Opposition sent two delegates from the Labour party to the meeting of protest. Why?",49
191,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"To see that whilst the producers and workers got a fair deal the public were not fleeced under any new agreement. They went, to the meeting to deal with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company.",49
192,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The motion proposed at that meeting by the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) wasThat this meeting of citizens protests the continued high price of sugar, and declares its uncompromising opposition to the renewal of any agreement necessitating Government control The honourable member for Batman and the honourable member for Yarra spoke to that motion.",49
193,Mr FRANCIS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Were not two motions moved at that meeting?,49
194,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I will complete the motion I had commenced to read- and supports the Housewives Association in the campaign initiated by tbem in reference thereto. It further records its opinion that Government politcal control of trade and industry is pernicious and detrimental to producers, manufacturers, and consumers alike. There is no doubt about the meaning of that motion, and two members representing the Labour party spoke to it . They were either deceiving themselves or they were deceiving the Melbourne Trades Union Congress of June, 1920. The meeting at which they spoke was a meeting of protest, called in order to influence members of the Federal Parliament against the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement, as I am sure the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) will admit. That charming lady, Mrs Glencross, sent the following letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) : At a largely attended meeting of citizens held in the Asseznbly Hall. Collins-street, and organized by our association, the following resolution was passed with great enthusiasm with only three dissentients-tw o of whom were Mr Higgs, M.H.R., of Queensland, and Mr. Walker, of that State, and one other stranger who was interrupting all the evening. Then Mrs Glencross sets out the resolution to which I have referred. We were referred to by Mrs Glencross as "" strangers,"" although we Queenslanders are expected to help Victorians in ab-. taining protection for their boots, hats, jams, and so for t h. When we put in an appearance at that meeting, in order to represent the Queensland view, we were, as I say, described as "" strangers,"" and I , who insisted on saying a word on behalf of our northern State, was forcibly ejected by the police. The honourable member for - Balaclava (Mr . Watt) told us today that we ought to discuss the question of sugar in "" peacer f u l calm."" I may inform that honourable member that the Victorians who are against the Sugar Agreement do not disagainst cuss the question in "" peaceful calm,"" and any one who ventures to speak on behalf of the Agreement is forcibly removed from their gatherings.",49
195,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Would it not be as well to come to the proposal before the Chair?,49
196,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member who interjects will forgive me if I in sist on pointing out the inconsistencyindeed, the hypocrisy-of the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) and others who profess to be in favour of the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement. Neither of the . two delegates from the Labour party at that meeting voted against the motion proposed. There are people who say that the old Labour party was very different from the new Labour party; and that is a fact. Is thera any member of the - old Labour party who would have gone to such a meeting of protest, and sat on the same platform with those opposed to the continuation of the Sugar Agreement? The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) admits that he went to that meeting with a view to socializing the sugar industry, and to taking away from the growers the profit they make by their harvests.",49
197,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,That is not correct.,50
198,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It is correct. I have here the Labour party's platform, one plank of which is the socialization of industries, production, distribution and exchange, and another the establishment of an elective economic council by all nationalized industries. The honourable member for Yarra was present at that All - A ustralia Conference, representing all the trade unions in Australia, held at Melbourne from the 20th to the 25th June, 1921. I think there were 150 delegates or thereabouts from all parts of Australia, and of these the honourable member for Yarra was one.",50
199,Mr MAKIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Where was that Conference held ?,50
200,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"At the Melbourne Trades H all . The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) is very innocent, and would have made an excellent member of the old Labour party. He is quite out of sympathy with the ideals of the Extremist party i u its advocacy of "" direct action,"" "" go slow,"" and so forth . I am sure the member has no sympathy whatever with the "" Tammany"" I find that Mr E . J . Holloway, the president of the Trades Council, said in his address that if they were going to make the next decade of the transition period from capitalism to socialism a success, . it was necessary that all sections should come together. The Conference to which I refer was held with a view to bringing together all the revolutionaries and cranks who were attacking the old Labour party. The honourable member for Yarra, in speaking on that occasion of the socialization of industries, said that the industries, "" when socialized, would establish an elective, supreme, economic council."" That council, said the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin). is the body which is to take the place of Parliament, and I am explaining the position in this regard because the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) has denied a statement to that effect. I propose now to say a few words to Victorians as represented here by thf. honourable member for Fawkner (Mr . Maxwell). The Queensland (representatives in both the Senate and this Chamber have met the Victorian manufacturers liberally on every occasion, and have given the highest protective duties desired. The honourable member for Fawkner will pardon me when I say that it is , the agitation in Victoria that prevents those interested in Queensland from getting the Sugar Agreement. If the honourable member were allowed to pay attention to our representations we might be able to obtain the justice we ask, but those concerned in the agitation follow him around his electorate in their endeavours to prevent this great Queensland industry being tieated in the way that Queensland has always been willing to treat Victorian in dustries.  some of us do net believe in the socialization of industries ?",50
201,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That may be; and possibly members are opposed to the socialization of industries because of the long list of socialistic failures in Queensland and elsewhere in the world. I appeal to Victorians on behalf of the cane-growers of Queensland, who are so uncertain of the future. honourable Mr MAKIN - Do the growers desire the Agreement ? methods. Mr HIGGS - Yes , but for fear we may not get an extension of the Agreement Hall we are asking .for an import duty. Victorians ought to look beyond the borders of their own State, and be .prepared to grant this northern industry a duty of £ 1 1 6s. 8d. The honourable member for Balaclava favours a duty of I d . , or £ 9 6s. 8d., but I notice that he does not refer to the duty at £14 per ton given to the beet-sugar industry. The cultivation of sugar-beet in Victoria has lieen going on for twenty years or more, but the honourable member does not propose to reduce the duty to £ 9 6s. 8d. Am, I to assume that he does not care to take such a step in the case of a Victorian industry ? I remind honourable members that if Queensland had stood out of the Federal compact at the beginning, 'thea:e would, probably, have been no Commonwealth for years. Queensland, however, joined, and the result was that her manufacturing industries suffered severely. The jam-makers of Brisbane were practically wiped out, and the boot and shoe industry seriously interfered with by Victorian competition.  manufacturing industry.",50
202,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That is so, but we have made a little progress since. I can only say that as soon as Parliament goes into recess we representatives of Queensland will appeal to the general public for a continuance of the Agreement. That is not because the Agreement has a socialistic character, for, indeed, it has not, even the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) would admit. The Fedeadded ral Government employees under the Agreement consisted of Colonel Olderwould shaw and a few clerks.",51
203,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I do not think there were even a few clerks, but only a typiste.",51
204,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"And the production distribution of the sugar is carried the workers, cane-growers, millers, finers, and by the wholesalers and the what is going on in retailers in their separate spheres arrangement has nothing in it of the colour of Socialism, or of the socializament tion of industry, which the honourable memher for Yarra is so anxious to im pose. Honourable members opposite are quite willin g to impose £28 per ton upon jam, and in respect of various fruits, for example, prunes, between £40 and £45 per ton. The question has been asked, why does sugar the Government bring forward this matter now? The reason is that the following Queensland Nationalist members of Parliament have had several interviews with the Prime Minister and members of the Government in regard to the extension of the agreement, and the necessity for taking immediate action to afford Queensland sugar industry the same sure of protection that has been given to Agreement for five years; other Australian primary industries: Senator T. W. Crawford. Senator H. S. Poll. Senator the Hon. T. WGivens., Senator Sir Thomas Glasgow. Senator Matthew Beid. The Hon. P. W. Bamford, member for Herbert. C. G. Bayley, Esq., member for Oxley. Colonel D. C. Cameron, member bane. L E. B. C. Corser, Esq.. member for Wide - Bay. The Hon. W. G. Higgs, member for Capricornia. G. H . Mackay, Esq., member for Lilley. The Prime Minister agreed to take action, and I am very glad that he has now done so. He did not think he could get the House to agree to £14 per ton, and proposes £11 6s. 8d. H is action has been quite in accord with the friendly attitude he has adopted towards the sugar in dustry since the inception of Federation.",51
205,Mr MAKIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,But it does not accord with the wishes of the cane-growers.,51
206,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member as for Wide Bay (Mr Corser.), who knows the new district which has now been to my division of Capricornia, will agree with me that the cane-growers be very sorry if this session were to end either without the Agreement being extended for five years, or-in its absence-the imposition of higher rates and of Customs duty. The Federal Labour on hy party, which is opposing the duty, redoes not keep itself acquainted with Queensland. - The Those honourable members opposite who spoke in opposition to the Sugar Agree-, at the public meeting in this city, do not seem to be aware that the Leader of their party in Queensland, the Premier, Mr Theodore, has telegraphed to Senator Crawford as follows: Failing the continuance of the Sugar Agreement, the sugar industry will be faced with a serious situation if the Federal Parliament rises without taking action to increase the duty.",51
207,Mr MAKIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Why does not the honourable member try as hard to secure the renewal of the Agreement as he is trying to secure the imposition of these duties ?,51
208,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"At the risk of my liberty and life I endeavoured to persuade Victhe torians in favour of the' Agreement. I meaam still urging the extension of the but I trust that honourable members will at least agree to the imposition of the rate of duty amounting to £11 6s. 8d. per ton, especially in view of the fact that Queensland members have always voted for the highest possible duties by way of protection to Victorian primary and for Brissecondary industries.  [4.35] - In judging the honourable mem-' ber for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), ono .should really be, at the same time, mercif u l ; for he has cut a very sorry figure day. He has grossly misrepresented the whole position. The honourable member has been forced into taking up an entirely different attitude from that which he occupied until only a few weeks ago. By his speech today he has exposed himself to the severest criticism on account of his change of front, when one would have expected him, rather, to take cover. Throughout the greater part of his speech the honourable member avoided dealing with the real, facts of the case. He pursued those tactics, because he knew that his position was so untenable that it could not be defended. He referred to the two members of this party who attended the meeting under the auspices of the Housewives Association. He said that the honourable members for Batman (Mr Brennan) and Yarra (Mr Scullin) went there for the purpose of opposing the Agreement. He knows that that is not correct",51
209,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Then , why were they there?  orable member may be pardoned for not knowing, because-owin g to his bad conduct-h e remained at the meeting for so short a time that he was unable to hear their speeches. However, the remarks of the two Labour members were reported in the press, and the honourable member for Capricornia must know that they spoke in support of the Agreement. The honourable member for Yarra-bein g the spokesman for this party-put the position in our behalf just exactly as he has done today. At Mrs Glencross' meeting, the honourable member for Capricornia was in agreement with the honourable member for Yarra. To-day, however, he finds that he must obey the dictation of his new masters, and he has gone back upon his former attitude. One wonders that he was not too much ashamed to open his mouth in this House, and it is only natural that he should have endeavoured to avoid the real subject. He has said, in effect, that because he cannot get the substance he must accept the shadow. He prefers the substance, namely, the Agreement; but he can only secure the shadow, which is the imposition of these duties. He condemned the to honourable members for Kooyong (Sir Eobert Best) and Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) because of the stand which they took at the meeting ; yet, at this moment, he sits cheek by jowl with them behind the Government, in support of the resolution. The honourable member stands, today, shoulder to shoulder with the lady who had him thrown out of that meeting. His position is an extraordinary one. The wonder is that he does not hide his head for shame. He is now the mouthpiece of the Colonial Sugar Befining Company. His present Leader, the Prime Minister, said, this afternoon, "" I am endeavouring to put this industry in the very same position as it was in before the first Agreement."" I emphasize those words; there is an ocean of meaning behind them. I need go no further than to quote earlier words of the Prime Minister himself in demonstrating the position of the sugar industry when it was in the hands of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company before the first Agreement. It was that company which was responsible for the deplorable condition of the industry. I hold in my hand a statement of the case for the Constitution referenda as produced by the then spokesman for the Labour party, the present Prime Minister. Of course, the Prime Minister ""has been saying, "" Alone I did it !"" He has said that we, on this side, had nothing to do with the preparation of the referenda arguments-"" I did it ; they simply looked on."" As a matter of fact, when the Prime Minister was with the Labour party he did nothing that the Labour party had not dictated and did not stand for. And, when he-did things which the party did not approve of, it sent him about his business. To-day, he is at the head of a party in which he is truly an autocrat. (When he holds up his little finger, it is welcomed with gusts of laughter. To-day, he rules according to his own sweet will. In his case for the referendum proposal dealing with trusts and monopolies, the right honourable gentleman first dealt with what a monopoly was, and, having tried to define it, he gave a list' of those concerns which, lie said, came under the head of monopolies in Australia. It will - be illuminating first to read - what he considered the effect of a monopoly to be. He saidWe all know that the cost of living has increased so that it is with the utmost difficulty that the bulk of the community are able, even with the greatest economy, to make both ends meet. The right honourable gentleman then proceeded to point out that such a state of affairs was due to the activities of certain monopolies, among which he said the Colonial Sugar Refining Company was one of the worse. This is what he had to say of the sugar industry when it was in the hands of that company, prior to' the making of the first AgreementWe know, for example, there is a sugar monopoly; that this controls the sale and manufacture of sugar from one end of Australia to the other; that it fixes the price the cane-grower gets for his cane, the price the Australian public pays for its sugar. And not only this, but as sugar is one of the main ingredients of jam, and the main ingredient in confectionery and lollies, it follows that this monopoly not only fixes the price which the cane-grower gets for his cane, and the consumer pays for sugar, but very largely the price paid for jam and lollies. This monopoly levies toll upon every man, woman, and child in Australia. And all have to pay. There is no alternative. The right honourable gentleman tells us today that he desires to place the sugar industry in the position that it occupied before the first Agreement was made. H is attitude has changed since he made the statement which I have just quoted. He has now to obey the behests of such in stitutions as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company-the company that £50,000 into the funds that keep him and his associates in power. He has to play up to such monopolies in order that his party may secure financial assistance. H is position is very like that of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), who said this afternoon, "" As I cannot get the substance I shall have to be content with the shadow.""",52

211,Mr MAHONY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"- How much Colonial Sugar Refining Company contributing to the Nationalist party's campaign f u n d today?  things have happened since the Prime Minister made the statement. I have quoted regarding the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. The money that has passed in doles of £25,000 and so an explains the change in the attitude of the right honourable gentleman and the honourable member for Capricomia. The honourable member for Capricornia has now to right-about turn . He occupies in this Chamber today a position entirely different from that which he took up a few weeks ago. It is not long since he was ejected from a meeting of housewives in this city because he tried to secure the very thing for which we 3tand today. We give him an opportunity now to take up the same attitude, and we do not threaten him with the treatment that he received on that occasion. We stand today where we stood in 1915. We stand for the making of a fair Agree-ment that will protect the interests of the grower and the worker in the industry, and do justice to all . The honourable member for Capricornia knows that if the Committee turns down the Agreement and accepts the proposed duties-""ac cepts the shadow for the substance,"" as he termed it-n o one in the industry will know where he stands. It is suggested in the press and elsewhere that the Labour party are pledged to the present Agreement. We say that we stand for an Agreement that will be fair to every one connected with the in paid dustry, and do all-round justice. If , in stead of waiting for the report of the Public Accounts Committee, which I understand will contain information of much value, we blindly accept the Government's proposal to impose these duties, we shall have no assurance that the Australian sugar-cane grower will be protected from the competition of sugar grown abroad by black labour. I fail to see that the proposed duties will give in - a protection substantial enough to save the Australian sugar industry from the competition of black-grown sugar fro m abroad. Thus not only is the honourable member for Capricornia, together with those associated with him , guilty of is the standing against the Agreement, but if he and his party vote for the duties proposed by the Government they will do so knowing that there is no assurance that the Australian sugar-producer will be protected from the competition of the blackgrown article. That is the indictment that we make against the honourable member and others who propose to take this Step in the dark. I felt that I ought not to allow the statements made by the honourable member for Capricornia to go unchallenged, and the observations I have made serve to show the extraordinary position which he and other honourable members opposite occupy today.",53
212,Mr ROBERT COOK,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Indi) [4.53] - It seems to me that the question at issue is of such momentous importance that it should bo discussed in a more amicable 2,520. way than it has been, and that our object should be to secure, if not all-round £576,302. justice, at least a compromise on the best possible lines. I made it my duty during £348,549. the last recess to travel over part of Queensland, and so to make myself familiar with the position of the canegrower, the miller, and every one associated with the sugar industry. There £1,730,349. can be no doubt that the sugar industry is a great one. We have spent millions pounds on the defence of Australia, and shall have to do so again:, and it seems to me that those who have so far addressed themselves to this motion have not given the consideration to the question of effect which the settlement of Queensareas. land by means of the extension of the sugar industry will have on the protection of the country from a national as well an industrial stand-point. I have thought it my duty to obtain first-hand informament. tion as to the extent of the industry. The latest report on the subject shows that there are 200,000 acres under sugar jane, that the capital represented today in land. land and improvements amounts to £6,500,000, that the value of mills and machinery is £6,000,000, and the value of refineries £3,500,000, or a of £16,000,000. Then, again, there are, approximately, 22,000 men employed in the industry, and 4,500 cane farms; while the average annual yield is, apwill proximately, 250,000 tons, of the approxiobject mate value of £10,000,000. The industry supports upwards of 100,000 people. is as yet in its infancy. There are in Queensland manv hundreds of thousands of acres equally as suitable for sugar-cane production as the land already so cultivated. We should, therefore, do everything possible to encourage and support the extension of so important an iudustry. Whilst we should give careful consideration to the sugar-cane growers of Queensland, we have also to consider the great fruit-growing industry in the south. The following return dealing with the position of jam and preserving factories in Australia in 3 920 will give some idea of rhe magnitude of the fruit-growing industry of Australia:Jam and Preserving Factories. Number of factories, 152. Number of employees, 6,974.

In Yictoria we have spent about £12,000,000 on irrigation, and the country so dealt the with consists largely of fruit-growing Quite a number of returned soldiers have been settled on fruit-growing lands in this State, and their future deas pends largely on the decision of the Parliament in regard to the Sugar Agree",54

I realise that the sugar industry of Queensland must have some protection. I am sorry that the report of the Public Accounts Committee is not available, but import parity. as it has not been presented, and as honourable members seem determined to bring down our orchards and this matter to a finality, we must f all back upon the only information on subject available, and that is contained in the finding of the Tariff Board.

219,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Wide Bay) [ 5 . 5 ] - I reprogret that upon such an important matter in conas this so much time has been spent by honourable members in making attacks on different parties and individuals in this I House. The sugar-cane growing industry tottering in the balance as to whether it can be carried on successfully or noti I . ask honourable members to recollect the attacks which were launched not many weeks ago at the Sugar Agreement and the administration thereof. Many charges were made which, I am eure, will be disproved when the report of the Public Accounts Committee is presented, but, at the time, there was no disposition shown to renew it . And now honourable members ask why steps should not be taken to do so. How could the House deal with such an important matter when a Committee is reviewing the'Government's administration of the present Agreement, upon which such terrifio reflections were cast? In any case, many steps must be taken before another Agreement could he drawn up. First of all, the Queensland Government must be induced to pass the necessary legislation to enable them to acquire the whole of the sugar-cane crop in Queensland for some years. having been done, all parties concerned in growing cane, the planters and the workers, those who mill the raw cane and those who refine the raw sugar, must be brought together and asked to come to some basis of agreement - And when all this is done, the Agreement, as drawn up between the Commonwealth Government, the State' Government, and all parties concerned,, must come before this Parliament - for ratification. It is absolutely certain that this task could not be undertaken this session. Mr MCWILLIAMS ' - But it was known, years ago, when the Agreement would cease.",55
220,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Yes , but what we did not know years ago was that the Country party and the Opposition would attack the Sugar Agreement as it has been attacked in this House. Until the charges made have been cleared up by the presentation of the report of the Public Accounts Committee_, which is now sitting, it will be impossible to enter into any fresh Agreement, or submit it to this Parliament with a chance of having it ratified.",56
221,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The Opposition did attack the Agreement; it merely attacked the Administration .,56
222,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The whole thing was attacked, and is now under consideration by the Public Accounts Committee, and until it is finalized by that Committee's report it would not be right to ask this Parliament on the eve of an election to r at if y an extension of the Agreement which has been open to so much attack. In the meantime, people with common sense will recognisethat those who are engaged in the sugar industry must have some guarantee that when they proceed to spend large sums of money in breaking up fresh ground, or in fertilizing ground already broken up, so as to insure crops for the next five years, they will stand a reasonable chance of getting their money back. They can have this guarantee, either by protective duty, or by an Agreement, or by both. Although I do not believe in the socialization of any Australian industry, except in carrying out a policy of building and running railways, or of running post offices and such like concerns, I regard the drawing up of an Agreement in connection with the acquisition and sale of That sugar as essential, because it concerns a commodity produced in all other parts of the world, from cane, by. black labour, and refined by black labour. It is necessary to treat the sugar industry in a different way from all other industries. In any case, the Commonwealth Government have simply undertaken the task of seeing that the terms of the Sugar Agreement were carried out. They have sought to make no - profit. They have undertaken to see that the labourer's wages were so much, that the price paid to the cane grower was so much, that the raw sugar miller was paid so much, and that the refining companies were paid so much. The companies were obliged to keep books, which were open to the inspection of the omcers of the Commonwealth ' Auditor General. The books had to be kept correctly, so that the Commonwealth Government auditors could trace the cost of tvery individual operation, and see that the refiners were not getting more than (hey were entitled to charge for the work they performed. The sole profit derived by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company came out of the managing charge of £L per ton, which was previously £ 1 7s. per ton. Much has been said by way of not attack upon the Agreement, because it was really attacking, the Agreement to attack the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and its administration during ihe period of control. Honourable members have pointed out that the company have doubled their profits,' the insinuation being that, the increased profits have been due to the Agreement. But such .is not the case. The Colonial Sugar fining Company have very large estates in Fiji, where all their sugar is produced by black labour. They were under contract to supply the whole of the sugar requirements of New. Zealand, and in addition they had other very large contracts They acquired large tracts of in Fiji, where no one had grown cane before the company went and erected factories for dealing the cane. They cleared and much of the land, and afterwards, many instances, sold it on terms. did the same thing in Queensland. too, the company - allowed men capital to take up land which they had cleared and planted, and to buv it on terms, promising them as high a price for their cane as any one else would give. The reports on the industry show that the Colonial Sugar Company's prices for cane have been higher than that of the other companies. The company did not wish to be can<»growers. They wished to confine their operations to manufacturing. years, the value of land, both in Australia and in Fiji, has increased considerably, and thus the company made large profits. Most of the profit to which reference has been made has come, not from the operations under the Agreements with the Commonwealth Government, but from other In making an arrangement Government, the company said, aro willing to place our cards the table, and to allow the General to check our We shall charge only the working expenses, plus £1 7s. ton""-which amount was later reduced to £1 per ton-""for profit and managerial expenses."" As a merchant has handled thousands of tons of sugar, I say that I could not do what Colonial Sugar Refining Company done at the price which it has received. Their overhead expensesfor so large a transaction are so much smaller per ton than any merchant's would be, handling much smaller quantities. It would not pay me to accept that price. sure that the Agreement fited the consumer and every in the Commonwealth, and there has been no legitimate complaint against it. Under it there is no interference of the Mr Carver. Re- cane-grower with his labourers: of the crude-sugar manufacturer with the canegrower; or of the refiner with the manufacturer of crude sugar. If there were any ground for fearing the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, the manufacturers of white sugar, .which for all praccountry tical purposes is as good as refined sugar, sugar- though not equalling it in appearance, there, would compete seriously with the comwith pany. It is necessary to protect the cultivated manufacturers of white sugar from the in competition of importers of Java, F i j i , They and other sugars. The Government proThere, poses an extra duty of £ 2 per ton on without white and refined sugar. I am not so much afraid of the importation of refined sugar as of the importation of white sugar. If we protect the white sugar, the mill-owners who make white sugar i u all Australia, instead of selling it to the Refining' Colonial Sugar Refining Company, can sell it direct to the public. To-day I received an urgent telegram from the Fairymead Factory, which used to send all their sugar into the market as white Of late sugar, saying that they regarded as inadequate a duty of l d . per lb., and hoped that the rate would be raised to has l ^ d . per lb., and l f d . for white aud refined sugar. I do not wish to injure any industry, and ever since I have been in this House I have, as far as I could, seen that fair play was given to all the indussources. tries of Australia, including those of the with the southern States. It must not be for""We gotten that sugar was produced so on cheaply in 1919 in comparison with Auditor- other parts of the world, that our transactions. manufacturers were able to export absolute in that year £1,847,970 worth of per jams and jellies, £1,054,099 worth of milk, £374,142 worth of biscuits, and £109,355 worth bf confectionery. The who consumers of Australia during the war got sugar for about one-third of the the price that was being charged for it in has the United States of America and in the United Kingdom. While we were selling sugar at £ 4 6 ls. 6d. per ton, the price in Gveat Britain varied from £ 5 7 15s. to £112 per ton, and jam factories there had to pay as much as £160 a ton I feel for it . We were charging the factories has bene- £ 57 a ton, less a rebate of £20 a ton interest on the sugar contents of exports. It must not be forgotten that when forming the. Federation, Queensland agreed to the White Australia policy, and gave up growing sugar-cane with black labour, which is the practice followed in all other parts of the world, the industry was promised adequate protection. These are some of the import sugar duties in force in other parts of the world. The duty per ton in the ""United Kingdom is £ 2 5 l.3s. 4 d . ; in Canada, £ 1 1 3s.; in the United States of America, £ 1 1 19s. 9 d . ; in Norway, £ 1 9 2s. l i d ; in Belgium, £ 1 0 4s. 10d.; in . the Netherlands, £ 2 2 17s.

Mr CORSER. - Not in every instance. Germany, Belgium, and other European countries subsist chiefly on beet sugar, and their duties are imposed to protect the beet-sugar industry. In Queensland we have 421,000,000 acres of land, and in our western districts the population is dependent for its f r u it supply largely on dried fruits. The cost of carriago i-s too high, and distances too long, to enable fresh fruit s to be sent there. We might easily have questioned why these people should be taxed as they have been on various other articles they do not produce. For instance, on bacon and hams, the duties are, British 3d., intermediate 4d., and general 4 d . ; biscuits, l | d . , 2d., 3 d . ; butter and cheese, 3d. all round; candles, l j d . , 2d. and 2 £ d . ; apples, pears, &c., 4d. all round ; honey, l j d . , 2d. and 3 d . ; hope, 6d., 9d. and l s . ; jams and jellies, 3d. all round; currants and raisins, 3d. all round; ginger, 4d. all round; prunes, 4Jd. all round; malted milk, 6d., 7d. and 8 d . ; sweetened milk, 2d., 2Jd. and 3d. We might easily have objected that the Queensland people were not producing those articles, and that they should not he taxed in order to assist their production in southern Australia, but we took a broader view. We realized that, having adopted a White Australia policy, we must encourage primary production and manufacture, so as to increase our population and thus insure our hold upon this enormous territory. If we do not follow that policy, the time will come when some other nation will claim the right to utilize those areas which we are not utilizing. The Australian people neither [148] bought this country nor won it by conquest. We took it from its original inhabitantssimply because they were not utilizing it , and if we, in turn, fai l to develop and populate the country, the League of Nations will find it diflicult to "" justify our retention of a continent populated by a handful of people. If the sugar industry is wiped out, no other will take its place in the north of Australia.. The only way to insure its continuance is to properly protect it , or renew the Agreement, which has not yielded an undue profit to any party to it . . From the cane planted next season the grower will get practically nothing in the first revenue year, but he will expect to. get a crop in the four following years. Before he can be expected to invest large sums of money in fertilizing, cultivating and planting that land, he must be assured that he will get a suflicient price for his product to pay the wages and other expenses incidental to his industry. I ask the honourable member for Franklin (Mr. MCWilliams) to listen to the appeal of the sugar-growers and to recollect the assistance that has been given to his own State. U p t ill the outbreak of war I used to import carbide at about £ 1 2 per ton, but, for the benefit of Tasmania, this Parliament imposed a protective duty of £30 per ton. Hops, also, are heavily protected. If it is fair for the Tasmanian people to ask this Parliament to keep its engagement in regard to the annual grant to that State, have we not a right to ask them to respect the undertaking given to the Queensland sugar interests, that, if they were deprived of the same class of cheap labour as is used by their competitors, they would get adequate protection 1",56
223,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,No Tasmanian member has expressed any opposition to adequate protection.,58
224,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,And no Queensland representative opposed the special grant to Tasmania.,58

226,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Fawkner) [5JBB] A considerable amount of irrelevancy has been introduced into the debate, and has obscured the real issue which the Committee is asked to determine, namely, whether we should increase the duty on sugar-raw , white, and beet. The question resolves itself into a very simple issue, and, before I can say whether I am. prepared to increase the duty on sugar, I must be convinced that such increase is necessary to the continuance of the sugar industry. My difficulty is to learn why I should vote for the increase. ""is a complete ahsence of evidence to assist the Committee in making up its mind. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) has told the Committee that he has received from a representative man in the sugar industry an urgent telegram stating that the duty proposed by the Government is totally inadequate. On the other hand, we are told by the Government that that duty is reasonable and adequate-so much so that the Prime Minister has assured us that, even with that duty in operation, the Australian consumer will be able to buy sugar at 4id. pei* lb. These two contentions are totally irreconcilable.",58
227,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That is not all the information bh which the honourable member is asked'to vote. . Mr MAXWELL - No ; I understand - that the proposal of the Government is based upon the recommendation of the Tariff Board-. I have read the report very carefully, and it is a most interesting document, but a careful perusal of it does not disclose one single reason why the duty on sugar should be increased from £6 to £96s. 8d. per ton. A great portion of the report is devoted to an examination of the claim made by the sugar industry to a duty of £14 per ton, and the Tariff Board, after a discussion of that claim, came to the conclusion that it 'is absolutely unwarranted, but that the industry should be further protected' by increasing the-duty to l d . per lb., or £9 6s. 8d. .per ton. Not one single reason is given for the suggested increase. I should imagine that when an increase of duty is sought by any industry the onus lies upon it bo show that the increase is necessary in its interests. The basic fact upon which the appeal for the increase is founded is the cost of production; in fact, we are told by those who are engaged in the sugar industry in Queensland that it is impossible for them to compete with other countries producing sugar by black labour-in other words, that the cost of production elsewhere is much lower than in. Australia.",59
228,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,So it is.,59
229,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I admit that, but when we ask how much .duty we must impose in order to equalize the conditions we must of necessity know what, is the There cost of producing sugar cane in Australia. I also draw attention to the fact, that the Tariff Board quotes from the report of the 1919 Royal Commission on sugar, that the Commission, when making in quiries as to the cost of producing; cane sugar in Queensland, found it impossible to get anything like reliableinformation upon that point. The fact is also pointed to that the Central Mil l Board in Queensland, for four years prior to 1919, made an effort to get information from the cane-growers as to the cost of production of cane, and failed to get it. Various reasons are assigned! why that information is not forthcoming.",59
230,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Farmer s do not keep books.,59
231,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"But when they did keep books, they did not produce the required information. In 1919, when the Commission asked for the production of books, it was told that they had beendestroyed in the cyclone of - 1918; and the very sarcastic remark is made by the Commission that it was most extraordinary that the ^cyclone seemed to have confined its attention to the books of those who would have been able to supply the information. I - do not wish toi labour this point, but I do wish to emphasize it .",59
232,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That cyclone cost this Government some hundreds of thousands of pounds! Mr MAXWELL,-What on earth has that to do with the fact that the cyclone was given as a reason why those men could not - produce their books ? Whatever the reason was, the fact remains that the information could not be obtained by the Board, it could not be obtained by the Commission 'of 1919, and it has not been obtained by the Tariff Board appointed by this House.",59
233,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,It is.an undiscoverable fact in all primary production.,59
234,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Her e we have introduced another element!,59
235,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I have said so before.,59
236,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It dees not matter if the honourable gentleman has said it half-a-dozen times, he says it now; and I understand from him that the cost of producing cane in Queensland is an un-discoverable fact.",59
237,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I say that it is so in al l primary production.,60
238,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The fact that this basic fact in such an inquiry is undiscoverable probably accounts for the discrepancy between the position occupied by the Government today and the position occupied by representative men,60
239,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"There are the facts of differences in the value of the land, differences in the rainfall, and differences in the methods of production.",60
240,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I quite admit all the Minister says, but surely it should be possible, even where there are varying - qualities of land and so for t h , to - districts in which the conditions are homogeneous.",60
241,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,They vary from year to year.,60
242,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Then the information can be supplied for one year; but, as a fact, we have not been able to get the cost of production in any one single year. It is significant, and I think rather, a sinister fact, that the men who are askingfor protection cannot give UB the basic information as to the cost of production. I am placed in a difficult position. Like other honourable members, I - desire to do the fair thing by the in dustry as by every other industry in Australia^-bu t only a fair thine.",60
243,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,As a consistent Proof tectionist you have voted without similar information before.,60
244,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"We l l , I should - have voted without such information. What reason is it that ought to influence me when I am asked why the duty should - be' increased by £ 3 6s. 8d. t For the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) to tell me that the duty is so and so on currants, bananas, or machiturns, nery, is no guide to me in deciding regard whether such an increase as now asked for is necessary. It is of no use to that, because adequate protection has been given in other industries, we ought to give adequate protection in this; question is, What is adequate protection in the sugar industry ?",60
245,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Protectio n to the extent of £ 9 6s. 8d. is not.,60

That information, however, haa not been forthcoming. The greater part of the day has been spent most interestingly, mostly in recriminations between various members regarding matters of ancient history. That, however, does not help one to solve the difficult problem of casting ah intelligent vote.

248,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,May I refresh the memory of the honourable member? The Government did table a dissection of costs which had been prepared. On every point approximate costs were shown; we cannot get them absolutely accurate.,60
249,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I understood the Minister to say a littl e while ago that the , cost of production is an undiscoverable fact.",60
250,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I was speaking of the actual cost.,60
251,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"On e does no*, expect a mathematically accurate estimate the cost; but, if the Minister will look at the report of the Tariff Board, he will find the grounds on which it is alleged not that, where the estimated cost has been .given by various growerSj it cannot be accepted as reliable. I cannot remember all the grounds cited, but they include inflated capital value, giving efficient' . averages instead of ordinary averages, and average returns instead of efficient reand unreliable statements with to the average price paid for cane. .",60
252,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,All these are weighed say against the application for £ 1 4 .,60
253,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The average price actually paid for cane is a matter which the admits of accurate statement, and about which no mistake ought to be made. An y reasonable man, outside the special pleaders from Queensland, will recognise that this places a representative, who has to give an intelligent vote, in a very difficult position. I regret that this debate I should have been used in an endeavour to excite Inter-State jealousies. That is unworthy of a debate of this kind. Sneering references have been made to the State of Victoria, and there have been insinuations that, because we belong to this State, we are incapable of taking a just view of Queensland's claims. I submit, however, that we are quite as capable of taking a just view as are the Queensland men themselves. They ought to realise the possibility that men from Queensland are prejudiced in favour of their own State; and of that great industry of which we have heard so much. We have been told that we are asked to impose this increased duty because the Queensland growers ought to know where they stand. That I admit; but I also say that every, consumer, and every taxpayer in Australia, has as much right to know where he stands in regard to the payment of the tax involved in the imposition of the duty. It is in order that we may enable both sections to know where they stand that we desire the information which, so far, has not been forthcoming. The imposition of this duty is simply a leap in the dark; indeed, the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr. ' Corser) has admitted the fact. If the - honourable member believes the representations made to him by his correspon- dents, he will admit that the duty the Government is asking us to impose is totally inadequate; and if it is totally inthen ? adequate it must be perfectly useless. I should like to know with what object the honourable member for Wide Bay read that telegram if he did not'endorse it?",60
254,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I do not know enough to endorse it.,61
255,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"If the honourable member believes the statements made to be true, he has a perfect right to give them to us as a fact; but if he does not, he should not have used the communication.",61
256,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I cannot say whether it is true or not.,61
257,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"We are at the end of the session, and we are told that this duty, if imposed, will not come into operation until the Agreement expires in June next. This means, of course, that the real settlement of the question of sugar protection, whether by way of an import duty or of control, is a matter for the next 'Parliament.",61
258,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,What are the parties to do in the meantime? » v,61
259,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"A duty is proposed which those concerned 'say is totally inadequate. It follows that such a duty can be of no use; and, in any case, they are protected until June next year, by which time the new Parliament will have assembled. Even if we do agree to this increased duty) that will not by any means settle the matter. A new Parliament is about to be elected, and I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that, when the Prime Minister was in Queensland quite lately, addressing the sugar growers in advocating a renewal of theAgreement as an expression of his own personal opinion, he said that the only way in which to obtain a renewal was to send into the Federal. Parliament a majority of members pledged to a renewal.",61
260,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,That is not true; the Prime Minister never made any such statement!,61
261,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Was the honourable member with the Prime Minister throughout the whole length and breadth of his tour in Queensland? Is he in a position to say that on no occasion, when the Pirime Minister was addressing the growers, he made such a statement?",61
262,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Suppose he did, what",61
263,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I am using this a3 an illustration; and I say that it lies with the next Parliament to settle the future of the industry in Queensland. Whatever we do now is subject to review by the new Parliament when it meets, and I am anxious to do whatever is fair in regard to the industry. If I thought that the increased duty of £9 6s. 8d. would help ithe industry, I should vote for it. Perhaps I should not have used the word "" help,"" because, of course, any increase would help the indus.try. If I were convinced that it was reasonably necessary I would vote for it . But I have only the recommendation of the Tariff Board; and the Government have gone one better than that. The Board has given no reason why the duty should be increased to £9 6s. 8d.; and a fortiori the Government have given no reason, so far as I can learn, why'they have gone one better.",61
264,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The honourable member cannot have read the report of the Tariff Board.,62
265,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I have read every word of it .,62
266,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The Board refers more than once to increased wages and added costs under the provisions of the Navigation Act , . and to other points which have reduced the value of the old degree of protection.",62
267,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The Board has not said to . what specific extent increased wages have reduced the protection or affected the cost of production.,62
268,Mr GREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"In 1912, wages were 26s. a week and keep; now, they are 45s.",62
269,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Can the' Minister for Defence show that the difference between 26s. and 45s. a week accounts for and covers the increase of £ 3 6s. 8d. a. ton in duty?,62
270,Mr GREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I tell the honourable member that it does not.,62
271,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Then where are we? If we are going to protect the industry, let us do so adequately. What is the use of the Government asking for an increase which the Minister for Defence (Mr Greene) admits is inadequate? If the Government desire to protect the industry, are they not making a fool of the House when they say, "" We ask you to agree to such and such a rate of duty, but it does not represent adequate protection ""?",62
272,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,What is the good of this special pleading?,62
273,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I desire to find facts on which to base the judgment which I must form before I can cast an intelligent vote. Despite all my endeavours, I have not yet been able to glean particulars which can guide and confirm me in the direction that I should take. If I should be asked by my constituents why I voted for an increase of duty to £ 9 6s. 8d. per ton I would like to be able to say just what necessitated the particular increase. I do not refer merely to an increase, but to the specific in crease. However, when I ask the Government if the proposed increase is adequate, I am informed that it is not.",62
274,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,If the honourable member proposes to work out the proposition on a basis of mathematical accuracy he will not succeed; for the imposition of these duties is involved in the policy of a White Australia.,62
275,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"W it h great respect, I hold that the White Australia policy has nothing to do with the case. It is a settled policy, which we must maintain; but the matter of its maintenance affords me no direct specific assistance when I am searching for the rate of duty which will be adequate to protect the industry. Of course, we must maintain our White Australia policy. That is why we must go in for Protection at all. But the question which I desire to have answered is, by how much, if anything, should we increase the present duty? As at present advised, I shall certainly not vote for l d . more than is recommended by the Tariff Board. W it h regard to the matter of the sugar to be used by manufacturers, while we should do all that is possible to assist and stabilize the great Queensland sugar in dustry, we should not be unmindful of the .position of the manufacturers of j a m and f r u it and other preserves into whose products sugar so largely enters. The manufacturers ought to get their sugar at world's parity, both for export and for home consumption.",62

I was one of those who voted in favour of the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), to the effect that sugar should be retailed at 4Jd. per l b . My object in so voting was to protest against the methods adopted by the Government in. withholding information for which the House was seeking, and which had been many times promised. Subsequently, there was a proposal, on the part of the Country party, that the whole matter of sugar control should be sub* mitted to a Select Committee. The House agreed,. unanimously, I think, that the Accounts Committee should be given the task of investigating and reporting. The Prime Minister offered to place at its disposal expert accountants; and the Committee was virtually clothed with the' authority of a Court.. Still later, a censure motion was launched by the Opposition on the basis of the sugar position, for which, however, I did not vote. The motion had no direct bearing on the actual price of sugar. It wasThat the Government be severely censured for referring its sugar transactions to the Public Accounts Committee before disposing of the amendments moved by the honourable members for Swan and Bourke, thereby delaying decision on the question of immediately reducing the retail price of sugar.",62

289,Mr FRANCIS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It was asked to ininto the administration of the sugar control over a period of years, ancl that the question of the sugar duties. There have been so many outside activihis ties, such as those of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, associated with the control, that one is justified in refusing to vote for any further support to the industry until the report of the Public Accounts Committee is available. From that report we should be able to learn the Colonial Sugar Refining Comto pany has been doing, and the extent to be which the cane-grower and the workers of the industry have been benefited by the of Agreement. The Tariff Board, in its reThe consumers will be called upon to make an unnecessarily large contribution towards industry which haa recently been reported upon as inefficiently conducted, should the duty be fixed at £14 a ton. t reports further that it has found it in difficult to come to the conclusion that even a duty of £9 6s. Sd. a ton is required protect the industry. The jam, fruit and confectionery industries, that which give employment to large numbers of men and women, are vitally interested in this matter. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell), after, list tening carefully to the whole debate, marshalled the facts; as only a man with a well-trained mind could do, and has suggested to the Government that all the industries that are dependent upon an adequate sugar supply are entitled to consideration, as well as the sugar-growers themselves. The T a r if f Board points out that in the report of the Royal - Commission of 1920 it was stated thatApart from the Targe numbers of farmers who do not keep any account of their transactions,, there' appeared to bea general disinclination on the part of those who do keep accounts to furnish statements of. actual receipts and expenditure. . . . numlbcr of individual' returns were received which purported torepresent actual costs and receipts. There were, also furnished a number 'of estimates of what was considered the cost of production. It is remarkable that the average of these data indicates that the sugarfarming industry is carried on at a loss, but nn examination of the statements submitted clearly demonstrates that with a few exceptions- (1) the capital value is greatly inflatedand that "" the average price received per ton of cane is understated."" The T a r i ff Board recommended a duty of £9 6s. 8d., but the Government have gone further and have imposed a duty of £14 per ton.",63

I say this because I realise that the consumers of sugar have to be protected, and because there are many A limited industries in Australia whose existence depends upon their ability to secure sugar at a fair and reasonable price.",64
298,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Batman) [S.2] There is ample excuse for the state of nervous excitement in which a number of honourable members have approached the consideration of this savoury subject. The attitude of the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) is not only understandable, but also easily excusable. He is setting out to stabilize an industry with the aid of a very unstable Government, and his obvious anxiety is due to the fact that he is supported by a party which is by no means united, as to the best means of - I repeat that word of recent manufacture-stabilizin g the great sugar industry. We. owe to the Tate member for Angas, Mr Glynn, a striking reference to his ""composite m in d . "" As a member of a certain Government headmitted that he had one mind as an individual and. another as a member of the Cabinet Unfortunately,, on this occasion we have not only the dual minds of the individual Ministers, but also the divided views of Cabinet itself. Furthermore, we are engaged in an endeavour to mature an agreement between the Commonwealth and the State of Queensland,, relating to the sugar industry in Queensland, while there is grave disagreement between the G'overnment and the members' of the party supporting them. For instance, there is the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell); who attended that memorable mee'ting of the housewives, to which the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) has made so frequent and such feeling reference. He finds himself absolutely committed against a renewal of this Agreement, which is to expire in the middle of next year. There is also the honourable .member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best), who was bidden to attend the same meeting, and who declared himself favourable ""to what is known as decontrol. There is '-also the honourable member for Henty (Mr Francis), who is endeavouring to compose his dual mind on the subject, and has assured us in those rolling platitudes of whioh he is a pastmaster, that he stands alike for the protection of the grower, the worker, and the consumer, ;and there leaves the question. It would - be unkind of me to leave this aspect of - the matter without some reference to the '.honourable member for Capricornia.",64
299,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Can the honourable member explain why he was at the meeting in question ?,65
300,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member's heroic, demonstration on that occasion in the face of almost unparallelled difficulties won for him, if not sympathy of any section of the meeting, at least that of my honourable colleague, Mr Scullin, ancl myself, who were present .at the meeting as the representatives of ithe great Australian Labour party. The right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) referred, in the course of his speech today, to the interesb which he said existed in the southern parts of Aus..tralia in the prioe of sugar, and I sected a remark that was designed to --show that the anxiety of the southern - dwellers is really well founded, and that this is not a question concerning, as the honourable member for Capricornia would '.have us believe, the retention and holding of the seats of certain honourable ^members who are in a very slippery place. Sugar is an article of food which is not specially or mainly used by the leisured classes; or by any means the sole concern of the sugar-growers or sugar workers of Queensland, but is a vital factor in every poor man's home, even in the little metropolitan electorate which I , for the present, have the honour to represent. Sugar is in every sense a real Australian question. By a slight extension nf the metaphor sugar is a "" bread and butter "" question. It is a domestic question which is not to be settled by the polemics of those gentlemen who come here from Queensland, and would have us believe that their special knowledge of cane-growing in the sub-tropical parts of Queensland entitles them to speak for the whole - of Australia on a matter affecting the people's food. I wish to debate this matter from the point of view of the sugar consuming public, but as I regard the proposals as political, because of the manner in which it has been brought before this Committee, rather than as an attempt to deal with an economic problem, I would like to stress the position of the Government in regard to it. If they speak through their representative head, they stand for the national control of this great national industry, and even today, in a whirling concatena'tion of inconsistencies the Prime Minister has reminded us of the good claim the policy of a White Australia has upon us, and of the necessity that exists for making sacrifices' in order to maintain it. The right honourable gentleman was pledged to a renewal of this Agreement. Why has he changed the his front upon that simple policy? The Agreement docs not expire until the middle of next year, after the new Parliament, in the ordinary course of events, must be called together. Therefore, there would the ample time to deal with the question of the renewal of the Agreement, and the right honourable gentleman had only to say, "" We stand for the policy of national control of this national ininter- dustry,"" to receive the sound backing of members of the Labour party. He would already have been assured in advance of quite sufficient support to give the people of Capricornia all the Government control they could possibly require. Why does my honourable and agitated friend, the honourable member for Capricornia, waste his time in animadverting upon the Labour party in this matter? Why does he not quietly take his Leader by the hand, and say, "" Mr Hughes, you have pledged yourself to Government control. Come into the House, and declare yourself for a renewal of that control, and you will have the support of every Queenslander and of every member of the Labour party "" ?  the honourable member for Capricornia do that?",65
301,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Because Victorians want sugar at 3d. per lb. That is the trouble.,65
302,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"'B y that interjection the honourable member for .Capricornia uttered at least half a truth, - which, for him, is a very fair record. He has indicated that there are Victorians, not on the Labour side of the House, however, who would not stand such a declaration from the Prime Minister. He knows that the difficulty facing the Government is that their supporters will not stand hy them on the subject of Government control, and that, for political purposes, they have to juggle with the question in a way which serves them, best in the difficulty in which they are placed. per lb. Therefore, they have come down with a proposal to impose increased duties on sugar, which is to take the place of the Government's policy of Government control - of the industry. iWhen I ask what will be the effect of the duties the answer is, ""They will protect the sugar-growers in the electorate of the honourable member for Capricornia, the sugar workers in Queensland, those engaged in the mills and refineries, and everybody associated with the working of sugar."" Everybody is to be protected except the consumer of the commodity which still stands at 6d. per lb. If it is a fact that even without the imposition of these duties the worker is protected by special legislation, and that growers and those engaged in the mills and refineries are protected without Government control, by means of local boards and local awards, they have very little to thank the present Government for in that regard. The security they enjoy has been given by the application of the Labour policy. If , as an orable member has suggested this afternoon, those engaged in the sugar industry are amply protected iby industrial legislation, they have to thank, not the present Government, but the Labour party. But, unfortunately, we cannot protect the sugar consuming public by the imposition of a duty, and therefore I do not stand at present for the proposal which the Government have now made. I am charged by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) with having at a public meeting in Melbourne made a demand for sugar at a very reasonable price. The honourable member has quoted me correctly in that regard more than once.",65
303,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Yes ; 3d. per lb.,66
304,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I do not think I suggested 3d. per lb.,66
305,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"""Cheaper and still cheaper.""",66
306,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"At least it waa a price consistent with the fact that Australia is a great sugar-growing country, and that in respect of sugar, unlike other commodities, we are practically self-contained. I said we should be able to supply sugar to the public at a very moderate price; certainly much less than 6d.",66
307,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,How could good wages be paid with sugar at 3d. per lb. ?,66
308,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"A Committee of this Parliament has been inquiring in regard to the production and distribution of sugar; it has amassed a great deal of evidence, and it is to furnish a report very shortly. Do the Government know what is contained in the report? Mr RoDGERS - r-lt will not be a te.port on the incidence of the Tariff.",66
309,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,That is altogether too thin. It will be a report which we all know will be very disquieting to the Government when it is published.,66
310,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,How does the honourable member know that already?,66
311,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I know it from what has been published about it already. I know it from question and answer published in the public press in regard to this inquiry. I know it by the long list of pitiable disclosures made against the Government in regard to sugar ever since hon- the matter was first discussed in this Chamber. I know it by the mass of facts we had in evidence before the inquiry was commenced, and I know it because I have faith in the Committee as a body endeavouring to give a fair report upon the facts. It is an indecent act on the part of the Government to jump in immediately ahead of the presentation of that report with this proposal to increase the duty on sugar.",66
312,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,On a point of order. Was the honourable member in order in saying that the Government were guilty of an indecent act? I insist that that expression be withdrawn!.,66
313,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The expression to which the honourable member has taken exception is very often used in the Chamber. I do not aay that it is a proper term to be applied by one honourable ber to others; but I am not prepared - rule it out of order. Mr BREN.NAN - I am glad to have the benefit of your ruling, sir, and accept the gentle and kindly hint have given me. I can only assure you that the expression of which complaint has been made is very mild in comparison witli what I should'like to say about the Government and their dealings with the sugar problem. Why do I stand for policy of Government control of sugar father than the proposed increase duty? My attitude is easily understandin able. Both a protective duty and Gonow vernment control through an Agreement such as the one now current are species of Government control. Both are operasame.. tions of government for the purpose of controlling the growing, manufacture, and distribution of sugar, but whilst the form of control, as we see it operating the Agreement, seeks to regulate the whole industry equally as to-the rights of the grower, the refiner, the miller, the distributor, and the public least theoretically sound policy, other form of Government control, although possibly it supports in sense the grower, the miller, and this the refiner, does not protect in way the general consuming public. Its effect is quite other than that, for it the whole control of the industry into hands of a great and. powerful moneyagainst making organization. I have never been one of those who indulge in mere rhetoric against the Colonial Sugar Refining Comon pany or any other company. In the sent state of society I ' admit the just claims of capitalists and capitalist ganizations, and I recognise that the natural ambition of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is to make as much money as possible out of the public the midst of whom it operates. I also congratulate it, with a certain amount of reservation, upon the great success with which it has drawn handsome dividends from the Australian public. But as member of this Parliament I do not feel in the least inclined to break down an existing control which limits, in some way, at all events, the operations of great middleman's concern, and to hand the sugar industry over absolutely to that company with liberty to make what progard memfits it can and will. That is my position to in regard to this question. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company has been shown more than .oncein this House to be in a certain sense in league I with the Government. We started with you a declaration made in this House, and still uncontradicted, that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is a direct and powerful supporter of the Nationalist Government. It ' is a sinister and unpleasant fact that the present Leader of the. Goa vernment (Mr Hughes), who waa one of the strongest and bitterest assailants of in the company in other days, when he was better company in another party, has become one of the readiest and - most effusive apologists of that organization. Not that the company has altered in the slightest degree; its methods are still the It still refuses to give evidence when called upon to do so; it still refuses to discharge the first duty of citizenship, one namely, to make a candid statement as into the terms and conditions upon which it carries on its business with the publio; it still adopts that sinister and suspicious attitude towards the people of the Comis at monwealth to . which it owes so the much. But the attitude of the head of the Government towards the company a has vastly changed. In this chamber afternoon the right honourable, gentleany man said, "" Yes, I know I have had a tilt at it many a time ""-and he laughed puts pleasantly at the memories of those other the days when he had entered the lists that doughty opponent- "" I know I . have had a tilt at it , as I have at many other things that have come in my way."" And he spoke, with tremendous emphasis the first personal pronoun, of the obprestacles he had overcome. When he had finished his oration one felt that Bill orAdams at Waterloo was not a circumstance in comparison with the right honourable gentleman. He had not only won all sorts of reforms for the Commonin wealth, but he had won them alone.",66
314,Mr CUNNINGHAM,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Did he sayanything about his wrestle with the £25,000 ?",67
315,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"He did not, and I % am surprised that the honourable member should call my attention to that matter, for I have not up to the present moment alleged that the Colonial Sugar Refining this Company was a substantial contributor to that gift, although it is quite possible that it was. The important fact in reto the company is that the Commonwealth has allowed the alleged Government control to f all into the hands of the company. Sugar is not under Government control in the national .sense in which the Labour party understands the term. By national Government control we do not mean political control such as is now operating. We do not mean a partnership such as the right honourable gentleman is responsible for bringing about between the Commonwealth and Amalgamated Wireless Limited , under which the control of the country's communications are handed over to a profit-making company. We do not mean a form of control of the .sugar industry, - by which the bookkeeping and every other operation in . connection with the Agreement isplaced in the hands of a profit-making company. is'not - what"" we understand, by national trusteeship for national purposes. mean disinterested control by disinterested persons, who are not only responsible to the Commonwealth, but who will place their cards upon the table and disclose their facts and figures to the representatives of the people. I defy any honourable member to say that we have been able to extract from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company facts and figures in relation to the period over which the existing Agreement has extended, namely, from March, 1920, to the present date.",67
316,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,How would the honourable member get the ideal control of which he speaks?,68
317,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The first essential would be a nearer approach to an ideal Government, and 1 feel a certain sense of elation in the thought that we are approaching nearer that ideal than we have been for some time. The honourable member for Capricornia has said,, and doubtless other honourable members will say, "" The workers in Queensland are entitled to this Protective duty, and does not the Labour party stand for Protection? "" Therefore, it follows, according to those honourable members, that we must be wholehearted supporters of the increased duty. The contention is too t h in ; the object of the Government in putting the matter in that way is too obvious. Of course, the party on this side stands for protection of Australian industries, and, especially, for protection of an industry which, as the Minister is so insistent on declaring, means to a great extent the maintenance of the White Australia ideal-the ideal of every member on this side. The"" workers of Queensland will not make any mistake about our attitude in this regard. I remind the Minister that when we come back-o r those of us who do-as a new Parliament, this Agreement will not have' expired. It will be still current; and there will be ample time then for us to deal with it , and to deal also with the question of the protection of the grower. I think . I am quite justified, although only' a member of the rank and file of my party, in saying, on their behalf, that the sugar growers of Queensland may rest quite assured that, so far as we are concerned, if this Agreement has .to run out, and if we cannot get any other agreement of a national character for national purposes, this party can be relied oh to give the That grower all the protection to which he is legitimately entitled. We Mr ATKINSON - The grower says that he wants it now, and not after the election.",68
318,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"If so, all I can say is that he can have from me now the declaration, that I am empowered to make for the whole of my party, that he shall have all protection he can reasonably want.",68
319,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The honourable member's time has expired..,68
320,Mr JOWETT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Grampians) [S.33] I regret that so sweet a subject as sugar should give rise to so bitter a debate. It has, up to riow , been a debate of flouts, : jeers, sneers, innuendoes, reproaches, implications of bad f a it h , accusations of narrowness and.provincialism, and almost everything that is evil in deed and in thought. My task is to endeavour to pour some oil on the troubled waters, and bring about that sweet reasonableness in this discussion which the public of Australia have been accustomed to in the past, though, perhaps, somewhat remote past, and which we always expect in the future. I am prepared to give .the Government the fullest credit for the best and soundest intentions, and I am prepared to give the Opposition the credit of being inspired by the very highest motives. There is not, in their mind, one thought of hostility towards the 'Government, and not one second of time has been wasted in the discussion of"" this vital question. As for the Country party, ""their sympathies are equally given to the sugar-, growers, the fruit-growers, and the consumers of the whole of Australia. I should like, first, to put the case of the .sugar-growers of Queensland. I have stood for a White Australia ever since I ;arrived in the country-nearl y fifty years ago. I have been for many years in that northern State, and know it well. I have always proclaimed, wherever I have been, that it is quite possible to carry on the sugar or any other industry in Queensland by means of white labour. We must regard those engaged in the sugar industry there, both employers and employed, as the "" wardens of the northern marches "" of civilization in Australia. . Mr MAHONY - Will you tell us what you said about coloured labour at Kyneton five years ago?",68
321,Mr JOWETT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"No doubt the honourable member has an excellent memory, but I do not think it goes so far back as that. However, that is not the point we are considering. What the public of Australia has always desired to know is exactly how much protection', how much Government assistance is required to maintain sugar-growing profitably by white labour in Australia. I do not wish to reproach the Government an any way with not having supplied adequate information to the people as to the f u ll measure of protection required. On the other hand, I , f e el quite sure that the Government must be deeply grateful to all those members who have"" taken part in this debate-for the questions they have asked, and the information they have imparted. I am equally sure that the Government will supply us with unlimited volumes of information and balance-isheets if required.",69
322,Mr RODGEKS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The balance-sheets will surprise some honourable members!,69
323,Mr JOWETT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Where is that sweet reasonableness on the part of the Minister that we have always been accustomed to?,69
324,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Where did you make that speech-at St. Arnaud or Kyneton?,69
325,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I have repeatedly called for order, but honourable members seem to pay no attention whatever to the direction of the Chair. It is not possible for the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) to utter more than half-adozen sentences without meeting with interjections, which only lead to further disorder. I appeal to honourable members io restrain themselves. If an honourable member desires to inform the Committee of anything that is in his mind, he may take the ordinary course.",69
326,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,It was not with a desire to interrupt the honourable member that I asked the question. I merely desired to know whether the honourable member made a statement about coloured labour at St. Arnaud or at Kyneton about five years ago.,69
327,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member may ask that question at the proper time, but not while another honourable member is speaking.",69
328,Mr JOWETT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The thirst of the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) for information is so insatiable that if we were to sit for six months, I should not have time to answer all his questions. I do not join with any honourable member in condemnation of that great company, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which I regard as one of the most - splendid and highly efficient organizations in the world. Its services have been of enormous value, not only to the sugar-growers, but to the sugar consumers in Australia. And it ill-becomes a Chamber, with such responsibilities as we have, to make charges or cast reflections unless there are the strongest grounds for so doing. Several honourable members interjecting,",69
329,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,If honourable members persist ini interjecting I shall name the offenders.,69
330,Mr JOWETT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"This House and the people . of Australia are, I think, prepared to give the utmost possible consideration to the sugar-growers of Queensland. But'not unreasonably,.we do claim to have laid before us information and figures to enable us to judge to what extent protection is required to ""enable the industry to be successfully carried on in competition with black labour elsewhere. There is a strong reason why that information should be given adequately and completely before we come to a conclusion. That reason is found in the present price of sugar, which, no doubt, has been arrived at with a desire to give every consideration to the sugar-grower. I do not think any reproach can be cast at the consumers and fruit-growers of Australia for having, so far, treated the sugar-growers of Queensland ungenerously. But we have arrived at the stage when further information is demanded, because it has been foundimpossible, or exceedingly difficult, for the orchardist to carry on while the present high price of sugar prevails. I have just returned from visiting a very delightful city, with a salubrious climate, in the fertile zone of Victoria.",69

334,Mr JOWETT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,During my visit it was strongly impressed on me by the f r u it growers aud the manufacturers of jam .that they will find it practically impossible to carry on unless there is an absolutely fundamental alteration of the conditions under which they obtain their supplies of sugar.,70

337,Mr MAHONY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I am not sneering; I am quoting from a speech of the honourable member.,70
338,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Order ! The honourable - member for Grampians is invitin g interjections.,70
339,Mr JOWETT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I am sorry if any in-vitation of mine to debate, banquet, or dance should be misconstrued; I shall not issue any' more invitations, at all events, until this debate is concluded. I have discussed this matter very full y with those engaged - in fruit-growing, and also with those who manufacture the f r u it after it has been gathered. I wish to impress on the Committee the immense importance of the f r growing industry, without in any way from the importance of sugar-growing. I remind honourable members, however, of the very grave danger of driving these fruit-growers off the land in the absence of any settlement of this question. My own belief is that the question cannot be settled by the motion before us, unless the Committee is prepared to carry the amendment of which I have given notice. I should also like to remind honourable members that the "" Book of L if e "" began with a man and a woman in an orchard, the Garden of Eden, with the story of our great ancestor and ancestress. It was only when they listened to the temptation of a serpent",70
340,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Was it from Queensland?,70
341,Mr GABB,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,It was the Colonial Sugar Refining Company.,70
342,Mr JOWETT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I desire to make no reflection either upon Queensland or the company; but the fact remains that, when our ancestors listened to the voice of the serpent, they were driven out of the orchard, and that unhappy event coincides with what is known as the fall of man. Those who thoroughly understand the industry say there is grave danger of many fruit-growers being driven from their orchards because they cannot continue to make a living. They see no prospect of improving their outlook unless jam manufacturers and. f r u it preservers are permitted. to obtain their coloured sugar supplies under considerably more favourable conditions than those which rule today. They are not satisfied with the proposal of the Government that they shall receive some form of rebate upon the importation of sugar for use in their products for export. They desire to be allowed to import their sugar supplies in bond.",70
343,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The Government have not made the statement, in connection with this debate, that the manufacturers shall be granted rebates, as the honourable member has just indicated. On the contrary, both the Prime Minister and I have said that the previous practice will be reverted to-namely , of permitting the importation of sugar for the purpose of manufacture for export.",70
344,Mr JOWETT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Do I understand, then, that, if this resolution is agreed to, jam manufacturers and f r u it canners will u it - be permitted to import sugar in bond ? detracting Mr Rodgers - For the purpose of manufacturing for export.",70
345,Mr JOWETT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I cannot read anything of that character into the resolution.,70
346,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I shall deal with it. when speaking to the honourable member's proposed amendment.,70
347,Mr JOWETT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Owing to the high price of sugar and the relatively high price which they are, therefore, compelled to charge for their output, manufacturers have complained that sales of jam and preserves have fallen' off enormously. They claim that their only hope of building up again-in respect of export products-is in being permitted to import their sugar supplies in bond. would impress upon honourable members the importance of doing everything possible to encourage the fruit-growing industry. Jam manufacturers and f r u it canners should be assisted so that they may be able to sell their products more cheaply, thus permitting the people to buy necessary supplies, and so saving orehardists from disaster.",70
348,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Darwin) [8.51] - On more than one occasion when the question of Government control of sugar has been discussed in this House I have said that I was definitely opposed to a renewal of the Agreement. I am not likely to depart from that decision. I object to Government control in respect of any of our Australian industries. This Committee is entitled ""to know whether the imposition df the proposed duties will mean that there shall not be a renewal of control. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr . Rodgers) was directly asked, last night, whether such would be the case; but he declined to give a frank reply, stating ' that the matter, was one for futur e consideration. The Prime Minister, when approached, would give no more definite assurance. But , if we decide to impose rates of duty which will afford full protection to the sugar industry and We discover, after the election, that the Government intend to renew the Agreement, this expiring Parliament will have been placed in a false position. It will not now be necessary for us to consider the question of protecting the in dustry if the whole subject-matter is to come up for review and final decision by the new Parliament. I recognise the 'value of the industry to Australia; and, since I have always been prepared to give what I have considered sufficient protection to Australian industries, I intend to support the imposition of duty. I do not feel inclined, however, to vote in favour of the motion unless and until I have been given an assurance that its adoption will involve the establishment of a Protectionist policy for the industry rather than the renewal of Government control. Upon the question of what is an adequate degree of. protection, I have nothing - t» guide me except the report of the Tariff Board. The literature sent to members from , and in behalf of the sugar interests, is not a true guide concerning the actual position. Obviously, it .is in I spired, just as was all the literature with which members of Parliament were deluged during the Tariff session.. I supported the appointment of the Tariff Board because I desired that there should be an expert body to inform and guide me when I should be asked to consider the rates of duty to be imposed for the protection of various Australian industries. I am not well informed concerning, the conditions of the sugar industry. I have already said that I desire to give it adequate protection, because I recognise its national importance. Also, we must settle the northern parte of Australia. Our empty northern spaces are our greatest problem, if we are to maintain the policy of a White Australia. I have turned to the report of the Board for guidance and advice, but I find that certain of it s passages are rather disquieting. It is a recognised principle that, if an industry ie, not doing all that should be possible for itself, the people should not be called upon to subsidize it by the imposition of heavy protective duties. Under the heading of the economic position of the industry, the Tariff Board states that it has been forced to the conclusion that "" the sugar'industry is on somewhat of an anomalous basis."" The report statesIn Queensland, where nearly all the sugar is produced, the State Government-throug h its instrumentalities-fixe s the wages and conditions of the industry, whilst' the Federal Government is called npon to protect a position ' it has had no hand in creating. Speaking generally, this does not appear to be a proper economic position, for in the future it might happen that the granting of a certain protection' if made necessary through special condi-tions_ imposed by any State might not be long sufficient if the State authorities concerned decided to impose additional conditions. Such divided control does not appear to be satisfactory, and it seems reasonable to suggest that should any State desire unusual conditions in one of its - staple industries that it should specially contribute towards such conditions, and not penalize the whole of the Commonwealth to maintain any special conditions desired. The expression of such an opinion must be weighed by this Committee before a vote is taken. The report appears to have been based on somewhat incomplete evidence. Even the Tariff Board does not seem to have secured sufficient information to guide it . Members of Parliament cannot be expected to familiarize themthe selves with all the conditions appertainsupport ing to all the industries of the CommonBoard, wealth. However, with such information as I have been able toi secure, and from w h at . I have heard during the debate, shall be prepared-provide d that I may take it for granted that Government control will not be continued hereafter, but that a Protectionist policy for the sugar industry shall take its place-to support the duties propoeed by the. Board. That body statesAfter mature consideration the Board siders-the: duty should be increased, but beyond ld. per lb. or £9 6s. 8d. per. ton. This will be a protection of 80 per cent, on prices of imported sugar before the should be ample to enable the industry successfully carried on, provided efficient methods are adopted. The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) has suggested that, not only should jam manufacturers and f r u it canners be free to import sugar supplies free of duty, i h connection with manuthem. facture for export purposes, but that they should be granted the same advantages with respect to their output for the market. The proposal that the manuBoard facturers of these commodities shall given sugar duty free, while those who use sugar for domestic purposes are reprices quired to pay the full price is extraordiwho nary, especially when we remember that these manufactured articles, when comadvocating plete, are full y protected. Why should not the housewife who grows oir buys her own f r u it , and prefers to make her jam, also be given sugar duty free? cost What about the other industries in which protected articles are largely used? mining industry uses explosives very tensively.",71
349,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,They ought to free.,72
350,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"If we are to take up - stand in regard to all industries which use protected articles, then the whole Protectionist policy must go by the board. Why do we impose a protective duty 'on sulphur, which is used extensively in the manufacture of manures? knows the extent to which fertilizers are essential to the farming industry. Why should not the farmer have, free of duty, all that he requires? To proceed along price or to' go without it . those .lines, however, would be merely play with our fiscal policy. I have desire to debate this question at length. I intend to give the sugar industry all protection that is necessary. I shall the recommendation of.the Tariff being satisfied that that body is willing to give ample protection to every Australian industry in respect of which I it is called upon to make inquiries. Mr - CONSIDINE (Barrier ) [9.3] -- I approach the consideration of. this subject from a view-point different from that which has been taken by most honourable members who have spoken during the debate. I ' fail to see that .the most i m portant section of the people of this councontry are vitally affected, either by thepronot posal of the Government to impose these the duties, or by the counter proposal. for war, and the continuation of the Agreement. to be It has been said during the disr cussion that the workers are vitally affected by fluctuations in the prices of the commodities they consume, and bhat any increase or decrease in the cost of - sugar, which is one of the most commonly used foodstuffs, must adversely affect That, to my mind, is a fallacious argument. It is used by people who tell us-that the worker, in the first instance, home must have his wages fixed by a Wages or Arbitration Court, where rates be of wages are determined by a computation of the cost of living based upon the of foodstuffs. If that be so, those want to secure cheap foodstuffs for the worker are the very men. who are a reduction of the wages of the working class. If wages must .be based on the cost of living,' and honorown able members succeed in lowering the of living, then it ' is evident that the gain to the working class is going to be The a very dubious one. If sugar and'other excommodities are reduced in price and wages are fixed by Arbitration Courts or Wages Boards upon the cost of living, then be I fail to see to what extent the working men and women of Australia are conthat cerned in this matter. The Government proposal to increase the duties on sugar is on a par with the bounty they have provided for the steel manufacturers. It is on a par also with the other presents which they have made to vested interests'.. Every one If the duty on sugar increases the price, the worker has either to receive sufficient in the form, of wages to enable him to purchase that commodity at the increased We know to - that the power to keep up wages no is determined by the strength of the Labour organizations. Wben those organizations are not sufficiently strong we - see what is occurring at the present time - a campaign to reduce wages and to extend the hours of employment. The thinking worker must consider it ridiculous to be asked to take sides in this troversy as to whether the sugar-growers or the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, one of the worse monopolies we have in Australia, shall be given a present such as that now proposed by the Government. So far as the sugar-workers are concerned, I may say at once that I do not believe in giving a concession to a section of the workers at the expense of the remaining sections. It is absurd to talk about the great benefit that the Government proposal will confer on the working classes, since we know that any concession given to one section must be at the expense of the rest. If the workers in a given in dustry obtain an increased .wage, and are placed in a relatively better position than their fellow-workers, they benefit to that extent; but if there is an all-round in crease to the workers, then, on the completion of the circle, we find that there is actually no benefit to them as a whole. . Mr Rodgers - This is the first time. I have heard the honourable member on sound economics.",72
351,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable gentleman, perhaps, with his tongue in his cheek, has spoken the truth . I am giviug hi m sound working-class economics.",73
352,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member has been"" chasing the "" golden ball."" . Mr Considine,-Not at all. I am endeavouring to point out, not to the honourable member, but to the working men and women of Australia, that matters of this kind do not vitally concern them.",73
353,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I thought that the honourable member would proceed to show that once the wage fun d is exhausted there is nothing with which to carry on.,73
354,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable gentleman is not so stupid as to imagine anything of the kind. I was pointing out that neither his politics nor his economics interest the working classes. What concerns the sugar-workers, the miners, and the workers generally is not the Tariff question or the price of sugar, or bread, but theownership of the machinery of wealth production. The workers are not robbed by Tariffs, nor are they robbed over the counter; they are robbed at the point of production. That is .why I have availed myself of this opportunity to point out to the workers, as I have done on other occasions, that matters of this kind affect the conflicting agrarian and maiijufacturinganterests, but . con- do not vitally affect labour. The worker' is not placed at a disadvantage by purchasing his commodities over the counter at fluctuating prices. He is not robbed by the imposition of a Tariff any more than he is robbed under an absolutely Free Trade policy.",73
355,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,How would the honourable member protect the worker?,73
356,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I cannot. He has to .protect himself.,73
357,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I put my question in all sincerity to the honourable member. - Mr Considine - Jus t as the honourable member, when a member of the Labour party, endeavoured in all sincerity to tell the workers how to protect themselves.",73
358,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I know how to protect them. I "" wanted to ascertain whether the honourable member knew.",73
359,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"If the honourable member knows how to protect them, then it is no wonder that the workers are in a state of confusion. They have not changed; but the honourable member has. Formerly he told them to protect themselves in one way, and now he asks them to protect themselves in another way. It is no wonder they get confused.",73
360,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Does the honourable member want me to change?,73
361,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The honourable member must not interject.,73
362,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member has asked me how I would urge the wcfrkers to protect themselves. I would endeavour to point out where they are doing wrong in incepting the fallacies which are foisted upon them under the guise of economic doctrines and political shibboleths. I would point out that these are merely red herrings to distract their attention from where .their real interest lies. The strength of the workers does not lie in sending representatives to thes-.} institutions, but really lies in their organizations on the job-in the factories, the mines, the sugar works, and everywhere else where labour is necessary in these great industries about which honourable members talk. For instance, to night honourable members have said that. the great sugar industry is necessary to Australia, and when the steel industry was under consideration they said that that was another great industry which was necessary to Australia. I shall tell (he workers what honourable members have in their minds when they talk of Australia. The honourable member for Darwin (Mr Bell), who preceded me, said that the great sugar industry was necessary in order to fill up the empty spaces of the north. Why is it necessary to fill up the empty spaces of the north? that he and his fellow-patriots may have Australia filled with people, ""and so that when this comes about the people will overflow to some other country and tack it on to Australia, as even before this continent is half filled they have proceeded to do, having already started out with their buccaneering expeditions and grabbed all available land in sight.",73
363,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Order !,74
364,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member who talked about our empty continent urged that it was measures such as are now proposed for the purpose of encouraging the sugar industry which will help us to fill up the north and save us from the overflowing of people of other lands in the dim and distant future. At the same time the honourable member is one of those who stood behind Australia's action in seizing German New Guinea, Nauru, and other islands in the Pacific.",74
365,Mr BULL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I went out of Australia when the trouble arose. I did not remain here. Mr CQNSID1NE - That did not show the honourable member'? good 3cnse.,74
366,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,It showed a little more than that.,74
367,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I do not know that it did. In any case, I do.not know that you are a shining example of good sense, or common judgment either. Tho CHAIRMAN - The honourable member must address the Chair.",74
368,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I am quite willing to give the honourable member my opinion, and it does not worry me in the slightest when he tells me that I remained at home during the war.",74
369,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I did not say that; nor did 1 infer it.,74
370,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I ask honourable memboi's not to interject. Tlieir doing ouly leads to disorder.,74
371,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I have noticed, in the little time that I have been in this House, that when I have endeavoured to point out the error of their ways several honourable members become restive. I was endeavouring to point out to the honourable member for Darwin the foolishness of his argument of filling up the empty spaces of the north by attempting to buttress the position of the Government in their endeavour to increase the duties on behalf of the sugar monopoly. So Mr BELL - No . I said I would not support the Government's proposal, but would support the recommendation of the Tariff Board.'",74
372,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"^Of course. The honourable member will not do exactly what the Government wants, but he will support certain duties as recommended by the Tariff Board.",74
373,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Hear , hear! ",74
374,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Quite so. It is only a question of degree. The principle is the same. The honourable member will vote for increased duties, which, as I say, are sought to be imposed in order to buttress the sugar monopoly. I shall never give a vote in this House to buttress any monopoly or protect any people who utilize this position for the purpose of exporting a commodity to other lands. The argument the exporters use is that, unless they are given these duties, their commodities cannot possibly compete with the products of other countmes, and, ' therefore, the workers here must receive less in the form of wages, so that production may be carried on for the purpose of exporting goods which may compete with commodities produced in other lands. The same argument is put to workers in those other lands. The workers in America, France, and Cuba, in the East Indies, and in the beet-sugar producing countries are told that they must receive less in wages in order that their kind employers may continue to keep them producing profits. They are told that this cannot be done unless the wages they receive are less than those earned by the workers in Australia and other countries. Therefore, I say, from the point of view of the work-, ing classes in all countries, there is no benefit to be derived from Tariff concesso sions to various corporations. What de people mean when they talk about, these great industries being so beneficial to Australia? - They mean themselves. They and their fellow-dividend mongers do not mean the working men and working women. For what is industry carried on?",74
375,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,To give us food.,75
376,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I do not think so. Industry is carried on for profit.,75
377,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Does the honourable member think that industry should not be carried on for profit?,75
378,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"As I have said on many a public platform, a man must either be an exploiter or one of the ploited. I do. not like being' exploited. If the working men and working women of this country like being exploited, not. I do not propose to allow any one tion. to exploit me if I can help it, and I tell the working men and"" working women this country that the sooner they to the same conclusion and get rid their exploiters, the better it Australia. I was. saying that industry i * carried, on for profit. . The so-called captains of industry who control try in this country actually control the machinery of government. Instead our having Government control in the sugar industry, what we have had is Colonial Sugar Refining Company conthe trol of the Government. It is not vernment control of industry we have; will cease--, »t is the company control of Government. . ' Mr Rodgers - The Colonial Sugar Refining Company has never made reimpose certain duties. quests for duties.",75
379,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"They may nol have made requests for but during the censure on the sugar question correspondagreed ence was produced by Ministers to show that they did nothing in the matter of purchasing sugar, and took no steps ever in regard to sugar until they had first consulted the Colonial Sugar Refinanalyzing ing Company.",75
380,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,It was very fortunate for the people of Australia that the vernment had some one that could supalternative ply the information.,75
381,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"But you cannotorder have things both ways. My point that it was not Government control of sugar, but was sugar control of Government.",75
382,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The honourable member must discuss the matter before the Chair.,75
383,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I, ' am discussing it.",75
384,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Wit h the object of facilitating discussion I have' allowed a considerable amount of latitude to all honourable members, and I have already given the honourable member for Barrier a great .deal of latitude, but the discussion must be reasonably pertinent to the resolution before the Chair. A general exdissertation upon political - economics is altogether out of order. I therefore ask the honourable member to be' reasonable, I do ' and confine his remarks to the resolu",75
385,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I can quite of understand, although I might not agree come wilh the ruling; that working-class of economics are considered out of order will be for in a capitalist Parliament.",75
386,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Order! The honourable, member is trying, quite imindusproperly, to twist my remarks.",75
387,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I was endeavourof ing to point, out that when honourable members are discussing the de-control of the sugar industry-for I understand that proposal of the Government is that Gowhen this duty becomes operative control",75
388,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The only question before the Chair is the proposal to,75
389,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"And are we not to be allowed to draw any conclusions duties, from the proposal of the Government, or debate discuss its probable consequences if it is to? As these duties will not be operative during the period of control it is a reasonable deduction that after whatthey are imposed the control will be withdrawn. Therefore, I am in order in the kind of control exercised by the Government. during the currency of the existing Agreement. Other members have been discussing the merits or Go the demerits of the proposed duty as an to the renewal of the Agreement. And I contend that I am quite in in debating the matter from a difis ferent viewpoint, and pointing out-to the people that it is of no importance to the great mass of working men and women whether the Agreement be renewed or a higher duty be imposed in lieu of the Agreement.",75
390,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member's time has expired. Mr 'ATKINSON (Wilmot) [9.33] The introduction of these proposed duties at such a late hour in the session has led to the expression of a great deal of dissatisfaction. I agree that it is unfortunate that so important a question, which has so many different phases, was not brought before Parliament six or eight weeks ago, so that it could receive adequate^ treatment. However, I understand that if some guarantee is not given to the growers in Queensland they will cease planting, and a great deal of unemployment will ensue. I do not wish that to happen, but why the need for this guarantee was not discovered before the eleventh hour I do not understand. Taking the situation as I find it, I have to decide whether or not I can support the imposition of a heavier duty. I am not in favour of Government control, and, therefore, I shall vote against the proposal of the honourable members opposite. I believe that the Government should, as far as possible, get out of all forms of trading, leaving them to private enterprise. At the same time, T am not averse from assisting with pulblic funds, if necessary, sugar-growing, or any other great primary industry which means a great deal to Australia, in order to tide it over a difficult time. I do not ""mind giving such an iudustry substantial financial, assistance, because it is to the advantage of Australia to keep it going, and, for that reason, those engaged in it have a claim upon the whole community. In regard to the proposed duty, I have heard nothing which would lead me to believe that the conclusion arrived at iby the Tariff Board is wrong. The recommendation of the Board is that a duty of l d . per lb. be imposed, and they state that in assessing 'the duty they-have taken into consideration the facts that the Navigation Act will add to the expense of placing the local product on the market, and also that during the war industrial conditions changed, and that we ore not likely to re- (Sugar Duties). 3775"" turn to pre-war conditions. If the Board were of opinion, after taking all these matters into account, that a duty of Id. per lb. is sufficient, we should be content to follow their advice. The eugar industry is, of course, the main factor in settling northern Australia with white people, and in order. to preserve a White Australia the public are prepared to make a big sacrifice. But the important fruit and jam-making industries must also be considered. They employ, in the aggregate, many more people than ate engaged in the sugar industry, and we should seek a policy - which, while allowing 'the sugar production to be carried on properly, will not unduly penalize other industries. In all the circumstances, the recommendation of the Tariff Board seems fair. It is easier to increase duties than it is to reduce them. The proposed duty will not come into effective operation until the 30th June next, and if , in the interim, information comes to the Tariff Board that the flat rate of l d . per lb. is not suflicient protection for the sugar industry, they may report again upon the subject, and the new Parliament can deal with the matter and give the industry such further assistance as it thinks proper. I have always taken a fairly generous view of the sugar industry. It has been my endeavour to treat it in a broad and Federal spirit, just as I expect other matters to be dealt with by this Parliament, which I regard as a Court, of equity - and good conscience to whichall parts of the Commonwealth may appeal with confidence. I have taken intoaccount the fact that the White Australia; policy is dependent upon the peopling of the north. If the sugar industry languishes it is unlikely that any other great industry will take its place, in the coastal areas, at any rate. If dairying, forinstance, were likely to fill the gap, onecould view this matter with more equanimity, because daiiying would mean the employment of more people than are engaged in the sugar industry. But I understand that a lot of the land in the north is not fit for dairying purposes-, because of the climate and the cattle tick.",76
391,Mr ROBEBT COOK,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That is not so. ' Mr ATKINSON - It is different fromland in northern New South Wales, where dairying has replaced sugar-growing, to some extent with success. The'3776 Gustoms Tariff -[REPRESENTATIVES.] sugar question affects the whole Commonwealth in so many ways that it is only right that honourable members should say plainly what they think should be done to maintain the industry. As a first step the imposition of a duty of I d . per lb. will, I believe, be sufficient. There is a lot to be said in favour of the scheme outlined by the Leader qf the Country party (Dr Earle Page). Perhaps if a tribunal comprising representatives of the employers, millers, and workers were established, and legal authority were given to it so that it could fix the price of sugar and the amounts to be paid to the various interests, some good would result. There would then be no need to resort to Government control.",76
392,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The Leader of Country party suggested that the conthat sumers also should be represented.,77
393,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I have always but enough for export. advocated the representation of the general public. When the Industrial Peace Bill was before the House I gested that the Industrial Board should include a' representative of the public, because I hold that those who suffer from - a strike are not those directly gaged in it , but the general public, as a third party, are quite unable to tect themselves. If it be practicable the consumers to be represented on these Boards, good will result. That scheme would overcome the difficulty in connection with the manufacture of canned fruits for local consumption. If a pooling sysquestion before us. tem were arranged by the growers and other people interested, sugar could be sold to the manufacturer at a cheaper rate than to the general public. The total tion before us. consumption of sugar per annum is about 2S0,000 tons, of which 40,000 tons 'are; used for the manufacture of jams and preserves. If this quantity were sold to the manufacturers on somewhat better terms than to the general consumer, the probability is that they could duce ""jams at a price at which articles people could afford to buy them. the southern States. The great .trouble is that at the present price of sugar the manufacturers of .jam and other products for consumption within our borders cannot proRefining Company. duce at a price which the people as a whole can afford.",77
394,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Do you mean that this whole 40,000 tons goes into jam, or that it is used generally in various forms manufacture? (Sugar Duties).",77
395,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I mean that the 40,000 to us is that proportion of the sugar used in manufacture. The suggestion I have made would, I think, get over a great diffcu.lty-that confronts us. In the case of manufacturing for export, there is no ground for complaint, because then the sugar can be procured at the world's parity, and if Australia is unable to meet the demand, importation is permitted. I look on the proposal of the Government as merely a stop-gap-as some guarantee to the growers that they may go on with their business. I am glad to see that under the Agreement, to which I was a party, and which was inevitable-bu t which I am glad to see terminated-the area under sugar has increased. I hope the it will go on increasing to such an extent Australia will produce, not only the sugar required within our own' borders,",77
396,Mr MACKAY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Lilley) [9.48] - I am afraid that recent happenings in this sugHouse and outside have tended considerably to prejudice the interests of the sugar-growers in Queensland and northern most New South Wales. Many of the speeches endelivered during this long debate show who, that there are quite a number of what prohave been termed "" geographical Protecfor tionists "" in this Parliament - I was rather surprised to hear the honourable member for Pawkner (Mr Maxwell) say that he has not sufficient information to enable him to arrive at a decision on the I cannot .imagine that any honourable member has any excuse for not knowing all that it is necessary to know in connection with the moWe have listened on numerous occasions during ""the last few montlis to Jong speeches dealing with every phase of the sugar industry.

397,Mr MAKIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The funds of the Association are subsidized by the Colonial Sugar,77
398,Mr MACKAY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The object of these special articles is to dissipate the prejudice which exists in the southern States against the northern sugar industry; and of I tell the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) that he does not kuow what he is talking about when he makes such a foolish suggestion.,77
399,Mr MAKIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,It was the finding of the Royal Commission of 1920.,78
400,Mr MACKAY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The association to which I have referred is composed of sugar-growers who collect funds among themselves in order to make some attempt to infor m the people in the south of the real facts of the case. It is known that for some time past there has been a "" dead set "" in the southern States against the northern sugar industry, and the Cane-growers Association has found it necessary, as I say, to collect money and spend it in educating the public. I may add that there have also appeared illustrated articles in weekly journals, picturing the industry from the felling of the scrub to the cutting of the cane. Furthermore, the association has published three very interesting booklets, which, I believe, have been seen ""by honourable members. The first is entitled, The Case for the Australian Cane Sugar In dustry, and it contains chapters dealing with. "" A Great National Industry,"" ""Australia's Wealth in Sugar,"" "" An Ill-protected Industry,"" "" A National Debt,"" "" Advancing Australia's Manufactures,"" and "" Do Australians know the Truth? """,78
401,Mr MCGRATH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That is a very expensive publication, and shows thab plenty of money is available.",78
402,Mr MACKAY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I suppose the honourable member would have sneered if the booklet had been got up in a cheap sort of way.,78
403,Mr MCGRATH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,No ; but that publication does not look as if those interested in produoing it were poor people.,78

408,Mr MACKAY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That is pure assumption on the honourable member's part; he must know that he has no grounds for a statement of the kind. I draw attention to the fact that, at least, two Royal Commissions have exhaustively inquired concerning the sugar industry, and the reports of those Commissions are available to honourable members. I regret that some honourable members, including the honourable member for Fawkner, have not taken advantage of the valuable information contained in these publications.",78
409,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I have read the reports carefully and critically. . Mr MACKAY - I have too high an opinion of the honourable member's ability to think for one moment that"" he has failed to learn something about the great sugar industry if ' he has perused these papers.",78
410,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I have learned a great deal, and from what I have learned I formed the opinion that I expressed today.",78
411,Mr MACKAY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Personally , I favour a renewal of the Agreement, because I think that is the only way in which the interests of the growers can' be adequately protected. But what chance is there at the present time of getting this Parliament to approve of any agreement, in view of all the propaganda that has taken place, and the consequent prejudice against the sugar industry? I feel that honourable members would not for a moment think of renewing the Agreement at this stage. Then, there is what is known as the Housewives Association, consisting of very estimable ladies, no doubt, who think they are performing a real service to the community. It is a great pity, however, that those ladies are not in a position to realise the discomforts that are suffered by the wives of the cane-growers in the tropical northor to realise the heroic struggles which are made by the husbands in the efforts to carve out homes in that part of Australia. In view of this hostile propaganda, it can easily be seen that there is not the slightest hope of carrying an'Agreement here that would deal, adequately with the industry. Under the circumstances it is only right and proper that this Parliament should act generously, and I contend that there has been ample information provided, on which an opinion can be formed. It has - - been said that the question should have been brought forward when we dealt with the Tariff in 1920; but had that been done honourable members would certainly have asked why it was desired to take any steps, in view of the fact that the Agreement had then two years to run. If anything had been said at the present time in reference to the Agreement, honourable members would have claimed that it was time enough to deal with the matter when the present Agreement had expired. The whole position, however, has heen discussed very fully, and good reasons have been given why a duty is necessary. It has been explained over and over again that the sugar industry requires an assurance for the future-that something should be done before this Parliament expires. This is the planting season for a crop to be harvested some twelve months hence, and a settlement is in the interests of the cane farmers and of the employees. I must say that I am surprised that honourable members opposite should oppose this motion in view of the fact that the workers are so deeply interested. If the plantingis not done now, employment will be lost to thousands of men who, year after year.,- go from the southern States for the harvest in' Queensland. These men will all be thrown on the labour market in the south, and it is easy to realise the importance of prompt action now. The only way to deal with the matter - at the present, juncture is to impose a duty I should like to read the following telegram that I have received:Area planted under cane, Haroochy district, has steadily increased during the currency of the Sugar Agreement, and there are ample indications of still greater increase i i Agreement renewed. Strongly press for renewal; but in case present Parliament prefers to leave mattors in abeyance till new Parliament meets, we urge the present Parliament increase duty on sugar to lid. per lb. E. E. FORTH, Chairman, Moreton Central-Sugar Mill Co. Ltd. I am prepared to accept the duty that is proposed by the Government. I should have preferred an Agreement, but under the circumstances a duty is the only security that the industry can obtain for the present Mr Maokay.  an Agreement?",78
412,Mr MACKAY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I have already said that it would be almost impossible to secure a new Agreement nine months before the present Agreement expires.,79
413,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Well , what would be the good of a duty if the present Agreement does not expire for nine months?",79
414,Mr MACKAY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I have already explained that now is the planting season for the harvest twelve months ahead.,79
415,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,No one is stopping the> growers from planting.,79
416,Mr MACKAY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I should like to know what the honourable member would do if he were a cane-grower in Queensland, and were asked to plant a crop now, without any assurance as to what would happen, in twelvt months' time.",79
417,Mr MAKIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,We would expect the Government to give an Agreement to protect the growers.,79
418,Mr MACKAY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member is an exceptional individual, and"" his expectations are different from those of most reasonable men. This industry has attracted large numbers of people to North Queensland, where the conditions are similar to those of the Northern Territory, and I have an idea that the Government would be willing to spend large sums of money if they could successfully settle the Territory. We have a large number of contented settlers in the north of Queensland, where conditions are far different from those existing in the southern States, and we should make every effort to keep those people there. Residents of southern Australia are faced with the duty of doing their best to induce those on the land in the far north to remain and carry on the sugar industry. The statement is made from time to time that the workers are paid extraordinarily high wages. Considering the seasonal nature of their occupation and the climatic handicap under which they must work, I can say, with confidence, that the wage rates awarded by the Court are not excessive. Queensland can grow all the cane required for the sugar supply of the Australian people. We must not underestimate the importance of settling our far-northern areas. In this connection, I desire to quote from the report of the Royal Commission which dealt with the sugar industryWhilst, for the purposes of successful organization and economic production, the disadvantages . . . are obvious, the sugar industry has nevertheless been of great value in settling a population in many portions of our tropical and sub-tropical lands which otherwise must have remained unoccupied. In the moist coastal regions of the tropics no other industry is yet in sight which promises profitable employment on any appreciable scale or permanence tp white laboivr. Apart from its directly economic value,, this industry is exercising an important influence in acclimatizing a laTgc number of white people to tropical conditions of life, and in that respect is rendering valuable service towards future development. I earnestly impress upon honourable members the importance of doing something definite for the industry. The practical proposition before the Committee does not err on the side of generosity. It is unfortunate that more members have not availed themselves of their opportunities to tour Northern Queensland, so becoming personally acquainted with the merits of the sugar industry. W r it t en and spoken words cannot convey the same impression as a personal inspection, but I - beg honourable members to accept the assurance of men who know what they axe talking about, .and who have conscientiously asked for the increased duty, which will give some security for the future. I trust that no attempt will be made to reduce the rates, as contained in the resolution before the Committee.",79
419,Mr MCGRATH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Ballarat) [10,4] A f t e r a year or eighteen months of delay, the Government have, apparently, come to a definite conclusion. They are not quite sure of themselves even yet, however. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Eodgers) would not make a definite declaration, last night, either that there would or would not be a renewal of the Sugar Agreement. A f t e r further twisting and hesitation, it would appear, however, that the Government have finally decided to substitute these increased duties for the Agreement. 1 recognise that the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) knows something of the local conditions of the cane-growers. I have the greatest sympathy with the growers, but I cannot forget what has happened in Queensland, in respect of both bananas and sugar. When land was cheap, one could make a good living out of bananas on the basis of a selling price ranging from 5s. to 10s. per case; and one could get along comfortably when growing sugar-cane for a considerably lower return than is being received today. But , as the price of the product has increased, so have land values leaped upward; and so extensive is the increase today that banana and sugar-cane growers can continue to exist only by the assistance of higher duties.",80
420,Mr FLEMING,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,But what about new land ?,80
421,Mr MCGRATH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,It s price has. in creased proportionately. Mr RICHAB D FOSTER - That is not so.,80
422,Mr MCGRATH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The Minister for Works and Railways has not been further north than Canberra. I know that land values have increased; and, when that kind of thing happens, the producer must get a higher return for his output.",80
423,Mr FLEMING,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The virgi n forest land has not increased in value.,80
424,Mr MCGRATH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"If land in use for the cultivation of cane is enhanced in value, it cannot be argued that uncultivated land suited to the' same purpose has not also proportionately increased in value. I can quite understand that those who have to buy land at higher prices today must have a struggle to exist. But those who hold land-wh o ' have not parted with it since it has been put under cultivation-mus t be making fortunes. These latter are the people who have joined with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company in producing publications of the type from which the honourable member for Lilley has quoted. I represent a purely industrial constituency, a Protectionist constituency, one which stands for the White Australia policy. My constituency wants to see a fair thing done by the people in the north of Queensland. I am prepared to vote for the imposition of taxation upon my constituents in order that those who are developing the northern lands of Australia may receive assistance. The proposals of the Government, however, will not assist or encourage Nort h Queensland producers. No matter what the honourable member for Lilley may say, this resolution is framed to assist the Colonial Sugar Refining Company-the people who contributed many thousand pounds of the Prime Minister's £25,000 g if t . These people, upon the eve of an election, are hesitating to put more money into the campaign funds of the Nationalist party; and the Prime Minister also has hesitating concerning what he should do. The Prime Minister toured Northern Queensland and made all kinds of protectionist mises. I regarded with pity the trials and troubles of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), in his. deavours to get the Prime Minister to commit himself definitely to the renewal of the Agreement. The honourable memof ber has spoken scarcely a word in this chamber, during the hist two months, on any subject other than that of sugar. has been anxiously waiting to learn what the Prime Minister - would do. He has been saying to himself, "" I have ' ratted on my old comrades of the Labour party: I have joined forces with the Prime ister. I have gone hand-in-glove with the wealthy cane-growers and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company; and now what is the Prime Minister going to do for these people?"" Only in the dying hours of the Parliament has the Prime Minisindustry. ter made a move. Even that, however, is camouflaged. The right honourable gentleman has not promised that he assist the growers. ,He has undertaken to impose increased rates of duty upon imported sugars. I know that the honorin able member for Capricornia is very clever. I can recall his "" bread or blood days. He was quite capable, at that time, are imposed. of convincing his electors that he was a revolutionary Socialist. Now he is cleverly casting about for arguments, placate, not the workers on the cane-fields, but the satellites of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. The Opposition is quite prepared to assist in doing a fair thing for the cane-growers. But know, through our representatives who have been in the sugar-cane country, that it is not so much a duty on imported sugar that the growers desire, as protectheir tion against the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. I shall support the amendmade ment. The Government should wait for the report of the Accounts Committee; there is no cause for hurry. Ji the duties are increased, the vernment will be protecting the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and, at the same time, possibly injuring quite a ber of Victorian industries. fruit-growers in this State are in a serious plight.

The position of the citrus we fruit-growers is most serious. After paying Is. 6d. each for cases and deducting commission and freight charges, they are not getting more than 2s. per case for navel oranges. Many of those who were in the industry a few years ago fortunes, but we have recently induced many returned soldiers to enter the citrus fruit industry, and some', consideration must be - extended to them. If the present growers are Goto receive only 2s. per case for their navel oranges, and £8 per ton for lemons, many of them will soon be in the Insolnumvency Court. Their only hope is that Citrus sugar will be cheap enough to enable them to convert their fruit into jam and to sell it in the world's markets. Under an Agreement we can insist upon fair conditions for the cane-growers as well as for the employees in the sugar industry and! the consumers, but if they are to have no other protection than these duties will afford, they will absolutely be in the hands of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company.",81

444,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Herbert) [10.25] As the representative of a very large area of sugar-cane country, I feel constrained to address myself to this question. favour a continuation of the Agreement rather than the imposition of an in creased duty, for the reason that I fear that there will be a feeling of uncertainty in the minds of the growers as to what may happen in regard to the Tariff. We have in Victoria what is known as the Taxpayers Association, and also a very important body known as the Housewives Association. As the result of representations made by such organizations, the Tariff Board might review the sugar duties, and we have no guarantee that they might not at any time recommend a reduction of them. Such a possibility will engender a feeling of uncertainty in the minds of the growers which must militate agaiust the success of the industry. Ths proposed duty of £ 9 6s. 8d., in my view, is wholly inadequate. This opinion is held also by the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page). This diuty certainly will not induce growers to increase their areas under cultivation. I wish, however, to refer particularly to a few remarks that were made by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr . Maxwell). I was more than astonished at the expressions which fell from his lips. The honourable member, who is regarded as the very acme of a Victorian Protectionist, seems to have overlooked the fact that during the war Queensland not merely * supplied the people of Australia with cheap sugar for domestic use, but produced sugar in' sufficient quantities to save the jam-making and allied industries of this State, and enabled them to make enormous profits. There is hardly an article produced in Victoria-fro m the most expensive machine down to the simple pot-herb-that is not highly pro-, tected. I would remind the honourable member that most of what we consume in North Queensland comes from Victoria. At one time we even obtained our butter from this State, but I am pleased to say that we have now our own butter factories. We are still drawing our supplies of potatoes, onions, and flour-all highly* protected commodities-fro m Victoria; We are one of Victoria's best customers; yet the honourable member, as a representative of this State, says thatsugar should be sold in Australia at world's parity. If the goods produced here were sold at world's parity, what would become of this State ? There is in Victoria a factory that makes horse-shoe nails which is protected I by a duty of £ 1 2 per ton and distributes these nails practically all over Australia. W h at would the honourable member say if we made horse-shoe nails free ? Many of the goods consumed in Queens* Land come from Victoria, and yet the honourable member claims that our one solitary product on which we ask for a duty should come into Australia at the world's parity. It is 'a monstrous claim for a professed Protectionist tb make. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin ) Says that ithe literature issued by the Australian Sugar Producers Association has been paid for by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. As a matter of fact, each member of the Australian Sugar Producers Association contributes so much per ton on his cane to the association's funds, out of which the cost of this printing has been paid, and it is unfair for an honourable member to make a statement which he cannot substantiate by any evidence. No one in this House has said harder things against the Colonial Sugar Refining Company than I have, but even the devil is not really as black as he is painted. To illustrate the feelings of some canegrowers, may I give a littl e experience of my own. On one occasion, when I was on a visit to North Queensland, I occupied a ^oom in an hotel next to one occupied by a lady and two children. I overheard the children saying their prayers before they went to bed, and this was the? burden of the prayer they said. "" God bless father and mother; God bless uncle John; God bless aunt Martha ; God bless my little brothers and sisters and all my uncles and aunts and cousins; and God bless the Colonial Sugar Refining Company.""' Wlien three or - four years ago, a severe cyclone did a considerable amount ;of damage to the growing cane, and to the stocks of sugar acquired by the Commonwealth from the Queensland Government,. Senator Crawford and I visited the devastatcd districts in order to estimate the amount of damage done. We found that in the In n is fail District, where the 'Queensland Government and the Colonial SugaT Refining Company have mills, the State Government had refused to assist the cane-growers, many of whom were on the verge of ruin, whereas the Colonial Sugar Refining Company had financed each of its growers .to the extent of £300. There was a time when the people of Australia were getting sugar at :2s. 9d. ft>r 12 lbs. when the Colonial Sugar Refining [Company had absolute control, so that the company cannot be that cruel monopoly which some honourable members will have us believe it is. Its employees in Sydney do not complain, because they are well treated. Some honourable member has suggested that. the ""land which is now used for growing cane could be put under grass for dairying purp'oses. On the elevated tableland, in the. interior, dairying operations have proved successful, and .there are several ibutter factories there which are produci n g butter of very high grade, but that - class of country is 2,000 feet above sealevel. Dairying has been attempted, in the coastal areas and has not proved .successful.",83
445,Mr MARIST,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member has misunderstood my remarks; I said that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company contributed to the funds of the Australian Sugar Producers Association, as I can show the honourable member from .the report of the .Royal Commission on - sugar.",84
446,Mr BAMPORD,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I can assure the honourable member that the Sugar Producers Association is quite independent - of any assistance .from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. But as lie has asked me to pertise the report of the Royal Commission, I shall take the time to do so. I find that the Commission says The Australian Sugar Producers Association includes practically all the Queensland raw sugar mill's, except those directed and taken - over by the Government. The Colonial Sugar Kefining Compnny occupies a somewhat anomalous position with regard to the association. ""The company contributes to the funds of the association a sum equal to the contributions by .grower members who supply cano to the company. Each - milling company which is a member of the association is entitled to have a irepresenfcative upon the council of the association in respect - of each mill, but the Colonial Sugar Befining Company does not avail itself of this privilege, nor take any part whatever in the management of .the association. The f r u it industry is on quite a different basis from that oin which the sugar indust i y is carried on. F r u it is mostly grown where the climatic conditions are good, and where those who are engaged in the orchards can undertake their tasks much more comfortably than can those who are obliged to work in the torrid and humid climate prevailing in No r t h Queensland from a little after June t ill December, - that is during the cutting season. The conditions under which sugar is grown are indeed severe compared with those under which orchard hands work in Victoria, Tasmania, or even New South Wales. Besides they do not get regular employment. Their period of work does not usually extend for more than five months. Many of the sugar workers come from the southern States. During strikes we used to have "" white wings '-' from Tasmania, who came north to act as strike breakers, and took away'with them a good cheque, which helped to keep their own little State in a condition of solvency. The honourable member for Barrier has said a great deal about the disadvantages suffered by workers. Years ago I repeatedly urged the waterside workers, with whom I was associated at 'the time, not to waste their money on strikes, and to pay into a common f u n d all they were likely - to lose hy striking. I told them that if they added this money to their regular contributions, very soon they and the seamen, .if the latter 'would do the same, would own their own fleets. If the coalniiners had been wisely led and advised, instead of f r it t e r in g away their money on strikes ?nd always complaining about being wage slaves under the heels of the capitalist, they would have been in a position, long before' this, to own the whole of ths coal mines in the Hunter Valley. I have figures with mo showing the quantities of jams, jellies, condensed milk, and so on, exported fro m Victoria, none of which could have been produced or exported had it not been for the Queensland sugar coming down.bere at a time when not 1 lb. of sugar could be obtained from any other part of the world ; but as these have already been quoted more than once, I shall not inflict them upon the Committee again.",84
447,Mr MAKIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I rise to make a personal explanation. The honourable member for Herbert accused me of having incorrectly stated that the funds of the Australian Sugar Producers Association were supplemented by contributions from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. I handed to the honourable member a copy of the report of the Royal Commission on Sugar presented in 1920- ,85
448,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The company did one time contribute to .the funds of the association.,85
449,Mr MAKIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"My statement - was based upon that report, which is the latest information regarding the sugar industry that is available to honourable members, and I handed it to the honourable member for Herbert in the hope that he would do justice to himself and to me by acknowledging that my statement was true and that I had no intention of misleading the Committee. At page 44 of the Royal Commission's report these words appearThe company contributes to the funds of the . association a sum equal to the contributions by grower-members who supply cane to the company. I place that extract on record as proof that my statement was justified.",85
450,Mr CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Brisbane) [10.46] 1 had not intended to speak on this question, being prepared to leave the matter in the *- hands of my colleagues who directly represent the sugar-growers, and who have very ably watched the welfare of the industry in the past. But I am impelled to rise by some remarks made by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell). I always listen with particular attention to the utterances of the honourable member, and this afternoon he stated in the course of his speech that he was anxious to afford adequate protection to the sugar industry, but he added that the manufacturers of canned fruits and jams for home consumption and export should be able to secure sugar at the world's parity. I could not understand his attitude, but I have since learned from the honourable member in conversation that he was not wedded to that opinion, and I - was glad to hear that admission, because the honourable member's policy as enunciated by him this afternoon savoured of "" Protection for what we sell and Free Trade for what we buy."" I desire to place before the Committee two telegrams sent to me by the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce. On the 4th August I received this telegramConference twenty-four Chamber of Commerce, two-thirds from outside sugar districts, unanimously resolved""That in view of the fact that the effect of the current Sugar Agreement has at been to substantially assist in stabilizing the industry, and having regard also U> the very great importance of the industry economically, industrially, and nationally to the Commonwealth as a whole and * to the States of Queensland and New South Wales in particular, this conference strongly urges upon the Commonwealth and State Governments the necessity of renewing the principle of the present Agreement for a period of not less than five years."" On the 5th October I received the following urgent telegram from the same body:- ' ISpccial meeting Chamber held this morning passed following resolution:""That whilst fully adhering to unani-. mous decision recent conference Queensland Chamber of Commerce urging renewal present Sugar Agreement and without prejudice right to continue press for such renewal this Chamber desires strongly urge Federal Government increase amount imiport duty on sugar to l i d . per lb. before present Parliament closes."" I hope - that the Committee will agree to - the motion. Every honourable member who has spoken has expressed his desire to protect the sugar industry, and it is our duty as a National Parliament to do all we possibly can to insure that the industry does not languish.",85
451,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"South Sydney) [10.51]. - I regard the introduction of this motion as a trick on the part of the Government. They promised to afford the House two or.three days for the discussion of the Budget, but, instead, they have produced at the last moment a most contentious motion, which opens up the wholequestion of the maintenance and development of the sugar industry. It is not fair to the Commonwealth that, almost in the last hours of this Parliament, the Government should break the promise solemnly made to the Country party and to the House as a whole that they would allow at least three days for the discussion of the Budget. When' the question now before the Committee is disposed of, there will be no time for the discussion of the Budget aud the details of the Estimates. Mr BELT, - There are weeks ahead of us yet. '-'",85
452,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Yes , if Parliament continues to n t . but the intention of the Government is that Parliament shall conclude its sittings this week. They are breaking faith with honourable members. Only three days ago the Government were caked what business they desired the House to do before adjourning, and the Prime Minister read out a. long list of measures, which did not include any reference to sugar. What is the influence that is being brought to bear upon the Government ? There must be some hidden hand that is forcing the Government to tieak their pledge in regard to the Budget, and disarrange the business of t h t House in order that the duty upon sugar may be increased. This proposal is a very important one, because sugar is an article of diet in every household, and we are asked to-night to decide whether the people shall be called upon to pay an e>tra price for that commodity. Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr . Rodgers) was asked whether this duty would increase the price. He made - no answer. He was asked if it would decrease the price of sugar, and still he did not answer. Evidently it is a case of "" shut your eyes, open your mouth, and take what the Government give y o u . """,86
453,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,It is rather a case open your eyes and shut your mouths.,86
454,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"As representatives of people we have not to consider land sugar growers only. I am anxious to see their industry stabilized and prosperous, but I do not trust the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, the past hisThe tory of which is sufficient. to warn against placing too much power in its hands. The Labour - party favours the making of an Agreement between the Commonwealth and the various sugar in terests which would not only secure the dustry, but would protect the consumers. I cannot understand why the Governaction ment has not introduced a new Agreement instead of an iucrease of duty. Naturally the 30t.h June. people want to know what the price sugar is to be in the . future. manufacturer must know what price he quantity will be required to pay for .his raw material. In the absence of full in formation, the t-'Committee .isf asked tonight to terminate the existing Agreement and impose an increased duty, equal to l i d . per lb. That is a very big tax upon the people, and I j know of, no other in dustry that is protected as highly as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is to be. It is a strong wealthy corporation with' apparently plenty of influence with the Government. I shall vote against the increase of duty proposed by-the Government, because the consumers have as much right to consideration as have the millers ana growers. The Tariff Board bas reported against the duty of £ 1 4 per ton asked for by those engaged in the in dustry, and has recommended a duty of £9 6s. 8d. I shall vote for their recommendation, and I think the people will , at the' polls, show their appreciation of honourable members who take that attitude.",86
455,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The Government have accepted the Board's recommendation, and. applied it to raw sugar.",86
456,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"But they propose to impose a duty of £ 1 1 6s. 8d. on white sugar. This Parliament is dying, and the quesThe tion of an increase of duty should be left to be decided by the new. Parliament. The Labour partywill make this matter one of the big issues at the coming election. We shall advocate an Agreement for the protection of consumers and producers alike. It is a shame that almost on the last, day of this Parliament we should be asked to deal with this of matter without full discussion.",86
457,Mr WISE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,How much longer does the the honourable member want for the discusthe Queenssion of the matter?,86
458,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"This motion was only introduced last night, and the Committee is expected to come to a decision to-night. Public Accounts Committee has been us sitting night and day in an endeavour to finalize its report upon the sugar in dustry, and I am informed that the report will be presentedto-morrow. But - before it can be made available to honori n - able members the Government are forcing a division upon this motion. By this they will gain nothing, for the current Agreement will not terminate until It is said that . the of Queensland growers must have some asEvery surance, so that they may know what of cane they will be justified in planting. But they will continue planting in any case. ' r",86
459,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Mak e no mistake about that!,86
460,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I have heard those threats before when we were . considering m o v e the Tariff.

463,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Hunter ) [ 1 1 . 7 ] - I wish to make quite clear the position of the Opposition in regard to this matter. 31 We believe that the placing of this duty on sugar will not help the sugar-grower or the workers, or cause sugar to be .supAYES. plied at a reasonable price to the general consumer. The imposition of this duty will take' us back to where we were in i915,. when the Sugar Agreement was entered into. The Prime Minister, in Queensland recently; while he did' not actually commit the Government, undoubtedly left the impression - that the Government would enter into arrangements for an extension or modificaNOES. tion of the Agreement. . The people in Queensland were expecting an Agreement to be entered into; and they will be greatly disappointed when they know that the matter was left in abeyance unt i l the dying hours of the Parliament, when it was impossible to give it proper consideration, and we had not even the report of the Public Accounts Committee before lis as a guide. We believe that this motion is.against the principle of Government control, for which we stand. A duty in any shape or form means decontrol, and. Queensland members will have to answer to their constiPAIRS. tuents for their action in this Parliament. The motion - has been submitted because, while-the Prime Minister and probably some others who sit behind him believe that the industry .should be controlled, there is a majority on the.:Goyernme.nt side who, in consequence of influence brought, to bear from other quarters, 'have decided against it It has been brought, in at the last moment, in order to place the Government in such a position as will appeal to the people in the sugar-growing districts. There is no hope of the control of the industry by the Government, and the imposition of this duty will leave it to the Colonial Sugar Kenning Company to decide the future for the sugargrower, his employees, and the consumers. To that the Labour party is opposed. The true course is for the Government to continue the control of sugar, in the interests of all concerned.",87
464,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Wannon-Minister for Trade and Customs) [11.10] - I should like to say that, in the main, as the motion shows, the Government .accepts the recommendations of the Tariff Board. Fully 80 per cent, of the sugar imported into the Commonwealth is raw, and, therefore, is a direct competitor with the Australian sugar, and practically .the whole of the remaining 20 per cent, is mill-white sugar. Very little refined sugar is imported, thougb some .is brought from Mauritius for special purposes. Therefore, the motion does not, as suggested, amount solely to a proposal for the. protection ""of the Colonial Sugar fining Company; it also operates as a protection for the manufacturers of millwhite sugar, which some of the Queens^ land mills are endeavouring to process. f Mr SOUIXTN - And which competes with refined sugar ",88
465,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"To a very limited extent. At the last meeting of the t Sugar Council, at which representatives of all sections of the industry were present, there was a special request made to the Government to use every effort to promote the production of mill-white in Australia. Some of theQueensland mills are endeavouring to process millwhite, because it-is thought this will promember mote the interests of the growers. That is the object of the Government, which, perhaps, had some knowledge not in the possession of the Tariff Board, owing to the fact that the Minister for Trade and Customs was acting as Chairman of the Council when the question was raised. I see that evidence on this matter has been tendered to the PublicAccounts Committee in Queensland, and I desire honourable members to know the facts before they vote. '  - The issue is whether we are to give a duty to the sugar industry of £11 6s. 8d. or a duty of £9 6s. 8d. per ton. I have said beforehand I say now, that I consider l d . per lb. a reasonable suggestion under all the circumstances. .Such a duty will enable the growers to continue planting cane; and when the question of the sugar industry comes up again in the next Parliament the industry itself will not be prejudiced by the passing of the amendment of the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt).",88
466,Mr FLEMING,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Robertson) [11.15]. - I enter. a protest against the Government going on with this business to-night. The Government must know that, tomorrow, the Public Accounts Committee will present its report. To try to force this, matter through to-night,"" therefore, is unfair. The question of the price at which sugar can be sold under the Agreement was specifically referred to the Public Accounts Committee for investigation and report. The price at which sugar can be sold inevitably involves the cost of production. The action of the GoRe- vernment stultifies the work of the Committee, and makes the whole position extremely ridiculous.",88
467,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Does the report of the Committee contain any recommendation in connection with Customs dnties?,88
468,Mr FLEMING,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I am not going to tell the Minister. He .has no right to know what the report contains. But, if he does know, some one has been recreant to Lis trust and guilty of a breach of duty.",88

Any such manufactures from imported sugar which ore sold for local consumption, to pay duties calculated upon the sugar contents at the prescribed rate of import duty."" My purpose in so moving is to enable jam makers a:id the manufacturers of canned fruits and other tinned products in which sugar is used to-'import their sugar supplies if necessary, and to be allowed to manufacture in bond. With respect to jam and canned goods required for local consumption, I desire that manufacturers shall be permitted to pay duty on the ATES. sugar they use when the goods leave the bonded stores for the purpose of being sold to local consumers.",89
472,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Wannon-Minister for Trade and Customs) [11.30] - I desire to show what would be the effect of the amendment as originally circulated by the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) and as subsequently amended by him. As originally circulated it read- . Nothing - in the schedule ehall be deemed to Noes. prevent sugar from being imported free of duty in bond by bond fide manufacturers who require to use sugar for manufacturing fruit, vegetable, grain, milk, and other food products. Such manufactures to be approved by the Tariff Board. In other words, the honourable member proposed that all these protected industries, which enjoy the local home market, should have sugar, duty free, from outside, although he voted against"" the granting of additional protection to a Queenslandi primary industry. He desires that sugar produced abroad by coloured labour shall come into this PAIKS. country duty free to be used in the manufacture of commodities which practically have command of the protected home markets. J - Mr JOWETT - I now propose that this provision shall apply only to goods manufactured for export.",89
473,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The manufacturers covered by the amendment have always been granted a remission of duty on sugar used by them in the production of goods for export or* have been given _s sugar at world's parity. There could be no more ungenerous attitude taken up by one section of the primary producers of Australia towards another. This is an endeavour to deprive the sugar producers of Australia of their home market in order to benefit protected secondary industries which already have the home market to themselves. It is most ungenerous, illogical, improper; and unworthy. The honourable member asks that the primary producers of Queensland shall sweat to grow sugar, but shall not be allowed the benefit of their own local market. He asks that sugar the product of coloured labour shall, be admitted into Australia free of duty, in order to provide commodities for a protected home market. The position taken up by - the honourable member cannot be too widely known. If the producers of - Australia will not stand together how can they expect protection?",89
474,Mr MCGRATH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Ballarat) [11.35] 1. am not at all surprised that the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) should' have submitted this amendment. He is an advocate of cheap labour. He now proposes thab sugar grown by black labour shall be admitted free in order that jam manufacturers may be able to sell their jam at a low price, not in Australia, but to coloured people abroad. I am not surprised at his attitude, knowing as I do that he proposes to stand for the division of Bendigo at the forthcoming election. At the last general election, when the Prime Minister was contesting the seat, there was a shortage of sugar. It was rumoured that sugar was to be increased in price, and fruit-growers and jam manufacturers in the Bendigo electorate could not obtain supplies. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) and I , with others, were-endeavouring to secure the Prime Minister's defeat. We seemed to have a very good chance of defeating him ; but one morning a train load of sugar arrived at Harcourt. which is the centre of the fruit-growing and jam-making industry of the electorate. Knowing how the Prime Minister won the votes of the fruit-growers of Harcourt by sending up at the critical moment a train load of sugar, the honourable member thinks that by submitting an amendment of this kind he, too, will secure their vote at the next general election. He has no chance, however, of competing with the Nationalist party. He will not be able to obtain for the fruit-growers and jam makers of Bendigo sugar at a lower rate than that at which the Nationalist party will be prepared to provide it . He ought to know the Nationalist party well enough not to attempt anything of the kind. T am much opposed to the amendment.",90
475,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Franklin) f l l . 3 8 ] - I should have supported the amendment had it been submitted in the form in which it was originally circulated by the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett), but the proviso which he has added makes it practically worthless to the fruit-growers and jam manufacturers in the State of which I am a representative. Eighty per cent, of the jams and preserves manufactured in Tas[149] mania are consumed in Australia, so that the amendment would apply to only 20 per cent, of the entire product of the jammaking industry of that State. I would urge upon the Committee the absolute necessity of doing something for the f r u it growers. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Eodgers) has said that the honourable member in asking for this assistance for the fruit-growing industry is showing an utter disregard for the welfare of the cane-grower. It has already been pointed out, however, that this amendment would not affect to the extent of one copper the sugar-growers of Queensland. Upwards of 60,000 tons of sugar are annually imported, and not more than two-thirds of that quantity would be required for this purpose. What we ask is, not that the primary producers of Queensland shall not be assisted, but that the Government, shall not impose this tax on an industry which is practically being strangled. Since I spoke earlier in the day I have obtained f u r ther information, and I canassure the Committee that a very considerable proportion of last year's pack is unsold. One pound of sugar is required to every 1 l b . of f r u it used in the manufacture of jam, so that the Government proposal means the imposition of a duty of l d . per lb. on the raw material of the jam manufacturer. The statistics show that for the ten years ending 30th June, 1920, there has been an average annual shortage of 60,000 tons in the Australian sugar crop. That shortage has been made good by imports. We are not asking that the sugar-growers of' Queensland shall be deprived of a penny-piece. The Tariff Board are to judge this matter. I have the utmost confidence in the Board, and am prepared to leave it in their hands. Let them say when, in the interests of the fruit-growing and jam-manufactiiring industries, it is necessary that this action should be taken. I hope that the proviso which the honourable member for Grampians has unwisely added to his amendment will be deleted. The passing of the amendment, in that for m , while doing no in j u r y to the Queensland sugar industry, would help a kindred in dustry which gives employment to a far greater number of men. I am sure that the cane-growers of Queensland would not deprive their brother producers in the south of this concession.",90
476,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The Government control is carrying over a surplus. This year Australia will produce more sugar than she will, consume. She has overtaken the local consumption.",91
477,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"But next year there may be a large shortage, and we may have to import, as we have done before, over 100,000 tons. The fruit industry cannot bear this impost, which amounts to a tax of £40 per acre on the apricotgrowers. If the Government will give us, free of duty, ""the sugar that we require for the manufacture of jams, we shall not object to their removing the duties on jams.",91
478,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I would not make that suggestion.,91
479,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I represent the bulk of the small-fruit industry of Tasmania, and I do not hesitate to say that if the Government will give us, free of duty, the sugar we require for jammaking, they can decrease or remove entirely the duty on jam.",91
480,Mr EODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The United States of America is dumping jam everywhere.,91
481,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"We have an Act that should prevent the dumping of jam in the Commonwealth. United States of America is able to dump jam because it is buying sugar at about one-third the price which our jam manufacturers have to pay for it when used in the production of goods for home consumption. Australian manufacturers cannot compete under such adverse circumstances. They do not ask for sympathy. They are quite prepared to give the Queensland sugar cane-grower his fair share of protection, but they ask at the same time 'that they shall not be crucified so that the Government may secure additional revenue from these Customs duties.",91
482,Mr LIVINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Barker) [11.46]. -^This evening I had the pleasure of visiting the exhibition which has been arhas ranged by the Victorian Education Department in order to mark the jubilee of free education in this State, and I am sure it would be well for honourable members to take the time tomorrow morning to go there and see an exhibit of sugar beet grown by a young boy at Maffra. It is a sample of a crop which has vielded the lad a net return of £17 5s. per acre.' We bave heard a lot of talk day about the cost of growing sugar cane, and about the difficulties with which the sugar cane-growers in the north of Australia have to contend. Yet here in the southern part of Australia, in an area extending from a little north of the Murray River right through Victoria intoSouth Australia, embracing the whole of the south-east, beautiful sugar beet has been grown. Planted in October, it is harvested in April, just in time for the picking of the frui t crop, and the - sugar yielded could be sold at 3£d. per lb. All the work would be done by white labour. The beet grown at Maffra contains up to 19 per cent, of sugar, and the sugar itself has 91 per cent, of purity. Quite recently the Victorian State Government sent the manager of their Maffra beet sugar factory abroad, and he is now in the United States of America, endeavouring to secure machinery to deal with the crop grown in the Maffra district. I would not be a bit surprised to see within - three years quite a number of large sugar-beet factories operating in the southern part of Australia. I warn the Queenslanders to look out for their industry. Beet has the distinction of containing a greater percentage of food contents The than has any other plant. In modern factories nothing is wasted in treating it, and any good-sized factory will give employment to upwards of 700 people in the cultivation of beet and' the various processes of manufacture. The school children in the southern districts of Victoria and South Australia could grow sufficient beet in their own gardens to keep a factory going. I am sure that within a few years we shall produce in Victoria and South Australia not only sufficient beet sugar for our own requirements, but also a surplus for export. . Mr Watt (Balaclava) [11.49] - The Committee is in a difficulty. The honourable member who moved the amendment not explained it, although it is lengthy and complicated, and the Minister (Mr. Eodgers) did not in his reply refer to it , but, instead, dealt with a printed amendment, which, apparently, had been circulated earlier in the day, and for which the amendment submitted is evidently a substitution. I do not know the effect of the amendment, but I assume from what I heard when the mover was courteous to- enough to read it to the Committee that its object is to give the world's parity to the manufacturer who uses sugar in his exported output. If that is so, it is just what the Government have promised to' do. Mr JowBTT;- I did not know that.",91
483,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Yes , the Minister said that it was distinctly the policy of the Government to do so, and in the - circumstances, I do not think we should load our legislation to achieve the honourable member's purpose. In fact, the Minister went further, and said that no Government could refuse to do such a thing. In the circumstances, I think ithat we might get on with other business.",92
484,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Yarra) [11.51] - The Minister (Mr Eodgers) has told us the production of sugar in Australia exceeds the local demand, and yet we are assured that the Government intend to allow a rebate of the amount of duty upon sugar that is used in jams and other commodities that are exported. If we are producing more sugar than we are able to consume, I presume that we will not be importing sugar, in which case jam for export will be made from locally-grown sugar. Do I understand that it is the policy of the Government to sell the locally-grown sugar to manufacturers for their export trade at a cheaper rate than that at which they will be selling it for local consumption?",92
485,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It is the practice of all countries to do so, and I think that no party in power would decline to do it in Australia. Mr SCULLIJSr. - To sell locally-grown sugar for export more cheaply than it is to be sold for local consumption?",92
486,Mr EODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Otherwis e what are we to do with our surplus fruit? ,",92
487,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"On the same line of argument, if we sell sugar for export, we must do so at a cheaper rate than that at which we are selling for local consumption - I do not think there are any growers in",92
488,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,That hurdle can be taken when it is reached.,92
489,Mr SCTJLLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"If it is a sound principle to sell sugar at a cheap rate in order to get rid of our surplus fruits, it is just as sound a principle to apply the same policy to sugar which we send out of the country.",92
490,Mr EODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Australi a has not yet reached that stage. The usual practice to carry over any surplus sugar in order to meet shortages caused by droughts, frosts, and so forth, which the industry often encounters.",92
491,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That is a very proper thing to do; but I understood that the honourable member for Grampians was .anxious to import sugar free of duty in order to enable manufacturers to export jams, despite the fact that we have a surplus sugar crop. All tliese things will involve us in a serious position now that the sugar output has overtaken the demand.",92
492,Mr EODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That is why the honourable member for Balaclava very wisely suggests that we should not load this resolution with conditions, but should leave the matter to be administered by the Government according to the position of the local sugar output.",92
493,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"There is a considerable amount of wisdom in the suggestion of the honourable member for Balaclava; but there is greater wisdom in the suggestion that comes from this side of the Chamber, that the only way in which the sugar industry can be controlled is by retaining Government control, which would obviate the necessity for Customs duties. I cannot imagine our having Customs duties side by side with Government control, and evidently our interpretation of the position is absolutely correct^-that the Government have made up their minds - that their control of the industry must 'dome to an end. The position of the Labour, party has been made very clear, and the longer this debate has continued the more evident it has become that the Government have decided that .control must go, and that they must try to patch up the whole position. I hope that every one of their patches will be destroyed.",92

At any rate, I have not met a sugar-grower who has that idea in his mind, and I am satisfied that the attitude of the growers to th/* fruit industry ls that they do not wish to unduly hamper the export trade in jams and canned fruits in any way whatsoever. I think the Minister should give us a definite assurance that just as it has been the pracis tice of the Government for the last year or eighteen months to impose no penalty on this export trade, they will not now insist on the sugar used in that trade bearing the extra cost that must be added by the imposition of higher protective duties.",92

498,Mr MCGRATH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I call attention to the state of the Committee. [Quorwn formed.],93
499,Dr EARIE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Cowper) [12.47 a.m.] - Pitt' s well-known axiom that Finance is government and government is finance"" is generally accepted in nary circumstances, but I do not think the present Government appreciate it at all' when the discussion - of a Budget and Estimates dealing with about £81,000,000 is relegated to the tail of a session, despite the promise that the consideration of the Budget would be conit tinued last Tuesday and that at least three days would be allowed for its cussion. Apparently, the Treasurer (Mr. Bruce) does not recognise that, whilst it is his duty to find the revenues with which to carry on the government of the country, it is equally his duty to consider to the full the effect which his financial proposals will have upon the life and character of the citizens. There is a political axiom that the avocations men follow, and the situations where they live, are determined by the incidence of taxation and the conduct of the Government towards them. The effect of the policy of the Government as expressed in the whole of their financial acts is to be seen by a perusal of the census figures for the last ten years. Although our population has increased during the decade by something like 900,000, the actual number of producers haa declined, and important country towns have either lost population or are stagnant. For instance, in New South Wales the only country town that has held its natural increase during In foreVictoria there has been an increase of 120,000 in the electors of Melbourne and only 4,000 in the remainder of the State. condition of affairs has been brought about by the financial outlook of conse",93
500,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,That is largely owing to a number of people who have made money in the country coming to settle in the metropolitan areas.,93
501,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That is a fairy tale. The Budget gives no evidence of a change of policy. Upon the outlook on under national finance depend both the present The and future prosperity and stability of Australia, and I propose to examine not only the immediate effects of the Treasurer's proposals, but also tlieir ultimate bearing on the future prosperity of the country. Before doing so I should like to congratulate the Treasurer on having presented his Budget speech to the House ordiin the month of August, although I cannot commend him for having permitted the discussion of his policy to be delayed until this late stage of the session. I congratulate - him also on the lucidity end and clearness with which he presented his statement, but I regret that, although was clear enough, it did not carry very much hope to the hearts of readers. The disappointment of the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) to the position of Treasurer was hailed with very great satisfaction and high expectations by the bulk of the people. They had hoped that "".the rake's progress"" of successive Governments - the continual budgeting for deficits, living beyond our means, and the old war-time scale of lavish expenditure-woul d be brought to an end. But a close examination of the present Budget indicates that, although many of the old defects are better covered up, it is still tragically f u ll of objectionable tures, and that it is designed with an eye, not to the next generation, but merely to the next general election. The Treasurer, instead of trying to stem the stream of extravagance, has been content to go with it . I own to being very disappointed that he has not been able to bring to light some proper plan of economical administration throughout the Service, that the expenditure of the Government during last year was £1,000,000 more than was voted by Parliament, that throughout the whole Service there is the same old war-time scale of expenditure, that there is no cessation of new appointments, and that the Commonwealth has not even begun to follow the example set by Canada, New Zealand, and Great Britain, of trying to got back at the earliest possible moment to something like a pre-war standard of finance. J am disappointed also that the Treasurer has been dismayed by the stereotyped obstacles and official blocks to thorough re-organization of the whole Public Service, and is content in any attempts at economy to deal only with those forms of expenditure which are outside the statutory obligations. The Parliament which had power to create those obligations has equal power to alter them; and in England a very definite stand was taken by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who gave definite instructions to the heads of Departments that the income would be only a certain amount, and the expendi- ' ture must be well within it, and that activities, which of themselves seemed wise and beneficial enough during the war, had to be cut out if some very sound reason for their existence was not evident. I u this way the estimated expenditure was reduced by £161,000,000 this year. I had also hoped that if the Treasurer proposed any remissions of taxation they would be accompanied by Borne evidence of a permanent diminution of expenditure which would insure that the reduction of taxation also would be permanent, instead of being merely a levy upon the surplus stored from previous years. Such remissions as he has made have come from the surplus that he found when he took, office, and another year such as the last was and the current one apparently will be, will abolish the whole of that store; whilst if we strike a bad year with a decrease in total production and a fea- corresponding reduction in the national income, we shall find ourselves short of as many million pounds as are at the present time in the accumulated surplus. Apart from the remissions, the Treasurer has been able to balance his ledger only by transferring to loan account the expenditure on certain works which ordinarilv are paid for out of revenue; and that despite the fact that owing to the decisions of the Washington Conference it was possible to reduce the Defence proposals this year very considerably. In addition, he has been able to conserve ever £2,00.0,000 from War Service Homes which, last year, were provided for out of revenue. The remissions of taxation which the Treasurer has made seem to be only electioneering baits, but they have been well distributed. Some of them. I welcome, uot because they are electioneering baits, but because they are* only a tardy meed of justice to the public.",93
502,Mr BOWDEN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Then why does the honourable member call them electioneering baits ?,94
503,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Because some of them have been brought forward in direct opposition to the Government's declared policy, in previous years. For instance, last year the Country party urged that the proper way to encourage the iron and steel industry was by a system of bounties and low duties, which would - make it possible for the secondary products of the industry to be available at a fairly low price. In that way there would be increased production and a better chance of establishing and maintaining the local manufacturing industries. I notice that a distinguished English manufacturer who is visiting Australia, Mr Green, has expressed the opinion in the Sydney Daily Telegraph that ""The proper way to establish the iron and steel industry was l-.y means of a system of bounties, because that would enormously increase the possibilities of great expansion in wire netting and barbed wire, and all the secondary indnstri.es established in connection with it."" The Canadian iron and steel industry, was established in that way. The cost of wire netting and wire has weighed heavily on production, and it is gratifying, therefore, that the duties have beeu reduced, no matter what the reason. Last year many people were practically eaten off their holdings because Lysaghts failed to deliver wire netting, and the settlers could not afford to import it. Tho settlers are at last able to make a stand against rabbits, and to increase . their production. I should have preferred to see the injustices and anomalies of the present taxation remedied before remissions were made in the income and other taxes. Most important of all, I should have liked to see greater concessions given in respect of children than we have been able to extort from the Government during the last couple of weeks. It is very interesting to note what is taking place in Canada in this connexiou. In the Canadian Budget for this year there is a reduction in revenue derived from taxation from §381,000,000 last year to $332,000,000 this year, a difference of something like $50,000,000. When we come to examine the method by which this has been brought about we find that, first of all, reductions were made in the duties on forty-nine specific items, including mowing machines, reapers and binders, cultivators, harrows, horse rakes, ploughs, vegetable grading machines, and nearly all other agricultural implements. - Tractors for farm purposes have been made free, first by Order in Council and then by Act of Parliament, and the duties have also been reduced on harness, tools, and so forth. Accompanying this, and as a result of a policy that looks to the land, we find that 60 per oent. of the Canadian population are living in the country, whereas in Australia, under our policy of looking first to the secondary instead of the primary industries, and our methods of taxation and administration, practically 50 per cent, of our people are in the capital cities. Further, these reductions were made in Canada not immediately before an election to gain votes, but after an election, when Parliament had its whole course to run.",94
504,Mr FLEMING,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,That is because people there are nearly all farmers. Dr Earle Page.,95
505,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That would undoubtedly make a difference in the mental attitude of the Government. The Treasurer (Mr Bruoe) ought to have endeavoured by his Budget to improve our publio credit by living within our income, and insisting that our current expenditure shall not exceed our current revenue, by limiting unproductive expenditure so as to lessen taxation and prevent the strangling of industries. There should have been an attempt to provide a larger sinking fund in order to wipe out more quickly our debts, instead of diminishing the fund already in existence, and at the earliest possible moment we should release the greatest possible number of employees from unproductive Government works, so that they may be available for productive enterprise. We should endeavour to reduce our statutory obligations by an alteration in our methods, and diminish the cost of government, both Federal and State, by the immediate abolition of the present duplication. Promises have been made of Constitution amendments, but those promises have not been honoured by the Government. The Treasurer's statement of last year referred to this matter, and pointed out that Constitution amendment was the only way to attain real relief from taxation and undue expenditure; yet there is no mention of this reform, in the Budget of this year, nor is there any attempt by the Government to submit Constitution amendments to a referendum at the forthcoming elec- 1 tion, although there was a definite undertaking to that effect. There seems to be only one definite line of policy adopted by the Government, and that is to placate as many interests as can be placated with the amount of money available from the old store; the old policy is maintained of debauching one set of electors with money derived from another.",95
506,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"In other words, the Budget makes a successful appeal to the electors?",95
507,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It will not be successful, for the electors have found out what is the true position. The outstanding feature, after the remissions of taxation, is that the income derived from taxation is less by £2,700,000 than the proposed current expenditure. In Canada, New Zealand, England, and throughout the the Dominions we find the Governments endeavouring to get back to pre-war conditions so far as. tke cost of government is concerned.; but we are simply "" l e t t in g thingsslide,"" and, in fact, increasing the ordinary cost of government. This is 'only rendered possible by permitting what was passed as a protective Tariff, to become a revenue Tariff. We were told that the T a r i ff was to be definitely protective, but the Treasurer is actually budgeting to secure more revenue from the Tariff this year than last. If a protective Tariff fulfils its function, the revenue derived must become less and less as industries are established within the country.",95
508,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Las t year was not normal year.,96
509,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,What does the honourable member mean?,96
510,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Trad e was not normal.,96
511,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Las t year the Treasurer got £1,250,000 more .than he anticipated, and .this year he is budgeting for more still. The Tariff is not ojjerating in the way that was anticipated, and this year is going .to be "" abnormal"" in exactly the same way as was last year. This shows of what little value the protective Tariff of this Government apparently is, and the unsatisfactory conditions under which industries are now conducted are due to the fact that the Government are unduly interchange fering. The Commonwealth coal"" control is probably doing more than .anythe thing else to dislocate industry. year we spent £1,000,000 more than was voted, in spite of an expressed intention on the part of the Government to enpursuing at the present time. deavour to reduce their expenditure. It is worthwhile to review the promises made by the Government of and compare them with the Goshould vernment's performances. Before doing boldly avowed policy. that, however, I should like to say that we must realise, and realise very soon, that the most important policy for Ausof national economy. tralia is one of development; and devethe lopment is essentially a function of State Governments. The revenues availwas late in February. able to both Commonwealth and States are largely drawn from the same source, in the for m of income tax, land tax, and so forth . If development is to be carried on there must not be continual ipetition between the Commonwealth the States as to how much each can tract from the taxpayers. If taxes'are been spent. imposed beyond what our resources can bear, the country cannot be developed. There ought to be. a reduction, of Commonwealth expenditure along the lines, that have been adopted in New Zealand, Greait Britain , and Canada. We have to remember that in New Zealand and Great Britain , where a courageous attempt has been made to grapple with the problem of increased expenditure, there are unitary Governments, and not several ! Governments all separately drawing taxation from the people. Although here we have Federal - and State Governments both extracting taxation a. we see no effort to stem, the rising tide of public expenditure; we are simply going on as we were four-years ago, although other countries, are doing what we ought to do in this regard.",96
512,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The honourable member would increase the number of Governments?,96
513,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I would, i u order to make them more economical under the closer supervision of the people. Victoria, which is the smallest State in the Commonwealth, has only one-third of the taxation of New South Wales,, and one-quarter the taxation of Queensland, and if conditions such as I advocate were brought about we should soon see a from the unrestrained and constant increase in our expenditure. If Commonwealth were deliberately enLast, deavouring to strangle the States and bring about Unification,, they could not go on .better lines than those they are If it is the desire of the Government to d ry up all the resources of the 'States in the way available taxation, it seems to me it not be done sideways, but on a .The Country party .on its entry into this Parliament took a definite stand on the question We found that Budget for that year had not then the been introduced, although the date We made an attempt to insist that the Budget should be brought down at the earliest possible moment, and made an effort comto reduce Supply to six weeks, so and that the Budget might be presented exbefore the whole of the money had On that occasion, however, the ' Government beat the party - drum, and by a party vote defeated our .""first attempt to secure economy. - did achieve one result, and that was a .promise by the Government' that tha Budget would in the future always be introduced at the earliest moment so as to --enable some supervision over expenditure to be exercised by this House. promise has been kept, as shown by the fact that in 1920 and 1921 the Budget was introduced in September, and this .year in August. At the same time, just immediately prior to an election, we find ourselves with just about a day and a half to discuss the expenditure of £S1,000,000.",96
514,Mr BRUOE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,We are not discussing 'the whole of that expenditure now.,97
515,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,We are discussing the departmental expenditure-w e are discussing all except loan expenditure.,97
516,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Yes , but the honourable member always includes the loan expenditure. He is not correct in doing so. What we are discussing now represents .not nearly £81,000,000.",97

519,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I will give the honourable member something to go on with by-and-by. I have a newspaper report here, 3$ inches long, in which there are seventeen lies.",97
520,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The Minister's - opportunity for making accusations of that character will come, no doubt, in due course. At any rate, the Country party succeeded in teaching the Government a lesson in regard to the time of '.bringing down the Budget statement.",97

522,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"And will continue to be made for ever and ever, amen!",97
523,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"In one Parliament, when there was no Country party in this Chamber, the Budget was pre-sented in June and was dealt with in - July of the succeeding year.",97
524,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,But the explanation of rthe greater expedition employed since those days is not to be found in the preWe sence of the Country party.,97
525,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Whil e the lesson in expenditure, has, apparently, been effectively taught by the Country party, the lesson in effective economy has still to be driven home and put into practice. That The effort of the Country party last year proved successful in the direction of securing certain definite promises for the reduction of expenditure. In the first place, while bargaining with the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Bayley) on the floor of the House on the 21st October, 192il, the Prime Minister said that, in, regard to new works, the Committee of Supply would be Tree to make any suggestion it liked, and that the Government would abide by the result. Further, the right honourable gentleman said that his statement applied to all woriks that had no relation to vital matters of repatriation, land settlement, and War Service Homes, or to works that were in part constructed. Secondly, on 11th November, on being driven into that position by the Country party, the Prime Minister made a, definite promise of a total saving of £500,000 in the public expenditure from revenue. This promise was repeated on 17th November, when the Prime Minister said (vide Hansard, page i.2941)I hope that honourable members, in the face of what has been said, will act reasonably, and accept the offer of the Government to reduce the Military Estimates by £250,000, and the Naval Estimates by £130,000, and effect such other saving as in the aggregate will make £500,000. After stating that the Government would reduce the total Military Estimates by only £250,000, the Prime Minister-hav ing been further pressed, to reduce the new works portion of the Military Estimates alone by that amount,, and having apparently realized that the House was determined to stop the extravagance of the Government-said , at a later hour on the same dayI have been looking into the matter, and, on the Estimates now before the Committee (i.e., the .new works portion only) we are prepared to vote for a reduction of £200,000. On 18th November, more pressure having been exerted, the Prime Minister saidTbe Government have given these Estimates (i.e., the new works) consideration; and they are now prepared to reduce this vote by £250,000. Tho vote was accordingly reduced - On 1st Deceniber, when dealing with the general Defence Estimates, the Prime Minister agreed to a reduction of £70,000. He saidThe Government are not prepared to go beyond £70,000, except in the event of the Washington Conference coming to such a decision as to change the whole face - of When sucli a position is made known, if it is, we will consider the matter in a new light. The Prime Minister, on the same day, summarized the promises of economy as follows: Naval Vote £80,000 Air Vote (New Works) ... 100,000 Defence (New Works) ... 250,000 . Defence (Ordinary) ... 70,000 Total £500,000 To this was added the promise that, in in arrear. the event of tihe Washington Conference canning to such a decision as to change the whole face of things, the Government would further consider the Defence mates in a new light. A perusal of this year's Budget forces sources the Country party to again raise the issue of economy. A deliberate attempt has been made to cloud the fact that the Government this year proposes to expend £2,705,443 more than it anticipates that it will actually receive by way of venue. Instead of finding that some tempt had been made to provide for the proposed reduction in taxation by a manent reduction in expenditure, I perCountry ceive that the Treasurer proposes to pay for the Government's vote-catching deBudget vices out of the surplus which past Treato surers accumulated by overtaxing the for people, and which-o n the present Treastatement surer's own calculations-wil l be examount hausted in two years. The electors must know, and will know as far as it lies in the power of the try party to inform them, that the probeen posed reduction in taxation cannot conpractically tinue unless there is a permanent reduction in the cost of government. Notwithstandmade ing the fact that the Government were faced with the specific mandate from Parliament, and despite the innumerable promises of the Prime Minister-mad e many times throughout the debates last year-to effect reduction in ordinary partmental expenditure, no such reducreduce tion-apar t from Defence and Navy, with which I shall deal later-ha s been made. But, on the other hand, the ordinary expenditure of these Departments haa been increased by approximately £471,000 over aud above the amounts voted by Parliament for them last year. The ex-Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) said, definitely, that the greatest care would be exercised throughout the whole of the things. Departments in seeing that the votes passed by Parliament were not exceeded. Despite that undertaking, the Government spent more than £1,000,000 over and above the sum which Parliament had voted; and, bub for the windfall of £835,000 in respect of the Australian Imperial Force troops abroad, together with an increase in income tax returns over and above the total estimated in the Budget, and an increase in Customs revenue which had not been foreseen, the accounts for the past financial year would have been hopelessly",97
526,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member'3 comment,- at all events, contains quite a Estinumber of "" buts "" and "" ifs.""",98
527,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Thos e additional of revenue were absolutely unforeseen by the Government. And, as for the windfall of £835,000, it is questionable whether it should have been properly taken into revenue, considering the cirrecumstances in which it had been raised at and spent and the sources from which it had come. Perusal of the present Budget peronly strengthens the purpose of the party in insisting that the matter of economy shall again be raised. In this a. clever device has been employed disguise the, fact that it will provide a deficiency of £2,700,000 on the actual of the year's finances. That is taken out of the surplus which has been accumulated over many yearsrunning back, I think, as far as 190S. CounThe whole of the remissions which have made at the instance of the Treasurer come out of that amount. The proposed reduction in taxation cannot be permanent unless some permanent - method is adopted for reducing the cost of government. Notwithstanding the fact that we arc getting further away from the war period and its after-effects, and despite innumerable promises and profesdesions on the part of the Government to expenditure and practise economy, we find that except in the Departments of the Navy and Defence, no such reductions have been made. And we find, further, that the ordinary expenditure of the partments has been increased by approximately £471,000-as I pointed out just now-ove r and above the amounts voted last year. These increases are as follows""Parliament .. £3,007 Prime Minister .. 33,388 Treasury .. 22,104 Attorney-General .. 11,805 Home and Territories .. 42,144 Trade and Customs . . .. 41,251 Works and Railways Postmaster-General . . 300,802 Health .. 16,642 Total . .£471,521 Notwithstanding the fact that the cost of government in Australia, excluding war expenditure, has risen from £50,000,000 to £106,000,000 during the past decade, the Government have added another £470,000 to the ordinary departmental expenditure, as against the amount voted by Parliament last year. In spite of the fact that Federal and State taxation has risen from ,£4 10s. to £13 per head during the same period, and that this year over £70,600,000 was poured into the State and Federal Treasuries bytbis small community, the Government, in the past financial year, succeeded in spending practithe cally the whole of the £3,126,000 nary revenue received from unanticipated resources, instead of using that sum order to afford some relief from taxation.",98
528,Mr MOGEATH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"-I think there should be a quorum present. [Quorum, formed.]",99
529,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"There have been .that alarming increases in the total number of public servants. Since the inception Eederation, the number in Australia has risen from 89,831 to 248,976, and salaries have grown from £11,733,000 to Robert £55,689,000. As the total adult lation of Australia is about 3,000,000, one in every twelve adults is a civil servant. The Commonwealth's contribution this state of affairs, as at 30th June, 1921-the latest figures obtainable from the Public Service Commissioner-an excluding the Department of Defence, was 23,4S9 permanent oflicers, and 15,120 exempt and temporary employees; makdecrease ing a total of 38,609. The number of exempt and temporary employees has gone up considerably, and on 30th June, De1921, the total stood as follows:Department. No. Prime Minister 660 Home and Territories 459 Attorney-General 34 Works and Railways . . 402 Treasury 1,042 Trade and Customs - Centra l Staff and Department of Health, 301 - Ne w South Wales 59; Victoria, 24; Queensland,. 39; South Australia, 18; Western Australia, 4; Tasmania, 4 Postmaster-General - Centra l Staff, 7; New South Wales, 4,209; Victoria, 3,297; Queens318 land, '2,103; South Australia, 1,144; Western Australia, 624; Tasmania, 630; total, 15,120.

The Prime Minister's Department has increased from 158 to 390; the Treasury, from 293 to 1,886; and Trade and Customs, from 1,232 to 1,592. According to the Estimates, there are no less than 40,231 permanent officers provided for 1922-23. There is no information in the possession of the Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner as to the number of temporary employees, so it is impossible to say exactly what the position is. No doubt, some of the latter have been made .permanent during the year.",99
530,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,A m I to infer from honourable member's remarks that he of ordirecommends wholesale dismissals?,99
531,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"No . What I in contend is that there should be a selfdenying ordinance on the part of the Commonwealth and State Governments in regard to the making of additional appointments to the Public Service, and there should be a thorough re-organization of the Departments - Every reof port that has been submitted to Parliament on this question-the report of the Economies Commission, the report by Sir Anderson, and others-ha s shown poputhat a proper re-organization of the Public Service would enable a great many men, especially temporary employees, to be displaced, and the work of the Deto partments to be carried out more efficiently than ib is at present. The figures I have given show that there is a gradual d and steady increase year after year in the number of officers engaged by the Commonwealth, and since there is now a rather than an increase in the number of our activities, surely 'there is no justification for the ever-increasing number of permanent officers. Despite these facts, the Treasurer tells us that every figure in connection with the ordinary Departments is the result of the closest investigation and that the Government are convinced, ""on the existing material and rate of pay,"" that the Estimates represent the lowest amount practicable consistent with the supply of a reasonable service to the community. The Minister charged with the administration of the Public Service Act says, however, that 'there can be a great deal more re-organization, and if that were done it would not be necessary to have as many public servants as we employ at the present time.",99
532,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I said that the Board of Oonrmissioners to be appointed under the Bill that we have just passed would be able to do a great deal.,100
533,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I hope it will ; but these two statements are in conflict. There is, admittedly, a greatfield for economy in the Pubic Service at the present time. Economy can be secured by re-organizing the whole Service. An illustration of the way in which the Service grows almost unconsciously is to be found in connection with the sub-Treasury Departments. The Treasurer eliminated from his comparison of the position in 1913-14 and the year 1922-23 the figures relating to those Departments, because «he said they represented wholly new activities. Last year, however, the ex-Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), when complaint was made of the establishment of sub-Treasuries all over the Commonwealth, said that ithey represented really a replacement of activities formerly carried on by other Departments, and did not cover new activities at all. It possible to reconcile these two statements. Sir Joseph Cook stated that hitherto it had been the practice of each Department to attend .to its own finance and run its own accounts in the various States, and that the establishment of these various sub-Treasuries would render such work on their, part no longer necessary. But there is no corresponding decrease in the number of officers employed in the Departments which have been relieved of this work. Another comparison made by the Treasurer dealt with the number of officers employed .in the Taxation Office in 1913-14 and 192122. I respectfully suggest that that is not. a fair comparison by reason of the fact that in 1913-14 there was no In come Tax Act, and, therefore; no expense of collection. If one were to take the increase in the Taxation Office since 1916-17, when the income tax was being levied, one would obtain some idea of the appalling addition to the omcers of that Department that has taken place. The cost of running the Taxation Department in 1916-17 was £198,967, and in 1921-22 it amounted to £546,127. In 1916-17 there were 637 employees in the Department, whereas in 1921-22 there were 2,037. There were 241,933 income taxpayers in 1916-17, and 434,000 in 1921-22.",100
534,Mr RICHABD POSTER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Why does not the honourable member tell us the reason for the increased expenditure),100
535,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I am going to point, out what has been done elsewhere, and to ask why this Government does not grasp the nettle firmly, and try to deal with the whole general question in a business-like way. Canada is proposing this year to raise, by way of taxation, £10^000,000 less than was raised last year. Honourable members know what has been done by New Zealand, aud I propose to show what has been done by Great Britain in the way of effecting economy. Great Britain, Canada, and New Zealand occupy very much the same position that we do, but the attempt that we are making to get' back to pre-war conditions is in no way comparable with what is being done in those countries-. In Great Britain, for instance, the Committee on National Expenditure recommended a total reduction of £86,750,000 in the annual expenditure from revenue. is imThat recommendation was ""carried out after the departmental heads in accordance with the request of the Chancellor of the Exchequer had carefully gone through their departmental' estimates and had reduced them by £75,000,000. There was thus a total reduction of £161,750,000.",100
536,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Since the honourable member quotes those figures, will he in common fairness tell the Committee what * proportion of that £86,750,000 was concerned with any activity such as those controlled by the Federal authority ?",100
537,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I will give the Committee the actual reductions that., have been made. As the result of the recommendation of the Committee on National Expenditure and the action taken by the departmetnal heads, the British Budget was reduced £603,000,000 to £442,000,000. I will mention the classes of expenditure on which the Committee concentrated, with a view to reducing expenditure by the enormous amount mentioned. Leaving out of consideration the question of fighting services, which cannot be compared with those of Australia, the following amounts were deducted from ordinary services:- Health Trade group Export credit Agricultural group ... Police and pensions ... General votes ... ... Colonial group ... ... Legal group ... ... Revenue Departments ... House of Parliament and other civil Departments ... ... Works and public buildings group 895,000 Art and science ... ... Foreign Offices ... ... Stationery Office and RegistrarGeneral ... ... Miscellaneous group ... This return relates to all ordinary items of expenditure, and I have not included therein any items that would come under the heading of the Navy, A r m y, A f t e r math of the W a r, Pensions, War Pensions, &c. I read with interest recently a stateare ment by the Canadian Minister for companies. Finance on the question of trade agencies. Speaking in the Canadian Parliamember's ment, he saidAnother regulation nt that time-it 'busy time in the Budget last year-contem plated the establishment of abroad, and the requirement that a commercial agent of Canada should have his certificate attached to every invoice more. It could be seen at once that if that was to be effected, we would have to have a large army of commercial agents throughout the wide world. After adopting that, the Government seem to have had some hesitation in applying it. They did not bring it into force at once. They provided that it should be brought into operation by order of the Governor in Council. They have never brought it into operation. To-day it is _ issue, and we propose to make it doubly by wiping it out. The attitude of the Canadian Governwould ment towards its commercial agents is v.ery different from that adopted by Australian Government towards our. trade agents. Dr Enrle Page. The items to which I referred a few moments ago as having been deducted from ordinary services by the Imperial from Government as the result of the report of the Geddes Commission are practically ordinary expenses which have their parallel in this Government of the Commonwealth. Mr EICHAR D FOSTER - Where is the parallel ?",100
538,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"There is, unfortunately, no parallel between the conduct of this Government and that of the British Government in regard to the reduction of expenditure. There are many 2,500,000 directions in which we might follow the 538,000 example set by the Imperial Government. 500,000 ... 855,000 They have already paid off a considerable ... 1,595,000 part of their war indebtedness, whereas ... 102,000 we are increasing our national debt. ... 2,285,000 Mr BELL - The need for a reduction ... 94;000 ... 2,509,000 in their case was much greater than in our case, because there was much more ... 935,000 extravagance there. 43,000 Dr EARLE PAGE - I do not admit ... 304,000 that. I would remind the Committee that although the Canadian Government ... 584,000 has to deal with an area as large as our ... 1,130,000 own, and to provide for the requirements of one and a half times the population of Australia, its Budget is practically the same as our own, and this notwithstanding that it has a very much bigger railway proposition than we have to deal with .",101
539,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The railways there for the most part owned by private,101
540,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The honourable information is not up to date. Quite a number of the railways to which was a he refers have come under the control of - the Canadian Government during the last commercial agencies two years.,101
541,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,What about the of $100 or Canadian-Pacific railway?,101
542,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,There are other scattered great railwav lines in Canada.,101
543,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,But the honourable member will admit that the Canadian-Pacific railway is by fan the greatest in Canada ?,101
544,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The Grand Trunk and the Great Northern are very a dead considerable railways. Returning to the dead auestion of the reduction of expenditure made by the Imperial Government, I point out that the Committee on National Expenditure said that the reducthe tions they had proposed throughout were attainable if prompt action was taken by the Departments upon the general lines of their suggestions and with determination to effect economies. They had uo doubt lic whatever that a close scrutiny of the penditure by the Departments themselves, and by the Treasurer, would disclose the possibility of further economies on the lines they had followed, as their investiitem gations could not be exhaustive. The view taken by the British Treasurer on this matter is also well known, and was quoted by me during the Budget dethe bate last year, but as it has such an portant bearing upon our Treasurer's Budget now under consideration, I refer to it againIn order to enable revenue nnd expenditure to balance in 1022-23. there must be a reduction in expenditure. There is no hope of solving the financial problem that, connot fronts the nation by additional borrowwe ings or additional taxation. . . . It is the three certain that any increase in taxation seriously hamper the recovery of British industry and commerce, and thus ultimately intensify the difficulty of the position, would on that account be most vehemently opposed by the House of - Commons, and by public opinion in the country; indeed, what.is required in order to maintain and stimulate industry and commerce-and secure full regular employment in the country-is a reduction of taxation and of the burden of State's indebtedness as rapidly as possible, process which can only be achieved by tinuous reduction of expenditure throughout the next few years. . . . It is recognised. that it will be impossible to carry out the degree of economy demanded by the financial situation and still preserve all the existing services carried on by the State. Therefore, the Treasury circular, with the authority of the Cabinet behind it, instructs each Departemployed ment to take into consideration the abolition of some of the services under its control, though these se vices represent functions posed by Statute. Where it is necessary to obtain parliamentary sanction by means Bill lo the abolition of any existing services, the Government will do so. There is a marked difference between the attitude taken up by our Treasurer that taken up by the British in respect to statutory obligations, which, - they declare, it is better to empty out if they cannot be carried out with satisfacpointing tion and economically. Our Treasurer said, in delivering his BudgetThe two ways in which a reduction can be brought about are by insuring more efficient sufficient. service as a result of better organization of all the Departments and by a reduction of the amount paid to the individual Public Service. I said last year that the members of Country party have no desire to interfere with good pay for good work, or with the natural increments that come to the pubservants for f a it h f u l work; but the exmethod which is to be adopted by the Government to obtain the better organization of all Departments surely conflicts with the Treasurer's statement that every of expenditure has been carefully scrutinized. We find, for instance, that the Government have appointed more Boards. I have already protested against appointment of three Public Service imCommissioners. I believe that the work could be done more efficiently and more satisfactorily by the appointment of one Commissioner, and giving him un efficient staff such as has been asked for, drastic and a board of accountants who would need to be paid the salaries have already arranged to pay to Commissioners. However, would as this Parliament has decided to appoint three Commissioners, it is better and to pay them such salaries as wjll secure the services of men who will be able to bring about better conditions in the Service. Nevertheless, the paragraph in the and Treasurer's Budget statement may be the taken as a frank admission of the exista ence of lack of organization throughout a conthe Service; and since the Government have been in power for six years, they must take the responsibility for this. Mr . Webster, a former Postmaster-General, has stated very definitely since leaving office that 20 per cent, fewer men could be if there were better organization in the Postal Department; and we find the even Public Service Commissioner complainiming of the action of some Minister in reof a instating a man who had absented himself without leave to act as clerk to his father, who is a bookmaker.",101
545,Mr LAXRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The honourable and member might wait until that Minister Government has made his explanation.,102
546,Dr EAELEPAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I am merely out the statement made by the Public Service Commissioner in his report. ,102
547,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,It is unfair and members of the unreasonable.,102
548,Dr EAELEPAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It seems to me the that the Government lack the courage to instruct their Departments to take into consideration the abolition of some of the services under their control, ev'eil although those services may represent functions imposed by Statute. last Budget, a fight was put up by the Government to have £45,000 spent on extending the Geelong Woollen Mills, and within two or three months these works were offered for sale, becauso the Government had found out that in three months the mills could produce suflicient to supply the whole of the requirements of the Commonwealth Departments. For years the Government have avoided the desirability of making satisfactory arrangements with the States for the elimination of the double cost of Electoral and Taxation Departments.",102
549,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The other States should follow the example of Tasmania.,103
550,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Yes , and if they cannot come to some reasonable arrangement in that regard, I venture to say that the people of Australia, who are sickened to death of the perpetual backing and filling in this matter, will be prepared to hold a convention on the matter and put the country's affairs on a better footing. There is also the matter I have already mentioned, the hours worked by Commonwealth public servants as compared with those worked by the public servants of the States. In four of the States ihe public servants work until 5 o'clock, but the Commonwealth officers do not work beyond 4.30 o'clock. If the Commonwealth Government had the courage to extend the hours of work a considerable amount of money which is now spent on the employment of temporary hands could be saved. In connection with the Budget, I would like to say that the statement for this year is a very clear one, but it has been arranged m such a way as to make it very difficult to trace the actual position last year as compared with this. Throughout, comparison is made between last year's expenditure and the estimated expenditure for this year, so thati t is difficult to ascertain exactly the difference between the estimated expenditure this year and the estimated expenditure last year. - Mr Bruce - I do not agree with the honourable member. I think that figures are easily followed as set out in the Budget-papers.",103
551,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The Treasurer has summarized the position as. follows:On the Surplus brought forward fromthei year 19201921, estimated, £6,61S,327;; actual, £6,618,327.. Receipts,, estimated, £61,787,350; actual,. £64,897,046. Expenditure, out of revenue, estimated,. £64,104,458; actual, £65,106,949. Surplus carried forward to the year 19221923, estimated total, £4,301,219; actual total,. £6,408,424. Dealing with this position, the Trea- 1 surer proceeds as follows: - 1 These figures show that during the past year Australia was able to meet the ordinary expenditure out of current revenue, except aa to the comparatively small sum of £209,903. Though there was a deficit of that sum, the fact should not be overlooked that provision was made for Defence compensation to the extent of £300,000. Tbis is a. non-recurring: item, and could legitimately have been brought forward into the present year. If that provision had not been made there would have been a surplus quite apart from the surplus brought forward from previous years.. Broadly stated, the. result of the transactions out of revenue was that we were able to balance last year's Budget and to carry .forward a surplus of £6,408,424, as against an estimate of £4,301,219: This pronounced improvement in the position indicates that the recuperative powers of Australia are' greater than we recognised a year ago. We can congratulate ourselves that, notwithstanding the unparalleled dislocation resulting from the war, and the world-wide tradedepression, we have come through the past year in a manner which shows the stability of our national finances. A little examination of these figures, however, soon disposes of the Treasurer's boasts. It will be noted that the revenue exceeded anticipation by a considerable sum. The principal of these excessesare as follows: Customs and Excise . . £1,499,359 Land Tax . . . ... .'. 34,040 Income Tax .. . . 1,790,682 Balance of Defence Trust Accounts 103,085 Payment on Account of Army of Occupation .. .. 835,000 Miscellaneous .. .. .. 200,000 £4,462,166 Deduct surplus earnings of Line of Steamers, £300,000; and over-estimated War-Time Profits Tax. and Succession Duties, £851,914 .. 1,151,914 £3,310,252 Turning to the expenditure out, of revenue for the past year, we find that the actual expenditure was £65,106,949; the the amount voted by Parliament was £64,104,458, the excess being £1,002,491.. Notwithstanding promises last year' to reduce expenditure by £500,000, the principal increases in expenditure oyer Australia. and above the amount voted by Parliament last year are as follows: Voted Last Spent. Year. Prime Minister.. 416,798 722,569 306,398 Treasury 1,207,280 1,319,852 Attorney-General 108,000 113,225 Trade and Customs 745,357 766,441 Health 108,568 144,535 Had it not been for the previously mentioned wholly unanticipated windfall, from which I have deducted the shortage in war-time profits tax, succession duties, and surplus earnings of the Common-: wealth Government Line of Steamers, the Treasurer's deficit on the past year's transactions, instead of being "" a comparatively small sum of £209,803,"" would have really been over £3,300,000. The Treasurer made his comparison between last year's expenditure and this year's estimated expenditure, and in that way was able to make the position appear better than it really was. When the comparison is made with the actual expenditure there is shown a decrease of £370,000, but when it is made with the actual votes threshed out in Committee, there is shown an increase of £417,000. It is quite evident that if the revenue had been what was anticipated instead of being what it actually was. there would have been a deficit of £3,300,000 instead of a surplus of £209,908, and when the Treasurer is speaking again I would like to ascertain from him the proportion of income tax still owing - compared with the amount owing last year. .There appears an expenditure item of £50,000 on account of additional temporary employment, which seems to have been utilized in collecting a larger proportion of the earnings of taxation than was anticipated. Last year, I think, Sir Joseph Cook said that over £8,000,000 of income taxation was outstanding, and I should like to have a statement from the Treasurer as to whether in the current year we are likely to get as big a return from this source as was received last year. The collection of £1,500,000 worth of additional duty through the Customs Department is due to causes which are not advantageous to",103
552,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,What are the causes?,104
553,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Many of the inIncrease. dustries which are supposed to supply the needs of the country are not work£ £ £ ing at the present time. 112,572 Mr RICHARD FOSTER,-Why ? 5,225 Dr EARLE PAGE -^One reason 21,084 that is commonly adduced in New South. 35,967 Wales is the maintenance of Commonwealth control of coal. A comparison of the imports for .the eleven months ended 31st May last with those for the corresponding period of last year shows: 1920-21, imports, £153,834,494; 1921-22, £90,846,091, a diminution of £63,000,000, or 41 per eent. The Customs and Excise revenue for 1920-21 was £31,800,000, and for 1921-22 £27,600,000. Thus, whilst the imports decreased by about 41 per cent, the revenue decreased by only 17 per cent., showing clearly that a very large proportion of the Customs revenue must have been derived from duties on highly-protected articles. I take it thathigh protection was imposed on certain, ""articles for the definite purpose of stimulating Australian production, and this it haa absolutely failed to do. If the duties had been imposed for revenue purposes only they would have been on a moderately low scale. The large amount of duty that has been collected indicates that it is in connection with the highlyrprotected industries that big importations have taken place. That it occurred is undoubtedly due to 1 the high .cost of production, brought about by high taxation in both State and Federal spheres, the increased cost of living, the artificial wages that are being paid, and especially the continuance of the coal control, which interferes materially with industry throughout Australia. These conditions have contracted many industries which should be carried on more vigorously than they are at the present time. Many of them are entirely closed up because during the consideration of the . Tariff the majority of honourable members, including all the members of the Government, refused to listen to reason cr to profit by the nearly advice that was proffered from this Corner."" Take wire netting as an instance^ The Government imposed a duty on zinc, although the great bulk of the zinc produced in' Ausmember tralia is exported. We also placed a on copper, and what was the effect? wire-netting industry, in which zinc is used, was never able to obtain local zinc at less than £4 per ton more than the price ab which zinc could be bought in power. England. This placed local manufacturers of the secondary productions made it is. from ziuc at a very great disadvantage, as compared with their overseas competitors. I brought, before the Minister for Trade and Customs the position of the bronze intion. dustry, which was definitely protected by this Parliament. People were induced iuvest capita] in certain works on the derstanding and assurance that, as soon the industry started to roll sheets, the ferred duty would become operative. The industry was waiting week after week, but the Minister took no action, although the thd Tariff Board reported long ago in favour of the duty being imposed. by Parliament. That industry is now closed down because Australian copper was not available for secondary manufacturers at a price at which bronze made in England from Ausof tralian copper could be bought.",104
554,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,All these things have happened since the so-called' Country part)' came into existence.,105
555,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The Country last party fought against these excessive duties all the time, and I regard the action of the Government in reducing duties on wire-netting and galvanized iron and wire as a confession, that the policy we advocated last year was the proper one. What has happened in Ausments', tralia is to be seen in the distribution urban and rural population. Canada, ceding years? which has problems very similar to our own, has adopted a different policy obtained different results. So far from the increased revenue being evidence, the Treasurer claims, of the recuperative power of the Commonwealth, it is really the result of the unfortunate fact that Australian industries have not to rise to the occasion and supply the needs of our people.",105
556,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Surely the honourable member is not denying Australia's rehe cuperative powers ,105
557,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"No ; but the infrom crease of Customs revenue is not a matter of which the Treasurer should be proud. It should rather cause him to 'go into sackcloth and place ashes on hia head. - Mr Bruce - I remind the honourable that it was the recuperative duty powers of the Commonwealth of which I The was proud, and I think I should be.",105
558,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The honourable member referred to the increased revenue as evidence of the country's recuperative,105

560,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It does not please me to see the country's recuperative power expressed in increased taxaTurning to the Estimates of receipts to and expenditure for the current year, I unfind that the Treasurer proposes to spend as £471,000 more in the ordinary Departdements than was voted by Parliament last year. It is true that the amount is lets than that actually spent last year, but expenditure was more than £1,000,000 in excess of the sum voted The Treasurer, however, shrewdly compared the estimated expenditure for the current year with the actual expenditure of last year, instead with the amount voted by Parliament. By so doing, he shows a decrease of £370,000 in the estimated expenditure for this year, although it is actually an increase of £471,000 over the vote for year. We are told that every figure is the result of the closest personal' investigation by the Treasurer, and that the the estimate is the lowest amount that is compatible with efficiency and the support of reasonable services. If there hap been no loss of efficiency in the Departwhy should it take £370,000 more of to run them last year than in the preI n addition, there appears to. be some and manipulation of loan and revenue expenditure, in order to make the Budgetas look as favourable as possible.",105
561,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Does not the honourable member think the word "" manipulation "" is a little offensive? I , personally, have been able no objection to it .",105
562,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I do not intend it to be offensive, and I am making no. reflection upon the Treasurer. Perhapswould prefer me to say that there has-, been some transposition cf expenditure revenue to loan, in ordeT to makethe Budget look well. It does not seem to matter very much what we do, becauseif we are to continue increasing our expenditure, whether it be from revenue or from loan, we must ultimately come to a dead end. I notice that in the Canadian Budget a definite attempt was made to provide from revenue the whole of the ordinary expenditure on works that are usually paid for out of lean, and thus to prevent any increase in the national debt.",105
563,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Does the-honourable member advocate that we should do that?,106
564,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Certain departmental works should be paid for out of revenue.,106
565,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Which ?,106
566,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"If the Post Office earnings had been retained in that Department for the last five years, there would have been no necessity for the raising of a loan of £8,000.000 for the Department. That Department has been the Cinderella and milch cow of the Treasurer since the inception of Federation. In dealing with the big jump in the increase of interest on the national debt for other than war purposes by £573,641 on one year's transactions, the Treasurer saidThe only comment necessary is to point out the substantial burden which is placed on the current revenue by heavy increase in the loon expenditure. This emphasizes the necessity for confining loan expenditure to strictly developmental, or productive works. We find, however, that, notwithstanding the Treasurer's well-meaning words, he has taken £250,000 out of loan for the relief of unemployment in the States. I shall never again vote for handing over any money to the States in this way, if the Commonwealth is not going'to determine in some degree the manner in which it shall be spent. We find thaf this money is being used in a way that is not by any means giving satisfaction. Many of the roads in Niew South Wales have been very much damaged by the inclement weather in the last eighteen months or two years; and it is stipulated by the State Government that those employed in their repair must be 50 per cent, of the unemployed from the capital cities, or otherwise the money will not be handed over to the shires as was intended. As a result, practically all the shire councils are turning down the proposition. Owing to hard times, and because of the damage done by the floods last year, many of the shires have dispensed with the services of the expert road men, and the unemployed sent up from the city are unaccustomed to the work.",106
567,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Surely you do not say that this money is being wasted.,106
568,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The statement made by the shire engineers is that many of the men sent to them have never doni* any road work before, and the work they do represents only 20 or 25 per cent, of that of the average tradesman.",106
569,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Does the honourable member not think that the States can spend this money much better than can the Commonwealth ?,106
570,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,If the money is to be found by the Commonwealth it is our bounden duty to see that it is spent in a satisfactory way.,106
571,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,This is being done.,106
572,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"1I have already informed the Government of the complaints that are made in this connection throughout the whole of northern New South Wales. I see no necessity for unemployed men to lie taken from the dtie."" when there are unemployed men in the country. The Treasurer, in his Budget speech, did not touch on the possibility of reducing the statutory obligations at all; but something ought to be done in the way I suggested last year, beginning with our own salaries. There are. however, the invalid and old-age pensions, which seem to offer a field f o i effort. The amount to be provided for these pensions must increase each year if we go on as at present; and the only way in which the cost can be reduced is by means of some system of contributory national insurance. I am hopeful that, with the assistance of the friendly societies, some plan may be devised and adopted to bring about a reform of the kind, so as to enable us to provide for these old people much more liberally than at present; for then the national conscience would be a little more tender.",106

575,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"There being objections, the honourable member's time cannot be extended.",106
576,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Yarra) [2.20 a.m.] - It Las been stated that the true test of a Government is its financing, and it becomes necessary, therefore, to analyze the Budget that has been presented to this House. The important consideration is what return is received for the expenditure. I do not propose to say anything that will affect the credit of Australia. I have great faith in the nation; and I believe that it will give good return for sound financing. I am bound to say, however, that it cannot stand much more of the present methods employed by this Government. Expenditure to increase national wealth, and thereby increase revenue, is not extravagance, but true economy; likewise, to decrease expenditure by starving revenue-earning Departments, such as the Post Office, is false economy, and that is the form of economy that has been indulged in for the past few years. The Budget figures, for example, may be reduced by selling woollen mills, though no financier would sav that it is sound business to sell a concern which returned £55,000 of net profit last year after paying interest and sinking fund. But while expenditure on wealth-producing undertakings which give employment to people, and a good return, is sound economy, wasteful expenditure merely adds to the burden of all sections. What is wanted is judicious expenditure. The principles that should underlie sound judicious financing are, first, a reduction of our indebtedness; secondly, concessions to the taxpayers should be made only from excess of revenue over expenditure; and, thirdly, the concessions ought to be to those most in need. Laying those principles down, we have to examine the Budget? Taking the first proposition-that our national debt should be reduced- I find from the Budget that, on the contrary, we are - increasing it . The Budget shows that the national debt on the 1st July, 1921, was £401,720,000, while on the 1st July . this year, it was £416.070,000, an increase of £14,350,000 in the past year. It is estimated that the debt will be increased for the current year by £17,250,000 ; and I submit that, four years after hostilities have ceased, it is surely time to make a substantial start to reduce our ' war indebtedness. debts are not productive, and it will be easier to pay them before a period of deflation sets in. If the cost of living comes down, and there is general deflation, it really means that our debts will increase in value, and that it will be increasingly difficult to redeem them. Instead of making haste to reduce our indebtedness, the Government have reduced the sinking fund, which was set up at 1 per. cent., was later per cent., and is now J per oent. That, in .my opinion, is not sound, but unsound, finance. In his Budget speech the Treasurer quoted from the report of the International Financial 'Conference the correct principles of finance. He quoted the first principle, "" That the Budget should be balanced,"" and said, "" This the Government have done by reducing the expenditure within the limits of the revenue moneys which are available."" I contest that point, and turn to the Budget to prove that the Treasurer and the Government have not carried out that first principle of correct finance. The Estimates of 1922-23 declare that the revenue will be £62,518,250; the expenditure, £62,023,693; and the estimated surplus, £494,557. But what are the actual facts ? The revenue which is stated at £62,518,250, is to be reduced by £3,200.000 in remissions in taxation, thus reducing the total to £59,318,250. The expenditure, as I say, is set down at £62,023,693; but if we add to that the expenditure on new works that were previously paid for out of revenue, but are now paid for out of loan, amounting .to £1,741,764, we find that the actual expenditure is £63,765,457, whereas the revenue for the year is ,£59,318.,250. When we deduct from that again the amount of money that has been, plundered from .the Notes Fund-£1,150,000-the real revenue for the current year is £58.,16S,250, while the actual expenditure is £63,765,457, and the actual deficit is £5,597,207. That is made up of £3,200,000 taken from the Trust Fund, £1,150,000 taken from the Notes Fund, and £1,741,764 transferred from revenue to loan expenditure for new works; a total of £6,091,764. When' we deduct from . that the actual deficit for the year£5,597,207, there is left a fictitious surplus of £494,557. That is an actual check of the Budget; yet we are told that the Government have reduced the expenditure War to an amount within the revenue. In proof of what I have said as to the transfer of new works from revenue account to loan account, I find that for 1921-22 the new; works provided for from revenue represented £2,571,794, and for the current year £830,030, a difference of £1,741,769. Expenditure on works out of loan in 1921-1922 amounted to £5,246,503; and, for the year 1922-23, it is estimated that the expenditure will be £6,910,031-a n increase for the current financial period of £1,663,528. Thus, it will be seen that the Government, upon new works, are reducing their expenditure from revenue and increasing the i r , expenditure f loan. Last year's Estimates were freely discussed in this Chamber. Never before had such a successful fight been waged against a Government for the purpose of reducing wasteful expenditure. successful "" cut "" was made. Despite that fact, however, and acting truly upon the irresponsible methods of recent times, the Government spent £1,000,000 more than 'Parliament had authorized. This year, while spending £3,000,000 less fro m revenue, the Government will £4,400,000 more from loan. I propose to turn attention now to the manner in which the Government have set out to disburse the £3,200,000 which has been taken from the Trust Fundthat is,, the accumulated surplus-to tide them over the coming election. Of the sum i u question, the Government .will hand over to the poorer class of taxpayers-the working people-les s than one-fourth. The increase in exemption from taxation, up to £2.00, will be respon- were thesesible for £600,000. I am allowing that the whole of that release will go to the smaller taxpayers-which , however, will not be the case. Then, in respect of remissions of the entertainments tax, there will be a further sum of £100,000. I do not suggest, of course, that the humbler folk in the communitywill solely benefit by the relief given in that direct i o n ; but I am willing to say that the total amount of remission from taxation afforded to the working people will be £700,000. I invite honourable members to turn attention now to what the Government propose to do for landowners who possess property of an unimproved value of more than £5,000. They are to be given remission of taxation to the extent of £400,000. Large companies, such as the Flinders-lane houses, the banks', and insurance companies, are to be afforded, a reduction of 3d. in the £ 1 , which will mean a g if t , in the aggregate, of £200,000. Owing to the reduction of income tax by 10 per cent, there w i ll be a further remission of £1,300,000. Then, in respect of the reductions of. duty on iron and steel products, there will be relief amounting to £350,000, to which must be added the benefit of. the bounty, amounting to £250,000. The"" wellto-do will be granted remissions of taxation, amountingi in all, to £2,500,000, r o m while the low-wage section and middleclass people will be relieved by only £700,000. Meanwhile, nothing further is being done for the. aged poor and infirm. There is a sum of £6,000,000 in the Trust Fund. The Treasurer has referred And a to this as "" an unemployed surplus."" That is an extraordinary way in which to regard the 'amount. What should have been done with it is not difficult tb stateI t is not sound business to remit taxation unless the remission can be made permanent; and there is not one word in the spend Budget speech to indicate that the remissions are likely to be permanent.",107
577,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The Treasurer, in' his Budget speech, indicated that such would be the case.",108
578,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Nothin g of the kind f Expenditure being considerably greater than revenue, the only way in which the Treasurer could afford to grant remissions of taxation was by dipping hishands into the Trust Fund.",108
579,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The specific word's I used! The Government feel justified in recommending the use of that sum in the manner suggested, without any fear that, in order to make the' revenue and expenditure for the year 1923-24' balance, it will be necessary to reimpose taxation. Mr SCULLLN.r-There is nothing in that reference to indicate that the taxation remitted may not have to be reimposed. It would have been far better for the Treasurer to purchase war bondson the market with the aid of the accumulated surplus. There are war loanswhich will be fallin g due next year. H ad the Government gone into the market with £6,000,000, or even with half of thatsum, they would have been able to get rid of 1925 4£ per cent, non-taxable bonds, so showing a return of about 6 i per cent. B y doing that, I point out further, they would have brought freshsources of income with in , the scope of taxation. The sum of £3,200,000, if it had been devoted ""to the purchase of bunds, would have earned about £200,000 a year. By so employing the surplus, the Government would have made use of the soundest way of handling this accumulated trust fund, for one of the first duties of a Government is to reduce rather than to increase their indebtedness. I desire to turn attention now to the worse feature of the Budget. I refer to the Australian Notes Account, which has been tampered with by this Government. When the Act was passed in 1910 it was laid down as a sound principle that none of the moneys received, for the notes should be used as revenue, and that none of the profits made upon the investment of the notes fund should be employed in that direction either.",108
580,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It was a distinct pledge, given by the Government of the day.",109
581,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The promise was made by the then Treasurer, Mr Fisher, that the moneys received and the profits made would not be put into revenue, but would be employed for the redemption of loans. That pledge was faithfully kept by every succeeding Treasurer until the 14th December, 1920, when, for the first time, hands were laid upon the profits derived from the note issue. From that date up to the 30th June, 1921, there was taken out the sum of £394,016. During the financial year 1921-22 a further amount of £1,261,482 was removed; while for the current financial period it is estimated that £1,150,000 will be taken from the Australian Notes Account, making a grand total, to date, of £2,805,498. This large sum has been appropriated from the profits made in connection with the Notes Account, and has been, and is to be, regarded as revenue and spent as revenue. The accumulated profit upon the note issue used for the redemption of Government inscribed stock up to December, 1920, was £7,780,524. When I add to that the total of £2,805,498 which has been taken into revenue from the Notes Account, it will be seen that the total profits from our notes to the end of June next year will have amounted to £10,586,022. This is the fourth Budget which I have had the honour to discuss and criticise in the Federal Parliament. The three earlier Budgets were produced by Labour Governments, in 1910, 1911, and 1912. I recall the fact that, on all three occasions, the criticism employed during the debates was of a fierce character. Opponents of Labour employed such phrases as, "" financial ruin,"" "" Australia run over a precipice,"" and "" bankruptcy staring the nation in the face."" All these pessimistic opinions were expressed because of the extent of the Government's expenditure. In the year when this was greatest, namely, in 1912-13, the expenditureafter the payment of State subsidieswas less than £15,000,000. This year, however, ordinary expenditure, apart altogether from war charges, will amount to £33,000,000. That is an increase equivalent to 120 per cent, since the lajt year in office of that Labour Administration which was described' as being so extravagant. However, I do not propose, to employ language similar to that which was hurled at the Labour Treasurer by the Opposition of. those days, because I consider that Australia's good name and credit are of more importance than one's desire-howeve r keen it may be-to criticise the occupants of the Treasury bench. That comment suggests to me that I might make a brief review of the financing of Labour Governments in the past, comparing it with the financing of their opponents. In 1908 the first Fisher Government came into power, and it remained in office for one year, when the Fusion was formed, and it had to retire. When Labour left office, in 1909, it left behind a surplus of £450,000. In the following year, when the Labour party returned into power, the anti-Labour Government, which had been carrying on a Fusion Administration, went out of office, leaving a deficit of £650,000. In1911 the Labour Government were able to show a surplus of £1,837,000, in 1912 a surplus of £2,261,000, and in 1913 a surplus of £2,650,000. Labour was then defeated, and its Fusion opponents came into power again. In their first year, namely, 1914, the Fusion Government reduced the amount of surplus by £1,400,000. For those six years which I have reviewed there were four Labour surpluses and two anti-Labour deficits. Then came the war', which involved increased taxation and huge loans, and the result of war financing left a balance of more than £6,000,000.' For the year 1921-22, with conditions returning to normal, we find that the same habit of creating a deficit dogged the footsteps of an anti-Labour Government. For .the period mentioned expenditure exceeded revenue by £209,000. For the current year, if we compare actual expenditure with actual revenue, it will be seen that the real deficit will amount to £5,597,000. Reverting to the Labour regime of . 1910-13, I invite honourable members tc review what was actually done. One of the first duties of the Labour Government was to repeal the Naval Loan Act , which involved £3,500,000. This measure had been introduced and passed during the regime of ths anti-Labour Government. The Lahour Administration paid out of revenue for war vessels which their predecessors had proposed to pay for out of loan. The Labour Government, for the first time, paid invalid pensions, and they liberalized the old-age pensions. They spent upon new works-chiefl y upou post-office services-£3,000,00 0 a year from revenue, as compared with less than £1,000,000 a year spent by their predecessors. The Labour Administra* tion reduced letter postage rates to I d and imposed a charge of Jd. for telephone calls. Since those days, by the way, each of those charges has been increased by 100 per cent. .Good results were brought about by adopting a policy of sound financing and of encouraging general national development, and not by increasing the burden of taxation. Only, one new taxing measure was passed That was the Land Tax Act, which provided an exemption up to £5,000 of unimproved value, thus bearing upon none of the poor throughout the Commonwealth. The report of the. Taxation Commissioner covering the first year of its operation showed that the effect of the Act had been to break up £22,000,000 worth of large estates. Wealth production - increased under Labour rule. In three years 4,000,000 acres extra were put into cultivation. Imports and exports expanded, and revenue generally benefited. The Labour Government of that period also established a number of enterprises which proved remarkably successful. The Commonwealth Bank has made net profits amounting to £4,000,000, and the savings made upon loan flotations have amounted to £6,000,000. Thus there is involved a profit to the people directly amounting to £.10,000,000. The profits made from notes have realized another £10,000,000, and the total of these operations aggregates about £20,000,000. We also' established woollen mills and a clothing factory which, up to the year ending June, 1921, showed a net profit of £300,000, and I have no doubt that if the balance-sheets for the year ending June, 1922, were available, they would show that the net profit up to that date was about £400,000. All these enterprises were established by Labour Governments. There were no scandals associated with them such as have occurred in connection with the wireless agreements, shipping contracts, flour sales, and War Service Homes administration, because the Labour Government saw to it that no profiteers should be in control. It was urged in the early part of the discussion on the Budget that the redemption fund of the Commonwealth Bank should be placed in the hands of the Treasurer. I would not have favoured placing it in the hands of any Treasurer of the type we have had during the last few . , years, because there is no guarantee that, if that course were adopted, the money would not be taken into the Consolidated Revenue arid spent. The experience of the Commonwealth in regard to trust funds is not a very happy one. We know that the £415,000 accumulated profit in the sugar accounts was taken into revenue and spent j that a sum of £2,805,000, profits from the Notes Fund since December, 1920, has also been taken over and spent as revenue. The present Government is now taking from another trust f u n d £3,200,000 and putting it into the revenue account. Our experience in this regard is not very fortunate. It is often said to an honourable member who criticises the Government, "" Why not offer some constructive criticism ? Why not offer some suggestions?"" It is difficult for one who is not in control of the Treasury to offer constructive criticism, because many items with which we may all agree may yet be capable of much reduction and yet produce the same result. I shall, however, offer one or two suggestions for the cutting down of expenditure. I am sure the Treasurer will be glad to have some suggestions on those lines. I observe some items in the Budget that might well be cut out. There is, for instance, an item of £32,000 for salaries, publicity expenses, k , of the Australian organization in connection with immigration. I would cut out that item. would also cut out the item of £40,000 far salaries, advertising, &c, in connection with the organization in London for immigration purposes, and a further sum of £200,000, representing the passage money for assisted immigrants. These three items make a total of £272,000 which might well be cut oub» of the Budget Seeing that we have something like 35,000 registered, unemployed in Australia at the present time,, in addition to thousands. of unemployed who have not registered, we might well do away with this expenditure. The honourable member who said "" Hear, hear,"" when I referred, to the expenditure of £272,000 in connection with immigration should visit the Labour Bureau and see the number of immigrants who are being sent away to work in country districts for a few shillings per week. He should visit the buffet at St. Kilda-road and see what a large number of returned soldiers are rushing it for a free meal. Before we expend £272,000 on immigration we ought to do justice to our own people. I have some other suggestions to make as to the way in which considerable savings might be effected. It is about time that the Federal Government took a firm grip of the question of the duplication of State and Commonwealth Departments. We could have no greater admission of weakness on the part of a Government than the statement that they do nothing with the States in this matter.",109
582,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Is not the member aware that it is.the States that will not "" line up "" f",111
583,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That is the greatest admission of weakness that an apologist for the Government could make. The Government has .the power to make the Bank States ""line up."" i Mr BELL - How can it do so?",111
584,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I am not in the habit of making statements that I cannot prove. The Commonwealth Government have no cent., constitutional or statutory obligations to pay £7,000,000 to the States per annum as it is now doing, and the States should be told by the Commonwealth Governtheir ment that if' they are going to pursue wasteful policy of duplication and guilty of other extravagant acts, which I shall enumerate, the revenues of the people whom this Parliament represents I shall not be available to them.",111
585,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,But the Commonwealth gets all its revenue from tfae States.,111
586,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Not from the States, but from the people of Australia. We represent exactly the same people that the State Parliaments represent. At the present time there is a duplication of land and income taxation, stamp duties, and ' death duties. We have duplication of the electoral rolls in most of the States, duplication of statistics, duplication of Governors, and, to a large extent, duplication of the Judiciary.",111
587,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,There is no duplication of Governors.,111
588,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"We have seven Governors for 5,500,000 people, and in that respect we are the laughing-stock of the rest of the civilized world.",111
589,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Would the honourable member take away all the rights of the States ?,111
590,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Does the honourable member say that it is the right of the States to waste public money on the duplication of services, and on fripperies * such as those associated with State Governors? I stand for the people's rights. When this Parliament, in 1910-11, established the Commonwealth Bank for the benefit of the people, there were many who criticised that institution as useless and unnecessary.",111
591,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,It has been of no use to the can small man-to the small land-owner.,111
592,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Will the honourable member say that it has been of no use to honourable the people of Australia?,111
593,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It has been no use to the small land-owners, although the Labour Government said it would help them.",111
594,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The Commonwealth has made a direct profit of £4,000,000, which, but for its establishment, would have gone into the pockets of a few shareholders in private banking companies. It has floated war loans for a commission of 5s. 9d. per whereas,, before the war., the private banks and brokers were charging an average of £2 7s. l d . per cent commission, and would probably haye doubled rates during the war period. Even a taking the pre-war brokerage rate, the !be Commonwealth Bank, in this matter alone, has saved the people £6,000,000. MT . BELL . And it has invested money outside Australia.",111
595,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That is where the private banks invest their money. The biggest private banks carrying on business here have their head office in London, and that is where most of their profits are spent. And yet we have members of the Australian Parliament standing up for the private banks-som e of them foreign institutions-and decrying the bank which belongs to the Australian people. The honourable members to whom .1 refer, represent the people in power in some of the States. They belong to the same party as do some of the State Governments which are deliberately boycotting the Commonwealth Bank.",112

597,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I am not. There are some exceptions. The Tasmanian and 'Queensland Governments are not boycotti n g the Commonwealth Bank, but a persistent boycott has been carried on by State Governments which are obeying the behests of the crowd that ordered the Commonwealth Government to sell the woollen mills. I think the Federal Government is entitled to.say to the State Governments, ' ' Here is a bank which belongs to the people of Australia, whom you represent. This bank is making a profit which will help the people of this country to redeem the national debt. You are handling the money of the people and are depositing it with, private bankssome of them foreign institutions-and so helping them to make profits which will be spent by shareholders, and not altogether to the benefit of the people of Australia.""",112

599,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"When the honourable member for Werriwa moved in this House to extend its operations to r u r a l credits, he met with the opposition of the Government and its supporters, but was supported by the Labour party. Labour Administration established the Commonwealth Bank, and was just getting the Bank "" o n its feet,"" so to speak, when it was defeated. the financial year 1913-14, an Honorary Minister in the Fusion Government, which succeeded the Labour Administration, stumped Australia slandering the Commonwealth Bank.",112

601,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"No , I am merely criticising State Governments who boycott this institution.",112
602,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Nam e them.,112
603,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"To begin with , I shall name the Governments of Vic-' toria and New South Wales. The Victorian Government is handling millions of money belonging to the people and is employing nine private banks to carry on its financial transactions. Four of them haye their head offices in London, and have for the most part foreign shareholders. Not one penny of the dividends they receive goes to the people of Australia. In addition to State Governments quite a number of municipalities, water commissions, harbour trusts,, boards of works, and sewerage bodies boycott the Commonwealth Bank.",112
604,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Is it not a fact that when the Commonwealth Bank was unwilling or unable to do their business these bodies had to go to other banks? Mr Scullin"" - I do not know of any case in which the Commonwealth Bank was unable to do their business, but 1 know that it is a class of business the Bank has been most eager to secure, and has been unable to get. The Commonwealth Government, instead of trying to get busiuess for the Bank from these public bodies, which are boycotting it in the interests of the big-moneyed concerns of this country, neglects to use the power it already possesses to tell the State Governments that their boycotts should cease, and that they must instruct their subsidiary bodies also to cease boycotting the Commonwealth Bank. Seeing that the £7,000,000 we pay to the States each year is subject to any conditions we may seek to impose, we have the power to tell the States that the duplication of expenditure and the consequent waste of public money must cease. It is our duty as custodians of the publio A purse to see that this duplication of expenditure and boycott should - come to an end. If the Government want to square the ledger they should be During extending profit-making public concerns instead of selling them. For instance, they should be carrying out the policy of extending the Commonwealth Woollen Mills as they set themselves out to do a year ago when they proposed to duplicate the plant. Instead of selling the mills they should be establishing scores of similar works throughout Australia. The Clothing Pactory, which has made considerable profits, should also be extended. The Harness Factory is well equipped, and had a splendid staff; it was started in peace times with eighty men, and although I would not expect the staff to be maintained at its full war-time standard, I maintain that it should not be wiped out of existence simply because the Government will not compete with private enterprise, despite the fact that the factory was capable of, earning profits, and was thus helping to reduce the indebtedness of the nation. All of these factories have been successful, and yet they are to be parted with at the instance of private profit-making concerns. Again, a vast field of social reform and sound financing is open to the Government if they would set on foot a national in surance scheme which they have the power to do. The Queensland Government, has already initiated such a scheme with marked success, and in Victoria it has been attempted on a limited scale i u connection with the Workers' Compensation Act, with the result that the premiums have been reduced by 50 per cent. But most public bodies boycott the Victorian Government Insurance Office.",112
605,Mr MACKAY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,In Queensland surance with the State office is compulsory.,113
606,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The right thing was done in Queensland, and the Victorian Government should have followed the same course instead of sending out an army of officials to gather in business. Under a compulsory scheme of insuring with the State office, the premiums would have been collected as cheaply as the in come tax is collected. The policy of the Government should he to provide the cheapest cover of insurance at a minimum of cost, and that can only be secured by eliminating the wastage that now goes on through the payment of agents' commissions. There is a big field open to the Government in this direction. national insurance scheme covering almost every ill , providing not only for sickness and accident, but also against unemployment and old-age, if adopted would enable us to provide at considerably reduced premiums for al l the disabilities suffered by the community.",113
607,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The honourable member is on a better wicket now.,113
608,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It is amusing to find honourable members agreeing to some socialistic principles and decrying others. As a matter of fact the principle which underlies a national insurance scheme is the same as that which underlies national banking, Government Woollen Mills, or Govermnent Clothing Factories. The principle is the collective organization of the people, aud, undoubtedly, the world must progress along the lines of the policy which has been enunciated by the Labour party. I do not wish to delay the Committee at this stage, although there are a number of matters I could touch upon. But I must say that when the Government pretend that they are' reducing taxation, and are merely taking the amount out of a trust fund, they are abusing the meaning of the word when they call it economy. If they expect to secure support at the election because they have remitted taxation, the people will have to be told that this remission of taxation has only been brought about by depleting every Trust Fund that has accumulated in past years. If the Government are to be judged on their financing they must stand condemned in the eyes of the people.",113
609,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Denison) [3.9 in a.m.] - I hope that in the next Parliament some arrangement will be made to avoid such long sittings as we have had this week. Honourable members come to the House about 10 o'clock in the morning, and remain sitting until late at night, and sometimes u n t i l the early morning. No one can stand much of this; the strain is dreadful. T would not have been speaking at this late hour but for the fact that I was desirous of enabling Queenslanders who had given way lo me when I wished to speak on the Public Service Bill and on the Superannuation Bill to speak on a most important matter concerning their State today. I wish to direct the attention of the honourable member for Yarra to a. long article apA pearing in The . World of the 10th inst. It is an able article, written by Mr H o l loway, of the Trades H all , Melbourne, and states very clearly the difference between the Labour party as it was from 1901 until 1916, and the Labour party of today. It is a reply to a Mr Watson, who had defended the party as it was when I and others of this Parliament belonged to it , and is the first honest and clear statement. I have yet read as. to the aims and objects of the Labour party of today as compared with those of the party as it was a few years back. I hope it will be read by every one. H a d the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr . MCGRATH) read it I am sure he would not have called the Assistant. Minister for Repatriation (Mr Hector Lamond) a Labour "" r at , "" or used that abusive language which is constantly applied to those who have never departed in one iota from the platform to which they subscribed, and which still finds a place in Commonwealth law today. Mr . Holloway has pointed out that six of the planks of the platform to which v.e subscribed have never been repealed. I shall carry a copy of this declaration with me during the election campaign, and I feel sure it will be useful. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) knows as well as I do why the Government abandoned their intention to extend the Commonwealth Woollen Mills. It was because the Militar y arrangements for the defence of Australia suddenly changed in common with those of other countries, with the result that it was impossible to place* the output of those mills, unless great warehouses were opened in every big city of Australia.  on buying from their own people.",113

611,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I am glad that the Postmaster-General has reminded me of that fact; it only shows that honourable members should be fair and should not exaggerate in the statements they put before the public. When we get on platforms we shall let the people know the true facts. I hope that honourable will not indulge in accusationssuch as those we have heard from the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page): He is a man for whose personality I have the greatest respect; in fact, to know him is to love him. politics are beyond my comprehension. Why he makes such 'statements as he uttered to-night I do not know. There must be people who relate things to bim and repeat them u n t i l he f u l ly believes them. How could he compare Canada with Australia? In the Dominion the railways are operated by great companies, and the country is developed in an entirely different way. In fact, Canada adopts, to a large extent, the methods of its neighbour, the United States of America. The whole of the Public Service is not discharged after every election, but a big proportion of them may be displaced. In other ways the conditions are entirely different from those in Australia. The honourable member talked also of the great savings that were made in Great Britain . But he did not tell us that during the war the Imperial Government assumed control of the railways, and operated them at an enormous cost. During Government control all railway officials were treated as Government servants, but as soon as the war ended the railways reverted to private control, and the Public Service and Government expenditure generally were correspondingly reduced.  Committee that Great Britain spent £90,000,000 upon the unemployed.",114
612,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"No. I do not advocate a general reduction in wages, because that policy is not economically sound. If all workers are receiving good wages nine-tenths of the money is spent in the community, and the business man and the producer benefit. If a man saves his money, and puts it into the bank, another man borrows it, and applies it to his industry. So how can the country suffer by paying a reasonable and just wage for a fair day's work'(The Nationalist party meets with a good deal of opposition, and is subjected to much criticism, but we need not fear either if we tell the people what has actually been done by the Government during the time they have been in office. Undoubtedly the last few years have been very trying to the Government, and, in deed, to every member of the House, and much of the criticism that is levelled members against us in the press is quite unwarranted. If honourable members will read the biography of the late David Syme they will find that the late Alfred Deakin, in his introduction, wrote that the late Mr Syme was so closely in touch with the But his Government of the State that he practically made Governments, and very often knew from the Premier more about State affairs than did other Ministers. the journal which he established is constantly condemning- "" one-man Government,"" I must say that during the time T have been a member of the Nationalist party I have not seen any undue influence by the Prime Minister. In regard to the vote I gave to-night on the sugar question, how could I , as a Tasmanian, refuse to support an industry that meant so much to Queensland? I could not help remembering with gratitude the assistance which my own State has had from Queensland members. carbide industry, upon the establishment of whioh an enormous sum of money had been spent, was jeopardized by the dumping of foreign carbide, and we asked for increased protection, it was the users of carbide, principally Queenslanders, who came to our assistance. How, then, could I , as an honourable man, help to crush their sugar industry by allowing sugar grown abroad by coloured labour to be admitted upon terms which would enable it to compete with the produce of white Australian labour ? The attitude adopted ' by Victorian members was amazing. They supported a duty of £ 1 4 per ton on beet sugar, but they would not agree to a duty of more than £ 9 6s. 8d. on cane sugar. Their action was. most unfair and ungrateful.",114
613,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Will not the imported cane sugar compete with the beet sugar',115
614,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,No . Why did the Victorians ask for such a high duty on beet sugar ?,115
615,Mr JOWETT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I have never heard any Victorian ask for it .,115
616,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"There was only one serious opponent to the increase of the duty upon carbide, and he was the late Mr James Page, whose death was mainly due to an all-night sitting such as that in which we are now engaged, and he was quite fair to us when we put the case before him.",115

I rose particularly to draw the attention Yet of the Minister for Defence to the following correspondence - tfrat has reached me:- , New Town, 18th April, 1922. Hon. W. H . Laird Smith, M.H.R., House of Representatives, Melbourne. Dear Mr Smith,-May I be permitted to bring to your notice the attached letter which appeared in the Melbourne Argus on the 12th instant. ' The point set out therein is one which is very keenly felt by the people affected thereby, and as' one bf your constituents I would solicit your help, which bas so readily been extended' in the past, in bringing this matter to the When the notice of the Minister :BRITISH WAR MEDALS. To the Editor of the Argus. Sir,-May 1 be permitted to bring to publicnotice the position that has arisen in connection, with the award of British war medals to certain members of the Permanent Forces and others who were retained by the military authorities on home service during the late war. Some eighteen months ago it was decided to make the award to those who fulfilled certain conditions re volunteering for active service, &c. Many of those who were eligible under these conditions-myself included-felt that it was unfair to award the. same distinction as that given to men who had been away from Australia, although we had in some cases been called on to do very exacting and strenuouswork. However, medals were awarded and names published in orders with permission to wear the ribbon. This naturally aroused the resentment of men who had seen service overseas, and forceful representations were made. New conditions were drawn up, medal Boards reassembled, and in the majority of instances the award has been cancelled. This has plaeed men who have been wearing the ribbon for twelve months in a most humiliating position. It is unquestionable that it was not proper to award the medal in the first instance to homeservice men, but the present decision is holding many men who did worthy service up to ridicule. It is suggested that in cases wbere men were retained in Australia and performed good service, the medal of the Order of the British Empire would have been a much more appropriate distinction, and may be the Government will see its way clear to make some such award to those from, whom the privilege of wearing the more valuable ribbon has been withdrawn. - Yours, See., SERGEANT. 11th April.",115
619,Mr FLEMING,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Can . the honourable too member tell us when the Government are going to issue the medals? Mr . LAIRDSMITH - I do not know. I was quite ignorant of the circumstances of the case I am placing before the Committee, and, consequently, I got in touch with as many returned men as possible in order to obtain their opinions. Not one of these men objected in the least tosome distinctive mark being granted to those who had desired to go abroad but were retained here. I have interviewed Defence omcers, and have seen the M in ister, but nothing appears to have been - done in the matter. I suggest that the Minister have an interview with a representative from the returned soldiers and one of the men on whose behalf I have spoken, in order to devise some means of getting over this trouble. Before I sit down I should like to express my deep regret at the enormous reductions proposed in the Wavy. This branch of our Defence Eorces has been worked up to a point of high efficiency, and I sincerely hope that there will be no further interference with it . We have an immense coastline of about 12,000 miles to protect, and to look after in the matter of surveys and so for t h , and the Government would be well advised to retain and keep in commission the vessels they possess, and in conjunction with them work our Aerial Eorce. This would go far to insure - the protection of our - coasts.",115
620,Mr FLEMING,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Eobertson) a.m.] - I cannot promise to be brief, though I should not have risen but for the fact that the Leader of the - Country party (Dr Earle Page) has not been treated to-nigiht with that courtesy which is usually conoeded to leaders in this Chamber. Never before have I seen a leader of a party, when dealing with important matters like the Budget, denied the privilege of an extension of time. But on more than one occasion that honourable gentleman has been rather badly served in this way. He was blocked on the Address-in-Reply, prevented from speaking full y on the sugar question, and now, when dealing with the Budget, which covers the whole of the Commonwealth activities for the year, he is denied a privilege which is very often extended, not only to leaders, * but to private members. It is for that reason that I feel it essential to supplement his remarks. It would seem that one member of the Ministry, at any rate, has a deadly fear of the honourable gentleman's criticism of the Government, for he never misses an opportunity of closing his mouth. I do not blame the Treasurer (Mr Bruce') at all, for I have never seen him act in that way, and I hope I never - shall. One may well ask why it has been found necessary by the Government to force the Budget through. If the Budget is all that the Government claim it to be, surely it could have been brought before the House and dealt with in a proper and thorough-going fashion. It is, of course, quite impossible to give it the attention it deserves under present conditions; and the fact that we are here at this hour dealing with such a matter, is only one more evidence of the unfair manner in which the present Ministry treat honourable members. Much, I think, would be gained if we returned to the common amenities of public life and the ordinary methods of conducting public business. This Parliament has developed some very ugly tricks of "" docking"" members of what are usually considered to be their rights. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) has, in my view, limited in every way the freedom of individual members, and it is because of this, and because of the way in which my Leader has been treated to-night, that I feel it necessary to deal with a few topics even at this unearthly hour. It is an un[3.34 pleasant and dangerous thing to keep honourable members here day and. night. Some of us are sitting on Committees practically all the time we are not actually in the chamber; but we cannot allow those circumstances to interfere with the exercise of proper criticism of the affairs of State. I desire now to quote some remarks of a man in whom I have a good deal of confidence in connection with the present position in Australia. I refer to Sir Thomas Henley, the' ex-Minister for Works in New South Wales- a man of wide experience, who has proved his value and ability to the community both here and overseas. Practically at the end of a valuable career, Sir Thomas made the remarks I am about to quote, at a time when, to use a common phrase, he had "" no axe to grind."" He saidThe Federal Government and our own State Government must face facts. The position is so serious that the State Government will of necessity require to get some relief from Federal domination, this particularly in regard to coal control, high protective Tariff, and industrial interference. Here Sir Thomas mentions the gravest difficulties that we have in Australia today, and the heaviest burdens that haye been imposed on the people. The coal control is a most serious fact in the in dustrial situation. All interested in Australia, as we are, are well aware that there is a vast amount of unemployment in New South Wales, and Australia generally. There should be no unemployment in a young and vigorous country like this. The basic causes are the interference by the Government with free trade in , and the production of, soal; the high protective Tariff, and the way in which the Prime Minister has always handled industrial troubles. have held for twenty years that the actions of the Prime Minister must sooner or later give rise to grave industrial turmoil. When a man perpetually foments discord it is inevitable that he should reap the whirlwind. Sir Thomas Henley went on to sayOur primary industries are today being sacrificed to these causes. Construction costs for railways, bridges, and all that goes to the opening tip of a country, together with the cost of engines and other forms of implements and plant, are excessively high. If the Federal Government could be induced to join the State in relying more upon up-to-date manufacturing plant and efficiency rather than high Tariffs, all that goes to make transport cheaper would be possible. High prohibitive Tariffs to inflate industries in the large cities are retarding fluences upon rural development-the products - of which have to compete in the open markets of the world. Unquestionably, the high Tariff has ruined the development of our primary production. An y one who goes through Australia can observe the effects of the high duties on wire, wire netting, and galvanized iron. In any part of Australia today where primary production is carried on, we may see. the retarding influences of the. high Tariff. The high prices of wire netting, barbed wire, and galvanized iron have allowed two very bad pests to increase in many parts. In the western districts of New South Wales and in the western division of Queensland, holdings have been deserted because of the ravages of dingoes and rabbits. The Government in terference in the coal business has been destructive to secondary industries in the same way as the high Tariff has been destructive to primary industries. Thomas Henley proceedsMy two months' close study of public works and railway construction and management more than confirm my long experience as a builder and contractor, and now, upon leaving office, compels me to speak plainly. doing, I shall, I hope, not be misunderstood, because I have only one interest to serveMr Fleming. the public good. We all believe that the safety and prosperity of our country ore wrapped up in the profitable development of rural Australia, which is our declared policy of closer settlement. It will, therefore, be seen that the key to progress is cheaper railway construction and transport, together with cheaper agricultural machinery, all of which is incompatible with ever-increasing Tariffs. To this end, I am strongly of opinion that both Federal and State Governments should bend their energies and evolve some more equitable system than that which obtains today. Anything I con do to reconcile these forces and assist the Government in rural development, .which I still beI lieve to be the backbone of the country, will have all the strength I can give. Here is a man who has served his country long and well. On leaving that service he gives as his considered, opinion .the causes of our difficulties. The Tariff has not only interfered with primary production by permitting the development of pests, but it has led people into blind alleys and left them there. I have already impressed the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Rodgers) with the seriousness of the position of certain new industries in New South Wales. I refer particularly to the essential oil industry which has inbeen inaugurated in Gosford, in my electorate.",116
621,Mr MCGRATH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I think there should be a quorum present. [Quorum formed.],117
622,Mr FLEMING,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"U n d e r the protection afforded by the T a r i ff the company of. which I am speaking thought it would be safe to fair l y establish itself. Large numbers of settlers and fruit-growers - have been induced to take up small parcels of shares; and they, together with many others in the citrus fruit-growing districts of New South Wales, believed that their future was assured. The shareholders considered 'that the industry ' would be able to pay them a fai r price-provide d that it could carry on-for all .the f r u it which was not good enough for the market. . It was prepared to take the whole of the lemons which <* were beneath ordinary market standard, or the whole of the lemon crop when the Sir f r u it was below a paying price in the 'ordinary market. Further, the company was ready to take and deal with all windfalls, and with inferior oranges. The growers realized that they would be able to sell their superior f r u it for ordiIn so nary consumption, and that, instead of having to plough in their lemons and other fruit, as sometimes happened in previous years, they would be able to sell to the company at a price which would enablethem to pay current expeuses. The company, at great risk, imported some of the essential oil plants from the other side of the world. It imported, and is growing, some of the best perfume-producing plants. Altogether, the industry, if properly developed, would have enabled attractive and healthy occupations to be found for thousands of women throughout Australia, who would be able to grow the plants from which perfumes are expressed. Such an occupation, I need scarcely add, would be infinitely preferable to life in a city office. Altogether, we looked forward to great development; and it seemed to be practically assured. The Government-and particularly the former Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene), and the present Minister (Mr Rodgers)-were sympathetic and helpful. It was, without doubt, their full intention and desire to afford the industry every encouragement and assistance in getting a fair start. If it had been administered in a reasonable and sympathetic manner, the Tariff would have permitted the new industry to grow, and eventually prove of great value to the Commonwealth; but, owing to difficulties in administration, the company has had to close down.",117
623,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member is asking for high protection for his industry, but he was not prepared to givn it in respect of the sugar industry.",118
624,Mr FLEMING,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I am only asking for reasonable administration in connection with the Tariff. The rates of duty are high enough. Yesterday, I received the following telegram from the works manager at Gosford:Closed down works pending granting practicable protection for Australian essential Whole of the fruit-growers are affected. This is a manufacturing industry which has very promising possibilities, but it has been compelled to cease operations just when it anticipated expansion all over Australia. Its doors have had to be elosed because, somewhere, there is a lack of sympathy for this new development.. I again ask the Minister to see that the administrative difficulty is removed, so that the industry may be established soundly, both for the sake of the. settler shareholders and in the interests of citrus fruit-growers. I admit that I am a director of the company. I have informed both the former Minister for Trade and Customs and the present-Minister of that fact. But, as for the direct financial interests which I have in the concern, I may say that they count for almost nothing.",118
625,Mr RODGEKS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The point which the honourable member has raised is purely technical, and depends upon technical information and advice. The chief technical officer of the Department was sent to interview the manager, and, after they had conferred, some relief was afforded.",118
626,Mr FLEMING,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It was only temporary, and the company was unable to carry on for very long afterwards. The result has been-eve n before the factory was compelled to close down-that , as it had to work on a reduced scale, tons of fruit have been left to rot in the orchards which otherwise would have been used.",118
627,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I shall be glad to go into the whole matter again with the honourable member and see if any further relief can be given.,118
628,Mr FLEMING,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I thank the Minister for his sympathetic suggestion. Another very serious matter to which I wish to refer .concerns the drift of the population from the country to the cities. I am afraid that the Australian people have not yet grasped the true seriousness of the situation. The Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) stated during the debate that there was only one country town in New South Wales which has maintained its natural increase during the past ten years. That is the coal mining and manufacturing town of Lithgow. Surely it is a serious thing that in a State like New South Wales country districts should not be able to maintain oils. their natural increase. There are only two districts which have succeeded in doing this during the past decade. They are the Manning and Hunter, which include Newcastle, and the Riverina District, which embraces large irrigation works and takes the overflow from the people of the neighbouring districts of Victoria. There are parts of New South Wales which are capable of producing anything that man .may desire, and in which one would have thought that, the conditions of l if e must 'be all that could - be desired. In these areas, large estates have been cut up ; and one would think, from ' a cunsory view of the countryside, that it was thriving. I have one such area particularly in mind. I know Australia fair l y well, and I can say that there are few other parts which can be said to be more attractive than the one of which I speak. Yet, within its boundaries there are some hundreds of people less than ten years ago, despite the fact that almost half of the large estates have been cut up. Not only has it lost its natural increase, but it has lost some of the population which originally settled there. When one deals with districts which are not so agreeable to live in , the position is shown to be even worse. was brought up in the western districts - of New South Wales. The number of the people there today is less by thousands than when I was a boy. position is most serious.",118
629,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,What is the reason?,119
630,Mr FLEMING,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,L a c k of sympathetic consideration for the man on the land. I attribute it partly to over-taxation and to the unreasonably high cost of materials the settlers have to use. Owing to the high price of netting and barbed wire the dingoes,119
631,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,That is a recent matter.,119
632,Mr FLEMING,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It is not. Nearly thirty years ago I shot the rabbit that was ever seen on one of the best areas in the western division of New South Wales. Owing to the cost of netting being reasonable in the early days, we were able to net our lands and so control the rabbits out there; but of recent years the rtrice of wire netting and barbed wire has been so high that the rabbit and dingo fences have been allowed to into disrepair, with the result that the rabbits and dingoes have overrun large areas out west. That is one reason why the people are forsaking the land. In addition to that, there is the trouble which arises from over-taxation. Much excellent land has also been overrun by prickly pear. Inducements for men to keep the country clear and to get rid of the prickly pear are not offered by the Government. The taxation of the men who have cleared the lands I have in mind is so heavy that they find it is not worthwhile going o n. The lack of consideration extended to these men, and the hardships which taxation imposes upon them, make it not worth their while to go on with the job. I referred recently to the case of a man who took up a lease out west and srjent twelve years in improving it . At the end of that period he' sold for an amount that returned him a little over £2,000. He received £5,000, but out of that amount had to pay off a mortgage amounting to £3,000. The Federal Government, however, made him pay income tax on the whole £5,000, on the basis of one year's profit. As a matter of fact, he had made a profit of only a little over £2,000, and that profit was made, not in twelve months, but in twelve years. It is that I sort of thing that is driving men off the land. We must do away with the burden of taxation which is preventing men from developing the country, is breaking The their hearts, and causing them to give up land settlement.",119
633,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The chief factor which has been responsible for driving men off the land is to be found in the periodical droughts. New South Wales has been particularly unfortunate in that regard.,119
634,Mr FLEMING,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It has not had. during the last ten years as bad a time as it had between t h i r t y and for ty years ago.' In those days, however, people were .going into the country and were encouraging their sons to take up land, whereas tofirst day people are flocking to our cities and land-owners are trying to get tlieir sons into professions or trades. The trouble is not a seasonal one. I wish it were, because the seasons change. The only other matter with which I wish to deal relates to the Post and Telegraph Department. I 'admit that the' pre proof has dealt with his Department quite reafall sonably, in some respects; but, to my mind, the whole position in regard to the Department is unsatisfactory - The Treasurer gave an address some time ago in which he quoted eleven articles of the correct principles of finance. The seventh article was that moneys required for capital purposes must be met out of the revenue savings of the people. If we accept this principle, it follows that the profits derived from the Postal Department should be devcted to the construction of new works for that Department before loan moneys are used for that purpose.  would be impossible for the Department to put forward such a programme as I have submitted. Mr . FLEMING - During the last six years the Postal Department has made a profit of £5,057,0.51, out of which it has expended on .new works only £2,788,718. Postal profits taken by the Treasury during that period amount to £2,162,333. That money has gone into the general revenue, and has been expended on various schemes. In addition to that, the Postal Department has contributed to the general revenue, by way of war tax, £1,407,207. The total taken by - the Treasury from the profits of the Postmaster-General's Department for this period is thus £3,569,540. During the whole of this period the postal and telegraph facilities have been neglected, and, on the Government's own admission, four years of arrears have been allowed to accumulate. Unfortunate women and children in the bush cannot be placed within reasonable access of medical attention, and even suburban services have been seriously restricted. I think that the Postmaster-General is doing something to relieve the position, but the figures I have quoted show that there has not been any true conception of a proper development of the postal, telegraph, and telephone services throughout Australia. These, above all services, should not be expected to return a profit. Every penny made by the Department should be expended on its development. There may come a day- I am afraid it 13 a long way off-whe n Australia will be properly supplied with these conveniences. There is no necessity for me to tell the Committee how essential the services of the Department are to life in the back country, or how essential they are to business. The motor car and the telephone are alone inducing the people to remain in many out-back districts of Australia. If those two facilities were taken away, the drift to the city would be even more alarming than it is. We cannot ask the Government to do anything in the way of providing motor car services, although they might very well reduce the duties on motors of the class generally used in the bush; but we can ask them to make full use of .the telephone and telegraph services. We cau well ask them to devote all the money earned by the Department to the further development of its services, and, in that way, to further safeguard women and children in the back-country who are out of reach of medical assistance. We can ask them, also, to see that the Postal Department is developed on proper lines. Every new telephone line, telegraph line, and mail service established in Australia means increased business for the whole of the Commonwealth. It means increased safety for those in the immediate vicinity of such services, and increased development and production for Australia as a whole. I can assure the Committee that within the last few years there has been a tendency, in some of the outlying districts of the Commonwealth, to go back on the services that have existed for many years. I have in mind a district on the border of Queensland and New South Wales, where a mail service which had been established for nearly forty years was suddenly suspended. There had been no decrease in the population along that mail route, but, without reason, the service was discontinued. The people along the route applied for its resumption, but met with a refusal, and it was only when I went to the Postmaster-General and told him what I personally knew about the district that the service was restored. Had there been no one with a full knowledge of the facts to intervene, these people would have lost a mail service which had been in existence for something like forty years. It seems to me that this is a sufficient condemnation of the way in which the country is being managed. The primary production of Australia is being stifled. People are being taken away from healthy occupations in rural districts to settle in our cities. The Postal Department, which more than any other makes for the comfort and safety of the people in the bush, is beingstarved and made to contribute to the general revenue. The time has arrived when this Australia of ours mustreconsider her policy. We must come down to bed rock. We must realise that it is only - by encouraging the great primary industries of Australia-that it is only by giving the people inducements to go out and add to the production of Australia - that we can bringourselves back to safety.",119
635,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Eranklin) [4.11 a.m.]-In view of the promise made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) last session, 1 thought that we should never again have a political debauch such as we are having to-night. The Treasurer has brought down one of the most i m portant Budgets ever submitted to this Parliament, and we are expected, during what is practically the last night of the session, to deal with .it. It s consideration has been purposely delayed to avoid criticism. I tell the Treasurer, however, that even if the Estimates are not criticised here, they will be criticised freely outside. There is one matter to which I desire at the outset of my remarks to refer, and it is an extremely unpleasant one. I have been in politics for a quarter of a century, bu t never before have I known the Leader of a party in a House of Parliament to be refused an extension of time in order that he might complete his speech on a Budget. In no other Parliament in the British Empire would the Acting Leader of the House object to the Leader of another party criticising his Government. We have witnessed tonight a most disgusting exhibition, and if the Acting Leader of the House is not ashamed of his action in refusing the Leader of the Country Party an extension of time, I am satisfied that three-fourths of his party are.",121
636,Mr HEOTOR LAMOND,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member cannot refer to a Leader of any party in the House of Commons who, within the last few years, has occupied an hour and a half in discussing a Budget. Mr M o WILLIAMS - If the Leader of the Country party transgressed any of the rules of the Committee, then the within six months. Chairman was to blame. If Ministers expect the ordinary courtesies of Parliament and of gentlemen to be extended to them, then the Acting Leader of this House must set a good example. I do not iutend at this hour to at the tempt any serious criticism of the Fisher saidBudget. It would be farcical to do so. We have been sitting continuously for ought sixteen hours, and the Government have posit deliberately withheld the resumption of the Budget debate u n t i l the last moment in order to prevent its proper criticism.",121
637,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT, The honourable member must withdraw that statement.,121
638,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I withdraw it .,121
639,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I also ask that the honourable member for Franklin (Mr . MCWilliams) be called on to withdraw the statement that the Government have deliberately kept back the Budget in order to avoid criticism.,121
640,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT, The honourable member will kindly withdraw that remark.,121
641,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"If I am asked to do so, I will ; but as the Government control the business of the House, and seeing 'that the Budget was delivered weeks ago, if they d id not deliberately hold up the debate upon it , who else could have done so ? ' The surplus shown in the Budget has been produced in an exceedingly simple way, namely, by spending less money than usual out of revenue and more out of loan. All that the Treasurer had to do was to take more out of loan and less out of revenue and he could have shown any surplus he liked. One most serious feature of the Budget is the utilization as revenue of the profit earned by the Australian Notes Fund. I was in this Parliament when the Australian Notes Act was passed in 1911, and the deliberate pledge was given by Mr Andrew Fisher, the then Leader of the Government, that the money earned by the issue of Australian notes would never be used as revenue. Mr Fisher explained that, owing to certain excess payments having to be made to the States, it was his intention to borrow from the Notes Fund for six months the money required; but he said that it would be paid back from revenue ",121
642,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Yes . I can quote what Mr Fisher said. ,121
643,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Yes ; but it is part that deals with the matter. Mr . I am clearly of opinion that the Treasurer to have authority to temporarily dein a bank the moneys raised thereunder, because, obviously, we shall have to accumulate funds before we can buy stock for such an amount as will enable us to deal profitably. is not Some honourable members, I know, have the idea that the moneys to be derived from the issue of Australian notes ought not to be lodged in a bank. . . . I think we are all agreed that the money should be used in the redemption of the Australian notes. The policy of the Government, I repeat, is to use some of the moneys temporarily in order to get over a financial difficulty at the end of the year. Those who were in the House in 1911 will remember that about then there was a considerable payment due to the States under certain provisions of the Constitution which were still in force at that period.",121
644,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Did the honourable member ibelieve that Mr Eisher intended to put the money back into the Fund?,122
645,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Yes . Although I sat in opposition to Mr Fisher for the whole time he and I were in this Parliament, I would accept his word as quickly as I would accept the word of any other honourable this House. I have never of any . one associated who would not have done so. I appeal to those honourable members of the present Government who were associated with Mr Fisher to bear me out in saying that his word could be relied on.  promised to do?",122
646,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"F i r s t let me finish this quotation, because it deals with the point I want to make. Mr Fisher saidThat amount will have to be recouped to the Commonwealth in the succeeding six months of the financial year. ",122
647,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"As the honourable member was a colleague of Mr An drew Fisher, he ought to know what wa3 done. The point I am making is that when the Bil l was passed it was on condition that the profits arising from the issue of notes should be used as a sinking fund for the redemption of the notes or for the reduction of the Commonwealth's indebtedness. Mr Fisher went on to sayFor all practical purposes it would be a loan from this fund to the Consolidated Revenue for the time being, to be repaid during the next six months. The party of which I was then a member, and of which the Deputy Leader of the. House (Mr Greene) and the Attorney General (Mr Groom) were also members, supported an amendment moved by Mr . [150] Edwards to delete the clause which enabled the Government to deal with the fund , and thus make it compulsory for all time that the profits arising from the notes issue should be applied to the liquidation of the notes themselves. That amendment was defeated by nine votes, but no one spoke upon the matter more strongly than did the Attorney-General (Mr Groom), who said I should like the Treasurer to make it clear in the Bill to be introduced later that the money deposited for the notes, and which is to be used for revenue, will subsequently be paid into a trust fundThat promise was given, and any one who reads the debates will see that the only consideration on which the Bill was accepted was that the Notes Fund was to be used for all time for the liquidation of the notes themselves or for the reducmember in tion of the Commonwealth's indebtedheard ness.  member has not raised any objection since then.",122
648,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Because I do not think any Treasurer prior to this has taken money from the fund and utilized it for revenue. When the Bill was passed deliberate pledges were given by the then' Govern1 ment that the profits arising from the notes issue would be placed in a sinking fund for the purposes I have mentioned, and it is dangerous finance to use them as ordinary revenue. For some time past I have complained thab the CJommonwealth Government Line of Steamers has practically joined the Shipping Combine. Instead of assisting in reducing rates of freight between' Australia ° and England, the Commonwealth steamers have been rather the means of preventing any reduction from being brought about. A statement. I got quite recently from the Wheat Board shows that, although they shipped last year's wheat by some seventy-five bottoms, only three vessels of the Commonwealth line could be engaged, owing to the fact that our vessels were charging 5s. per ton more than was being charged by any other line, although at the same time our boats were running practically empty, and some of them were even lying idle in Australian ports. The Wheat Board gave the Commonwealth ships first call always. We have heard the honourable member for Yarra (Mr . Scullin) complain that the States and their instrumentalities wil l not utilize Commonwealth organizations. point out that the Commonwealth G'overnment Line of Steamers, by charging higher rates of than are obtainable from lines, have made it impossible for their vessels to be used. In conjunction with the Combine, they were charging 6s. per bushel freight on f r u it shipped from Australia to England, but, when, owing to the discovery that it was impossible to ship peare in bushel cases, the f r u it growers decided to use what they call trays, three of which go to the bushel measurement, they charged an extra 6d. per bushel. There was only one other line of steamers that followed their example. All other lines trading between Tasmania and Great Britain continued to charge 6e. per bushel. If wo expect Commonwealth utilities to be used, the Commonwealth Line of Steamers must first break away from the Combine. It is useless for the management to. say there is no Combine. Except in the instances I have mentioned, I have not been able to find any difference between the freights charged by our steamers and those charged by what are usually known as the Conference Line. The Prime Minister, in his policy speech at Bendigo on 6th October, 1919, s a i d Seven million tons of British ships lie at ths bottom of the sen. Who owns the other seven million tons? This is controlled by a Conference. 'Sou can call it what you ""like, but I call it a Combine, and it is riot controlled in your interests, but in theirs. This Combine is able to sny where practically every ship over 1,600 tons flying the British 'flag shall go, and they go where they oan get wheat at world's parity. They can get that in Argentine, because there is no competition there, but we have competition hero in an aggregate of 200,000 tons, and as we keep freights down, so must this Combine keep theirs down. The c.i.f. and world's parity are nothing to the farmers, but trade and finance are. The whole question of wheat and the farmer is that of freight. You are up against that shipping trust and credit. Notwithstanding that policy, by the Prime Minister, the Commonwealth Line has done absolutely nothing to reduce the freight on produce Australia and Europe. On the contrary, I have shown that it has deliberately charged more than the Combine. I voted quite recently for the sale of the Geelong Woollen Mills. so reluctantly, because I believe that the Mr MCWilliams. woollen mill was the most successful of all the socialistic ventures in which the Let me Commonwealth has engaged.",122
649,Mr MCGRATH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Shippin g has been a financial success. freight Mr MCWILLIAMS - I am afraid other that is not so. I voted for the sale of the Geelong Woollen Mills because I believed it . was the beginning of a. general policy by which the Government would rid itself of trading enterprises.,123
650,Mr FOLEY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,How did the honourable member vote on the proposal last session to sell the Commonwealth Line of Steamers ?,123
651,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I do not remember, but I will vote now for the sale of the Commonwealth Line, because I believe that instead of helping to reduce freights it has kept them up.",123
652,Mr MCGRATH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The honourable member's party is opposed to him in that regard.,123
653,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The farmers' conference did carry a motion in favour of the retention of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers, but on the floor of this House I recognise no conference. My duty is to my constituency, to Australia, and to my own conscience. I did believe that the Commonwealth Line would be the means of reducing freights. Only within the last few months have I found out that it has had the opposite effect. In respect of the carriage of both wheat and f r u it , the charges of the Commonwealth Line have been higher than those of competinglines, and instead of helping the producers it has penalized them. I am sorry to say that letters which have been shown me from passengers on the Commonwealth ships indicate that there issome truth in the complaint of lack of discipline on them. One lady wrote advising her sister Dot to travel to England' by a Commonwealth ship because her own experience had been unsatisfactory.",123
654,Mr CUNNINGHAM,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That could be said of private lines, too. declaration Mr MCGRATH - Did she advise her sister to travel by a Japanese or German boat ? between Mr MCWILLIAMS - No . I think she and her sister would always prefer to travel under the British flag if they had' Shipping the chance. I anticipated that the Commonwealth Line of Steamers, when I did it was first formed, would be of inestimable value to the producers. But I find that it has linked up deliberately with the Combine, and where its 'freights are not the same, they are even higher than on other ships trading between Australia and England. It is not my intention to discuss the Budget at this hour. You, sir, have not allowed me to say that this debate has been deliberately held back by the Government, but it will take a great deal to convince the public that the remark for which I was called to order was not correct.",123
655,Mr CUNNINGHAM,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Gwydir) [4.36 a.m..] - Like other honourable members, I regret very much that we are called upon to discuss such an important subject as the Budget in the last hours of the Parliament. Many Bills of little or no consequence have engaged the attention of members that could well have been deferred until the Budget had received consideration.. Having made a careful study of the present Government throughout the life of this Parliament, I think they might well be christened "" the calamity Government."" The Ministry is really a half-breed, a union of men with unbridled socialistic tendencies such as .the Prime Minister and a few others, whose enthusiasm got the better of their judgment a few years ago, and a band of reactionary Tories, who, seizing the opportunity to exploit the war hysteria of the people, allied themselves with the socialistic section I have mentioned to gain position and power. Like most half-breeds, the Government has inherited the bad points of both its parents and the good points of neither. Every enterprise Ministers have touched has been calamitous to the taxpayers, who finally have to foot the bill. In the Wireless Agreement there is a blending of Socialism with private enterprise. The Australian people socialistically find the money which private enterprise is to handle. repetition of the story of the "" mug "" and the "" crook."" The Commonwealth - had the money and the company the experience; soon the company may be expected to have the money and the Commonwealth the experience. That has been the result of every scheme with which the Government have been associated, largely because they are controlled by one egotistical Socialist, who, when he was a member of the Labour party, was hard to restrain, but who, since he 'has assumed .the leadership of his present party,' has had licence to do what he liked and spend what he liked, depending at all times upon the capacity of his followers to keep him in office. During the last few months there have been several exposures of the conduct of the Government, which I believe will assist in their undoing when they go before the electors. But those are not their only misdeeds that are on record. The Auditor-General's report for the year 1920 drew attention to the enormous losses incurred by the Commonwealth through contracts entered into in America with the Patterson MCDonald Shipping Company, by the Prime Minister, on behalf - of the Nationalist Government, for the building of wooden ships. No caution was exercised by him as to what the ultimate cost of the vessels would be, and the result was that, although the original contract provided that the cost should not be more than $1,500,000, it was revised and the ultimate cost was $1,780,000 for ten vessels, which were finally sold at a loss of £326,000. The Wallace Power Boat Company, in Sydney, contracted to build six wooden vessels for the Commonwealth. The cost of cancellation of the contract and the progress payments totalled £51,839. Another contract was made with Hughes, Martin and Washington, of Sydney, which resulted in a loss to the Australian people of £72,500. We cannot forget . the lamentable law case of Merton v. Hughes, the cost of which to the Commonwealth we have never been able to ascertain. That case was a result of the egotism of the Prime Minister, and of his failing, which we know only too well, of allowing his tongue to run away with his discretion. Then, there is the litigation in connection with the wool-tops agreement, but we are unable under the circumstances It is a to discuss it here, as the case is sub judice, beyond saying that it appears that the contracts were loosely drawn, and, consequently, capable of honest misinterpretation. We next recall the bungling and mismanagement of the Prime Minister in his sales of Australian wool to (he British Government. I have no hesitation in saying that, as a resuit of those sales, the wool-growers of Australia have lost manv millions of money. One of the chief reasons why the people of Australia are crying out today about heavy war taxation is that the producers, in Australia did not receive war prices for - tlieir produce, such as were received in New Zealand, South A f r i c a , and even in Great B r it a in itself. Sir Joseph - Cook has said that the heavy debt on Australia is due to the fact that this country did "" more than her fair share during the war."" We sold our wool at a flat rate of ls. 3£d. per lb., and the loss sustained by the Australian grower did not benefit the British peopleas a whole. Much of the wool was sold to private speculators and spinners and weavers in France and Great Britain , so that our loss was not the gain, altogether, of our British fellow subjects. The profits went into the pockets of a few people, and that is why today we are under such a heavy burden of taxation, and why we have not the reserves of capital, which we should have gained during the war, to help us over this period of war taxation. - Of course, there are many wool-growers who say that they are perfectly satisfied with the price that they received, but that is only because owing to the War Precautions Act information could not be given as to what was the real value of the wool. Much of the wool bought or acquired at ls. 3^d. was subsequently sold at prices ranging up to 6s., and, when manufactured into tops, to 9s. per lb. The Government must be held responsible for having made this loss for the people of Australia.",124
656,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"There wool-grower who is not satisfied, and more than satisfied, with the ls. 3i.",125
657,Mr CUNNINGHAM,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"T h o s e men were satisfied because of the comparatively low prices received previously, but the price they got was not as high as the wool-growers of Britain , South Africa , or Canada received. It did not compensate for the enormous expenditure we were incurring owing, to our participation in the war, and it explains why so many wool-growers are complaining now about excessive taxation. On the other hand, the Canadian receipts from overseas sales during the war balanced the war expenditure of the Dominion ; and the people of Canada are in a much better position than we are, because business men, and not bunglers, were in control of their affairs. I venture to say that the most ardent supporter of the Prime Minister dare not stand up and maintain that he has a knowledge of proper business methods. He has involved us in litigation due to loosely-drawn contracts, and we have to take into account also the sparse legal knowledge he possesses. The adage that "" A little knowledge is a dangerous t h in g "" is particularly applicable to the legal profession, and the Prime Minister's lack of legal knowledge is responsible for the-bungling in the sales and contracts I have mentioned.",125
658,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Of course, you know that the Prime "" Minister is a barrister",125
659,Mr CUNNINGHAM,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The r e are barristers and barristers, just as there are doctors and doctors; the fact that a man bears the stamp of a barrister does not constitute him a reliable legal authority. As a matter of fact, since the Prime M in ister qualified, the regulations as to examinations have been tightened up considerably, so that at the present time it is a much more difficult thing to be called to the Bar. To constitute a legal author it y requires years of practice and experience, and of these the Prime Minister has not had the advantage, for he has devoted his l if e to the altogether different line of politics. Of course, we know that his egotism leads him to believe that in this, as in everything else, he is the greatest authority. I have mentioned the Wireless Agreement, and now I have to refer to the Oil Agreement. Even a Tory paper like is not a the Sydney Daily Telegraph has found it necessary, in the public interest, to publish a series of articles in order to expose the u n f a ir deal represented in the Agreement into which the Commonwealth entered at the instigation of the Prime Minister. I ignore the other Ministers, because the Prime Minister absolutely rules the Cabinet, the others being cyphers. - Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE - He does not rule me at all ; let him try it on.",125
660,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,He is only repeating what the press says.,125
661,Mr CUNNINGHAM,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That is not so, for I am speaking from the experience of three years of Parliament. W it h all his"" faults, even the Prime Minister would not be guilty of what the Minister for Defence (Mr Greene) did to-night to the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page), who may be the Prime Minister in the next Government. Events in ""Melbourne during the last couple of days show that the great body of business men are waking up to the bungling mismanagement and incapacity of this Government.",125
662,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The Leader of the Country party had spoken for an hour and thirty-five minutes, and I did not see the necessity for him going on.",126
663,Mr CUNNINGHAM,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The Minister has never in like circumstances been denied the privilege, and, seeing that the Prime Minister had made a definite promise that there would be ful l opportunity to discuss the Budget, the least the Prime Minister's henchman could have done was to extend the usual courtesy to the Leader of the Country party. I can quite understand that those who are opposed to honourable members on this side will, when before the electors, endeavour to misrepresent what are the ideals and objects of the Labour party. We have always stood for living in peace with our fellow men of the world; we wish to develop our resources peacefully, and let the people of all other countries do likewise. Australia occupies an insular position, and she has no desire to acquire any other people's territory. There have been occasions in the past when private individuals engaged in the manufacture of munitions have not hesitated to sow the seeds of rancour between peoples; and have, in consequence, reaped enormous profits through the prosecution of warfare. Ixi tihe past few weeks it has been shown that the Prime Minister is not as cautious as he might be in regard to committing this country to war. Let us remember his reply to Mr Lloyd George's hastily sent"" message asking for assistance in connection with the difficulty in near East. The Prime Minister, without inquiring whether Mr Lloyd George was right or wrong, immediately replied that Australia woiild, if necessary, engage in war. That was not the attitude of either the Prime Minister of Canada or the Prime Minister of South Africa, nor is it the attitude of the Labour party in Australia. Caution is supposed to be the prerogative of the Tory section which sit opposite, but it is only displayed in regard to their banking account, not in regard to human life except their own. We say that if there is any caution to be exercised in such a stupendous thing as war, it should be exercised before rushing blindly behind Mr Lloyd George or any other man who is likely to let hia enthusiasm run away with his judgment. It is quite possible for a man like Mr. Lloyd George to have his vision distorted by reason of the great strain he has gone through in the past few years. Moreover, it is quite possible that parties to the national combine of munition maker* may pull the strings and precipitate a war which would involve, not only the British Empire, but the world, in calamity. Every .member of this House might well record his views on this matter, in order that the attitude we take up here may be universally k n o w . The Labour party say that every possible avenue of reconciliation should be exploited before war is precipitated/ The Government have said, time and again, that they desire to bring about constitutional reform; yet nothing has been done. The activities of the Federal Government are hampered because of the clash of State and Federal authority. The Prime Minister has said, and continually repeats, that he is desirous of introducing constitutional reform. The Leader of the Country Party (Dr Earle Page) was promised that the Government would introduce a measure to refer proposed Constitution amendments to the people, so giving Parliament adequate opportunity to discuss the various proposals. It was expected, by probably every member of Parliament, that, at the forthcoming election, referenda would be taken upon this matter. There is great waste today because of the duplication of State and Commonwealth activities. And, the since the object of the Federation was that Australia might become one nation and speak with one voice, I maintain that no opportunity should be lost of bringing about that desirable state. Powers are held by the States today which rightly belong to the Commonwealth. The framers of the Constitution thought that they had clearly provided for those powers to be held by the Federal Government; but the High Court has ruled otherwise. I believe that if the proposed amendments were placed before the people they would be very generally endorsed. We are handicapped, in various parts of Australia, by the inadequacy of rail communication-particularly , near to the State boundaries; and by the paucity of harbors. ""We cannot establish more ports around our coastline because of the "" p u l l "" of the great coastal cities. If projects of this character were brought before the Federal Parliament for review and decision-, they would not be hampered by parochial considerations. jealousies of States and of the various cities would not come so markedly into play, and there would assuredly be greater development of the ports of the Commonwealth. Sydney virtually controls New South Wales, ancl Melbourne prevents the opening up of additional ports along the Victorian coastline. I saw, when visiting Western Australia some time ago, a beautifu l harbour site in the division of Kalgoorlie ; but it was not being utilized because of the influence of Perth and Fremantle.",126
664,Mr FOLEY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The harbour to which the honourable member refers is now being opened up and developed.,127
665,Mr CUNNING,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"HAM - It should have been opened up thirty years ago. The wheat land behind the port would"" then have bepn exploited and developed, and, as a result, there would have been thousands of settlers using the port for the transport of their produce; and, instead of Western Australia having a deficit year after year, the State would be forging ahead. Similar criticism, may be applied to New South WfJes.  Ian^?",127
666,Mr CUNNINGHAM,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Queenslan d is not so badly served. It has five or six ports along its coastline, and its railways have been constructedat right angles to the coast rather than parallel with it. The district in which I was born affords an' example of the inadequacy of communication, and of the need for developmental services. I live, approximately, 120 miles from the coast. If I desire to ship goods they have to be sent inland, and after going 100 miles are further away from Sydney than when they started. In a direct line, my neighbourhood is 368 miles from Sydney; but the distance by rail is 509 miles.",127
667,Mr FOLEY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Does the honourable member 'favour the idea of the Commonwealth taking over the railways?,127
668,Mr CUNNINGHAM,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Yes . - ways are a national utility; and, when considering .projects of such a character, one must bear in mind their possibilities under war conditions. The efliciency of the Commonwealth's railway services would be tremendously enhanced by the elimination of breaks of gauge. Tf, from thu beginning, Australia had had one The controlling .authority ""in the matter of railway construction, we would not now be faced with the enormous task of bringing about unification. I think that there could be devised a practical scheme for the inauguration of unification. Trunk lines between the chief capitals should first be unified; but it would be bad business to scrap our rolling-stock forthwith, in view of the enormous debt which the Commonwealth had to incur in connection with the war. I do not favour Tushing blindly into the expenditure of large sums of money. As a small landholder, and having worked practically all my life on the land, I have learned to be cautious. The fault of the Prime Minister is that, so long as he is free to do so, he will go right ahead with his projects, irrespective of cost. When the Government are compelled to keep within the four corners of an economical financial policy, there is trouble.  lions upon postal services, and the honourable member has always advocated that I should do so. Mr CUNNINGHAM:- I have not asked for the expenditure of one penny which has not been more than justified.  takes pride in the fact that he proposes to spend £9,750,000 in the netft few years. The fact that it has become necessary to spend so much upon the services of the Postmaster-General's Department, in order to overtake the leeway, shows that the policy of the Government in. the past has broken down. The policy of those services is like the running of a lift in a tall business building. The lift does not' pay "" on its own,"" but the building would be useless unless a lift were installed. People will not live in the back country unless we supply them with adequate mail and telephone services. These the people have a right to expect, and the Government that fails to Eailsupply thera has not a proper appreciation of the functions of government. The Labour party has always been prepared to expend large sums of money in the provision of these very necessary services. At no period in the history of the Commonwealth were more telephone lines erected and more money expended in connection with the Postal Department than during the regime of the Labour Government. When Labour went out of office the starving of the Department began, and it was starved to such, an extent that the Postrnaster-'Geueral must now come forward with a costly scheme in the endeavour to catch up with the arrears.  to do with the trouble.",127
669,Mr CUNNINGHAM,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It started before the war. I dare say the honourable gentleman will say that owing to the war supplies of material could not be obtained.  not only of material, but of money.",128
670,Mr CUNNINGHAM,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,This Parliament has never asked for a curtailment of the expenditure of the Department. The honourable gentleman will not say that mail services were cut down because of shortage of supplies due to war conditions.  very often because of a reduced t r a in service.,128
671,Mr CUNNINGHAM,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I know of mail services adjacent to railway lines that were cut down, although there was no alteration in the railway service. Many mail services were cut out because or the false cry for economy preached by the Age and the Argus, l t is all very well for the city press, which has the advantage of a post-office "" round 'the corner,"" to urge the reduction of these services, but we have to think of the people in the back country who have to submit to many inconveniences, and who should not be deprived of their only link civilization. I have mentioned the bungling that has taken place in connection with various contracts entered into by this Government. I could add to the list I have given. There are, for instance, the KidmanMayoh ships, and the contract for the building of wooden ships, the facts in relation to which have been fully placed before meur, by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony). The KidmanMayoh death ships have also been dealt - with at length by the honourable member  unnecessary, therefore, for me to say more than that, in connection with the KidmanMayoh ship contracts, the Commonwealth has sustained a loss of upwards of ..£75,000. The wooden ships were con- (structed. at a cost of £162,000 each, and five of them have been sold for £2,000 each. That surely is a. monument to governmental incapacity and mismanagement. We have in those cases an illustration of this Government at its worse. Mismanagement and bungling in connection with such enterprises must bring about disaster, just as the bad management of private undertakings leads to bankruptcy. The Commonwealth Bank is a gigantic success because it is well managed. In the ranks of the Nationalist party there are men who would alter the management, and whose ultimate object would appear to be the undermining and wiping out of the Bank. The Labour party wants the powers of that institution to be widened. On 2nd September, 1920, the honourable member for Calare (Mr . Lavelle) moved an amendment of the Commonwealth Bank Bill to the effect that the powers of the Commonwealth Bank be widened with a view to establishing it ae a bank of issue, deposit, exchange,- and reserve, with non-political management, and so as to provide for a comprehensive system of home loans and rural credits. The honourable member, in attempting to put the case for such an extension of the functions of the Bank, was "" gagged,"" and not one member of either the Country or the Nationalist party voted with the Labour party on that great question. The Country party, knowing that we have never wavered in our hostility to the Government, refused to support a. proposal by a member of our party that was calculated to be cf with great benefit .to the settlers and wage earners of Australia. The Country party, because its Leader was ""gagged "" tonight, is angry, as it has a right to be; but when the honourable member for Calare was "" gagged "" while attempting-to put the case for the extension of the operations of the Commonwealth Bank, so as to provide, amongst other things, for a system of rural credits., its memParliabers voted against us. UP to date the profit on the Commonwealth note issue, which was decried by the Tory reactionaries, amounts to £10,000,000. The - Commonwealth Bank itself shows a profit of £4,000,000. Yet we are told that Labour is not to be given credit for having established these utilities. We stand, also, for national insurance, which this Government will uot take up. The Prime Minister, in his policy speech at the opening of the last election campaign, promised that action would be taken by the Government to insure provision for old age. But nothin? has been done. The Queensland State insurance system is one of the most striking examples of efficient management and of the wisdom of collective action that can be quoted. In efliciency it is second to the Commonwealth Bank.  thickly.",128
672,Mr CUNNINGHAM,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"-The honourable member poses as an authority on insurance matters. Will he deny that the Queensland State insurance rates are lower than those of any private insurance company? Will he deny that the Queensland State insurance rates in regard to workers compensation are lower and the compensation higher than those of any private company? I would refer those who say we must have immigration for the settlement of this country to a statement made recently by the manager of, I think, the City Mutual Insurance Company, who said that if national insurance were adopted by the Commonwealth on lines similar to those followed by the Queensland Government, it would result in 50,000 additional men going into productive industry. He was referring to the army of canvassers employed by private insurance companies. Owing to the fact that such companies return very much less per £100 collected than does the Queensland State insurance scheme, they have to employ thousands of canvassers. They employ far more than are necessary in connection with the State scheme, under which every employer must insure those working for him. I had, some time ago, an example of the value of the State insurance scheme. A boy working for a contractor on the New South Wales side of the border was injured. The contractor was a man of straw, and the lad could obtain no compensation from him. On the Queensland side of the border, however, a boy lost his arm on the first day that he started to work, and he received compensation from the Queensland State Insurance Oflice, notwithstanding that we had not had time to fill in the necessary papers and send them into the office. In Queensland, as soon as a man starts to work, he becomes automatically insured under the State insurance scheme. It is impossible to over-estimate the importance of such a system to ""workmen, especially to those who may be working for men of straw or men who for some reason or other fail to insure their employees. It may be said that in the other States a worker who is injured may secure compensation by going to law. But what is only the use of going to law with a man who has nothing? The Queensland Governtoo ment Insurance Office, as I have said, automatically insures every man as soon as he starts to work, and if the Commonwealth Government had the welfare of the people at heart it would branch out in the same direction.  Labour Government bring in such a Mr CUNNINGHAM.""-Because , I suppose, there were amongst its members at the time men of the type of the honourable gentleman, who would, no doubt, be a ""brake"" on such a progressive policy. We are very disappointed that no provision has been made for increasing the invalid and old-age pensions. If economies were carried out in directions that might well be followed the old-age and invalid pensions could be so increased that the pioneers of this country would at least receive a pension sufficient to provide for their scanty needs. ' This they do not receive today. This Government is callous to the last degree in regard to, not only old-age pensions, but war pensions. Within the last few weeks a determined effort has been made by a Government supporter in another place to force the hands of the Government and to compel them to grant a reasonable pension to soldiers who have been incapacitated. I would particularly draw attention to the many hard cases amongst the returned men who were gassed. These men are treated most unsympathetically by the Medical Board. That Board is given a discretionary power under the amending Act. When that measure was before the House the Labour party vigorously opposed one of its provisions to the effect that if the Medical Poard was of the opinion that the incapacity or illness of a returned soldier was not substantially due to warlike operations he might bo deprived of his pension. The Leader of the Country party, as a medical man, will tell the Committee that many men who have been gaesed may look all right today and yet be totally unfit to work tomorrow. I know a man who was gassed and who before the war was an excellent shearer. His pension has been cut down. He tries very hard to work, but the effect of the gassing on his system is such that while he may be quite well one day he is almost unable to move the next. There is no excuse for the Government in refusing to treat these men sympathetically. The extra cost would be very small. Thore is an enormous waste of expenditure in the duplication of Government activities, the keeping up of many useless Parliaments, the maintenance of State Governors, and the duplication of Public Services, such as the Electoral and Taxation Departments. Economy could be exercised in these directions. Some people believe that chaos would follow the abolition of State Parliaments, but that is because they are not yet prepared to, trust the Commonwealth Parliament to legislate for the whole of Australia. When taxpayers are complaining of the hardships imposed on them by reason of the enormous increase in public expenditure and in the cost of government, both State and Federal, it is only right - to point out that a considerable reduction in expenditure could be brought about by the States handing over to the Commonwealth those powers which are essentially of a national character, and by carrying out the Labour party's policy of subdividing the States. Some of our friends in the Corner are very enthusiastic about the creation of new States. So are we. The principle which we advocate is to break down the vast territories controlled by the local authorities, which the State Governments really are. We believe that most of the powers enjoyed by the State Parliaments are of a national character, and that the remainder, which are of a purely local nature, could be delegated to provincial councils. Australia is the laughing-stock of the world, with its seven Parliaments, seven representatives of Royalty, and over 700 members of Parliament for a population of a little over 5,000,000 people.",129
673,Mr ROBERT COOK,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,There are good men in the State Parliaments.,130
674,Mr CUNNINGHAM,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Certainl y there are in those Houses which are elected by the people, but many in those most undemocratic Houses which are not elected by the people are not. No one has a right to legislate unless he has been elected by the will of the people. In Queensland, after lengthy litigation and deliberation, the Legislative - Council, in pursuance of the Labour party's policy, has been wiped out, and now one Chamber accepts the responsibility of legislating for the whole State. There is no longer any opportunity in Queensland for a vacillating Government to submit legislation that it knows will be rejected by the Legislative Council. The Queensland Government, which deserve the thanks of the people of Australia for - having taken the step of wiping out a reactionary Legislative Chamber, has shown one means by which the cost of government can be cheapened. Some people advocate the reduction of public servants' salaries, but the Labour party contend that the State should be ideal employers. A very severe test is imposed on all persons who enter the Public Service. They must be of excellent character. They must be possessed of an education above the ordinary; and, as in the majority of cases, we prevent them from doing other work, it is our duty to recompense them generously. No reduction in the cost of government should take place at the expense of those whom we induce to enter our service. A New South Wales anti-Labour Government once endeavoured to do so by withholding the increments to which schoo? teachers were entitled. The result w&* that many school teachers left the Service, and today there are many persons who have grown up in the State without the education they should, have received. It is false economy to endeavour to pay our public servantsless than private employers will pay for men possessing ability. In a new country like this where we shall double the population in the next twenty years there are great opportunities for men with initiative, and private employers are only too thankful to get men from Government Services. I am sorry to see, although I expected it , that certain utilities established by the Labour Government, the Clothing Factory and the 'Commonwealth ""Woollen Mills, are to be disposed of, apparently at the behest of those who contribute to the party funds of the National Government. These people fear the prospect of the Commonwealth Government entering into competition with them, and as they pay the piper by providing funds for the National party they are calling the tune by compelling the Government to get rid of such excellent investments, which have saved the people enormous sums of money. Riding breeches, which cost 30s. per pair at the beginning of the war when supplied by private firms, were produced by the Clothing Factory at l is . 6d. per pair. The Woollen Mills have saved the country hundreds of thousands of pounds, and, at the same time, earned good profits. They have been able to sell their output at prices which the exploiting middleman in Melbourne could not touch.",130
675,Mr ROBERT COOK,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,If the workers in the Commonwealth Woollen Mills have done so well why do they not buy them out?,131
676,Mr CUNNINGHAM,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The workers are doing this good work through the Government.,131
677,Mr ROBERT COOK,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"But have lost £5,000,000 in strikes during the last few years. They have lost more money than it would cost them to buy out these mills.",131
678,Mr CUNNINGHAM,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"No doubt the honourable member is a most enthusiastic follower of Mr Lloyd George, but has he ever attempted to arrive at the cost of the recent war, when men were engaged in destruction, instead of following peaceful avocations? It is all very well for the honourable member to talk of the losses caused by strikes, but he must apportion the blame. Very often strikes are caused by employers.",131
679,Mr ROBERT COOK,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I see that point.,131
680,Mr CUNNINGHAM,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"E f f i c i e n vernment control is the highest for m of cooperation. It means the doing of things by the people collectively which, individual! v, they are not f?ble to accomplish. Owing to pressure brought to bear on the Government they would like to - destroy the effectiveness of the , Commonwealth Conciliation aud A r b it r ation Court by the unsympathetic administratiou of the Justice who is President of that Tribunal, and by the appointment of a mau like Mr . Atlee H u n t to arbitrate for the Public Service, and do everything to put the public servants in such a temper as will probably do more than would anything else to bring about industrial unrest. . On the Government rests the responsibility for preserving industrial peace, and they will be called to account by the people of Australia for any action which tends to result in an upheaval. Under Mr Justice Higgins the Arbitration Court was a Court of conciliation and arbitration, but, rightly or wrongly, we declare that the present occupier of the position, the President of the Court, is a man who, unfortunately for the employees of Australia, has too narrow a vision, and is too inexperienced as a judge.",131
681,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT, The honourable member cannot reflect on a Justice of the High Court except upon a special motion.,131
682,Mr CUNNINGHAM,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I have heard the Prime Minister referring to Mr Justice Higgins in most scathing terms, and, as one who has worked in an industry in which his Honour kept industrial peace for a number of years, I thought that, at m y rate, I might refute the right honour the workers able gentleman's comments upon one who has done more than any one else to create respect for the Arbitration Court. Whether the Government are aware of it or not, for all practical purposes that Court is now dead, because no workers will approach it with any degree of confidence that they will receive justice. They believe that the Court is being administered unsympathetically. I could not take up any other attitude in regard to the matter, and if I cannot say here what I wish to say in regard to the gentleman who now occupies the position of President of the Court, I shall certainly say it outside. I warn those men who may not come into t Go- close contact with the wage-earners that for al l practical purposes the Commonwealth Arbitration Court is dead, so that they may not be surprised if they find that it fails to bring about the results that they expect. It would be wrong for me to conclude without making reference to the plight of the primary producers, who have not received sympathetic consideration from the Government or a majority of the members of this Parliament. For instance, I moved last year an. amendment to the Income Tax Assessment Bill that involved a reduction of the burden of taxation in regard to the natural increase of stock. Honourable members in the Corner, who claim that they represent country interests, voted against my amendment.",131
683,Mr BOBERT COOK,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Because a Royal Commission was inquiring into the mat. ter.,132
684,Mr CUNNINGHAM,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,A Royal Commission is not required to inquire into what everybody knows to be correct. The honourable miemiber for Franklin (Mr. MCWilliams) did mot wait for a Royal Commission to report.,132
685,Mr ROBERT COOK,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,That electioneering .stunt will not go down in my electorate.,132
686,Mr CUNNINGHAM,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"On e cannot refer to the misdeeds of the honourable member's party without 'being accused of engaging in an electioneering stunt. If the honourable member had only showed as much concern for the primary producers as he showed for keeping the Government in power, my amendment would have been carried, and many men upon) the land would have been relieved of taxation amounting to hundreds of pounds. But the Country party failed miserably, because it decided in favour of this bungling mismanaging Government in preference to the primary producers. Honourable members in the Corner are continually saying, ""Look at what we have accomplished."" They have accomplished nothing. In the final, resort, the Prime Minister has always snapped his fingers at 'them. When they claim credit for having achieved some good, let them also accept responsibility for having kept the present Government in power. And what greater crime could they commit than to keep in office a Government with such a long record of calamities? We need not wonder that the taxation is heavy when we know that the Government's blundering has resulted in the loss of millions of pounds in connection with the sales of wheat and wool, the wireless agreement, and the shipbuilding, contracts. People like Kidman and Mayoh have waxed fat through taking advantage of the Government. Yet the members of the Comer party have always voted to keep the latter in power. As a political party they have failed miserably, having succumbed to the bluff of the Prime Minister on every occasion. It cannot be said that the Labour party was responsible for keeping the Government in office. We have 'been consistent in our hostility to the Governmenit when the welfare of the people was concerned. On many occasions, reforms could have been carried in spite of the Government-in connection with the Income Tax Assessment Bill, for instance-if honourable members in the Corner had merely indicated to the Ministerial Whip that they intended to vote against the Government. The Prime Minister would have climbed down, rather than risk a defeat, because he would hang on to power at all costs. In business circles the idea prevails that a man is "" on a good wicket"" if he can make a contract with this Government, and afterwards ask for it to be cancelled.. I wish to draw attention to the action of the Government in handing over £32,500 to speculators in South Africa, who, according to the Prime Minister's own words, had no claim upon the - Commonwealth. The Wheat Board also handed over £82,500 to those people. These payments arose out of the sale of inferior flour by millers in Australia to speculators in South Africa. There was no obligation upon the Government or the Wheat Board to pay over any money to the speculators, and in doing so they were guilty of maladministration of the worse description. The first intimation we had of the matter was a statement in the press that there was trouble in South Africa over the purchase of inferior Australian flour. On the 23rd September, 1920, the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) asked a question in the House regarding a complaint from South African bakers and merchants as to the quality of B grade Australian flour and the alleged unreliability of Commonwealth Wheat Board certificates. .The. Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) replied-- I spoke to Mr Oman about this matter at the conference to which I have already referred. In the first place, the Wheat Pool is not re-, sponsible for the sale of the flour. It sella - wheat; it does not sell flour. The millers sold - this flour. In the second place, the flour, which had been gristed from damaged Victorian second-quality wheat, which had been recon- ditioned, and was described as B grade, ^yas - sold upon sample, a parcel of 270 tons having been sent as a sample, and subsequent shipments were up to that sample. But it was sold - np to sample by the millers, and not by the Wheat Pool. . . . However, South Africa - bought to sample. . . . That statement disposes of the suggestion ""that the men in South A f r i ca were taken down."" On the 24th September, the honourable member for Capricornia asked whether the Government would in vite the South A f r i c a n Government to appoint some one to inquire whether the ' Commonwealth Government or the Wheat Hoard had anything whatever to do with the export of alleged inferior flour. The Prime Minister repliedSo far as I am aware, the South African Government has no direct representative here. I spoke recently, quite properly, in severe terms of those who send from Australia goods that were not true to sample, and, what is more, were not of first quality. But I think I can say publicly-and I hope the press will take note of the statement-that the South Africans have nothing to complain of in regard to this deal. They bought from sample, and the goods supplied are true to sample. . . . I am now informed by my colleague that no certificates were issued, and, therefore, no Government oflicials whatever are or could be implicated in any way. Ou the 22nd A p r i l , 1921, in reply to a question asked by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Marks), the Prime Minister said I want only to say that I think it is the duty of this Government to see that not only the reputation and honour of Australia, but its material interests, are safeguarded by putting the inatter right. If it involves the payment of ""compensation, then the compensation must be made, and the Commonwealth ought to see, as - far as it has power, that it is made by the people who are primarily responsible. . . . Cn the 27th A p r i l , 1921, Mr Riley askedIn view of the Prime Minister's statement Inst week that injury was done to this country by the exportation of bad wheat to South Africa, will the right honourable gentleman, before he leaves for England, publish the names of the persons responsible?",132
687,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I have not yet obtained the names of those to whom I referred, but I have communicated with the Premiers of the wheat producing States, and have also asked for a statement from the Central Wheat Board. My right honourable colleague the Treasurer, who, during my absence, will act as Prime Minister, will make this information public as soon as it comes to hand. ilr. Cunningham.  ing statements we have heard are true they are calculated to bring great discredit on Australia. Does the Prime Minister not think the position serious enough to justify the appointment of some kind of Committee of Inquiry in . order to sheet the charges home to the culprits who are responsible?",133
688,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I certainly do. . . . On 16th June, 1921, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr M a k in ) saidIt is stated in the South African newspapers that the sending of unwholesome flour to that country from Australia recently was due, not merely to slipshod methods, but to the do.vnright dishonesty of the exporters. I ask the Acting Prime Minister if inquiry has been mode into the facts, and, if not, I ask that it may be made, so that the prestige of Australian exports may be maintained.",133
689,Sir JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The matter is under very serious consideration. Inferior flour was certainly sent to South Africa, but so far this is one of those cases in which nobody seems to be to blame. We are trying to get to the bottom of it, with a view to doing what the honourable member thinks should be done. 1 hope he will leave it at that for the moment. This brings the matter up to the 13 th July of the present year. When the* honourable member for Corangamite (Mr . Gibson), speaking with regard to this matter, said",133
690,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"On a point of order, I call attention to the fact that the honourable member is about to quote from Hansard of this session.",133
691,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT, The honourable member may not do that.,133
692,Mr CUNNINGHAM,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I am able to relate the incident from memory. The honourable member for Corangamite said, in reply to a question by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) as to why the Government intended to pay over the money, that £32,500 was involved, and that it was a matter of blackmail-that the bludgeon had been held at the head of the Government, and the Government had paid. At a later date, when the Prime Minister was asked a question, he said that not only was the Commonwealth Government not responsible, but that the connection of the Wheat Board was very remote, that the Wheat Board sold the wheat but did not sell the flour, and the f a u l t lay with the millers. Then the honourable member for Hunter - (Mr Charlton) asked what was the amount of compensation intended to be paid, and would the Prime Minister make available the names of the firms concerned, and he received one of - the most weird replies it has ever been thei lot of an honourable memher to receive from a responsible Minister. The Prime Minister replied that it had been decided to pay this compensation, and that the amount that the speculators in South Africa were to receive was £115,000, of which the Wheat Board waa to find £82,500 odd, and the Commonwealth £32,500 odd. The Prime Minister added that it was a voluntary payment, and that there was no claim, on the Commonwealth Government.",133

No pen-son in the posibut, tion of a trustee would dream of paying 'out trust funds unless there was a legal claim-the man who did so would be sonally liable for the amount. would imagine that the people who bought were men who went about with their eyes shut. In my view, this is but another of those sinister examples of ' ' hush it up "" on the part of this mitous Government-the smothering u of their friends, who were, perhaps, tributors to that dole of £25,000 the Commonwealth.

To that expression of hope the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill"") replied, "" No fear I "" To mark the closing chapter of this most discreditable and unseemly exhibition of incapacity and bungling, 1 this week asked the Treasurer what had been done in regard to the matter, and I was informed that the money had been paid over.",134

That may be said of their experiences from the moment when they first stepped into a transport to the day of their return home. The National, Government gave them a privilege possessed hy no other soldiers who had fought either for or against Great Britain . They were given civil rights superior to their militank tary obligations, and they appreciated",135

But , most instances, the fault-wher e there has been fault-canno t be laid at the - door of the Federal Parliament or GoI want to see settlement repushed aihead. I am glad that the Government have taken important steps in that direction. In Western Australia the group settlement scheme has been .proved n afa success. Companies of six to ten men go out upon new land, and band together After with that operation, they act on their own responsibilities, . and devote . themselves to their own blocks. That form of pioneering has done incalculable good. Reof cently, the Prime Minister visited the. . southern portion of Western Australia and t inspected conditions of soldier settlement for. himself. He saw men working away happily who, only three months before, had been employed on the wharfs at FreThey said that wild horses But they would not drag them back again. U n fortunately, there is something lacking in the selection of immigrants in England. We cannot expect them to be as good as our own artisans and others who make , a on the land, even without previous experience. Newcomers from overseas should be put to work under experienced in supervision. They should be taught the way to clear their land.and get ahead rewith their' first crop. They need to be' placed initially under tihe control of a good practical man. I am glad that the have seen their way clear to remove, the Tariff imposts upon agricul-' tural tractors. Far more can be done in the direction of benefiting new settlers by .means of clearing the land with machionly nery than could have been done under the old manual methods. At Bridgetown, the in Western Australia, the Prime Minister and I had lunch at 1 o'clock in the afternoon. Before sitting down to our meal we noticed a truck at the railway station - on which was a Whippet tank and a fourdisc plough. Later in the afternoon we reached a farm some 8 or 9 miles away, and wo saw that, by a quarter to 5, the tractor and disc plough had turned it . over 3Jacres. The person - who imported tihe tank was required to pay a high duty: That tractor was the tool of trade of a I man who was developing this country, ' ^ ^ ' at is bad policy to place a duty upon to o » of trade. The land of which I speak had cost 22B. 6d. per acre to break up. The rnan with the tank and disc plough said he would break up all the land which the Government of Western Australia was opening under the repatriation scheme, for 7s. 6d. an acre, and that he would be prepared - enter into a contract to do so If he oould do that, I contend that the ""Government acted wisely in removing the duty on tractors, which, are one of the tools of trade of the pioneers. I am not going to discuss the sugar question except to say that the vote I gave earlier in the sitting was in accordance with those which I gave on the Tariff and was in keeping with my fiscal belief. I trust that the Commonwealth Government will do everything possible, first of all, for State Soldier Settlement schemes, and also to assist the States to put their own people on the land. The honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Cunningham) travelled over 260 miles of good mallea - country in Western Australia, much of which is now being taken up hy mallee farmers from Victoria. . Mr Souixnr - How is Kendenup faring?",135
705,Mr FOLEY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It is all right. In the course of a few months a great many men - will be making a living on the mallee lands to which I have just referred. We .should pay no regard to State boundaries when dealing with settlement schemes, but should look at them from an Anstra-' lian standpoint. If we do that we may very well leave the States to work out their own destinies. The Government is to be commended for its action in encouraging all who are willing-com panies, private firms, aDd individualsto develop ' any portion of this country. I recently saw set out from Leonora the best-equipped expedition that I had known to leave an out-back town since the discovery of the Western Australian goldfields. The expedition carried 3 cwt. of desiecated food, which, - when prepared according to' directions on each packet; would provide 18 owt. of wholesome food. By carrying this, food' in a compressed form the-party was able to travel many hundredsof miles more than would otherwise have been possible. I am not seeking to ""boost"" up the proprietorsof Kendenup, but I think they will make good; and more power to them if they do. Unfortunately, many Australians have a habit of running down their own country. The country is all right, and with a proper developmental policy vast areas that a few years ago were thought to be useless, will be turned to profitable account. I to hope that the Commonwealth Government will help, not only States, but private institutions and individuals, to develop and settle onr vast spaces. Tho honourable member for Gwydir has referred to the question of arbitration. When we provided for compulsory arbitration we thought that it would be a grand thing and wonld usher in an era of industrial peace. The workers, however', have not got the best that either the Federal or the State - arbitration systems the could givo them. Many unions went to tha Commonwealth Arbitration Court when it was created, not because it was a Federal tribunal, bnt for the reason that it was ""presided over by Mr Justice Higgins. When that learned Judge retired from the position of President of the Court, they, wanted the Commonwealth Court no longer. I am sorry to say that many of the workers have only themselves to blame for the position they occupy today. When their unions came only within the jurisdiction of the State Arbitration Courts they made the fullest use-of those tribunals and also of the State Conciliation Courts. With the creation of the Commonwealth tribunal, however, they took, first of all, what they could get from the State .'Courts, and, if they thought they could do better hy resorting to the Commonwealth Court .they did so. They availed themselves of. both the Commonwealth and State .industrial systems,.",136
706,Mr CUNNINGHAM,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The' honourable member surely does not blame 'them for that.,136
707,Mr FOLEY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Recently the employers have adopted the same tactics.. I blame both parties for doing so. Gne of the first subjects to which the new Parlia--ment should direct its attention is that of industrialism. Every honourable member when he goes bef OTOhis constituents, as: wo all shall do presently, shouldask them whether they are in favour of this principle of arbitration, and' those' who come back pledged' to that principle ; should lose no time-'in securing' a clear definition of what are Federal and what are State arbitration functions. An eifort should also be made to promote, on the part of both the workers and the employers, afeeling of confidence that an award, whatever it may ' be, will be obeyed. I say that as a firm believer in Federation.",136
708,Mr CUNNINGHAM,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The function the Arbitration Court is to fix a minimum wage. There is a good deal of misconception as to that. The Court fixes only a minimum wage, but most employers make the minimum the maximum. - Mr FOLEY - The workers themselves are sometimes to blame. . I know of an employer who was giving the men in one branch of his factory £5 a week, although the award relating to it provided for a wage of ouly £4 perweek. When the men employed in another branch of his business demanded a rise, those who were receiving £5 per week, although the award provided for only a wage of £4 per week, also demanded a rise. I am opposed to the payment of men to speed up their fellow workers, but unfortunately under our present arbitration system a man - cunnot reward an employee as he would like to do. I hopo that honourable members when they return to their constituencies will put this matter before the - electors, and that if they are returned to support the principle of arbitration they will adopt the course I have suggested, and in that way help to secure for the Commonwealth, industrial peace.",137
709,Mr MAKIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Hindmarsh) [6.40 a.m.]. - It is now approaching three years since my constituents were pleased to honour by returning me to this Parliament, I tliink that this is an opportune time, since we are in the closing hours of the tions.heavily Parliament, to review briefly the work which it has accomplished. Curtain things have been done by the Government that ought not to have been done, while things which should have been done been left undone hy them. I confess to a feeling of disappointment with the work of the Parliament. It has failed to carry out many reforms, which thought we should he able to effect-re forms that would give considerable relief to our fellow-citizens, and conduce to general welfare of Australia. While have been favoured hy being a member of this Legislature I have endeavoured .gain somo knowledge of the possibilities of my country. I have availed myself of every opportunity to travel the length and breadth of Australia, and it seems to me that honourable members generally .would do a greater measure bf justice to the claims of the Commonwealth if they had a better knowledge of its resources, of ' its potentialities, and its vastness. Far too often the operations of honourable members are confined to our city areas, with the result that as a Legislature we do not appreciate the difficulties with which a great number of our people in the outposts of the continent have to contend. My extended travels have, certainly given - me a more just appreciation of the possibilities of the glorious territory of which we are the proud possessors. My hope is that we shall prove worthy of the trust, and shall develop our resources to the best possible advantage; because so for as we prove ourselves in this respect, to that extent only shall we be able to claim respect and prestige in the councils of nations. But if we are to set a fitting example in regard to conditions of living and national progress, we shall have to bend ourselves a little more to the particular duties required of us as members of this Parliament, and become more ' directly acquainted with the vastness and possibilities of this continent than perhaps may be the case at the present moment. _ In a previous debate I was able to review the financial proposals of the Government and the position of Australia. It is unfortunate that a young coantry me sucb as this, with resources hardly yet and touched, and with a population that selfbarely skirts the continent, should find itinvolved in financial obligaLet it be said to their credit, that Labour Governments that have occupied a position in the affairs of the Commonwealth have proved themselves equal to the demands made upon them as stateshavo men, and have so guided the ship of State ae to bring it into smooth waters of finance, and proven by the manner in which they have piloted the affairs of the T country that they are entitled to be - regarded as men who understood the first principles of government. In 1909 the a Labour Government had a surplus of 1 I £450,000. In 1910 an anti-Labour Government went out of office leaving a deto ficit of £650,000. A Labour Government which held office from 1910 to 1913 not only overcame that deficit, but also so built up the financial resources of the Commonwealth that at the end of its term of office it was able to face the electors with a surplus of £2,650,000, which, however, was reduced in the following year by an anti-Labour Government to £1,400,000. There were very few tangible assets to show for the money spent. Affairs have gone back to such an extent since the last Labour Government, which left a surplus of £2,650,000, that we have now a Federal public debt of £416,000,000, for which Nationalist Governments are responsible. I quite recognise that heavy obligations were imposed upon us by the war, but our expenditure did not rest with the conclusion of the war. Last year the public debt was increased by £14,000,000, and the estimated increase this year is a further £17,000,000. . Mr MASSYGREENE - I e the honourable member entitled to misrepresent the Commonwealth finances in this way ?",137
710,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT, I am not a judge as to whether the honourable member's remarks are misrepresentation. I have not heard him make use of unparliamentary language.,138
711,Mr MAKIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It is but an attempt on the Minister's part to try to make the public believe that what I am saying is erroneous, although he knows that it is absolutely correct. He - can verify my figures by referring to his own Treasurer's Budget, and I ask him to do so, in order that he may properly acquaint himself with the financial position of the Commonwealth, of which evidently he has no knowledge at the present time. Although there is an increase in the public debt to the extent I have indicated, there is a reduction in the Sinking Fund, the purpose of which is to repay the Commonwealth loans. It should be our endeavour to find a way out of our increasing difficulties, and place our finances on a sound basis. The records of Labour Governments prove that the methods of finance they adopted were sound. The results that have accrued from their administration of the finances stand to their credit, and prove that they were able to conserve the interests of the country in a way that no other Government has been able to approach. OCTOBER, 1922.] 1922-23. 3837 It is most regrettable that certain proraised legislation, which it was most important should have heen passed to secure harmonious relations between the people engaged in the industries of this country has not been carried into effect. After all the promises and protestations on the part of the Government as to the sincerity of their intention to amend the Arbitration Act in order to relieve those engaged in industry of many inconveniences which create dissatisfaction, delay, and injustice, and make it costly to secure a settlement of applications for improved wages and conditions, it is regrettable to find that our deliberations in this Chamber have heen devoted to other forms of legislation, which certainly were of far less importance. If our efforts had heen spent in trying to solve the ever agitated industrial problems, I am sure that it would have shown a greater measure of statesmenship on our part than has been displayed during the three years in which 1I have been a member of this Parliament and in a position to view its deliberations closely. It may be of advantage to those who oppose the Labour movement to endeavour by misrepresentation and recrimination to make the' people believe that we are prompted by the desire to create discord, unrest, and dislocation in the Commonwealth. But that is not the wish or record of the Labour movement. Our desire is that people shall live in peace and harmony with one another, and with a true feeling of good-will. We stand for the principles of arbitration and a system of arbitration that will give satisfaction to those who require to take advantage of the Courts. To us it is quite patent that there is every justification for so amending the present Arbitration Act as to enable awards to be delivered more expeditiously, and so that the procedure may be less costly to those who require to take advantage of the opportunity to have their claims heard. Another measure we might have expected is the Bill to establish a uniform railway gauge. Tho necessity for this has been emphasized in this House for many years past. We find, however, that the proposal ;ie not to be now considered, and that it is to be placed on one side along with many other Bills promised earlier in the session. Another matter that concerns .South Australia vitally is the proposed north-south railway from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. It might have reasonably been - expected that the Government would afford Parliament an earlier opportunity of honouring the compact made between the Commonwealth and that State, and of doing everything possible to expedite the construction of the north-south line. Valuable evidence that has been collected regarding the resources of Central Australia justifies us in believing that we have there very rich mineral fields, the opening up of which will give opportunities to our people to advance their position in life, and to fittingl y play their part in the development of the continent. To-day, unfortunately, there is a tendency throughout Australia towards centralization, but if we intend to truly progress along lines that will lead to the greatest advantage of the Commonwealth, we must develop the more distant parts of our continent by providing facilities for people to settle there. represent a metropolitan constituency, I recognise how essential it is, in order to overcome the tendency of our people to migrate to the cities, that we should make the lives of tbose in distant parts more' agreeable and comfortable, and thus encourage them to undertake the - responsibilit y of opening up and developing the interior of this great Commonwealth. During my three years' service in this House I have endeavoured honest and, I trust, helpful criticism men and measures, and to do full justice recognition to the views and claims of those who me here. I have thought it necessary clearly indicate my distinct of certain features of maladministration and business undertakings for which Government have been responsible. instance, in connection with War 'Service Homes, Australia was committed large obligations, but the expended has not given value to the monwealth or satisfaction to the soldier purchasers. The Kidman-Mayoh building contract is another instance the Government's ineptitude. did not carry out their contract, and Government will lose approximately £50,000. If Ministers had been to the people's interests, they have claimed a refund of the Ur. Makin. of the progress payment^, amounting to £114,000. Por the five wooden ships built in America to the order of the Commonwealth, the Government paid £811,000. A few weeks ago they sold them for £10,000, although they had previously refused an offer of £15,000 for them. I have dissociated myself from, these transactions, and have availed myself of an opportunity to register my protest against the unbusinesslike methods of the Government, which have involved the country in heavy losses. The Commonwealth is now committed to an expenditure of £500,000 in connection with the agreement made by the Government with Amalgamated Wireless Limited for the installation and operation of a system of long-distance wireless telegraphy. The interest of the people has not been conserved as it should have been; the Government have shown a. tendency to expend public money under questionable agreements with private companies in a way that certainly has not Although I been justified. I wish to emphasize certain payments made to South A f r i c a in regard to sales of inferior flour. I understand that the Commonwealth received from the South African Government a claim for £115,000 as compensation. Although the Australian people were in no way responsible for the unfaithfulness of those persons who so treacherously dealt with the commercial reputation of the Commonwealth, to apply the Government have paid the sum of to £32,000 from the national exchequer in of the claim. When sent we sought to know the names of those to responsible for these contracts, the disapproval Government refused to give them. I would not be worthy of the position I the occupy in this House if I did not record, Fofor the enlightenment of my constituents, the misdeeds of the Government in regard to to this and other transactions. money Throughout the last three years I have Comendeavoured to secure all the advantages possible for the division of H in d shipmarsh, but I regret that the Government of have not realized their obligations toThat firm wards one of the greatest industries of the South Australia-shi p building. At its commencement, the industry was enalive couraged by the Commonwealth, and would offers and promises of' orders were made whole that have not been fulfilled . To-day, the f u t u re of the industry is no't assured, owing to the indefinite attitude which the Government have adopted towards it , and their failure to honour their promises. In association with other honourable members from Soubh Australia., I have requested that the two light-ships required by the Lighthouse Department, in that State should be built locally, so keeping the ship-yard going, and developing an industry which must become a valuable asset. So far, we have received from, the Government only indefinite and unsatisfactory replies. For certain advantage I have been able to gain for my constituents, I have to thank principally'the Departmental officers. When T was-first elected to represent Hindmarsh.. the postal and telegraph accommodation in the division was in a deplorable state, but thanks to the just consideration extended to my claims by officials in the Department,, [the .postal facilities have been brought up to date and improved; although I should have appreciated finality regarding the West Adelaide Suburban Telephone Exchange, and the ac-ccptance of the citizens' site for the Port Adelaide Post Office. A large part of my duty has beeu been to assist in overcoming the distressit ing drcumstanoes in which many reand turned soldiers and old-age and invalid pensioners are to be found. I am glad that I have been able to do something to relieve those so circumstanced, by securing for them some measure of the considerayou tion to which they are entitled. Whento ever it has been possible for me to adit vance in any way the interests of my stituents I have endeavoured to do so, future. but my activity has not been limited to that alone. I realized that a man elected to this Parliament had a national duty, and legislated for a wider sphere than his own constituency. I understand that it is the intention of the Government to make certain additions to the Adelaide Post Office, too which is regarded as one of the stance, most imposing edifices in the city. I am informed that it is proposed to construct a concrete building, and one whioh will not - be in harmony with the other portion of the structure. been requested hy the Operative Masons' Society to place on record 1heir protest this matter, - and perhaps I could best servo their purpose by reading the following communication:28 Courtis-street, North Adelaide, 16th September, 1922. Mr N. Makin, M.H.K., Parliament House, Melbourne. Dear Sir, At a meeting of the Operative Masons' Society held recently, a resolution was carried protesting against the action of the Federal Government in their scheme of remodelling the Adelaide General Post Office, and I was instructed to bring the matter under your notice, so as to have our protest voiced in the Federal House. It is the intention to carry out extensive alterations and additions in reinforced concrete, and then colour the work to match the present facade, which is executed in cut stonework. The present building is considered one of the finest in the State, and occupying, as it does, one of the most prominent positions in the city, we consider it an injustice, as well as a blot on our architecture, to carry out this work other than in conformity with the existing building. Furthermore, - we consider the excluding of the stonework am injustice to our trade, as we have always looked to the Government Departments for this class of work. We - feel this matter more keenly, in view of the fact that South Australia is the only State in the Commonwealth in which a cut-stone building has not been erected by the Federal Government. In Western Australia, the General Post Office, at Perth, has in course of erection for some years, and is aid .stone. Likewise, in New .South Wales Victoria, branches of the Commonwealth Bank, and other extensive cut-stone buildings, have been, and are 'being, erected by the Commonwealth Government; so that we feel that, unless, some action is taken, the claims of our trade will never be recognised. I trust that will bring thiB matter under the notice of those responsible, and that, even i i it is too late remedy .the defect in the .present instance, may be the means of preventing stonework confrom being excluded where possible in the Yours faithfully, GEOKGE P. LEAHY. I trust that those - who are responsible for the type of building to be constructed in Adelaide iwill remember that a strong protest has been lodged. Even if it is late to alter the proposal in 'this in it should be the policy in f u t u r e to construct important public buildings in cut-stone, so that the architectural beauty of our cities may be preserved, and the interests of a deserving section of the I have community full y considered. I regret, that it has been practically imi n possible to amend legislation passed during the present session, by reason of the Government's adamant attitude; but I am hopeful that, after an appeal has been made to the people, a Labour Government will be returned. If such should be the case, the needs of the people will be f met, and an effort made to remove many of the injustices which now exist. We shall have sane, sound, and honest government, and shall then be able to sayThere is a land where summer skies Are gleaming 'neath a thousand dyes Blending in witching harmonies Where grassy knoll and forest height Are flashing in the rosy light, And all above is azure bright, Australia ! Australia ! Australia !  It would appear that the discussion of the Budget has beeu intentionally delayed, with the idea of preventing many of its intricacies from being investigated. determined effort is, apparently, being made to bludgeon it through when honourable members cannot be expected to be mentally alert. The Government think it quite a small thing to ask us tQ authorize the expenditure of £60,000,000 or £70,000,000, after ' sitting up all night. The Commonwealth machine is altogether too unwieldy, and when one harks hack to the early days of Federation, and compares the expenditure then with that we are now asked to sanction, one is astounded. If another Parliament were created",138
712,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member's party favours new Parliaments.  vincial councils in new States. another Parliament were created, it would find a means of raising and spending public money. The Commonwealth Parliament cannot effectively control six huge States. The Country party advocates smaller States. We believe that the present States are altogether unwieldy, and the Prime Ministei seems to share that opinion.",141

714,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Without reprethat sentation in the Federal Parliament?  division of Western Australia, and the other large States, with Federal reprepolicy in the past. sentation would make this truly a Comwho monwealth Parliament. It is obvious that the State of moderate size is the more easily administered. The Treasurer, in introducing his Budget, made use of some very excellent maxims with which I u l l y agree, but which I am sorry to say the Government do not appear to be acting upon. It is true, as the Treasurer said, that it is sound policy to extract as little money as possible by way of taxation from the pockets of the people, for it is by the people themselves that this country will be most successfully developed if they have the means to do it . The function of the Government is not to tax people to the very limit, because that only lessens the wealth-creating power of the community. It has been wisely said by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) that the so-called reduction of taxation is only, as it were, a kind of A refund from an accumulated surplus of moneys wrongfully collected, but ^hese remissions cannot continue; as the honourable member for Balaclava has said, we can only have an encore, and then-the deluge. It would have been much wiser on the part of the Government to redeem its stock; but be that as it may, the only object the Government can have had in keeping the Budget back until the last hours of the session is that there might not be sufficient time in which to properly discuss it . What we require is the development of this great country, but development is retarded by the fiscal policy which has been adopted. Parliament may think that it has done its duty when it has imposed high duties on If almost every conceivable commodity; but that is not the way in which to promote the true interests of the community. I propose to read a few statements, which appear to me to be wise, but may not appear so to other honourable members, regarding the Tarif f revision in America. These statements are as follows: The upward revision of the tariff which is in in Congress is causing no small amount of confusion and anxiety in business circles, and increases the complexity of our international relations. Every change, although made for the purpose of benefiting some American industry, bos effects reaching beyond industry, and often far beyond what have been foreseen. It is not necessary in quesThe tioning the wisdom of disrupting trade relations still farther at this time, to enter into an argument over the achievements of the protective There are many people believe it has rendered great service in diversifying and developing our industries, but who recognise that the questions of today are not the same as the questions of the past. We have now a highly-developed state of industry and trade, and must consider how every change in the Tariff will affect the exis.ting status. «A Tariff schedule should be intensely practical. For instance, the press report makes the f o l lowing reference to a discussion in the Senate over a proposed duty on cyanide, to protect its manufacture in this country :"" Senator Sterling called attention to the importance of cyanide to the gold and silver mining and citrus f r u it industries, and asserted that the proper protection of them called for free cyanide."" This argument prevailed and cyanide was mode free. And so in the case of hides the farmers' bloc, after taking account of the compensatory duty proposed on shoes, is reported to have concluded to be content with free hides and free shoes. Tbis, however, does not leave the shoe manufacturer free from effects of the new Tariff. His employees will have to be compensated for any advance in clothing, sugar, or other articles of common .consumption which will cost more as the result of liigher duties. We have a growing volume of shoe exports, but every act of Congress which makes the cost of living higher for shoemakers is a handicap upon this export business. The increased duty on sugar for which the farmers' bloc is contending, if finally adopted, will be a direct out-of-pocket expense to all fanners, as well as all wage-earners in the country, but the farmers who do not grow sugar beets are supposed to be compensated by the duties on corn, wheat, and other products, most of which are being exported in quantities on the basis of world prices. mercially almost a part of the United States. There is no reason wby trade relations with the island may not be considered as of the same mutually compensatory and beneficial character as the trade relations between Minnesota or California and the other States of the Union. The difference in climate mokes an exchange of products naturally advantageous. The climate nnd soil make sugar in Cuba with less labour, as everybody agrees, than it can be made in the United States. Otber important agricultural products can be grown to better advantage in the United States. Cuba is without coal and has few manufacturing industries. There is a natural exchange of sugar and other tropical products grown on the island for flour, meats, clothing, shoes, steel, machinery, and other manufactures. Cuba took $30,000,000 worth of cotton goods from us in the last fiscal year, $15,000,000 worth of shoes, $20,000,000 worth of railway equipment, and so on. short, it is a reciprocal relationship, no different in practical character from that with Minnesota and California. The rest of the States do not merely tolerate Minnesota and California to help the two States, but rejoice in the mutual advantages accruing all around. There is no reason why natural trade with Cuba should be regarded in any other light. Cuba grows sugar and otlier t r o p i c a l products better t h a n the U n it e d States of America. The g e n t l e m a n ' w h o m I have quoted seems to recognise that. Almighty, when He createdthis world, gave it its different climates, and its different plants for different seasons. If we try to develop anything exotic, we must pay for it. The Fijians and Pacific Islanders are certainly black, but should we say that because they are black they ought not to live ? Is our trade with them to be only a one-sided trade? These black men, perhaps, are as healthy and happy under their conditions of life and work as we are. Have we not taken a foolish course in ostracising F i j i in the matter of trade? If we examine the trade relations between this country and F i j i prior to the date when we placed a prohibitive duty on bananas, we find that while they gave £1,00(X000 to us we gave £250,000 to them. ""We were not satisfied with that, but wanted the lot; and therefore we shall get nothing. The people of F i j i have taken their trade to other countries, and those other countries, which are older and bigger than Australia, are very glad to deal with the Fijians in a reciprocal manner. The other day I asked a question about the copra trade, which has now practically departed from Australia. That was a large and useful trade to Australia, and might have been kept here Cuba is com- entirely. . It is now going to America and England, which countries are actually sending ships to take the copra away. This is simply because of our insane policy. ""We brought in a Navigation Act which excluded all sorts of trading from our coasts. We bring rice past Papua to Sydney, and ship it back again to Papua at great unnecessary expense. The freights from the islands to Sydney are such that the people there cannot trade with us in copra. They decided that it was better to sell"" direct to the people of America and England, who send direct to the islands and lift it, notwithstanding the fact that we subsidize Burns, Philp and Company to provide a service of mail In steamers between the islands and Australia. Not only in. the islands of the Pacific, but in the Far East, there are millions of mouths, that could be fed with Australian produce, but trade with those parts of the world has been forbidden by an unfriendly Tariff. If we offend the people whose markets would be useful to Australia, how can we expect them to accept our products? This country should be self-contained, The but that ideal cannot be secured by each of us taking in the other's washing. We need to develop our trade relations with other countries. We cannot pay our national debt unless new wealth is brought into the country, and that cannot be secured except by extending our trade connexions with our neighbours. If we paid more attention to the development and general encouragement of primary production our financial position would be infinitely brighter. The fiscal policy of the Commonwealth is not conducive to its progress. The way in which the Treasurer has disbursed the accumulated surplus, in order to give, on .the eve of an election, a littl e help and favour here and there to various sections of the community, suggests that Australia is like a good boy who has been given a little b it out of his earnings-6d . here and ls. there with which to buy a few lollies for himself. The Government have distributed doles in the way which they think will best serve their electioneering purposes. The policy of the Country party has been to assist production, not by the imposition of duties upon implements of trade,, but by the removal of Customs duties and the institution of bounties, whereby all the people would contribute, to the development of industry. When the man on the land is called upon to pay duties levied upon the things he needs to produce goods for sale overseas, he is severely handicapped. The Argentine may be compared in certain respects with Australia. But the Government of that country do not burden their, producers with imposts upon agricultural machinery. As a result, the Argentine has beaten us badly in the world's markets. In Australia, shackles are placed upon producers, but. our South American competitors bear no shackles. The intelligence of this Parliament is such that it has actually supported the Government in imposing a duty upon sulphur. That is how the wheat-grower is helped in his struggles in the world's markets. Superphosphates today cost between 50 and 60 per cent, more than in 1914.",141
715,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"And the price of wheat is about double the 1914 price.  who shoulders the burden of a heavy Protective Tariff. Seventy-six per cent, of the wealth of this country is due to 1 primary production; all other resources account for only 24 per cent. The Government appear to be very proficient in bungling. I need only tur n to the pages of this week's press for a demonstration pf that fact. The Auditor General, in his report, is distinctly uncomplimentary to the Government. If I were responsible for the causes leading to Mr Israel's comments, I would hide myself in a corner. That official refers to the bungling over War Service Homes construction. He speaks of contracts made with various people for timber, joinery, cement; and tiles. He tells how practically all have had to be compensated in large sums for breach of contract. The Government have been guilty of blunders, and the public have had to pay. Ministers cannot afford to laugh. The cost of their negligence and incapacity falls upon the poor old taxpayer. The Australian people felt, when arrangements were being made to provide homes for their fighting men, that the money whioh they freely furnished would be used, in the directions best calculated, to serve their interests. Such, however, has not.been the case. When the whole truth has been told we may learn exactly how much has been squandered. The Budget statement hasi made, our financial position to appean very much better than ib really is. Because of loan appropriation for the Postal Department there would seem to be a considerable profit in respect of ordinary revenue. There are also considerable reductions shown in .the Navy and DefenceDepartments with respeot - to works which had been previously paid for out of revenue, but which are now being financed with loan money. The Postal Department should - be purely and simply a utilit y Department. None of the profit which it makes should betaken from it and paid, intoi the general revenue. The  found it necessary to ask for a loan of £9,000,000, to be expended during the next few years, in order that his Department may be brought up to date. In the circumstances the course adopted was wise, but behind it there lies the unwisdom of earlier years. I ask the Treasurer to say what he in> teuds to do with what appears to be a surplus expected from the operations of the Postal Department. The honourable gentleman is silent. The ablest statesmen 'who have appeared in, this House, and amongst them Mr Alfred Deakin, have laid it down that tha Postal, Department should not be used as a profit-making machine. That is the view held, also, by politicians in America and in other countries. The Government borrow £9,000,000 to .bring the Postal Department up to date, whilst at the same time they are taking earnings of the Department into revenue. Had the money earned by the Department in the last few years been allowed to remain to'its credit, the loan proposed would not be necessary. I want to know whether the Government intend to continue to take into the Consolidated Revenue the earnings of this Department, so that later on a fresh loan will be required to bring it up to date.",143
716,Mr BEUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Tb e honourable member - cannot expect me to explain the policy of the Government by interjection when it is set out in the Budget, the Budget-papers, and the Estimates.  leman took a. considerable amount of pains to explain what his Budget meant. estimates a profit of nearly £900,000 on the operations of the Postal Department for the current financial year, and I do - not think that the Budget reveals what he intends to do with that surplus. believe that he intends to. take it into the general revenue, and I disapprove entirely of that practice.",144
717,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member is trying to conduct a crossrexamination. I will reply to all these 'questions later on. Let him express his views now, and I will express mine afterwards. I propose to correct the misapprehension under which the honourable member appears to labour.  simple question, - and the Treasurer has. invited me to find out the answer to it as best I can from his Budget.",144
718,Mr BAYLEY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member might explain his system of averaging in come tax.  views on the subject of taxation, and submitted a simple method of averaging. The House declined to permit me to explain a misleading table which the Treasurer put before us. I gave the honourable gentleman my table some days before I submitted my amendment in order that he might have an opportunity to in quire into it . When he was replying to me he had a table circulated amongst honourable members, and when I wished to deal with that table I was informed that I had exhausted my time. The Treasurer's table was submitted as an effective argument against the system of averaging which I had proposed. The figures in that table are very cleverly devised, and I think I see the hand of the Commissioner of Taxation in them.",144
719,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It is only fair to the Commissioner to say that he had nothing to do with the table. I gave the figures to the Commissioner, and he and his Department . worked out the rates.  the honourable gentleman's statement that the Commissioner of Taxation did not devise the table. I thoughtthe Treasurer would have questioned the figures I had placed in the hands of honourable members, and I would have been glad if he had attempted to show that my system of averaging is not a fair and reasonable one. Instead of doing so he subHe mitted his table covering a ten years' period. In my table, for simplicity, - the periods were cut into terms of five years. In the Treasurer's table the total income covering the two periods, of five years, is I £15,500, and for the purpose of a regular annual income that amount is divided into ten equal parts. The Treasurer takes the rate on that, and arrives at the figure which honourable members will remember to have seen, namely, £ 9 7 1 , as the amount of tax.. It is manifestly unfair to submit that as a test of my scheme. In the table submitted by the Treasurer, a squatter, for instance, with an irregular income is shown to have made in the second period of five years £18,500. If both schemes are applied to a single period of ten years, they give the same results.",144
720,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"They do not - It is not true, unless the honourable member alters his period to ten years, instead of five years, that the results which I have shown in my table would follow from the assumed incomes?  of five years the squatter shows a loss, and pays no tax. In the next five years he makes £18,500. and makes it in a very irregular way. He has a fluctuating in come, whereas the other man, with a regular average income during the five years' period, makes the same amount of money at the rate of £3,700 a year. These two citizens, as shown in my .memorandum, pay precisely the same tax. Treasurer knows that under my scheme the total taxes paid by a taxpayer over a period of five years, whether his income be received in five equal annual sums or in irregular amounts, are exactly the same. If the honourable gentleman thought that by spreading the averaging over ten years a greater measure of equity would be secured than by .confining it to a five years' statement ? period, I should not have objected to such an alteration. Instead of making such a suggestion, however, he abandoned my scheme. Its adoption, I bold, would have been of help to the taxpayer. The Country party have been endeavouring, amongst other things, to put the primary producer on a better basis. The averaging system was first proposed by us, hut a member of the Nationalist party forestalled us by moving the adjournment of the House with the object of urging on the Government the adoption of that system in relation to the income tax paid by the primary producers. We did not ask that the system should he applied only to primary producers, although. they are most in need of relief. We believe in its general application. A Royal Commission was appointed to make recommendations as to the best taxation methods to adopt.' That ('ommission cost the country some thousands of pounds, but the work done by it might easily have been carried out by two or three accountants in Melbourne. Climatic conditions could bave no possible bearing on the subject of investigation, yet the Commission travelled all over the Commonwealth. Finally they suggested a method of averaging, the defects in which were quickly discovered. Even members of Parliament were quick to appreciate the fact that it would prejudicially affect them. Members of Parliament had more influence with the Treasurer than had the farmers. The Treasurer explained the proposal to the members of /his party in the little room upstairs, and was told by some of his colleagues, "" If we go out of office and our income is thus reduced, this scheme, instead of helping us, will hit us. It will not do."" Then followed a few letters in newspapers from pensioners or others on a retiring allowance, who also claimed that the averaging 3ystem would be prejudicial to their in- terests.  The Mr Bruce - I know that the honourable member is a seeker after truth, but what he has just said is far removed from the truth.  it is. I have the very best.authority for the statement.",144
721,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That means that the honourable member does not accept my  refuse to accept the honourable members statement, hut what are the facts? There was an outcry on the part of those who had declining incomes, and I had it put to me by members of Parliament that they would be hard hit by the proposal.",145
722,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT," I must draw the attention of the honourable member to standing order 266, which provides thatNo member shall allude.to any debate of the same session upon a question or Bill not then being under discussion, nor to any speech made in Committee, except by the indulgence of the House for personal explanations. The honourable member is now discussing the Income Tax Assessment Bill which was passed by the House a day or two ago,  dealing with a purely financial question. There are several methods by which the Commonwealth collects its revenue and the Budget provides for the raising of £15,000,000 or £16,000,000 by direct taxation. I submit, therefore, that I am in order. '' We asked for bread, and they gave us a stone."" We were promised that relief would be given to the man on the land, and it has been given, nol to him, but to others. The cry of other people has been heard, while that of the primary producer has passed unnoticed by the Government. [With the assistance of the table to which I have already referred, the Treasurer endeavoured to make it appear that there was nothing in my scheme, but - I think I have proved that it is a sound one. The scheme that has been adopted will not give anything like equity. In conclusion, I protest most emphatically on behalf of the peonle I represent against the action of the Government in bringing their financial proposals under review in the dying hours of the Parliament. In such circumstances the Budget must necessarily be ill-considered. Within the last few day3 we have had to deal with a number of Bills of great importance, and now, in the closing hours of the session, we are called upon to dispose of the Budget, involving an expenditure of £60,000,000 or £70,000,000. is impossible to obtain a proper grasp of the business submitted to us when we are required to deal with it in this hurried manner. Protests, however, seem to be futile. The Government is hardened. ' It promises economy, hut does not practise it . At the close of last session a host of important measures were hurriedly rushed through the House, and I am not surprised, that several of them have had to be amended. On this occasion quite a lot of Bills ou the notice-paper will have to he abandoned because of the failure of the 'Government to submit them earlier in the session.",145

As it is not in the for vided for iby our Standing Orders I cannot present it as a petition, but I propose to read it to the Oommittee. follows:Salvation Army Aged Men's Retreat, Glencross-road, Bed Hill, Brisbane, 6th October, 1922.

Sir,-We , the undersigned residents of the above institution, most of whom are and invalid pensioners, respectfully request you to submit the following petition to the House of Representatives, through Mr Austin man, the mover of the resolution for an in-' crease of the invalid and old-age pensions £1 per week. We pray for the said increase, or, if that unobtainable, for 17s. 6d. per week, for following reasons :At this home, where the rates are lower at any other except similar ones of the vation Army, we pay from 12s. to 13s. 6d. per week for board and lodging, which leaves from Is. 6d. to 3s. per week for clothing and Minister. other necessaries, not to mention luxuries, which are out of the question. Considering the great increase in the prices of everything, can be seen that life for us is almost unbearable.

But we have faith in those whom we bave set to rule over us, and so for this humble matter we will ever pray. I shall be very much obliged if the caseTreasurer will give this request his earnest consideration.  a.m.] - I do not think that I aro exaggerating when I say that this Budget is more bluff than anything else. The Government pretend to do two things, namely, to give relief from taxation, and to have reduced expenditure. To give colour to their pretensions that they are easing the taxation burdens of the people they are dipping deeply into trust funds prior to the elections. This pretence is an outstanding feature of the Budget;, but, of course, such a state of affairs cannot continue. The Government cannot continue indefinitely to dip into the trust funds, and therefore these taxes which have been remitted m pro- must eventually be reimposed, or other taxes substituted. In the second place, as I have said, the Government pretend It is ai to have reduced expenditure, when, as a matter of fact, all they have done is to decrease expenditure from revenue by £3,000,000, while increasing expenditure from loan to the extent of £4,400,000. Micawber himself never indulged in such slipshod methods of finance as these.",146
724,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Micawber' s principle of old-age finance was eminently sound.  Chapcourse, the methods of the Government in regard to finance are only in keeping to with their general attitude for the whole is of the time that they have been allowed the to occupy the Treasury bench- a time which, I devoutly hope, is drawing to a than close. The present, I think, is a fitting Salopportunity to briefly expose the misus doings of the Ministry and the Prime",146
725,Mr FLEMING,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"There will hardly be it time, before we rise, to do that.  events, I shall devote as much time as is of our allowed me under our Standing Orders to expose the wrong-doing of the present which have been 3846 Budget, covered up with, more or less success during the past two or three years. If by. doing this I shall be assisting to prevent a continuance of this state of affairs, I take it that my effort will not have been made in vain, The trouble is to know where to begin. If I were to remind honourable members of the beginning of these misdeeds I - should have to go so far back in our political history that I oould never hope to cover the ground in the time allowed to me. Some honourable members now associated with the Ministry were not then in the Government, so responsibility for these matters cannot very well be charged against them. The Prime Minister himself (Mr Hughes) must bear the brunt of those early scandals. It is just as well, at this stage, to remind the general public that the present head of the Government was responsible for the Ready-Earle scandal of some years ago. If the Prime Minister had been guilty of no other offence against political decency that, in itself, would have been sumcient to unfi t him from ever again occupying a place in the public life of this country. Honourable members will, no doubt, recall that at that time, when the Government were in a minority of one in another place, one honourable senator, not a supporter of the Government, conveniently became ill . A most remarkable feature of the whole business was that evidently the Prime Minister knew a fortnight prior to the incident that the senator referred to was about to become ill and resign his seat, and. so another man from Tasmania- a man who would be a slave to the Prime Minister-wa s waiting on the doorstep to take his place. In this way the Government got their majority.",146
726,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It was suggested the senator referred to was suffering impecuniosity.  ever he was suffering from , i markable that the Prime Minister was able to ""peer into the future and to know that Senator Ready was about to become Public Accounts ill . The Prime Minister was thus able to lay his plans well, with the result that, in the twinklingof an eye, the Government minority in the Senate was converted into a majority. As I have ready said, some honourable members now in the Ministry had no responsibility [REPRESENTATIVES.] 1922-23. connection with that scandal. In that matter the Prime Minister stood alone. But I am. not going to dwell at length upon those earlier incidents. I propose to confine my remarks to those misdeeds that may be charged up against the Government during the past three years. It is my intention to assemble these charges - so that the people may look at them in globo and not forget them, because I believe that if they will only think hard enough about them it will be impossible for the Government to remain in office after the coming election. For these later acts of maladministration the majority of the present Ministers, of course, must take their full share of responsibility. Let me refer to one of the very latest, namely, the sugar scandal. That in itself unfits the Government for continuing in office.",147
727,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The finding of the Committee was, "" Government figures upheld."" Don't forget that.  the sugar business there are certain outstanding features which cannot be denied by the Minister, who has talked more upon the subject than any other honourable member, and has given less in formation. The Prime Minister declared that he intended to abide by the decision of the Tariff Board aa to the Tariff to be levied. Was that promise fulfilled ? Of course, it was not. A duty is proposed in the interests of the refining companies - principally the Colonial Sugar Refining Company - as a quid pro quo which the Prime Minister fel t in duty bound to give to the company. The action of the Government yesterday was a breach of good faith . This Sugar agreement was that the subject of a reference to the from Public Accounts Committee only a few weeks ago, and the House certainly understood then that no: action would be t - taken before that Committee had made t was reits report to Parliament. Mr GREENE. - The question of the Tariff on sugar was not submitted to the Committee. Sitting suspended fro-rn 9 to 11 a.m. (Friday).  alvernment's proposal to impose on im ported white sugar a rate of duty £ 2 in above the rate recommended by the Tariff Board was simply intended to bei n the nature of a present to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, whose manager at one time said - that his company had contributed large sums to the election funds of the Nationalist party. As the Colonial Sugar Refining Company does not forget the Nationalist party, it was quite to be expected that the party would not forget, the company. The list of scandals associated with the Ministry's term of office is enough to sweep any Government from the Treasury bench. Everything associated with their control of sugar has been discreditable, which is the least I can say of them. It has baen a case of "" cover up "" from beginning to end. Instead of waiting for the finding of the Public Accounts Committee, the Government brought down their proposal for increased sugar duties, and sought tofinalize the matter before the Committee had presented its report.",147
728,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT," Order. ' The Committee has already dealt with that matter.  vernment's action in regard to the wireless agreement is the second in the series of their wrong-doings to which I shall refer, because on the eve of an election I think it is the bounden duty of every member of this House to let the people know exactly what the Government have been doing, particularly during last session. I need not dwell upon this matter except to say that in this, also, everything associated with the business was discreditable to the Ministry. The facts are all too fresh tc need recapitulating beyond saying that when the Labour party challenged the Government on the score that, although the Commonwealth had provided the greater proportion of the capital of the new company, they had the least, representation on the board of directors, the Government immediately proceeded to appoint a seventh director. But when it was shown who that gentleman was, the Government*' pulled him out, or else he pulled himself out, because the position was too unsavoury for him. And now we have the Prime M in ister accepting the position. Let me say that I totally disapprove of his being on the board of directors, but, although he is there, the company still have a maj o r it y on the board. It only shows that the Government are willing to do the bidding of those who provide their election f unds-. I suppose it is a matter of comnaiotn Inaewledge that Sit Willia m Vicars, 1 a'rnember of tha Wireless Board, and Sir Thomas Hughes were prominent in the presentation of that £25,000 to the .Prime Minister. At least, so a Sydney paper says, and a newspaper ought to know that much. In the .third of the series of scandals we have a very fishy business, which has already been referred to this morning by the .honourable meanbsr far Gwydir (Mr Cunningham); but I propose to speak about' it again, because the circumstances surrounding the sale of inferior flour to South Africa are worth repeating. An unscrupulous band of speculators, instead of being punished fear having injured the good name of this country, were presented wibh compensation amounting to about £115,000, to which the Government contributed, about £32,000 and the Wheat Board £82,500, from money directly drawn from the farmers of Australia. When honourable nMnrbers on this side of the House asked for the names of the individuals to whom the money was paid the Prime Minister absolutely refused to give them. Surely when the people of this country are called upon to pay money they are entitled to know to whom the payment is to be made. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, I do not intend to go through the whole list of the wrong-doings of the Government. The time allowed me under the Standing Orders would not permit me to do so. The fourth in my list is the Kidman Mayoh shipbuilding scandal, the circumstances of which are still fresh in the minds of honourable members. The firm of Kidman and Mayoh undertook to build six wooden ships for the Commonwealth Government, and although they did not touch four of them, managed to draw £52,000 from the Government as compensation for the cancellation of these after the war. The contractors got £114.000 from the Government for building two vessels which an expert appointed by the Public Works Committee, which was inquiring into the contract, said would have gone to the bottom if they had gone outside the Heads, so unseaworthy were they. The Public Works Committee after an> inspection accepted the advice tendered to them by the expert, and declared that these ships unseaworthy, and the interpretation the Attorney-General put on their findof ing was that the contractors should turn the sum of £114,000 paid to them by the Government. But, instead of this being done, the Government apsustained pointed Sir Mark Sheldon to hold a ing the first tender. secret inquiry into the very matter upon which the Public Works Committee had submitted its report, and he gave a verdict for £50,000 less than the amount which the Public Works Committee had posed the matter in this House. declared the Government were entitled to get back from the contractors. few days ago I asked the Attorney General if any of that money had been paid by them, and he said he did not know. I do not think that any money has been paid over, nor is it likely to paid over until pressure is brought bear on those individuals who were guilty of one of the"" worse actions that have been purchased. could possibly have been done against the Commonwealth. It did not matter to the contractors that lives might lost on these boats, which were totally seaworthy, and instead of their being punished, they were practically presented by the Government with £50,000. Several ,of the scandals I intend pass by, but the sale of the Commonwas wealth Woollen Mills is worthy of menDirector said that after ' rain tion. The Returned Soldiers League being supplied by these mills with cloth at cost price plus ls. 6d. per yard. This concession was a boon to the returned trary to plans and specifications. men. But because of influence exerted in a. well-known quarter in Melbourne about which the Treasurer (Mr Bruce) with transactions of that kind. knows a great deal; because certain gentlemen in Flinders-lane have said that it is totally wrong for the Comtail monwealth Government to run these mills _in competition with Flinders-lane, the Government have come to a decision to sell the mills, and now the returned soldiers will be obliged to bargain with Flinders-lane for any cloth they may quire in future. It is a gross injustice to those who have fought the nation's the Treasury bench. battles. „ Honourable members opposite promised the soldiers that nothing would be too good for them when they came back from the Front. They are getting nothing. Number six in my list of the fount wrong-doings of the Government is almost exhausted. the sale of certain wooden ships. Vessels which cost the Commonwealth  were about £830,000 were offered for sale. which Tenders were invited, and a tender £15,000 was submitted, but turned redown, the tenderer's deposit being returned.

He has the fullest latitude of speech on the Budget, and surely it is unnecessary for him to drag in the opinions of outside persons.  put my notes away so that I cannot look a.t them. The latter part of Mr Ashworth's statement was that the Prime Minister was endeavouring to cement together the workers, returned soldiers, and a lot of other people in the community, by resorting to every for m of class hatred and sectarianism. If the Lahour vernment came into power there would he a return to responsible Governmenta thing almost forgotten in Australia since the preseut Prime Minister has in power.

765,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Who made the speech?,151
766,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The ' president of the Chamber of Commerce.  good deal of unnecessary trouble,' I have managed to let honourable members know that there are those in the community outside the Labour party who have the courage to expose the wrong-doing of this Government. A few days ago the situation in the Near East was prominently bsfore the people, and there are two outstanding facts in connection with this matter which should be known. Our position was very precarious for several days, and not only the British Prime Minister, but alsothe head of the Commonwealth Government apparently forgot that there was such a body as the League of Nations. We were almost on the verge of war without the slightest thought beiug given to the League of Nations, which is supposed to intervene in international disputes. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) was the first to mention the League.  discussed in the House a cable had been transmitted by the Prime Minister to the High Commissioner.  was after the Labour Leader had spoken. A statement by the Prime Minister did appear in the press to the effect that we would send a contingent.",151
767,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I think he said, "" I will send a contingent.""  he did ; I know he did not say that he would take one. Unfortunately, there are a number who have swallowed the dope offered, after the last war, when it was said that that was a conflict which had ended all wars. Many innocents believed that such would be the case, and it must have been a rude awakening to read the Prime Minister's statement that he would send a contingent. There was not to be any referendum, but the men were to be conscripted.",152
768,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"If the Prime Minister thought he would have to go, he would travel farther than from Bendigo to North Sydney.  ndt included North Sydney in the points I wish to discuss, but now that matter has been raised, it may as well be mentioned that the candidate who had been selected in the Nationalist interests and who had started his campaign in that electorate was hurled out to make room for the Prime Minister.",152
769,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"He was sent bathroom.  know how it . was done, but it was a sudden death way of moving in the matter.",152
770,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT," Order ! Will the honourable member for Hume tell 'me what this has to do with the Budget?  under the impression that in the Budget debate my scope was practically unlimited. Any one of the wrongful acts I have mentioned should be sufficient to remove-the members of the Ministry from the Treasury bench, and if the full facts were known, they would not have the remotest chance of being returned to power.",152
771,Mr STEWART,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"No one expects that.  the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart)' feels as I do, and it will be his duty to follow when I have concluded my criticisms.",152
772,Mr STEWART,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"There is no shortage of ammunition.  not. It is the proud boast of the Labour party that although there have been Labour Governments in the State Parliaments, and in the Federal arena from 1910 to 1913, and from 1914 to 1916, no one has been able to say that any Minister connected with the Labour party has ever been charged with bribery or corruption I now come to another point. While all this wrong-doing has been going on, although the Government had not a majority in the House without including Mr Speaker, they carried on in a shameful manner with support from outside their own ranks. Whilst the Government are primarily responsible for many acts of maladministration, and the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) is taking great care to dissociate himself just now from the present Government and everything they do, it must nob be forgotten that often a majority of the members of the Country party supported the Government when any vital question, arose.",152
773,Mr STEWVRT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,That is not true.  statement cannot be contradicted.,152
774,Mr STEWART,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The honourable member said a majority.  quote the division lists giving the exact numbers to stow that members of the Country party have supported the Government when it was in danger.,152
775,Mr STEWART,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"And so have the members of the honourable member's party. Mir. PARKER MOLONEY - Never . J challenge the honourable member to prove that when any vital question was to be decided, the members of the Labour party have voted to keep this Government in power. It is only fair to say that extreme steps have been talcpn by the Leader of the Country party to prove that there is a difference between his party and that of the Nationalists, the facts and figures are against him. I shall go back to the 10th Marcli, 1920, when the then Leader of the Country party (Mr MCWilliams) in fulfilment of an election promise, moved to reduce a vote in Supply by one-half. When the division was taken two members of the Country party crossed over supported the Government. I know that two members do not constitute a majority of the Country party, but their votes made all the difference, and had the effect of keeping the Government in power. On the 30th July, 1920, a proposal submitted by the Labour Leader with the object of preventing the further deportation of residents from Australia without public trial by j u r y ; and on that occasion the members of the Country party voted with the Government. On a statement made by the Postmaster-General, an amendment was moved by myself on behalf of the Labour party with the object of increasing postal and telephonic facilities in country districts. This, of course, was of vital interest to the country members, but only five members of the Corner party voted for the amendment. That division will be found recorded on page 3194 of Hansard. On the 7tb October, 1920, as reported on page 4439 of Hansard, the Leader of the Country party moved a hostile motion condemning the Government for the purchase of saw-mills in Queensland without first consulting Parliament. This motion involved the fate of the Government, which, however, escaped by two votes, only eight members of the Country party voting for the motion. the 12th October, 1920, as reported ou page 5505 of Hansard, on the Judiciary Bill an amendment was moved by the Labour party in favour of the moratorium being extended for the protection of primary producers. This, again, was a proposal of great importance to country people, but only two members of the Country party voted for it , the others following the Government. When the first guarantee of 5s. per bushel on wheat was under discussion, and there was a proposal that it should be paid at railway sidings, none of the Country while party voted with honourable members on this side in favor of the guarantee; that was on the 22nd October, 1920, and is recorded on page 5928 of Hansard. As a matter of fact, the Deputy Leader of the Country party moved as an amendment to that motion that payment should be made partly in certificates. On the 10th November, 1920, as recorded .on page 6358 of Hansard, there was a division on the Commonwealth Bank Bill on an amendment moved by the honourable and member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) to provide for a system of cash certificates for rural industries, so as to relieve the primary producers from the grip of financial institutions. Surely that was an important proposal from a country point of view; but the Country party voted was with the Government. When the Budget of 1921-22 was under discussion, the Leader of the Labour party, according to Hamsard, page 12053, moved to reduce the first item as an instruction to the Government to reduce the military expenditure by £2,000.000, in order to square the ledger. This was a question of economv, but no members of the Countrv party voted with the Labour party.",153
776,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,It is only fair to say that the Leader of the Country party had given notice of an amendment before the amendment of the Labour party was submitted.  honourable member is quite right; the Leader of the Country party had given notice of a precisely similar amendment.,153
777,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"No , no!  rate, the amendment of the Country party Leader was an instruction to the Government to reconsider the Estimates On with a view to reducing the expenditure by £2,000,000 odd. When the division was taken every member of the Labour party voted for it , but one member of the Country party crossed over and gave the' necessary majority to the Government. As a matter of fact, the Country party 'were never solid on any of those occasions. On the 8 t h December, 1921, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr . Cunningham), on the Income Tax Bill , moved that the tax should be paid only on the live stock existing at the time of furnishing a return. The honourable member pointed out that it was unfair to tax the primary producer on the natural increase of his stock before he had had a chance to realise on it . That this was a most important question is shown by the fact that subsequently members of the Country party went to farmers' conferencee and pointed out that a number of producers in drought areas had had to shoot their stock as a consequence of this tax. But when the division was taken on this matter of vital interest to primary producers, only one member of the Country party voted for the amendment. On page 1368 of Hansard it is recorded that the Leader of the Country party moved to reduce the price of sugar to 5d. per l b . , sion a member of thab party crossed over and voted against his colleague.",153
778,Mr STEWART,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Unlik e honourable members opposite, we are not in the grip of a.'cast-iron machine!  what is the good of the honourable member and others in the corner calling themselves a party? The honourable member now admits my contention. On the 30th August, 1922, according to Hansard, page 1773, the honourable member .for Hunter (Mr Charlton) submitted a motion of censure on the Government for their maladminisof tration in connection with W a r Service Homes. On that motion the members of the Country party had a good deal to in condemnation of the Government, but in the division four of them voted against the motion - I shall not cite every in stance of the kind, but merely refer to the recent occasion when the adjournto ment of the House was moved by myself bn behalf of the Labour party in support of a 4s. guarantee, and, although were several Country party members within the building, only one voted f the motion. One member of the party, who had spoken in favour of the guaranJ tee,, did not vote at all. All the tions' under discussion were of vital [151] portanoe to rura l districts, some, of course, being much more important than others; and the point is that on every occasion there was a division in the ranks . of the Country party. While all these Bcandals were being perpetrated by the - Government, and there was a chance to embarrass the Government, the members of the Country party were always there to save it fro m disaster. I refer to this matter now because it is grossly unfair, in the dying days of the Parliament, that the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) should go about the country endeavouring to make people believe that the party he leads is entirely different from the Nationalist party, when, as a matter of fact, they have lived together, voted together, and in every way acted together.",154
779,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I have voted with youi n many divisions.  not on vital questions. However, those who voted with the Government must share the responsibility for the Governand on that occa- ment's actions.",154
780,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The awkward thing ie that the Prime Minister says that we are in alliance with the Labour party 1  his object in making that statement. Proof of everything I have said can be found in the Hansard records. It is not speeches but votes that count, and the division lists show that on all vital issues the Government have been kept in power by members of the Country party. While the Government is primarily responsible', what blame there is must be shared by the members of that party.",154
781,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Did not a majority the'Country party vote with honourable members opposite on all critical occasions ?  say honourable member looks up the Hansard records he will find that.is not so. I know that there are members of the Country - party who at times do not agree with the majority of their colleagues, but desire live up to the name of "" Country party."" Why, otherwise, so distinguish themselves from the Nationalist party? there One or two members of the Country party are consistent, and regard themo r selves as returned as opponents of the Nationalist party. But the party's record as a whole makes it hard to realise quesjwhy there should be two names to disi m - tinguish the anti-Labour forces. Before I sit down, Mr Chanter, I should like to say that if I reflected on the Chair in the early .part of my speech there was no intention on my part to be in* any way unfair.",154
782,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I assure the honourable member that there is no ill-feeling oh my part.  glad to hear that, sir. I have said nothing that is not based bn absolute facton evidence given in regard to scandals I have recalled. The Government are now going to the constituencies, and it'is fair that the true facts should be put fully before the country - I have laid those facts before the Committee today, and I am going to lay them before the public within the next few weeks. Mv, STEWART (Wimmera) [11.57 a.m.] - The honourable member for Hume  speech in which, from beginning to end, there was not a sentence of original talk. Any stranger in this Chamber would have been as much puzzled at the end as at the beginning as to what the debate was about. The honourable member repeatedly appealed to Hansard as bearing out his statement that a majority, of the Country party voted with the Government on every vital question.",155
783,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That will help the Country party during the election more than anything else that can be said ! ' Mr STEWART - The Country party, during the election, will stand on its own feet, and fight its own battle, quite independently of the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) and the honourable member for Hume. The last-named honourable gentleman has threatened to expose the Country party's methods when he goes before the electors; but I think he will find that there are members of the party to which I belong who are able to return criticism quite as keen as his own of my colleagues and. myself. Howover, I do not wish to follow the honourable member in his re-hash of ancient history; my object is to say a few words about the Budget, which, apparently, has been forgotten for the last hour or two I desire to say, first of all, that for many reasons I do not intend this morning to attempt a critical analysis of it , the main one being the circumstances under which we are conducting the debate. In my opinion the Budget proposals of the Ministry, as submitted by the Treasurer (Mr Bruce), are a sham and a delusion from an economy point of view. They-are a sham because they are put forward in a Budget which purports-to provide for the strictest economy"", and they are a delusion because, while ostensibly remitting taxation, they, in effect; only achieve that object b j drawing upon funds - which, in my opinion, the Treasurer has nd right to touch. The late Treasurer (' Sir Joseph Cook) only was very trenchantly,. and, I think, in some respects unfairly, criticised because of the Budget proposals which he brought down last year, but he did have the decency, at least, to keep his hands off the accumulated surplus, and did not attempt to bolster up his Budget by the method adopted . by .the present .Treasurer. While the remission of taxation has, no doubt, pleased some sections of the community, I fear that those who seem to be satisfied with it are not aware that they can only have one more edition of it . After that the inevitable result will be that the Government which happens to be in power-and I do not think it will comprise the present occupants of the Treasury bench-wil l have to do one of two things-economize , or reimpose the taxation which is now being remitted.",155
784,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I wish to draw attention to the state bf the House. If we are to sit here for two or three days all members ought to share in it. [Quorum formed.] Mr .STEWART - I wish to quote an extract from a financial ' statement made by the Right Honora'ble. W. P. Massey, - Minister for Finance in New Zealand. The statement was made .in Committee of Supply of the New Zealand Parliament on the 15th August, 1922. I quote this extract because it shows that, when a Ministry sets out to tackle in real earnest the job of squaring the ledger, it can be done. The following is under the heading of ""Economies and Savings"":-Although it is somewhat difficult to express in precise figures the full extent of the economies and savings that have been and are being effected, I have attached a table which shows the result so far of the operation of the Publio Expenditure Adjustment Act and of economies effected by the Departments. . I 'have had conferences ""with the Heads of tb e respective - Departments, who - fully recognise ihe necessity of reducing administrative expenditure to the lowest possible figure, and are rendering valuable assistance. Honourable members will recognise that a ^general re-organization to effect economy - must be a .gradual process, as ill-considered savings only lead to' extravagance and 'waste. The duty which has devolved upon <the Government is by mo means '.a pleasant One, especially when faced with the absolute necessity of reducing - cash grants and services, as well as dispensing with Staff, - at a 'time when employment is diffiicult to obtain, but the 'balance between - taxatio n and expenditure, must be maintained upou an equitable and sound basis. Justifiable and '-desirable expenditure hn's had to be postponed for the simple reason that at present the.country, (cannot afford it . The results which I summarize hereunder indicate the actual reductions and savings - effected in detail, and also the economies now - being effected and proposed, Including those in the table referred to. The period under review runs from the 1st April , 1921, at - which date I directed the' operation of special measures to bring about the necessary 'reductions. As the adjusting .and coordinating process is gradual, - and 1 desire tb bring these changes about with as little disturbance as possible to the various .public utilities which are used by all classes of the community, the full mies under 'action and proposed cannot yet show in the annual appropriations. ,T.he effect of the figures quoted by Mr. Massey, which I will aiot ""worry the House by '-repealing ""in detail, is that last - year the ' 'Government of New Zealand spent £28,466,838, or £88<8,1516 less than the amount appropriated by Parliament. That was one result of the prompt and decisive action taken by the - Government of New Zealand, ""While the New >Zealand'Parliament spent £886,000 less than ""was appropriated by Parliament, the present Commonwealth Ministry spent,, approximately, £1,000,000 more. The report, which circumstances render it inadvisable for me to quote fully, shows quite - clearly that there is a tremendous difference between the result achieved by the New . Zealand Ministry and the result achieved by the present Commonwealth Ministry. . There is intense dissatisfaction with many of the details of the Budget as submitted by the Treasurer. I do not intend to take the individual items of the Estimates and criticise them, but I want to protest very strongly against the circumstances in which that Budget is being debated. To leave what is the most important business of the year until the,dving hours of the session, and to it up then after a prolonged and exhaustwas deliberate. ing sitting, when members are. physically and mentally incapable of concentrating - their .minds upon it , is an oSenoe which will not be condoned by the general public, although it is in .keeping with many other action's of the Government during 1 the jpast two or .three years. One little incident to which I wish again to refer happened in the early hours of ithis morning; I .allude to the unsportsmanlike action of the Acting Leader, of the House (Mr Greene) in being the 'sole representative in this House who objected to granting a courtesy, ""which is almost invariably extended to the Leader of a pairty, by allowing him an extension of time for his Speech. The Acting Leader >of the House refused, and he was the only member of the House, as-far iis I'can understand, who did ref use, to give the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle : Page) an extension of time in order that he might criticise the Budget and make his speech upon the economy proposals effect of the econoof *he Government.",155
785,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I was not, as a matter of fact, the only member who - objected. '",156
786,Mr STEWART,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The Minister was one, and a Very prominent one; and I 1 think lie should have been the last member of 'this House to take such action. I am absolutely certain that had the position been reversed the honourable member for Cowper ""Would have been ""the last member of the House who would have attempted to stop the Minister from speaking.",156
787,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Considerin g what 'the honourable member has done to me this session ?,156
788,Mr STEWART,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I recognise that there isan intense personal feeling between the two honourable members, and I regret it.",156
789,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,".The honourable member for , Cowper practically accused me of corruption.",156
790,Mr STEWART,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"No , he did not. I well remember the incident to which the Minister refers, and, as a matter of fact, I intended at that time to rise and make it quite clear that the Minister had mistynderstood the action of. the honourable member.",156
791,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,^I did not misundertake stand the honourable member's action. It,156
792,Mr STEWART,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member for Cowper, I honestly believe, had not the slightest intention of reflecting upon the Minister personally, Or of accusing him of corruption.",157
793,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,He should have said so.,157
794,Mr STEWART,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I believe he did say so.,157
795,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member did not, although I challenged him.",157
796,Mr STEWART,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"My Leader said so, at any rate, to me, and to other members of the party, in our party room;, and he has repeated it over and over again. Speaking for myself-and , I repeat, for the Leader of the Country party- I say that I have never yet made such a charge, for I have never had any justification for so doing. I have never even thought anything of the kind.",157
797,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I accept that statement, willingly, so far as the honourable member is concerned.",157
798,Mr STEWART,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I have made no secret of my attitude towards the Government. But, in all that I may have said and done, while being both consistent and persistent, I have always tried to be perfectly fair. I dissociate myself, therefore, from any suggestion of levelling at anybody a charge of corruption. .So, also, do the whole of the members of the Country party. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear!",157
799,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Then , let your Leader say so. MI-. STEWART - It was rather childish-certainl y it was not very manlyfor the Minister, in getting a "" bit of his own back,"" to take the course of action which he adopted this morning. incident was altogether in bad taste, and that is saying the least of it. In the circumstances in which honourable members are placed at this hour of a sitting which began at 11 o'clock on Thursday morning, I have not attempted to-particularly criticise the Budget. . The Treasurer (Mr Bruce) must recognise that a close and careful analysis of his Budget proposals is now out of the question.",157
800,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"But the honourable member is enjoying as favourable an opportunity, and may speak for as long, as he could do if the House were to continue to sit for another month.",157
801,Mr STEWART,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The debate should with by the and be so conducted that every member, might have a chance to express his views, if necessary, upon every line and feature of the Budget. That would be out of the question, of course, today. In what circumstances am I speaking at this moment ? ' Mr MAXWELL - I never heard the honourable member in better form.",157
802,Mr STEWART,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I thank the honourable member for his tactful comment, but I refuse to allow myself to be flattered. I repeat that the conditions under which this debate is being conducted are such as to render it impossible for honourable members to give to the Budget proposals the ful l and critical analysis which they demand. Por that reason I move That all words after ""That"" be left out, with a view to inserting, in lieu thereof, the following :- "" the item be postponed in order that the Government may obtain four months' Supply, so that the Budget. and Estimates should be dealt with by the new Parliament.""",157
803,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT," I cannot accept the proposed amendment, since it has not been presented in conformity with the rules and orders of the Committee. The purpose of the honourable member may be secured, however, if he moves in another form, namely, that the item be reduced, by a specific sum, as an instruction-and then he may give his grounds for so moving. But the honourable member may not attach conditions in the way which he now proposes. .",157
804,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,What is the difference between moving for the postponement of an item and for its reduction!,157
805,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Some days ago, I looked into the question of a proposed The postponement; and, here again, .the Committee is bound and guided by the practice of the British House of Commons, which regards such an amendment as an abstract motion not relevant to the inatter before the Chair. The proposed amendment is not in order, and I cannot accept it. Mr iSTEWART-My amendment not having been accepted, I take it that I shall be free to move another amendment in the proper manner. I accept the suggestion of the Chairman, and now move That the item be reduced by £1: I do this in order that the Government may obtain four months' Supply so that the Budget Estimates shall be dealt new Parliament.

806,Mr WISE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Gippsland) [12.25] - I deMinister sire to take this opportunity, which is earliest that has heen afforded me, to reCommissioner. fer to certain comments in the report the Acting Public Service Commissioner, which was laid on the table of this House on Wednesday. I may say that I absent when the document was presented, and I did not know of the circumstances until I saw, in the Herald that evening, some startling headlines. The newspaper item was headed, "" Soft-hearted Minisfor ter,"" ""'Dismissed officer reinstated,"" reports "" Federal Commissioner's scathing reAot. . . . port,"" The press report proceeds relate, with comments by the Acting Com- "" recommendations."" missioner, two instances of "" Ministerial interference in the case of Federal public servants whose dismissal had heen mended by the Acting Commissioner."" The Herald adds The name of the Minister concerned was' deliberately withheld in the report, in order no personal note might intrude. In justice to those honourable gentlemen who were my colleagues in the Ministry, I take this earliest opportunity to say that I am the Minister referred to. In the first place, I wish to express my opinions on the attitude which the Acting Commisis sioner adopts in regard to the position the Minister concerned in relation himself. The Acting Commissioner ptates:I do not propose to discuss the merits merits of the offences with which the officers were charged. Honourable members will presently learn why the Acting Commissioner does not sioner's recommendation. propose to do so. I intend, however, to says:discuss them very full y. The Acting Commissioner proceeds:and I wish to make it clear that there is no question as to the power of a Minister to submit to the Governor General n recommendation contrary to mine, or as to the power of the Governor General to disapprove iny recommendation. The point I wish to establish is that it is most undesirable that a Minister sbould intervene to vary the action proposed by the Public Service Commissioner for the punishment of an officer. "" I entirely dissent from that position, and I think that every member of the Government, and every member of Parliament who has ever held Ministerial office, would do the same-, n I want to know where Ministerial, responsibility comes in if a is to be a rubber stamp in the the matter of recommendations made by the I doubt very much of - whether the Acting Commissioner .had any right to make a recommendation in respect of any matter such as those which was are under review. In the Public Service Act, the only power which the Commissioner has to approach the Governor General is set out as follows: 5. . . . The Commissioner shall submit the consideration of the Governor General as to any matters requiring to be dealt with by the Governor General under this to The section speaks of "" reports,"" not of This is one of the matters with which the Governor General has to. deal. Sub-section 5 of section 46recomthe punishment section-states: (5) If any such charges are admitted, or are found by the Board of Inquiry to be proved, then, on the recommendation of the Chief that Officer, the Permanent Head may, subject to the regulations, impose a penalty upon sueli offending officer, or may deprive him of his leave of absence during a specified period; or the Commissioner may, according to the nature of the offence, reduce such officer to a lower class or grade and salary and wages,- or the Governor General may dismiss such officer. . . The only case in which a recommendation there referred to is the recommendation of by the Chief Officer to the Permanent to Head. The Commissioner has power to inflict certain punishment himself. Nothing at all is said or provided about a reor decommendation from him with regard to dismissals by the Governor General. There is, however, one specific case in which the Governor General acts on the CommisSection 65 If an officer appears to the Commissioner, after a report from the Permanent Head or an Inspector, to be unfit to discharge or incapable of discharging the duties of his office-, efficiently, the Commissioner or any Inspector may refer the question to a Board of Inquiry, and if such Board finds that such officer is unfit to discharge or incapable of discharging the duties of his office, the .Governor General may, on the recommendation of the Commissioner, deal with such officei-. . . . That is the only case, as regards officers, of a recommendation by the Commissioner to the Governor General. However, in matters of this kind, it has been the practice for the Commissioner to send on his recommendation to the Governor General through the head of the Department in which the officer concerned is employed.. Thus, these particular recommendations came before me-as . they would before any .other member of the Ministry. I have always acted on the principle that, when the matter under review has to do with promotion or transfer, or is of another type of routine character, the Commis. sioner's report should be accepted without comment. But when the case has concerned, for example, the annulment of the appointment of a probationer, or the imposition of a severe penalty upon an officer; or-stil l more seriously-the dismissal of an officer, I have refused to act until I have seen the evidence upon which the recommendation has been made. I have felt my .responsibility to bo so great that I could not do otherwise. May I be permitted to mention, further, the case of the annulment of the appointment of a probationer. These probationers are either boys or girls who have been appointed as messengers or telephonists. Their parents sometimes, no doubt, have been put to considerable expense, which they can ill afford to bear, with respect 'to 'the training and coaching of their sons or daughters for the prescribed examination. If .successful, the candidates are appointed for a period of six months, on probation; and, if the official report upon that term of service and the medical report are satisfactory, they are appointed permanently. If the report is unsatisfacPublic tory, or if the medical certificate is unsatisfactory, the annulment of the appointment may then be recommended. If the doctor, or head of the Department, recommends a six months' further trial, the oflicer may be given a further trial. The first .of these .cases which came before me came with asimple recommendation to ..the Governor General .that the appointment .of so-and-so as a probationer be annulled. I asked the head of the Department why this was being done, and he said, '"" No reason is reported."" I told the head of the Department to ask the Acting Public Service Commissioner to let me know the reason. I was told in this instance that the medical report was unsatisfactory. I said, "" Would you mind asking the Acting Public Service Commissioner to let me see the medical report?"" and on receiving it I acted. I remember that in one case when a medical report was received it ocmost - Mr Wise. cuTred to me that - it was 'not a conclusive report, and I said, "" Ask the medical officer if he is prepared to certify that this officer cannot ""be cured of the illness from which she is suffering within a reasonable time."" I did this because I have a recollection of a youth forty-five years ago applying for an appointment in a country town. The oflicial doctor had deliberately turned him down as being in bad health. I remember that - the youth's mother said at the time, referring to the report of the doctor, that he had got square with the lad's father for the difference the latter had had with him some years before. It was, perhaps, a good thing for the lad that he was rejected. He is living to this day, and is in perfect health.",158
807,Dr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That only goes to show that the doctors will say what the Department wants them to say, as in the Perry case.",159
808,Mr WISE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I am not suggesting thatj I can refer to another instance in which I wanted to know what the medical report was, and whether the illness of the oflicer, who was a girl, was incurable, or could not be cured within a reasonable time. In that case I said that the girl was to be given a further few months' trial. I heard, and of this I can speak only from hearsay, that the action I took was rather displeasing to the Acting Service Commissioner. I always had a feeling of extra responsibility in connection with such niatters. It was always present to my mind whilst in charge of both of the Departments m which I acted, that I was not merely a layman Minister. I happen to be a lawyer, and what might be pardoned in a layman Minister could not be excused in a lawyer, because he was in a better position to weigh evidence in these matters than a layman. That being so, I felt it my duty to go into all these cases. The Acting Public Service Commissioner in his report refers to two cases, and I shall deal with the last case. There was, however, a third case to which he does not refer. This and the second case'he mentions were of a similar kind. The first of these two cases was one in which a young man went away from the office without leave, and though he wished to resign he was dismissed.",159
809,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,r l understand that the serious charge against the honourable gentleman is that he was a soft-hearted Minister.,159
810,Mr WISE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That is a charge made against'ine. The first case occurred three months before the case which may be referred to as the case of the - bookmaker's clerk. He was a returned soldier who was discharged from the Australian Imperial Forces in October, 1918. He did not resume duty in the Department, and on 19th May the Deputy Postmaster General communicated with his mother, asking the reason why he was not on duty. He received a reply that the man was' unable to take up duty, as he was still under the doctor,, and medical certificates were supplied. On the 11th December, 1920; twenty months later, he advised the Department again to the following effect:lie. my reporting to Departmental Medical Officer before this. I beg to state that it has been impossible ior me to do so. In the first place, on the 1st June, 1920, it was useless owing to my incapacitated condition at that time.. Sinee. that time, however, I have: considerably improved. My father is in business here, and at present as away recuperating aftera two months' illness. It is impossible for me - to. leave until he. returns, as I have to watch the. interests , of the business in his ab1 sence. However, I will come before the Departmental Medical Officer to see if I am yet fit to resume dnty, and I sincerely trust that it will be in the affirmative^ as soon as I .pos1 sibly can. I also wish to state that I am extremely sorry that I have been unable to report before, this, but it has heen no fault, inine. He was then instructed to submit himself to the Departmental Medical Officer for examinationas to his fitness to resume duty, and, on the 1st February, 1921, he was advised of the medical officer's report, and was called upon to resume duty. As no communication had been received f rom him up to the 3rd March, 1921, nor had he resumed duty, action was taken to charge him, under section 46 of the Public Service Act, with having absented himself from duty without authorized leave, and without having shown reasonable cause for his absence. The charge was dated 5th March, 1921, but was not delivered to the man until the 17th March. In the meantime he advised the Department, on the 5th March, twelve days before he received the charge, in the following terms:I expected to he back to work long before this, but, as my father is still under the it is impossible for me to leave at present. I have previously explained in my last communication the position that, unfortunately, I Was .placed in. I therefore beg to be granted more leave. If it cannot be granted, I am foreed to put in my resignation, but this is greatly against my inclinations, but is my only alternative. : ' This communication was not dealt with , but was marked to be brought forward with his reply to the charge. On the 7th April, (1921,. the man replied to the charge in the following terms:Before I received this charge I wroteexplain1 ing the reason of my not returning to. duty, and asked 'if more leave could be granted.; if not, that I would only have one. alternative, viz., resign. I have had no answer to that communication, and that communication positively answered this charge. . . I think it severe of the Department-to charge me under section 46 for absence, without leave. I have explained everything, and can only say that, if this explanation, is received, I would like to make application for leave until after operationHe was in hospital then- "" otherwise I will be forced to resign. Notwithstanding, the distinct intimation that he would resign, the authorities went to the expense of appointing a Board, and the Board found the man guilty of being absent, without, leave,, and sent in itsrecommendation; In * connection with the finding; the Board commended to the consideration of the Chief. of Oflicer that the accused had served in the recent war for two and a. half years, and, in addition to being (wounded in action and gassed, sustained other injuries, all calculated to affect him temperamentally. Notwithstanding that, the Chief Officer recommended his dismissal.",160
811,Mr BILEY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Who was the Chief Officer?,160
812,Mr WISE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I do not intend to. say. This case occurred in one of the other States, and I propose to deal with the cases on their merits, without reference to. individuals.",160
813,Mr EILEY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,In which State did this occur ?,160
814,Mr WISE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I shall not name the State, because that might serve to indicate the individuals. Honourable members will bear in mind that the Acting Public Service Commissioner had all this information before him. On the 24th May, 1921, the Acting Public Service, Commissioner doctor, made the following recommendation -.for the approval of the 'General:That , junior mechanic (in trainting), be dismissed from the Public Service, a - charge preferred against him having been found to be proved by a Board of Inquiry appointed in accordance with the provisions of section 46 of the Commonwealth Public Ser- ; vice Act 1902-1918. Acting Public Service Commissioner. When I saw this I said to the Permanent Head, "" What, in the name of creation, is the reason for the dismissal of this man? sending him out branded so that it may be difficult for him to secure a position elsewhere because he has been dismissed from the Public Service. The man is an invalid, and he asked leave to resign. Why was he not given leave to resign ?"" I told the Permanent Head to see the Acting Public Service Commissioner and find out whether he would be willing to withdraw or cancel his recommendation. see the Acting Public Service Commissioner and made the following report.: As desired by the Minister, I have discussed this master with the Acting Public Service Commissioner, who stated he went carefully into the reports and was of opinion that hod been given every consideration by the Department. He agreed with the deputy Postmaster-General, - officer' who evinces so little regard for his position as this man has shown should not be retained 'in the Service""The ..man, as I have said, was willin g to ""resign<and therefore confirmed the recommendation -'for his dismissal. I consider that if the man did not suit - and wanted to go away, he should have been allowed to do so. I cannot see why an effort should have been made to do him an injury. The report continuesIf, however, the Minister thinks his tion should be accepted, the Acting Commissioner has no objection to withdrawing his recommendation to the Governor General for dismissal. I said that I did tliink that the man's resignation should be accepted and the recommendation was cancelled. Those are the particulars of a case which the Acting Public Service Commissioner has not mentioned in Ids report.",160
815,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"A similar case came under my notice, and I was told that if the Department let the officer resign he - would have the right to come back again to the Service! Mr Wise. Governor- Mr Wise - The answer to that is that when a man is allowed to resign in circumstances not wholly free from trouble, a note is made against his name so that if he applies for employment in the Service again the departmental officers can consider the circumstances under which he left. In the case W. B. EDWARDS, to which I have referred, I could not understand why the departmental officers should have' taken the action they did. The case was one which made a clear demand for sympathy,-because there was. the report of the Board that this man had two and a half years' war service, was badly wounded and gassed, and was temperamentally affected. The next case to which I wish to refer, and which is the second one mentioned by the Acting Commissioner, occurred a couple of months later. This was the case of a postal assistant, and he He did wrote into the office to say that he wished to be given six months' leave of absence without pay, for the purpose of assisting his father at home.' He said that he would not be engaged in outside employment, and that unless the leave were granted he would have to resign. Inquiries elicited the fact that he desired the leave in order to act as clerk to his father, who is a , that an licensed bookmaker. . Before a decision was arrived at-I , do not know how long a time elapsed-the man ceased duty without permission, and lef t his district. Here, again, was a case in which a man said that if the Department would not give him leave he was prepared to send in his resignation. I admit that he left his district wrongfully; but why did not the Department accept his resignation? Why was it necessary again to appoint a Board and go to the expense of proving that the resignaman was away from duty without leave? When I got the recommendation for dismissal, I made a minute to the effect that, in view of the statements in. the man's letter,. I thought he should be told to resign, as he originally intended. I said I thought the brand of dismissal was too severe, but, at the same time, for the reason set out in one of the paragraphs reporting the case, I thought he would be better out of the Service. That is the second case to which the Public Service Commissioner takes strong exception. In that case, the district inspector was of opinion that the man should be re-instated with a fine of £2. I now come to the last case, which is a very serious one indeed. This is 'the case, of which it is said in the newspaper""The officer referred to,"" says the report, had been found guilty by a Board of Inquiry of certain charges preferred against him, and the Chief Officer recommendedhis dismissal."" Mr Edwards was in accord with the proposal, and made a recommendation, through the Minister, to the Governor General, that the offending officer be dismissed. ''The Minister, however, submitted a recommendation to the Governor General that my recommendation be disapproved,"" continues the report, ""and that the case be referred for reconsideration. The Governor General, acting on the Minister's advice, and the Permanent Head, acting as Chief Officer, fined the guilty officer £10. The officer was then re-instated, and paid salary for the period (some five montlis) during which he was under suspension. This is a rather extraordinary case, and one of the most painful with which I have had to deal. It is that of a postal assistant, a returned soldier, who was brought before a departmental Board of Inquiry on a charge of having used in toxicating beverages to excess and of having been guilty of a breach of the regulations under the Public Service Act in that he was absent from, duty without authority. The second charge was the outcome of the first. The facts of the case are that about half-past 4 o'clock one afternoon a woman on returning to her home after an absence of only five or ten minutes, found that it had been ransacked. Running into the street she saw this man standing only a few yards away holding various articles of apparel, wrapped in a military overcoat. Recognising one of the articles protruding from the bundle as her property, she at once acoused the man, who was helplessly drunk, of having entered her. house and stolen the goods. The man was so drunk that he was unable to say where he had obtained them. He was handed over to a policeman, and on the way to the lock-up he was so intoxicated that he fell to the ground. Ho passed through two watchhouses before reaching that in which he was finally incarcerated. All the policemen who saw him said that he was hopelessly drunk. He remained in the lock-up all night. When brought before a magistrate next day, he told his story 'and was allowed out on bail in order that in quiries might be made as to its correctness or otherwise. When he again appeared before the Court, a few days later, the facts were explained, and the charge laid against him, that he had been found i u unlawful possession of certain articles, was dismissed. The departmental officials, had they chosen, could have charged ' him before the Board of Inquiry with having been guilty of disgraceful and i m proper conduct. If they had done so his conduct immediately prior to arrest oould have been brought under review; b ut they did not. The Board found him guiltyof using intoxicating beverages to excess and of having been absent without leave, and his chief officer recommended that he should be dismissed - The Chief Officer, in his memorandum on the subject,' after setting out the facts in the man's favour, statedAs against this there is, in my mind, no room for doubt that while on duty he stole the articles in question, when in an' advanced stage of intoxication. The public must be protected against employees of dishonest tendencies, whose duties give them the opportunity of visiting housed to attend to telephones and complaints in connection therewith. Under the mechanics award he cannot bi reduced in statusThat was the opinion of the Chief Officer, but I think he was wrongIf fined for his lapse the standard of similaremployees would be lowered by his example. Had he been, honest and straightforward he would have admitted the charg3 in the first"" instance and saved the loss of time and expense of a_ Board .to the Department, in justice to him I am advised he was about io do this when he wns advised to secure a solicitor and fight the cose. Having considered thecase carefully in all its bearings I am satisfied' that in the interests of the Service it is my duty to recommend his dismissal from the Service, and 1 must, therefore, do so. That recommendation was forwarded to the Acting Public Service Commissioner, who signed the following recommendation to the Governor General: That , mechanic, unattached, be dismissed from the Public Service, charges preferred against him having been found to be proved by a Board of Inquiry appointed in accordance with the provisions of section 46 of the Commonwealth Public Service Aei 1902-1918. This man was a returned soldier. Hfe had served' four years at the Front, had not a mark against him on his military record, had no police record, and hia thirteen years' service with the Department was not unsatisfactory. He brought with him from the Old Country a young wife, and a child had been born to him only a day or two before he was found 3862 Bvdget, intoxicated. In the circumstances m in u t e d the file as f o l l o w s : The penalty of dismissal is far too severe in this case. has served four years abroad with no blot on his military record. He'has no police record, and his departmental record is not unsatisfactory. There is, in my opinion, no evidence of intent to steal. evidence is overwhelming that he was very drunk. Everything was done in broad daylight. While drunkenness 'is no absolute excuse it is a reason for mitigation of punishment. He brought a young wife from England. Their born and he was induced to do what very many others had foolishly done similar circumstances-celebrat e casion with liquor, with the result shown in the evidence. He is not likely to offend again. A fine - and reprimand would, in my opinion, meet the case. I 'addressed the following m e m o r and u m to the Act in g P u b l i c Service Commiss i o n e r :Referring to the memorandum of the 24th ultimo from the Acting Secretary to the Acting Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner to the Secretary of the Postmaster General's Deportment I desire tp point out, as regards the statement therein that the recommendation for the dismissal of upon the finding of the Board of Inquiry into the. charges preferred against bim (which were only (a) using intoxicating beverages to excess, and fb) breach of the regulations in being absent from duty without authority)-the officer in question having admitted the charge of using intoxicating beverages to excessthat, whilst that may be technically correct, it is not really so In the first place, the Acting Commissioner's recommendation was an endorsement of that of the Deputy Postmaster-General, which was undoubtedly based on the alleged theft. in his communication of 5th July, No. S.1395/21, says:"" Defending my action, I reply:(1) There is in my mind no room for doubt that while on duty articles in question when in an advanced stage of intoxication. (2) The public must be protected against employees of dishonest tendencies,"" &c. This line 'of thought is clearly token up by the Acting Commissioner, as will be seen on reference to the memorandum to the Secretary of the Postmaster-General's Department from the Acting Secretary to the Acting Commissioner, dated 4th August, wherein it is stated -' ' I am directed to state that, although the Court dismissed the case (for stealing) against Mr the charge-sheet shows that he was in possession of seventeen articles which it may be reasonably assumed he would have taken away had he not been arrested.""' the first matter mentioned, and was palpably uppermost in the Acting Commissioner's The Acting Secretary then goes on to say :"" In addition to being intoxicated . (which is thus casually mentioned), he was absent without leave,""and his arrest by the police (which wasfor theft) and the hearing of the case (for Mr Wise. [REPRESENTATIVES.] 1922-23. I theft) in the Court brought before the public his unsatisfactory conduct as an officer of the Commonwealth Public Service."" Later on, again, he states :- "" The duties of a mechanic necessitate visits to the residences of the telephone subscribers, and for such work, the Department must have officers who can be thoroughly relied upon."" Tbis, too, clearly The refers to the alleged theft. No charge of theft, nor, as I have stated, of disgraceful conduct, was preferred against this man before the departmental Board of Inquiry. first child was - Mr BELL - And as a lawyer the under honourable member ' would say that the the ocChief Officer and the Acting Public Service Commissioner had therefore no right to take cognisance of the proceedings before the Court.",161
816,Mr WISE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Undoubtedly. ' My memorandum continuedIf the alleged theft is omitted from the case, I am perfectly satisfied that the single case of intoxication and consequent absence without leave, under the exceptional circumstances in which used the intoxicating beverages on this occasion, would never have been visited with a recommendation for such a draconian was based punishment. I cannot, therefore, delete the words from my proposed submission to the Governor General, as suggested in the Acting Secretary's letter of the 24th August. I paid the Acting Public Service Commissioner the courtesy of sending a memorandum to him advising him of the recommendation I intended to put before the Governor General in Council. I , thought it only fair that he, with the Chief Officer, should have an opportunity of reconsidering the matter. The only reply I received from him was "" Send on my recommendation."" He then took exstole the ception tto my proposal to refer the matter from the Governor General in Council to the Permanent Head, instead of returning it to the Chief Officer through him., and I wrote to the Acting Public Service Commissioner as follows: W it h reference to the procedure and the comments in the final paragraph of the communication of the 24th August just referred to, the words ""' Permanent Head "" were advisedly included, because he con exercise the powers of the Chief Officer-vid e section 13, sub-section (4) of the Public Service Act-and as it was Thot was my intention-as I have done-to re-submit the matter to the Acting Public Service Commismind. sioner, and through him to the Chief Officer, for reconsideration, before referring it to the Governor General, it would have been useless, hod the Chief Officer adhered to his former recommendation to refer it back from the Executive Council to him'. My recommendation was accepted by the Governor General in Council, and was then dealt with by the Permanent .Head, who fined the man £10. That, I thought, was a severe enough penalty. The Permanent Head then inquired what was to be done in regard, to this man's salary, explaining that, it was for me to say whether the whole or any portion of his pay in respect of the period during which he ' had been under suspension should, be - forfeited'. My reply was that no part of the> man's salary was to be forfeited. I took the view that he had been under suspension! for so longa time as f o u r and' a 1 half months, not because of any faul t of - his' own, hut becausetheActing - Public ' Service' Commissioner and I had been : engaged in a controversy in regard to his case; The-salary owing-to him in respect of his period of' suspension was: £90. The ' regulations provide thatWjhere an officer is suspended for an offence, and the charge Has heen found to be not proven, full, payfor tihe period of suspension shall be allowed. Where the offence is admitted or proved the officer may be deprived of pay for the whole or any portion of the period of suspension, but in any such case: the recommendation of the Chief. Officer shall set forth, in addition to any other punishment proposed, the amount of pay of which it is intended to deprive the offender, and any such deprivation shall be regarded and recorded as part of the penalty. Since we had been responsible for the long delay, I said, in the circumstances, the penalty of £10 was severe enough, and that the man should not be deprived of any portion of the pay due to him. I do not think' that those who have heard my recital of the facts of these cases will say that I did not do what was right. I felt it to be my duty as the responsible Minister to see that no officer in the Department was dismissed without justification, and I am confident that honourable members will say that the action taken by me in each of these cases was justifiable. In the report .of the Acting Public Service Commissioner there is a nasty i sinuation that this action on my part was the result of outside pressure, or, as Herald put it , of ""outside p u l l ."" said It is to be remembered that the political head of a Department isliable to embarrasstime, ment in' dealing with matters of this kind by representations made on hehalf of officers members of Parliament, associations of cers, or. even by the officer himself, and consequently may not be in a-, position to give the same, unfettered consideration to the facts as is. the Commissioner, who refuses to entertain any communication bearing on a matter of the kind while it is sub judice. It is a remarkable fact that, in not one of these - thr.eei cases was I approached personally or by letter on behalf of - tihe men concerned. I did net see them-, no*, : did they write to me, nor did any one interview me' in their' interests. I have gathered from the official papers that when the deputation 1 from thePostal Union interviewed the Chief Officer in reference to the last case 1 to which I have referred, they said that the man had had. a hard struggle to carry on, and was just getting on his feet when the matter arose. How he existed during, that long; period of suspension I do not know. At the time of his arrest his young wife was i h the hospital. She had. just given birth to a child,, and,, fortunately,, knew, nothing of what had"" happened to her husband, u n t i l the 'Police Court proceedings were over. There was a p it if u l scene when his union*, officials calledon them, in their home. The man did noteven approach the Department with a view of urging that there should be no delay i u dealing with his case, nor did auy one do so on his behalf. I do not know any of these men, and the action taken by me in each case was absolutely free from pressure or influence of any kind. All that I did was, so to speak, off my own bat.""' I dealt with the papers, as I found them on the file, in a way that I thought was fit and proper on the part of a Minister dealing with members of ' his staff, and I am satisfied that honourable-members will say that I did not,, as alleged by one . of the newspapers, shield a-guilty officer..",163
817,Unknown,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.80 p.m. (Friday). Dr EA'BLE PAGE - In personal explanation, I should like to make refern - ence to an interjection made by the M in ister for Defence (Mr Greene), this mornthe ing, from which it appeared that he had He an impression that, at some time or other, I had reflected upon his personal honour. I desire now to say that never, at any have I been guilty of any reflection by in any way upon 'his personal honour, or offiupon the manner in which he has carried out his public duties, or upon his in tegrity, and I want to show that there is no foundation for any such suggestion. By inquiry from the Minister, who directs me to. a perusal of Hansard of 16th August of this year, I find that, apparently, the Minister gained that impression from a speech which I made in this House when dealing with sugar matters, and in which I said I am not making a charge of fraud against anybody, but I do say that these matters require explanation. I want to. make it quite clear that I was then making no reference in any shape or form to the Minister for Defence. The context of my speech bears me out in this. I was referring to four cases which I thought were worthy of attention. Those cases had been dealt with, not by the M in ister for Trade and Customs, but so far as I could gather from ithe papers available to me, by the Prime Minister's Department, and he was not connected with them in any way. But I distinctly made it clear that.. I made no reflection on the personal honour of any member of the Cabinet. I can - well understand that, with the increased duties which the Minister has had to perform as Leader of this House, he is suffering somewhat from nervous tension, and, perhaps, in some degree is unduly sensitive to criti cism ; but I wish to state publicly that at no time did I intend to make any personal reflection upon his honour or his publio integrity. I take this opportunity of bearing my testimony to the manner in which he has discharged his duties as a Minister of the Crown and to his uniform courtesy to honourable members as Minister for Trade and Customs.",164
818,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"May I also make a personal explanation. At the outset I wish to say that If u l ly and frankly accept the assurance which the honourable gentleman has given. Perhaps I may be permitted to refer briefly to the circumstances under which the honourable member spoke on the occasion to which he has referred, and quote the passage of hie speech immediately preceding that which he read. The honourable gentleman said- : What I and the public desire explained is why the Government went outside the ordinary well-recognised channels of business to conduct sugar operations during 1920, when the condition of the sugar market was such that there were almost daily fluctuations, possible for fraud and corruption to take place in a way that could not possibly happen when the sugar market was stable for weeks and months at a time Then he went on to sayI am not making a charge of fraud against anybody, but 1 do say that these matters require Explanation. At the time. I took serious exception to his remarks, in the belief that they were directed particularly and personally against myself, and the honourable gentleman did not deny it at the time.",165
819,Dr EARL EPAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I do not thin k that I could have been in the chamber when the Minister m.ade that statement.,165
820,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Yes , the honourable gentleman was here. As I have said, I took serious objection to his remarks for two reasons. First of all, it had been whispered about the House for some days before the honourable member spoke that charges of eorruption were going to be made by him, and, secondly, the special purchases t p which his speech referred particularly were purchases for which I was peculiarly responsible. There were no other purchases of a similar nature. I knew all the circumstances, and I knew all the care that had been taken in connection with these purchases, because they departed from the ordinary practice, and therefore I felt the imputation very keenly at the time.

I now find that they have paid others-Warran t Officer Sherlow got twelve get. months' gratuity, and all officers twelve months' gratuity and pay lin lieu of leave; Sergeant Brown and several others got twelve months' gratuity.

829,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"After listening to those honourable members who have contributed to the debate, I am satisfied that our financial proposals are framed on sound to and sane lines. The honourable member for  that there has been no time to consider I do not want to dwell on for his own case, but I remind him that durand I ing the hours which have just gone by there was a long period in which he and a deother honourable members addressed themselves to the Committee at length, in some of cases for over an hour at a time.. If that not sufficient opportunity for offering r ithe necessary criticisms of the financial statement, I am afraid it is impossible to It has been said that no opportunity has been afforded for the discussion of the Budget, and that the Budget and the Estimates have been rushed on at the last, minute thing to say. - with a desire to a.void and burke sion. That, statement is a little., amazing when one thiuks back ower the last weeks and - months, during which, we been sitting and remembers, hcsw/ the of this Parliament has been occupied with censure motion after censure motion, and how proceedings, have, been delayed' how. opportunities, which might have if I take as a sample the speech delivered been taken to consider seriously the financial position of the country and the proposals of the Government have been neglected by the deliberate actions of honourable members. It is useless for now' to. turn round and try to say the fault lies with the Government. Ample time has been afforded, so far as every respect. we are concerned. The Government have been only too anxious, andwilling to have f their proposals thoroughly threshed out and considered. When the Leader of the Country party CiDr Earle Page), was speaking last night, he suggested that the. Budget had been greatest brought down this year at such an early date owing to the action of his party, but I can assure him that he is flattering himself and his party. Dr EAKEE . PAGE - I said that it been brought down early in pursuance the promise made to us by the Governand ment.",166
830,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member put the matter very much stronger than that. He said that the pressure and i fluence of the Country party had caused the Budget to be brought down at such an early date, and I repeat'that in saying this he flattered himself and his party. Neither he nor his party had anything to do with the early delivery of the cial statement. The Budget was brought down so early because the Government believed that during this very critical period of Australia's finances it was'deparable sirable the whole community should .have an early opportunity of learning what the Government's proposals were, and because we were convinced that, toy affording that, early opportunity, a great deal would be done to stabilize the whole of the commercial affairs of Australia. That was the only reason for the early introduction of the Budget. 1 The criticisms that have been delivered pffeued. against the Financial Statement are a very much upon the same lines, and in tsvery. case have been strained, indicating that there has been a hunting for someI propose to analyze some discusof the criticisms which have been advanced, and 1 think I can show that in few every case the facts have had to be have handled' in an extraordinary and amazing time manner in order to make out a case. I shall not deal' in extensow i th all: the points that have been raised by different and honourable members. Time will be saved! 1 by the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) , an ex-Treasurer, and! deal with it . Most honourable members^ I am> sure,' will be content if I follow that them course, and in doing, so,, show exactly that why my Budget and the proposals put forward by the G'overnment are sound' in - The right honorab.le gentleman disagrees with my Budget, and the suggestion . that I think was underlying his speech was that if he had been responsible for its preparation it certainly would not have been of the character of mine. I have the respect, for the ability of the righ t honourable gentleman, and at times when I have been burdened with the responsibilit y of the office I hold, the thought has crossed m y mind that. perhaps it, was a had great disaster to. this country he, was not of in my position. Since I ' have heard considered his criticisms upon the Budget, very much at the expense of m y modesty I am forced reluctantly to the. conclusion that it is fortunate n - for Australia tnat he was not the Treasurer intrusted with the preparation of this Budget. Honourable members will agree with me that the case which he placed before the Committee was prefinansented with that admirable clarity and precision of speech which always distinguishes his utterances; but the subject matter of his speech was in no way comwith the manner in, which he delivered it . The right honourable gentleman took eight points in all, but. he prefaced his remarks by saying that the Committee had asked for a decrease in revenue expenditure-last financial year, and had got an increase last year for which no' apology orexplanation had ' been offered to the Coraoni'ttee.. As a matter of fact, the yery fullest explanation was I ""made a statement in this l l chamber five days after the conclusion of the financial year. I dealt with each-Department separately, giving the: amount of the increased expenditure, and indicating the items which had brought it about. The Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Bage), in dealing with last, year's expenditure, went into exhaustive detail as to the estimated expenditure of each Department, showed where actual increases had occurred, and left'his case at that. ' He totally ignored the statement. I had submitted to the House, and he made no reference whatever to the explanations I had given in regard to each of these increases. If the honourable member's criticism was intended to be regarded as serious, of what use was it for the honourable member simply to repeat the figures I had already given in reference tb the increases in each Department. Surely if the honourable member were serious, he should have taken the items in which I indicated that we had spent more than was provided for in the Estimates, and shown where. Ave were wrong in so doing. Merely .to indulge in a repetition bn the 13th October of all that I had said with equal fullness on the 5th July, does not seem to be material or usef u l .criticism of last year's transactions. Yet. that is all the honourable member said in reference to last year's transactions. He was quite right in saying that we spent £1,000,000 more than was provided on the Estimates upon expenditure from revenue, but he entirely failed to remind the Committee of the amount of £378,000 which was included in that increased expenditure in respect to soldiers' pensions, which had been liberalized by Aot of this Parliament in September of last vear ;- nor did he mention an item of £300,000 which did. not appear in last year's Estimates, but is debited against the year's expenditure, as representing the compensation payable in connection with the Defence reductions which the Government carried into effect, bringing about a saving of ""1,700,000 per annum. A third item which the honourable member forgot to mention was the £300,000 which was made available for the Department of the Postmaster-General as a deliberate act of policy on the part of the Government, which was unanimously endorsed by Parliament, and in regard to which no one could offer the slightest criticism. No further criticism was offered by the honourable member with regard to .last years' expenditure, and when the right honourable member for Balaclava says that no explanation has yet been offered to the Committee, I suggest that he must have over-looked my statement of the 5th July. The Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) submitted to honourable members figures showing increases which I. had already given three months previously, but he completely failed to indicate where the Government had. spent money in addition to the sums"" voted by this Parliament which was not justified.",167
831,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,That is not the duty of an Opposition.,168
832,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It is the duty of the Opposition to point out where the Government are wrong. But I gave all the information to the Committee. I showed exactly where and for what purpose the additional amount had been spent, and the honourable member did not assail one single item of that, expenditure. I do hot propose to. delay the Committee with regard to last year's expenditure. I . come now to the points of criticism suggested by the right honourable member for Balaclava, which I am taking as a basis for the remarks I propose to make. The honourable member said that the Postal Department is still to be used as a taxing machine, and his remarks in this regard were endorsed by most other honourable members who spoke. The Leader of the Opposition commented on the fact that there was a surplus of revenue over expenditure in the Postal Department. The Leader of the Country party also dealt with that phase of the matter, and the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Prowse) offered very strong criticism of the action of the Government in taking into revenue money derived from the Post Office. Underlying these criticisms is the suggestion that the ordinary revenue of' the Commonwealth has benefited at the expense of the Postal' Departmental revenue. Each speaker has made it perfectly clear that that is the burden of his complaint, and the suggestion is that ordinary taxation has been relieved by paying in vast sums from the revenue derived from the Post Office. It has also been suggested that if the Post Office revenue had been kept apart from the ordinary revenue, and the Department had been allowed to' have the whole of its surplus for capital expenditure, we could show a very different position in 'the Post and Telegraph Department today. One honourable member said that we would not, in those circumstances, have to barrow anything to help the Department. I do not know where honourable members get their information, which at least amazed me. The real position is as different from the one they suggest as it is possible to be. Although surplus revenue of the Post and Telegraph Department has been taken to assist the Consolidated Revenue, the Department owes the Consolidated Revenue £7,259,118. In other words, the Consolidated Revenue has paid that amount to the Department in order to meet the shortage on that Department's own revenue.",168
833,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The Treasurer is not including in that the transferred profrom perties-the debt of .the Commonwealth the past. to the States in that respect.,169
834,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"No , I am taking the money for the purpose? revenue and expenditure. The position is that Consolidated Revenue or the general taxpayer has provided for the Post nnd Telegraph Department, over and above its own earnings, more than £7,000,000, which has been employed for departmental purposes, not one farthing has been paid into Consolidated Revenue as interest.",169
835,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,For what period?,169
836,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"For the whole period during which the Commonwealth has in control. I suggest to honourable memfor bers that the criticism that the Post Office has been used as a taxing machine is trary to the facts. The suggestion the Government have been taking vast sums of money from the Postal Departtained meut for providing ordinary revenue quite untrue. I would like to indicate what the Government propose doing, and facilities. that is a point in which the honourable  to be interested this morning. The Go the £7,000,000? vernment are desirous that the maximum facilities shall be provided by the ment at a minimum of cost. We hope, conjunction with the loan programme we are now carrying through, to bring the Postal services up to a state of full efficiency, and we shall at the same time endeavour to greatly reduce the cost of postal, telegraphic, and telephonic facilities. The Government's intention is that every farthing that is received in revenue shall be employed for the purposes of the Department. I suggest that that is, at least, one commendable action of the Government. We have grasped the nettle in our hands, have put the Department on a sound financial basis, and are re-organizing the whole system. But that matter has only been dealt with during the last few months, and much more has still to be done. While w.e are getting the position in hand, are we unreasonable in asking that we should at least get a little of the money back which the Department has had from ih.e general taxpayers? I am not suggesting that we are going to take the surpluses of the Department until we have recovereS the wholo of the amount, but when so much is beiug done in the Departmeut, the ordinary revenue is entitled to receive it some of the moneys it has had in ",169
837,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,That clearly indicates that the honourable member has not grasped the position even now. ,169
838,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"We have a works proand gramme for the Department-for prothe viding the necessary facilities. We are borrowing money for this purpose, and the Department will be liable for the interest. The position is not in any been way different if we borrow money the Department and charge iitt interest than if we proceed to charge interest in respect of money of conours it already has. The scheme the that Government are working on is to allow the Postal Department to become self-conto have the whole of its revenue,, is but be charged with interest upon the capital expenditure required for its Mr GIBSON.'-Is interest included in - Mr Bruce - The £7,000,000 is the Departn mount the Consolidated Revenue has in found for the Department, but the Consolidated Revenue. has never received one penny in interest from the Department.  paid interest on the money it took out?",169
839,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The position is that £7,000,000 is still owing to the Consolidated Revenue, but there has always been a large debit balance against the Post and Telegraph Department. It has never been the other way, by our having money on which we ought to pay interest. There has always been an enormous debit against the Department on which no interest was paid. The next point the right honourable gentleman raised was that last year there was a deficit of £209,000, but I would remind him that that point is a slightly false one. Our 'position last year was that wo could after balancing have shown a surplus, but, as a prudent measure, when we came to the end of the .year we charged £300,000 for defence compensation, which we do not have to meet until this, year, and which we could legitimately have leftover to be charged to the present year. The point is not worth dealing with at any length, but I have merely referred to it as it is one of the seven mentioned by the right honourable member. If this is one of the best points that can be found in attacking the Government's financial polioy-the right honourable gentleman placed it second on the list-the case does not appear to be a very strong one. The third point was that ordinary expenditure is still rising. I have searched and I cannot find anything which justifies such a statement. I have also asked the Treasury officials to see if I have overlooked anything which could alter the figures, and the result is that uo one has been able to discover on what conceivable grounds the right honourable gentleman could have based the statement.. The facts are against it. There is a decrease of £370,610 in ordinary departmental expenditure. The right honourable gentleman might have referred to departmental expenditure upon new works. But, taking these items, there has been a decrease of £2,112,374. Departmental expenditure, new works, and special appropriations-othe r than war-sho w a decrease of £1,211,533. The remark cannot refer to our total expenditure from revenue, because there is a decrease of £3,083,256. These are the facts, and it is impossible to see that the right honourable member has any justification for making such a statement. There is one possible explanation. He might have been thinking of what he deals with in the next point, which is loan and revenue expenditure added; but from the way his remarks are framed I do not think it is likely, because he uses the word "" ordinary"" and the words "" ordinary expenditure is still rising."" The only answer is that it is not so. The statement is inaccurate. The fourth point is that the total disbursements this year are to be greater than last year by £1,344,000; but that is a surprising statement when I have said that our expenditure from revenue has decreased by £3,083,256. The right honourable member has added revenue expenditure and loan expenditure together. Before I deal with that rather startling manner of making comparisons in expenditure for the year, I would like to point out one rather significant fact. The right honourable member compared, the total estimated expenditure for the coming year, both revenue and loan, with the actual expenditure from the same source last year. He compared the estimated' amount for this year with the actual of last year, and the right honourable member, who is a careful student of Commonwealth finance, must have known that the actual loan expenditure last year shewed a considerable decrease on the estimated expenditure for last year, brought about by the fact that there wns a heavy reduction in respect of War Service Homes and soldier settlfmont.",169
840,Mr SOULLIIT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The v expenditure from revenue last year showed an increase over the Estimates, and that balances what the Treasurer is now saying.",170
841,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It does not. The right honourable member for Balaclava knew that, for certain reasons, the actual loan expenditure last year was much less than the estimate, and that there was no possibility that the items which were reduced last year would remain upon the same basis; they would inevitably go up again this year. But, knowing that, he yet compared the actual expenditure last year with the estimate for this year, and so managed to achieve the point at which he was aiming, viz., that the Government were proposing to spend from revenue and loan £1,344,000 more than was expended last year. If the right honourable gentleman had compared the estimates for the last year with the estimates for this, year, he would have found that we are estimating to ispond £1,623,015 less. A rather interesting position has arisen. When I suggested that the right honourable member for Balaclava, had he not been straining in order to make his case, - might have compared estimate with estimate, the honourable member for Eranklin ("" Mr MCWilliams), who is a member of the Country party, indicated in the clearest way that that would be an impossible basis of comparison. His own Leader (Dr Earle Page) last night took me most seriously to task for not having my comparisons in the Budget on the very basis which the honourable member for Franklin quite clearly regards as ridiculous. The Leader of the Country party said last night that I should not have compared the estimated expenditure for this year with the actual expenditure for last year, but should have compared estimate with estimate. - Mr MOWILLIAMS - That is the only with effective comparison that can be made.",170
842,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Apparentl y there is a gestions. difference of opinion between the honourable member and his Leader. It seems quite clear, from the manner in which his comparison wa- made, that the right honourable membe./ for Balaclava was straining to make it appear that we proUnless posed to spend this, year more than wo spent last year. And no other comparison would have suited his hook. He lumped loan and revenue expenditure together. That is a most amazing thing to do. The two are entirely different in character, and in no circumstances, either in Gopoint vernmentfinanceor in privatefinance,are they ever brought together under the same heading and used for purposes of comparipenditure son. The right honourable gentleman, howsions, ever, lumped the two together in order arrive at the only figure that would port his argument that we proposed to spend more this year than we spent last year. I leave the Committee to judge that criticism for themselves. But I canpatriation, not avoid coming to the conclusion that the right honourable gentleman was strainmate ing his argument very hard indeed. do not know whether he does seriously suggest that the basic of comparison he used is proper, but if he does he must causing a good deal of consternation commercial circles, in which, I underspend stand, he now plays a prominent part. in the enterprises with which he . is nected, he is proposing to make compariported sons by adding expenditurefrom capital and revenue together, instead of comparing separately the expenditure from each source, some of his commercial friends must be receiving the shock of their lives at the introduction of a new theory into commercial practice. But granting, for the sake of argument, that'the right honourable gentleman was right in adding together the expenditure from loan and. revenue, I suggest that he has been a little recreant to his duty in this House. We have already passed the whole loan programme, involving an expenditure of £17,000,000, and the right honourable gentleman uttered not one word of protest, and gave no indication of where the expenditure could be reduced. Surely after he had made a very biting criticism of our proposals when he was speaking on the Budget, we were entitled to ask for his assistance when dealing the loan expenditure of £17,000,000, but we. received no assistance and no sugThe rest of the points made by him are based upon the allegation that the Government are proposing to spend this year £1,344,188 more than we spent last year. his basis .of comparison is admitted to be .fair, all the criticisms to which I have referred are"" wiped out.. The right honourable member has said that there is an increase of £1,344,188, notwithstanding a huge - saving - in - defence, and . his sixth was that we intend to spend' that larger amount, - notwithstanding the natural and inevitable falling off of exin connection with - war penrepatriation, and other war serto vices. Such criticism shows that the supright honoraible gentleman has been straining extraordinarily hard to make a case. Every one of those items of reduced expenditure-defence , war pensions, reand war services-ar e paid for out of revenue, and if this year's estiis compared with last year's expenI diture out of revenue, a deduction of £3,000,000 is shown. Yet the honourable gentleman based his criticism on the conbe tention that, notwithstanding all these in deductions, the Government proposed to £1,344,188 more than was spent If , last year. The Only way in which he concould establish his case, which was supby the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), is by drawing in loan expenditure OB> the. Post Office, immigration, the Murray Eiver waters scheme, &c, a procedure which is determined entirely by policy.. Those works .have nothing to do with the' expenditure from day to day^ and the economies. of which we. have heard so. much. These two criticisms, are absolutely unfair, and if the. right, honourable gentleman had wished to gives the fullest assistance to the Committee he should have' frankly shown that because of the savings in the Defence Department, and elsewhere^ we havereduced our expenditure by £3>000,000. Instead of doing this, he brings irthe whole of the loan expenditure, for this' year and last year in order to> make it appear thlat we are spending £1,344,188 more than we! did last year. ' The right .honourable gentleman next protested against the transfer to loan of itemswhich last year were met out of revenue. Obviously, the principal item transferredis the expenditure on the Post Office. Every time. I have spoken I have madei t perfectly clear that we cannot possibly meet out of revenue the necessary expenditure required . to put the Post Office on an up-to-date basis. Unless, it be admitted that it is legitimate to borrow for postal works, we must go without those postal facilities for - which every one in the .country is crying out. The. honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin) has contended that if we had not transferred that expenditure to loan, we would have been spending more from revenue, and our position would have been no better. OBut the honourable member overlooked the fact that we could not have afforded to spend those sums. We would have had to economize so as to meet with revenue the whole of our expenditure. Unless, we admitted that the expenditure upon such things as postalservices should be paid for out of loan, the expenditure would have been reduced materially, and the country would have had to go without facilities that are now being given. I come to another aspect of the criticism. The right honourable member for Balaclava was very concerned about the transfers to loan, but when the House gave its approval tb the loan proposals, and made. the. necessary appropriation, he. never attempted to show which of the-projected works should have heen charged to loan, and which should have been reinstated as a charge upon revenue.",171
843,Mr ISCHLLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That cannot be said 1 about honourable members on this side. Mr Bruce' - I admit, that the honourable member made a spirited protest, and did his best to have our arrangement altered. But it was very fortunate, for him and the community that we stood firm, and refused to entertain his ideas, because had we accepted them,, we would not have been spending, £3^000^000 upon the Postal Department this year; it.would have been lucky if £1,000,000. were provided for it. The eighth point made by the right honourable member for Balaclava was that if the new sinking fund' arrangements were not being brought into force the-surplus shown* would have been a deficit. I can understand that criticism, because the right honourable member does not approve of my proposal for a sinking' fund. But we are perfectly satisfied that we 'have devised a more effective system for the re1 demption of the national debfy and we have donethat at a reduced cost- £ percent: instead of f per cent. If we have done that it is a matter for congratulation, and not for condemnation, but holding the views he does; it is very natural that he should say that the sinking fund' should not have been reduced. . I would like to pause here to say that I have dealt with all the substantial' points of criticism .which were enumerated with that extraordinary clarity which the right honourable gentleman' possesses. He brought his argumentsunder the notice of the Committee in theremarkably forceful way ih which he can present a ease. Analyzed , however, thepoints he made are those I have stated. I suggest that none-of the points have any real substance in them. In nearly everyone of them the figures have to be strained to-make a case at all. When.I know that the case was presented by an ex-Treasurer of the Commonwealth, in a manner which leaves, no doubt as to his ability to pre*sent all the facts that should be brought under notice, and when I remember that the speech was - made in - a .thoroughly critical manner, by one who was not a friend of . the Government trying to gloss over its errors, I am driven to the conclusion that if nothing more than that can be said against the Budget, it is a better Budget than I had the remotest idea of. Apart from these criticisms, which were definite, there is a general suggestion running through all the speeches of the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt), and the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page)', and also though not to the same extent, through the speeches of the Opposition (Mr Charlton). The suggestion is that expenditure can be reduced, and that if the Government was a strong Government we would reduce it, and do many other heroic things. All the honourable gentlemen in their speeches, however, have been extraordinarily silent as to how we are going to do what they advocate. In this respect, I am not surprised at most of them. It is difficult for an honourable member outside the Ministry to know the details of the finances of the Commonwealth, but an ex-Treasurer of the Commonwealth could surely tell us, if it could be done at all, how it should be done. General criticisms are not very helpful from people who should be in a position l b show where we can effect economies if it is possible to make them.",172
844,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The Opposition showed the Treasurer how he could save £250,000 in respect to immigration.",173
845,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"If the honourable member really wants me to take' some notice of that interjection, I would'say that we all heard of his proposed reduction. It drove clean across the policy of the country. He suggested that we should blot out immigration and do many things that no thinking people in the country would countenance for a .minute.",173
846,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Do not say that we did not offer any suggestion.,173
847,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I will not say that; but I will say that the suggestions which the honourable gentleman made were worse than useless. If we would effect reductions, we must find out first where to make them. These vague statements are utterly useless. I get a little tired of analyzing the position, and I should think that any one who hears me must get tired of hearing it ; but it must be repeated. people will ignore the facts, we must keep pointing them out. Certain headings of expenditure are set out in the Budget and Estimates. The first of them is "" War Services,"" which include interest, isinking fund, war pensions, repatriation, and other war services. "" Other war services"" is a very small amount, and has practically disappeared. The only suggestion that has been made with regard to those items is that we should increase them by increasing the sinking fund. There has not been a suggestion from any one that we should reduce them, and no one expects them to be reduced. We have to stand up to our obligations in every direction, whether they are contractual or are obligations that we owe to the soldiers who fought for us. That part of the expenditure of the Commonwealth we cannot avoid. It is there, and we must face it. It amounts to a considerable sum. Last year it was over £31,300,000, and this year it has been - brought down to £29,465,000. No further reduction oan be made at the moment. The next item is additions to and new works. That has been brought down from £2,571,000 to £830,000, a reduction of £1,741,000. I do not think any one who has analyzed the new works proposals would suggest that we can further reduce this expenditure materially. I shall be very surprised if any honourable member can tell me where it can oe reduced. The point I wish to stress is that although honourable members have' made their criticism, they have not suggested that anything could come out of that item. The next item relates to special appropriations. Those have gone up from £14,900,000 to £15,800,000-a n increase of £900,000. In these special appropriations, there is interest and sinking fund other than in connection with the war, invalid and old-age pensions, maternity allowances, and payments to the States. Is it suggested that these special appropriations oan be reduced? The right honourable member for Balaclava tried to fasten upon me a statement that we cannot touch the special appropriations. I have never said or thought such a thing. What Parliament has done, Parliament can undo. What I said was that the policy underlying every one of these payI f ments was such that Parliament would not be prepared to reverse it, and that nobody had shown me which of the items could be withdrawn. I have dealt with of them several times myself, and the orable member for Cowper (Dr Earle diture. Page) dealt with it laet night. That the maternity allowance. Policy change in regard to that, but it will change in the direction of getting effective service for our money. No one blot any of it out. in this House, or outside it , has suggested t that the expenditure should disappear. must first shift the Government. Several suggestions have been made for better method of achieving the result we desire. No one has suggested that other of these special appropriations lie even altered. If honourable gentlemen' will read carefully the speech of the the Government has considered right honourable member for Balaclava, they will discover that he did not gest which of the items should come but there is a general suggestion running through his remarks that if 4he country had a strong Treasurer and a strong vernment, Parliament would be recomI mended to alter some of them. In regard to that point I should point the Committee that the right honourable member was Treasurer of the Commonwealth for two years. one of those special appropriations were in existence then. He waa in that position for the last few months cf war and the first year of peace. needs were greater than mine, but never suggested taking any of the special appropriations out and reversing the policy of the Government by Ac t of liament. I think that fact should be out. borne in mind when one read's the very definite words which he has uttered with tal and telegraphic facilities. regard to these special appropriations. The only other heading is that partmental expenditure, and, before reductions. speaking of that, I would remind the Committee that T have dealt with services, which cost £29,465,000; works and buildings, which i £830,000; and special appropriations, amounting to £15,869,000, which make a total of £46,164,000. As far as that total is concerned there does not seem be very much hope of reducing our exwhich, may have to be increased. penditure. The ordinary departmental expenditure' last year was £16,229,000, and this year we propose to spend £15,858,000. The suggestion in all speeches is that some economy would effected if members of the Government were worthy of their positions, and would be effected if the gentlemen who criticise were in our places. a one consider whether we can reduce the item honof £15,858,000 for departmental expenIncluded in that expenditure is there is an item of £3,696,000 for demay fence. Members of the Opposition say only bhat we can blot most of this out. The more present Government, however, will not If honourable members want that expenditure shifted, they The a figure has been arrived at after most that careful consideration by the Government. any It never could have been reduced to its should present amount but for the results of the Washington Conference. A f t e r the. sememes that were presented for a sugreduction of the expenditure, the Counout, cil of Defence was called to its aid, and the position was scrutinized from every angle. The Government will not Gorecede at all from that expenditure, and do not understand that it is the expenditure to which our principal economy out to critics direct their attacks. The next point relates to the Post Office. A f t e r deducting the Defence expendiEvery ture we are left with an amount of £12,162,000 from which to effect our economies; of that, the Post Office expend the ture is £7,756,000. Do honourable memHis bers suggest that we should effect our h f economies there? As a matter of fact, everybody is asking that we should in - crease the' expenditure, and nobody has Parsuggested that we should out any of it We are now embarking upon a big developmental scheme for providing posWith every efficiency that can be put into the of deDepartment we cannot hope for any big It will be an expanding business in the future, and we have war to remember that we shall not receive new any more revenue than is necessary to cost meet the expenditure. Therefore an expanding Post Office revenue will not help us to reduce the expenditure at all. Post Office expenditure comes in merely to as an item which has to be met, and The best we can do on the revenue side is to get the expenditure back again with no margin. If this £7,756,000 is taken the off we are reduced to £4,406,000 with be which' to effect these suggested great economies. But we have to remember that there are certain revenue-collecting Departments, the activities of which it There remains to would be as well not to completely cut off. I do not deny for second that there are economies, and large economies, that could be effected' in our Departments by better methods and greater' efficiency; but to that we can. do this with, an axe is to talk absolute nonsense. It cannot be so done, and. endeavours in that direction! could only result in chaos.. The cost of the Commonwealth Departments will, come down with the cost of Uving, and be accomplished without any reduction ifiund. in the standard of living. People, say. that percentage reductions today possible irrespective of the merits or the justice! of the> case; are talking on. basis that this: Government, at all events, will not accept.: Gradually and steadily greater efficiency will result from' appointment of the Board of Commissioners in accordance with the recommenvernmenttake dations, of the Economy Commission-, tion, and the Departments will be put on an improvedl basis. The point I am pressing is that we cannot bring about any treable mendous-, reduction, such as is suggested, when we have an area of only £4,406,000 to work om. This year we are drawing the accumulated surplus, plus the surplus we brought down, for. the relief of taxathat tion. Somepeople say we should not do this; but I say deliberately that cannot reduce taxation unless we do. Those people who would lead the publio of Australia to believe that if only theytaken were in. power they would reduce taxation by immediate eoonoinies, are certainly deceiving the publio. I sincerely they are deceiving themselves, but,, as to that, I have grave doubts, for I fancy they are perfectly well aware that they could not do anything of the sort. For if this we have been severely criticised, I am rather inclined to think we are expected to apologize for what we have done. The Government, however, do nothing of the sort, for we believe that we have acted on the lines of sound finance. To take this action needed little courage and a little vision, two qualities, in which I am inclined to think, from their remarks,, our critics are lacking. I desire to emphasize that what we have done is perfectly legitimate and proper. We have taken from' the people in the past £6,400^000 that was not required for the current services of the Government and we bave no business to keep money. We cannot, likea trading conin cern, which must provide for the dodge-that 1 Mr Bruce - this is. an electioneering one future, create a sort of a. reserve fund toi fall' back, on in moments, of. stress. That is. not a system of national finance that could possibly be countenanced. say We have to da something, with the surplus, and the alternatives before us are, first, to pay our debt with it ; second, to reduce taxation; and,, third, do what I have just said we cannot do-kee p it as a reserve fund indefinitely. As to our will debt, we are creating, 'a. sinking We would gain little Or who nothing by using this £6,400,000 to are wipe out £6,400,000 of our indebtedness. - Rut if we take part of it to reduce taxar a tion at a moment when taxation can be reduced in no other way, I venture to say - we shall do. Australia benefit thevalue the of which cannot be calculated. The Gothis course without hesitain spfte of their critics, because we know it to be sound finance, as I claimed in my Budget speech. The right honormember for Balaclava (Mr Watt), on the other hand, when addressing himself to the Budget, expressed his opinion on in the words, "" I say it is the road to 1 bankruptcy.""' He uttered them with all conviction he can impart to his remarks. Personally; I think he has no we rival ih that regard-and one would almost, have thought that something profound had been said. If £3,000,000 is out of the accumulated surplus to relieve taxation,, thinking people will agree that great benefit will result in the trust stimulation of trade and industry, the restoration of confidence,.'and the attraction, of foreign, capital. But the right honorablcmember for. Balaclava, says that we do this once, and then do'it a. second' and time, we shall, have wiped . out our resources, and will - have to re-impose taxation. I agree that if all these will things should happen-if we took £3,000,000 this year, goti in no increased revenue, . and made no rea duction in our expenditure-thoug h I am confident as to the contrary- I agree that we would, probably have to impose taxation in the third year. But is it not exaggerating slightly to say that in taking the course we have, we are on the road to bankruptcy? I suggest that it is purely grotesque exaggeration- a telling ; phrase, with nothing at all behind it. that We are told, thatthesereductions taxationarean electioneering e Budget, with, no rhyme or reason, except the desire to snatch and catch and keep votes. ' I am afraid that that is a reflection of the minds of the critics. It certainly is not the reason for the Government's action. The Government have made every reduction on sound, principles. The increase of the general exemption to £200 in the income tax is made on two principles*-on e that taxation should never touch what is necessary to the existence of the contributor, and the other that every tax ought to be so contrived as to take out and keep out of the pockets of the people as little as possible. The point was made the other night thatwhen people have to pay some tax it causes them to realise and appreciate their responsibility for the government of the country. That sounds as if it must be right; but I venture to say that the paying of £1 or 30s. in taxation does not arouse in a person any appreciation of his responsibilities; I do not think it the slightest effect of the kind. taxation of those who will come within the exemption costs an undue amount to collect, and this means taking far more out of the people's pockets than we receive in the shape of revenue. The next remission is the general reduction of 10 per cent., and I have already indicated why it is made. It is besause excessive taxation ever cripples industry and enterprise, and any relief, even if only small, will certainly do - a great deal to promote industry and stimulate development in this country. The war surcharge on the. land tax of 20 per cent. - I shall not weary the Committee by dealing with it in detail, because I explained it when the Land Tax Bill was before us-wa s a - special revenue 'tax levied on one class of property and on no other. It has no relation to the ordinary incidence of the ' land tax, and it is regarded as unfair that one class of property, and one class only, should be taxed, while other classes go free. The entertainments tax I also dealt with on a previous occasion, and I think that I then used an expression which more or less indicates the necessity there is for our people to have invigorating relaxation. If they are poor, it is dimcult for them to get it, and this reduction in the entertainments tax is' to help them to obtain that very necessary relaxation. The reason for the action of the Government in regard to .galvanized iron, wire netting, and tractors is obvious. We desire to help settlement in the country, about which we hear so much from the Corner. Action was rendered necessary as a result of serious difficulties that have arisen, owing to circumstances of the time, in connection with the anticipated manufacture of the necessary supplies of these commodities in Australia. There is. only one other point that I must trouble the Committee with-the proposed Sinking Fund. I .should not delay honourable members but for the fact that this proposal has received such biting criticism that, in self-defence, and for the information of honourable members, I must say a few words. The proposal of the Government is to substitute a i per cent, sinking fund for a f per cent, redemption fund which was ; has previously in operation, or, at all events, The was in operation during the previous year, but had no fixed or determined basis. Under our' proposals the debt upon which the sinking fund is operating will be redeemed within fifty years. When the right honourable' member for Balaclava was speaking in the Budget debate he offered some rather severe criticism on the whole basis of my proposals. He startedoff by more or less ridiculing the whole of my remarks. He said on that occasion: The Commonwealth operates, at present, a Redemption Fund. The Treasurer prefers a Sinking Fund. I do not, and I want to 'tell him and the Committee why. If his remarkswere to go without comment or challenge people might properly infer that i per cent, per annum paid into a Sinking Fund would do better work than f per cent - per annumpaid into a Redemption Fund. That is a legitamate deduction to be drawn from his somewhat desultory observations, bnt reflection, of course, will show members that this is a preposterous theory. I regret to disagree with the right honourable gentleman, but still I say I am right, and that it is his suggestion that is a preposterous theory, if one may use his rather biting terms. A sinking fund of i per cent, earning 5 per cent, interest will redeem the debt on which it operates in fifty years. A 'redemption fund of the. type we have had in this country will never redeem the debt. We may go on with it for ever, and' not redeem the debt, though, of course, at a certain time it will get to so low a figure that, to all intents and purposes, it will be redeemed. Even if a redemption fund is established which provides for a percentage contribution which is maintained on the original amount, the position is not greatly improved. That fund, at - J per cent., wiil not bave completely redeemed the .debt until 133 years have expired. But a sinking fund of - J per cent., earning interest at 5 per cent., will wipe out the debt in fifty years. There-fore, the'biting criticism of the honourable member for Balaclava is unfounded. The honourable member gave clear and interesting information regarding the difference between a redemption fund and a sinking fund. Schools of financial thought are evenly divided in their adherence to the two principles. However, I need not traverse the honourable member's arguments against a sinking fund, because they were based on a 'feature which will not be embraced in the Sinking Fund Bill which it is pro posed to introduce, but which, I regret to say, I shall, probably not have an opportunity, at this closing stage of the Parliament, to present. The feature to which the honourable member for Balaclava took special exception was the gradual * accumulation of funds in the hands of trustees as the years went by. He said that position might .constitute - a serious menace. I am inclined to agree with the right honourable gentleman. But, in the proposed Bill, while it will confer the .benefit of a sinking fund, operating at compound interest, the Government do not intend that trustees shall hold securitinue ties without cancellation over au indefinite period. Provision will be made in the Bill so that the securities, upon ing into the hands of the trustees, shall be redeemed as under a redemption fund; but the obligation to pay interest on the securities will be maintained over the period covered by the sinking' fund in respect of the particular debt. The whole of the debate has centred around the Budget, and criticisms have been directed from all angles. I thought it only fair, therefore, that I should in - of any honorablo member. form the Committee concerning the views and intentions of the Government. So far as concerns the matters raised during Mr Bruce. the debate, they have, to a great extent, strengthened my view that there is merit in the proposals of the Government. I am unshaken by the criticisms which have been uttered. A commencement has been made in the reduction both of expenditure and taxation. Sensational reductions cannot be achieved; but, with sane financing and stable government, a steady diminution of expenditure and taxation can be brought about. I am confident that that will be demonstrated, and that we shall see great expansion in the development of the conntry generally, if only we are blessed with the kind of seasons ro provide us with the opportunity.",173
848,Dr EARIE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Cowper) [4.5 J Iu speaking to the amendment,177
849,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT," Order ! Will the honourable member please resume his seat. I am called upon to make a statement from the chair on the subject-matter of which I have givenseveral previous rulings, and from which I presume .the Committee will not wish to depart. The purpose of the provision in the Standing Orders whereby a member is allowed an hour and thirty-five-minutes in which to address himself to a financial measure or statement was to insure that speeches should bo consecutive. It was never intended that there should be two speeches of the same length. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) intervened in the debate by moving that the amount of the first item be reduced by £1. I have taken upon myself the responsibility of permitting honourable members to conto speak for the full length of time allotted, as just indicated.",177
850,Mr MCSWILXIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,But the speech of com- the Treasurer did not touch the amendment.,177
851,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I have just mentioned that I have afforded honourable full members wide privileges, notwithstanding the amendment before the Chair. I have given them the benefit ' of the full limit of time, if they desired to avail themselves of it ; on the tacit understanding, however, that there should be no second speech on the part When the particular items are reached, in the course of dealing with the Estimates, honourable members will be free to discuss them then, and not now; and they may then occupy as long as two half-hours each in doing so.",177
852,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Cowper) [4.7] The amendment of the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) has for its object the postponement of consideration of the Budget until after the election. The Chamber is now thoroughly disorganized, and is practically moribund. Many honourable members have already left to catcli their trains for distant States. Yet, in a denuded Committee, itemized expenditure, amounting in all to £62,000,000, has come forward for debate. Sueh a position is not fair to this Committee, or to the taxpayers,- or lo the public at large. On a similar occasion three years ago, wheu the Government of the day were preparing for an election, although there was a Government majority of about twenty members, the Treasurer did not ""push"" the Budget debate or rush the Estimates through in a couple of days. The Government secured three and a half months' Supply and went to the country; and then, upon the re-assembling of Parliament, they introduced the Budget. Tho same course might well be adopted now. Honourable members are weary after an all-night sitting. Not one of us desires to sit. again throughout the night, but it appears to me that that course will be absolutely certain if the Government force us to continue. In such an event we will not be able to give fair and reasonable consideration to the ways in which this huge sum of money is to be spent. I urge the Minister for 'Defence (Mr. Greene) to consider the. request of the honourable member for Wimmera. ""His amendment has been moved only in order that our position might be made plain. The honourable member for Wimmera will be quite prepared to withdraw his amendment if the Government will acquiesce in his proposal. And, thereafter, honourable members of the Country party would willingly permit the,"" necessary Supply Bill to pass through all stages, practically without discussion; and, as there are still a few more Bills to bo more or less formally dealt with-bu t to which wo would not bo able to afford reasonable consideration if an all-night sitting were again inflicted-the Government would do well to signify their acceptance of the (Suggestion. Almost all the members from distant States have either left Melbourne or have booked their berths to depart tomorrow. Such of the business as still remains to be disposed of, apart from the Estimates, could be facilitated. And, altogether, I commend to the Government the example which they set themselves on the eve of the last general elce. tion. With regard to the statement of the Treasurer, I desire to make a few observations.",178
853,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Order ! I must again call the attention of honourable members to what I . have frequently pointed out before. When an amendment has been moved in this Committee general debate cannot ensue. That is clearly laid down in the Standing Orders. It is competent for the Chair, after the submission of the first item, to permit debate to extend over the whole range of the Estimates; and the debate is only restricted and concluded after the responsible Minister has replied. I have so far digressed from the strict reading of the Standing Orders as to give honourable members extended periods in which to address themselves to the Chair. However, tliere must be some finality. I now call attention to the rule, which is explicit, that, in Committee, members may speak more than once on the same question, but that when an amendment has been proposed from the Chair they must thereafter confine themselves to its subject-matter. Since I have been responsible for relaxing strict control for the purpose of affording honourable members wider freedom of debate, I must now put an end to that state of aflJairs. I may explain that, if a member desires to speak upon some feature of the Estimates, other than the specific item which it is proposed to amend, he will be free to do so when the item directly concerned is under review. Mr Mo WILLIAMS - It is a.pity that the Chairman's ruling had not been given before the Treasurer rose to speak. The Treasurer's statements require to be an, swered. Why should a Minister be allowed to make a speech covering the whole subject-matter of the debate, and after an amendment has been moved, if honoraible members generally-and the Leader of. a party particularly-ar e ruled out of order when they rise to refute those statements? I wish to know whether the Treasurer was speaking to the amendment or was making a general reply? If the latter was his purpose, I ask for a. ruling concerning whether he should not have been prevented from speaking until after the amendment had been disposed of.",178
854,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I am bound by the Standing Orders; and, so long as they remain as they are",179
855,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I submit that the Chairman has not been bound by the Standing Orders.,179
856,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Order ! striction is placed upon the opportunities of a Minister in charge of a Bill, or, having made a financial statement, to address himself to the Committee. .

857,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Canno t the Minister's statements be replied to?,179

859,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I cannot help that.,179
860,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"On . a point of order, am I to understand that the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) has moved an amendment for the reduction of the. amount set down in the first item; and that, following"" the amendment, the Treasurer made a general reply, and so closed the general debate? Although the Treasurer may speak as frequently as he likes, I submit that he should be just as strictly confined to the (Subject-matter before the Chair asany private member.",179
861,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member is not in order in discussing my ruling. I have already intimated that I myself am to blam'e for what I have allowed. After the honourable member for Wimmera moved his amendment, several other honourable members spoke. the Treasurer rose, and made his statement. I must intervene at some time, and it cannot be said that I have been illiberal when I have allowed several honourable members to expand rather than curtail their . remarks. There must be some finality; and I now appeal to all"" honourable members to abide by the Standing Orders, and wait until we reach the various items before speaking to them. Thus they will be afforded an opportunity to reply to the Treasurer.",179
862,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It seems unfortunate that last night I was prevented from proceeding further with the statement of my case, and today, when I rise tp reply to the Treasurer on the same debate,' and in conformity with the speeches that have been made, for example, by the honourable members for Gippsland (Mr. No re- Wise), andMelbourne Ports (Mr. Mathews), and the Treasurer, I am again the unfortunate member to come under the lash. The O HA IRMAN - I ask the honourable member to accept my assurance that it is not due to any fault on my part. I distinctly - remember the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley) asking the Treasurer, when he was speaking, if that was his reply, and the Treasurer replied, "" Yes.""",179
863,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Do I understand you, Mr Chanter, to rule that the mover of the motion can reply after an amendment has been put?",179
864,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I have not - ruled anything of the kind. I have already intimated that there is no restriction on the Treasurer, who can speak as many times as he likes. The Standing Orders make no. provision for this usage of Parliament. . The usage ie to submit an item, and to allow a general discussion on the whole of the Estimates upon that one item. That discussion has taken place. For many years past that has been the practice, and it has never been challenged until now. It is unfortunate that the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) should fall a victim because of the point raised, but I cannot helpthat.",179
865,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Is there any reply in Committee?,179
866,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The Treasurer, in Committee, can speak as often as he thinks proper. His speech has, accordThen ing to our practice, closed the general debate in Committee.",179
867,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I submit that, during last year, when the Budget debate was under discussion, I distinctly remember the Treasurer of the' day (' Sir Joseph. Cook) (speaking several - times. seemed to. speak after every honourable member who rose in opposition, and the debate was not considered closed. The CHAIRMAN:- I have already said that Ministers are privileged to do that under the 'Standing 'Orders.",179
868,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,But that should not necessarily close the general debate on the original motion before the Chair respecting the first item in the Budget. gathered from what the Chairman stated that the fact that the Treasurer had spoken practically closed' the debate on the general issue.,180
869,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"What I stated was that there is no such thing as closing the debate except by mutual consent. The honourable member for South 'Sydney (Mr Riley) asked the .Treasurer if he intended his remarks to be taken as his closing reply, and he distinctly said, ""Yes.""",180
870,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,He had no right to say that.,180

872,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I attempted to rise as the Treasurer got up, and if I had been able to speak then, I would have had more liberty than I shall have now. I shall confine myself to the particular item before the Chair, and I .again urge on the Minister (Mr Greene) the point that I have raised that he should favourably consider the proposition that the Committee should not deal with the whole of the Estimates at present, but that it should prepare a Supply Bill for, say, four months, to enable the elections to be held. Then we could come back to discuss the Estimates in the light of 3 what had taken place in the interval.",180
873,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Richmond-Minister for Defence) [4.22] - I must express my surprise that the honourable member for Cowper <(Dr Earle Page) should ask me .at this stage to consent to. such a proposition. If he desired.mc to take that course, surely his duty in accordance with the usual practice was to abide by the well-known method of approaching the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) or myself in the usual way, and putting the question to us. But when the honHe orable' member, through one of his party, submits, an amendment of this character in Committee, which, by its .very nature is a motion of censure r - Mr MCWILLLAMS - No .",180
874,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Yes , it is. It is always understood as such, and it has never been accepted in any other way to my knowledge. It is an extraordinary proceeding for the honourable member for I Cowper even to suggest that he would be pleased to withdraw this amendment so that I might consent to 'his proposition. No honourable member in my position could even dream of .doing such a thing, once such an amendment had been moved, and the honourable member knows it perfectly well. By his-mere act he has ; - forced the Government to go straight through with the Estimates, and he knows it. If he does not know that, he has not even an elementary knowledge of parliamentary practice. Mr Mo WILLIAMS - You said you were going straight through before this action was taken. - Mr MASSYGREENE - When was that?",180
875,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,You r Whip told me so.,180
876,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"There was no public pronouncement. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) approached me .about this very matter. He did not table a motion in the House, but the honourable member for Cowper has, by his action, forced the Government to go straight .through. I can do nothing else.",180
877,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,It is cutting the painter.,180
878,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Yes . If the honourable member is going to suggest to the electors that the Government should not have taken this course, all I can tell the country is that the honourable member haa compelled the Government to(take it . The course that the honourable member has adopted is the most extraordinary one that I have ever heard of in my short parliamentary career. If I were to accept the amendment, it would be an acknowledgment of absolute defeat of the Government at the honourable member's behest - It would put the Government in such a position that they would be' unable to hold up their heads in the country, and the honourable , member - would be the man who had forced the Government into that position.",180

883,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Order ! I gave the honourable member-for Cowper the opportunity of doing so, and he still has that opportunity, as a matter of courtesy. .He is the official Leader of the party.",181
884,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I was the member who made the statement that the Treasurer had brought down his Budget early in the session in distinct compliance with a pledge given by the Prime Minister during a nrevious debate. The Treasurer contradicted that flatly, and he said that the Country party were taking a lot of credit to themselves - I do not know whether I would be allowed to read about four words of what took nlace la&t session.",181
885,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I cannot allow that.,181
886,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The Treasurer was quite wrong. Thp Budget was brought on when it was in accordance with a distinct pledge given by the - Prime Minister, as Hansard will show. In reply to the Acting Leader of 'the House (Mr Greene), I would point out that the amendment, the acceptance of which he says would be tantamount to anadmission of defeat on the part of the Government, was not intended as a motion of censure. I agree with the honourable gentleman that the Government alone are responsible for the conduct of the business of the Committee. We have been sitting^almost continuously since 11 o'clock yesterday morning, and are not in a position to givo to the Budget and the Estimates the attention they deserve. The Government are attempting once more to bludgeon them through at a time when, owing to the long sitting, honourable members are physically unfit and mentally weary. I should like the Treasurer, who has spoken of the practice of business houses, to say whether there is in Australia a businesshouse that would expect its directors to sit continuously for thirty hours in order to deal with its affairs. It is absolutely impossible for us to discuss the Estimates at this stage. Questions have been raised as to the note issue and other niatters that should receive the careful consideration of the Committee.",181

888,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Year after year, the Estimates have been bludgeoned through, but we succeeded two sessions ago in extorting from the Government a distinct pledge that such a procedure would no longer be followed. It is a burlesque on parliamentary procedure and a political debauch to deal with the Budget and the Estimates under these conditions. I enter my emphatic protest against the way in which the Government are conducting the business of the country. The Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Richard Foster) has interjected that we shall all have to account to the electors for our actions. I am quite prepared to do so.

890,Mr MCGRATH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Ballarat) [4.41] Very serious objection is taken by Ballarat City Council to one of the contions ditions laid down by the Government in connection with its grant of £250,000 the States to enable the carrying out 18 public works on which work will be found 22 for the unemployed. I refer to the condition that no city councils may parti4 cipate in the grant.""' That is a;very cruel AYES. restriction, and I understand that the Bendigo City Council also takes exception to it. We have, unfortunately, in Ballarat, a number of unemployed, but the city council cannot do more than it has done for them. It would be necessary for the council to secure an amendment of the Local Government Act before it could increase its revenue, since it has already imposed the maximum rate for which the NOES. Act provides. How can the unemployed in Ballarat be expected to go down to the Otway Forest to work? Many of them are married men, and it would be impossible for them to keep two homes going on £4 per week. Mr RICHARD .FOSTER (Wakefield) [4.46] - In reply to the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH), I can only repeat that the conditions upon which PAIRS. this grant shall be paid are specifically set-out. The moneys must be used on highways and district roads outside of cities for developmental purposes. It is for the State Government to give' us a guarantee that this £1 for £1 subsidy shall be spent in the manner provided. The State Government are required to submit a schedule of the roads proposed to be undertaken, and this has to be approved by the Commonwealth Government. In the case of Victoria, it has been approved. The unemployed in the cities are not barred at all. Quite a number of unemployed from Melbourne and suburbs are already employed on roads in this State, and there is no reason unemployed in Ballarat should not participate in the employment scheme resulting from the granting of this sum Mx. MoGRATH (Ballarat) [4.47] We know, of course, that nobody is debarred from the right to secure employment under the scheme. I am only pointing out that it would be utterly impossible for unemployed married men in Ballarat to get employment under it . The the State Government will receive applicafrom the municipalities eligible to participate in the grant, stating how much to money it is proposed to raise on the £1 of for £1 isubsidy basis for developmental work. Under normal conditions this provision may be all right, and the city of Ballarat would be only too pleased to take advantage of the scheme, but unfortunately the ratepayers of Ballarat have been taxed to the uttermost farthing.",182

892,Mr MCGRATH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That docs not necessarily mean that there is no ground. for complaint. Bendigo, the only other large inland city in Victoria, has not a member here at the present time,' because the Prime Minister is flitting to Sydney.

895,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Barrier) [4.51] I desire to - bring under the notice of the Treasurer (Mr Bruce) a request which I made some time ago for information inconnexion with the suspension by the Commonwealth Pensions Department of the payment of pensions to New South Wales pensioners who became entitled to relief under the New South Wales Workmen's Compensation Act. The Treasurer, I have no doubt, is fully aware of the circumstances. 'The Miners' Accident Relief Fund was operating prior' to the introduction' of the Workmen's Compensation Act, and beneficiaries under that fund were specifically exempted by the Old-age Pensions Act from having their pension computed as income. That Act, upon which the fund depended, expired some years ago, but so far no stepshave been taken to apply the provisions of the Act to the Workmen's Compensation Act, and in a good many cases hardship has resulted. I u one case there was a demand by the Pensions Department for a refund of £40 - I should like to know if it is the intention of the Government to amend the Act in such a way as to enable the benefits formerly given to certain persons under the Miners' Accident Relief Fund to be extended to beneficiaries under the Workmen's' Compensation Act, and pending an amendment of the Act I - would like to know if the Treasurer will instruct. the Pensions Department to defer action.",183
896,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Flinders-Treasurer ) [4.55] - The honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) has certainly been very active in this matter. IHe has brought it under my - notice' twice already, and I .am afraid it is my fault that up to the present it has not been finalized. When he first spoke to me ou tihe subject. I made . inquiries, and found that the position was as he stated. I asked that a full statement of the case should be prepared, and that there should be a consultation with the Attorney General's Department as to what action was necessary to put the matter right. I regret that owing to the pressure of public business during the past few weeks I have not yet had an opportunity to go into the question. I can only tell the honourable member that, as I have seen the case up to date, the request seems to be a just and reasonable one, and unless somo new light is thrown upon it as a result of further inquiries, I shall certainly endeavour to take some action to give the relief he suggests.",183

898,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Flinders-Treasurer ) [4.58] - There are no negotiations going on at the moment between the Govern-' ment and the British Medical Association, but a great deal of information has been acquired by the Government from individual members of that body on the subject. The question of maternity allowances is dealt with in the Budget, and the Governor General's Speech also contains a definite pronouncement with regard to the whole question of national and public health. I can assure the honourable gentleman that when the Government are considering a scheme they will be only too pleased to seek his expert assistance.' On page 77 of the - Estimates there is a footnote with reference to the alteration in the - duties on galvanized' ironj wire netting, wire for use in the manufacture of wire netting, and tractors.

899,Mr MCGRATH,DEPARTMENT OP HOME AND,"Ballarat) [5.0] - I wish to bring under the attention of the Honorary Minister representing the Minister for Home and Territories a matter of considerable concern to those who work in country districts, and particularly in country towns. It has relation to the manner in which the Commonwealth statistics are collected. A great deal of injustice is being done to the workers in these districts and towns owing to the fact that arbitration awards fix lower rates of wages for them than are awarded to workers in the metropolis. It is contended that the cost of living in country districts and towns is lower than it is in metropolitan districts. That contention is not based upon proper grounds, as I shall endeavour to . show. The awards of Arbitration Courts are based upon cost of living statistics and industrial statistics prepared by the Commonwealth Statistician's staff, hut in the formulation of these statistics proper regard is not paid to lative cost of articles or'rent of houses of equal quality as between, say, Ballarat and Melbourne. The, Commonwealth Statistician's figures relate only' tb "" the - dominant prices - of specified articles"" which are required to be furnished in - returns from retailers and house agents. In other words, they seek only to reveal what - the workers in - various centres : actually pay for articles of food and groceries, and for rent, no regard whatever being paid either to the quality of the goods purchased or to the accommodation in the houses occupied. For instance, if the workers of Ballarat, owing to their poorer circumstances, are accustomed to buy a cheap grade of tea at ls. 3d. per lb., the predominant, price of tea in Ballarat is set down as ls. 3d. per lb. If , on the other hand, the workers of Carlton invariably pay 2s. per lb. for their tea, 2s. per lb. is regarded as the predominant price of tea in Carlton. The statistics as presented to the Arbitration Court would therefore serve to indicate that the average cost of the tea supplied, to Ballarat workers was so much less than the average cost of tea"" supplied to the workers of Carlton. In the same way, if the workers of Ballarat, owing to their circumstances, are obliged to live in a poorer class of dwelling, such as would not be permitted to exist in a Melbourne suburb, the rents paid by them for their poor class dwellings are accepted as the predominant rent paid in Ballarat; while the higher rents paid for dwellings in a Melbourne suburb, with higher standards of comfort, are regarded as the predominant rents obtaining in that suburb. The statistics thus"" indicate that a provincial centre like Ballarat is enjoying relatively cheaper houses than those made available to the workers in the metropolis, whereas, in truth, the Ballarat rents, compared'with the character-and quality of the dwellings, are proportionately higher than those paid by Melbourne workers for * houses of a higher standard. "" Predominant prices "" is defined to mean simply the price of the article most frequently bought, without regard to quality. The prices actually paid by Ballarat workers for certain commodities may appear to compare favourably with those paid in Melbourne, but the rethere may be no comparison whatever between the two articles as regards quality. Therefore, on the ground of equity, I urge that the wages of the Ballarat worker should be held to have the same purchasing power as those of a Melbourne worker. The la'bour and skill of each man is of the same quality. The value of the output of each is equal. Why should not both be put on the same footing, particularly when the selling price of an article made in the country centre is generally higher than .that of an article made and sold in Melbourne? I hope that the Statistician will have more money made available to him to enable him to collect more reliable information as to 'the predominant prices of articles in both city and country areas. If this is done, an injustice will be Temoved, and a step will be taken towards preventing the drift of population from country districts to Melbourne and the sea-board. It is unfair to compel a Ballarat. worker to accept less wages because he happens to be paying 10s. per .week rent for a house not worth more than £500, and without any of the conveniences of civilization which are to be found in the £1,000 house in the Melbourne suburb, for which the Melbourne worker is possibly called upon' to pay a rent of 15s. per week. The conveniences available in each building ought to be taken into consideration in fixing the relative values of city and country houses. I would rather pay £1 per week for a house in Melbourne than pay 15s. per week for a house in Ballarat and suffer a reduction in wages, as compared with those I would receive in Melbourne. I would be much better off in Melbourne paying the higher rent. Unfortunately, the whole trouble lies in the inability of the Commonwealth Statistician to collect the proper information on which to base his statistical tables, which carry so much weight with the President of the Arbitration Court. If the Honorary Minister will urge upon the Minister the necessity for increasing the vote available for the Statistician, I shall be quite satisfied for the moment.",184

After all, defence expenditure, whilst it may be necessary to some extent as an insurance, does not yield much benefit to the councarriage try, and from a productive point of view it has no value at all. We should aim at reducing this burden to its pre-war dimensions. What justification is there for continuing a large defence vote? I was proved during the war that the tary training that had been compulsorily given in Australia counted for very little on active service, because the conditions of warfare were vastly different from the method of training. Everything should be done throughout the world to avoid future wars, but, if one should unfortuintention [152] nately break out, new methods of fighting may be introduced which will mean the waste of the money spent in defence training. Whilst the compulsory military training may have been beneficial to our young men in their capacity as citizens, under war conditions, they were no better than thousands of other men who, prior to enlistment, had not received any training.",186

915,Mr MATHEWS,DEPARTMENT OP HOME AND,"Melbourne Ports) [5.17'J - I rise to say a few words in The Public ' Works Committee has presented-a report on the extension of the establishment at Point Cook. One of the witnesses examined by the Committee was Major- General White, who, I suppose, is one of I endeavoured to get him to support my view that we might utilize the Air Force for the carrying of doctors into the remote parts of Australia, and also for the of mails. In this way we woura popularize the Foree, which is sure to be one of the first lines of defence in years to come. Of course, everything associated with aviation is expensive, and, from the t commercial point of view, the returu is milinot commensurate with the enormous amount of capital required. I believe that training in the Army should fit a man for a useful part in private life, just as training in private life should qualify a man to become useful in connection with defence, if required. It is evidently the of the military authorities to-. make the A i r Force an important line of defence. I't is necessary, therefore, to popularize it, and the only ""way to-do it is by qualifying those engaged in it for civilian occupations. We are told that the defence of Australia in the air will probably necessitate the establishment of ah air squadron at Darwin, and another at. Papua, or some other northern islands. That must necessitate large and costly establishments. I think the military will the well advised if , in training aviators during peace time for fighting, they allow them to utilize their training machines for other purposes. The purposes for which I wish to use the aeroplanes used in central and northern Australia are not such as would warrant vate companies undertaking these operations for profit. If it were possible utilize a man-of-war for commercial purposes the expenditure on Naval defence would be diminished very considerably. That is not practicable, however, but if it is possible to qualify members of the Air Force for civilian usefulness a great benefit will be conferred upon the community, the A i r Force itself will become more popular, and the expenditure on the defence machine will be reduced. I hope that the. Government will give serious consideration to this suggestion.",186
916,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEPARTMENT OP HOME AND,"Richmond-Minister for Defence) [5.22] - Par t of the establishment at Point Cook is a training school. The squadron is organized for the training of pilots, who are not only put through a full military course, but are specially trained also for civil tion. After they have passed through the school they will be fully qualified pilots for the fighting Air Force if quired, but they are allowed to engage in civil, aviation. They aa-e, however, under an obligation to serve with the military Air Force in time of war. Provision is made on these Estimates for the training of civil aviators. The present A i r Force is the smallest effective nucleus that we can do with', but we must keep it up to a high state efficiency. There is no other school in Australia for training civil aviators. Therefore, the establishment at Point Cook is serving a dual purpose,' and I have no doubt that it will be of immense' importance to the country as time-goes on. mind.",187
917,Mr BELL,DEPARTMENT OP HOME AND,"Darwin) '[5.24] - 4 am very pleased to be able to support honourable members opposite on any question of military training, and I endorse what the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) has said in regard to the A i r Force. On these Estimates £251,042 is provided for that body, of which £151,915 is allotted to the military branch and £99,127 to the civil aviation branch. Although I am not likely to make the mistake that is made by some who have had no experience in military work, of thinking that a man who has had no training can be as readily equipped for active service as can a man who has had the advantage of universal pri- training, I see no reason why the members of the Air Force who are now being to trained cannot be utilized for civil aviation purposes. I was, therefore, glad to hear the statement of the Minister for Defence regarding the combination of the military branch and the civil aviation branch for training purposes. The services of the men so trained can bo utilized with great benefit to the Commonwealth for the carrying of mails and, as suggested by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, for doctors into the remote districts. I am perfectly sure that if that scheme is extended it will popularize the A i r Force, which, of coursej is a most desirable aim in connection with any military force in a community such as ours. There is no doubt that the scheme can be extended to provide for the carriage of mails from the mainland to Tasmania and other places. No other ""arm of .the service will avial>e needed as much in any future war as - the A i r Forces will be. Only those who as have had the uncomfortable experience of re- being bombed can realise what effect an aerial attack has upon even trained men, to say nothing of the civilian population. Aviation should be encouraged in every way possible, and any expenditure on this branch of defence is fully warranted. - Dr EARLE PAGE (Cowper) [5.29] My experience is that a man who has of been working for twenty-four to thirty hours without sleep is not more than 50 per cent, efficient, and probably only 25 per cent. The Government have decided to go through with the Estimates, and have a majority in the House, of the same Therefore, I see no use in attempting to discuss the items of the Estimates in detail) but I should like to know something about what is happening in regard to defence. First, I should like to know what is the exact position in regard to the Duntroon and Jervis Bay Colleges. Is there any likelihood of the two establishments being amalgamated? Then, we ought to be afforded some information regarding the various Factories that the Defence Departmeut is conducting. Amongst the contingencies for the Supply Branch are items of £20,612 for the maintenance of the Explosives Factory, £4,073 for the maintenance of the Acetate of Lime Factory, and £76,427 for the maintenance of the Small Arms Factory, all of which are on a nucleus basis. If these Factories are continued as at present, the^ will not prove satisfactory if our day of trial comes. The Avorkers in the Small Arms Factory, for instance, must be very highly skilled technical men, whose number cannot be rapidly augmented if we desire to increase our output. My suggestion is that it would, perhaps, be better to sell such establishments as the Small Arms Factory to the Maxim firm, or Armstrong, Whitworth and Company, to be run, not merely for turn'ng out small arms, but also for the manufacture of motors and other classes of maehinery. Such establishments in the hands of private enterprise would stabilize employment in the various - districts. According to the report of the Auditor-General, the position of the Small Arms Ammunition Factory is exceedingly unsatisfactory. He saysI t was pointed out in my report on the accounts for the year 1920-21 that, a9 the Colonial Ammunition Companvwas unable to carry out its contract with the Department Defence for the. supply of 6uiuu Aims ammunition, it had been decided to .lease the buildings, plant, and equipment of the company, and to conduct the concern as a departmental factory, the Department entering into possession on the 1st Januaryj, 1921. Although it was understood that the lease of the Factory was to be for a period of seven years from the 1st January, 1.(121, at a yearly rental of £20,000, the agreement does not appear to have yet been signed by the contracting parties, notwithstanding that considerable expenditure has been incurred during the period of over eighteen months since the Factory was taken over. On 15th-June, 1922, the Secretary, Department >of Defence, advised that, owing to a disagreement between the Colonial Ammunition Company and the Commonwealth as to certain of the conditions under which the Department went into occupation, no agreement had been signed yet, and, further, that a w r it had been issued out of the Supreme Court agaiust the Commonwealth by the company, and the Crown Solicitor had been instructed to defend the action. ' The Treasurer, on 30th December, 1920, approved of the establishment of a trust account in the Treasury books for the purpose of recording transactions in connection with this Factory's accounts, and the following amounts /£)no 000 £100,000, and £50,000 = total £250,000) were transferred to its credit from the Small Arms Ammunition Trust Account. The account was kept at the Bank of New South Wales, Sunshine, subsequently transferred to T?oyal Bank, and later to English, Scottish, and Australian Bank, Footscray. It appears to have been agreed that the Department was to purchase, at= cost price, the company's stocks of metal, fuel_, stores, &c. Application has been made by this office from time to time for the submission of the stocksheets showing the goods transferred on the 1st January, 1921, but these were not received until - the 16th June, 1922. The total value of the transferred stocks appeared as £109,535 8s. 5d. It was pointed out by the Department of Defence that it had been the practice of the company to take stock at the 31st December in each year, and arrangements were, therefore, made for a stocktaking to be conducted on the 31st December, 1921. The particulars of tbese stock-lists have been called for from time to time, but they have not - been received for examination. On the 2nd June, 1922, the Secretary, Department of Defence, advised that the stock-sheets compiled were not satisfactory: that it was certain from investigations that had been made that the lists would not represent the true position of the stocks at the date mentioned, and it was submitted that the apparent results of this stocktaking should be abandoned, and a further stocktaking be conducted as at the 30th June, 1922, when it was promised that eveTy effort would be concentrated with a view to bringing the stock-sheets nn for audit examination by the middle of August, 1922. A recent visit made by an Audit inspector of to the Factory to make a test check of the stock in"" the mill and the Factory stores showed most unsatisfactory, results. In connection with thiB inatter certain articles which were missing were found to have been abstracted by the night watchman, and this official was subsequently dismissed."" That does not disclose a very healthy state of affairs; and I should like information from the Minister (Mr Greene"") as to the real position in regard to all these undertakings, so that we may be better able to decide whether they could not be handled to greater advantage by private enterprise under contracts to supply the Commonwealth as required from time to time.",187

919,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEPARTMENT OP HOME AND,"Richmond-Minister for Defence) [5.37] - I must admit that, the two Colleges referred to by the honourable member (Dr Earle Page) present a difficult problem. Both my military and naval advisers are strongly opposed to an amalgamation. I confess that I was somewhat enamoured of the idea at one time, as a possible solution of thf d-ffioulties confronting me, but after mature consideration 1I have arrived at a different conclusion. We should have to spend something like £60,000 at Jervis Bay to enable the establishment there to accommodate two staffs. Notwithstanding the fact that the buildings are larger tlian are required for the number of cadets at present at the College, .the expense is due to the fact that the military staff bas to be housed. That is one reason, but no.t the only one, that may be advanced against amalgamation. We are looking carefully into the whole tion, and examining many propositions. One of these, submitted quite recently, is that part of Duntroon could be utilized by the New South Wales Government as an agricultural college; and that most useful suggestion is being looked into. It would undoubtedly reduce the per capita cost of the cadets at the College, which, under our nucleus organization, is unfortunately large. However, we have - effected at these Colleges considerable - economies, and are endeavouring by every means to reduce the . expenditure to the lowest possible rate. hope that before the next Estimates come up for consideration some further practical means will have been discovered of dealing with this dimcult situation. As to the nucleus Munition Factories, I referred to the Small Arms establishment when some previous Estimates w r e before us some time ago, and explained at length our policy with regard to them. I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that we could not get any private firm to take these factories over .and run them on our behalf; and the reason is simple. The factories are laid out for specialized work-for the production of special articles. There are some machines capable of ^doing general work, but the great majority are not so adapted, being special machines for' special purposes. Consequently, if a firm were to take over the factories they would either have to scrap a good deal of the machinery, or erect new buildings to house the additional machinery necessary for other enterprises. The honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) suggests that the number of men employed at the Small Arms Factory is small, and that it would be difficult' if an emergency arose to sufficiently extend the staff to enable the establishment to work at its full capacity. I cannot altogether agree with the honourable member in that regard. There are in all these factories a number of men who have to be specially trained for their job; the work they do is of a highly-specialized order, and it takes a considerable time for them to learn their business. On the other hand, when the factories are operating at their full capacity a large number of those employed are engaged on what is known as -"" repetition work."" Practical engineers or men accustomed to handling, posinot the same machine, but machines of the same class, could be picked up in engineering shops throughout Australia. The machinery is so accurate that it turns out the articles automatically; all that is required is some one to stand by and manipulate it . The simplicity of this class of work, and the comparative ease with which efficiency can be acquired, was illustrated over and over again in England during the war, when women in large numbers were engaged on this repetition work, and had no difficulty in mastering it in a comparatively short I time. The nucleus organization on which we are working necessitates our keeping on these ""key men,"" as they really are. We have sumcient work to keep them engaged. At Lithgow, for example, in the great tool room, we are using hands there to turn out tools for the ammunition factories which we propose erecting, including the cartridge-case and shell factories. Instead of the men making rifles, which we do not happen to want at present, they are engaged on the other work I have indicated. The same remark applies to the Cordite Factory, the Acetate of Lime Factory, and the others. The men whose services we have dispensed with are those who are ordinarily engaged in repetition work.",189

We should no longer compel our young men and boys to give up. their Saturday afternoons and place themselves under the control of a few military chiefs. This training serves no useful purpose, for it certainly does not fit the trainees to defend their country any better than it was defended by untrained Australians during the war.

926,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEPARTMENT OP HOME AND,"Richmond-Minister for Defence) [5.46] - The honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) referred to the state of affairs which has arisen as a result of the Government taking over the Small Arms Ammunition Factory. Some time ago- I think, quite two years - w e were faced with the position that the Small Arms Ammunition Company was so financially embarrassed that it was not able to carry on. The Government had to come to its rescue in some way or be. content to see the whole concern go into liquidation. The result of that would have been that the Small Arms Ammunition Factory would have probably closed down. We did not consider that it was in the best .interests of the country that such a thing should be allowed to. happen; and the Government decided eventually to lease the factory, to run it as the other munition factories were being run, and to take over the whole of the stock from the company, under certain agreements. Thereafter, various troubles arose; and, under the agreement with the company, the Government undertook to. take over such of the company's staff as were deemed necessary to carry on. Disagreement has arisen in connection with taking over certain members of the staff. The Government are being asked to take over certain men who, we think, ought not to be taken over. As the matter is at present the subject of litigation, I cannot enter into the actual details of the dispute; but I am free to say that we believe we are acting in the best interests of the Commonwealth while, at the same time, taking care to stand by the terms of our agreement.",190
927,Mr MCGRATH,DEPARTMENT OP HOME AND,"Non-commissioned officers have not been provided for in the Superannuation Bill.

929,Mr BELL,DEPARTMENT OP HOME AND,"Darwin) [5.51] - In the Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference) Act no reference was made, in the reciprocal schedule, to oats. Tasmanian producers, and particularly those, in my electorate, are concerned over the possibility of aa unrestricted importation of .New - Zealand oats. I draw the attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Rodgers) to a telegram from .Launceston, was published in this morning's Age. Strong exception is being' taken to some rumoured agreement for the remission'of duty on oats as .between the two Dominions. If there is anything in .the rumour, I .should like to be informed. I would certainly protest if the proposal were about to come .into operation. It is well known that the climatic and general conditions of Tasmania are very similar to those of New .Zealand.; and there is no doubt that oats grown in the 'Dominion would be a most formidable competitor with Tasmanian oats on the mainland market. We cannot produce grains as Cheaply as can Victorian farmers in good seasons. When occasional bad seasons are experienced >on the mainland, Tasmanian growers naturally benefit. If New Zealand oats are admitted free, or at a lower rate than under the Customs Tariff, my State will be done a serious injustice. : Mr 'CHABLTON - Is 'the .Minister a 'position 'to give the House 'any - information regarding the hop industry*? Mr 'RODGERS (Wannon-Minister for Trade and Customs) |5.'5'5] - My attention'has'been'directed to ""the telegram from Launceston which was published - in the Age. The information is based, apparently,, upon a statement by .a memher - of the .New .Zealand Government. It is not definitely asserted that .an alteration .in the rates of duty has taken place, but that negotiations are proceeding for the .free entry of .New Zealand oats into Australia. I am able to inform the honourable member that no such ""proposal has been adopted between the Commonwealth and - New Zealand Governments. I could not favourably regard the request of the New Zealand Minister for Trade and Customs for the admission of oats free of duty,, nor do - the Government intend to grant that request. I hope later to deal with . several outstanding items in the agreement between New Zealand and the Commonwealth. I have 'in mind, particularly, those which may be called the - bargaining items. With 'respect to the hop-growing indus'tiy, I^have.rgiven-much attention to'what has proved a very difficult matter. It should be unnecessary for me to refer again to the causes which have imperilled the industry; but I would remind honorwhich able - members that the 'conditions were so menacing that definite action had to be taken. I have had .several consultations, with the hop-growers on the one hand and with the brewers on the other ; and I 1 desire to acknowledge the assistance .freelyand fully accorded by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton). I am pleased to say that the negotiations have resulted in a very substantial agreement being entered into. Australian brewers have undertaken to use at least -85 per cent, of Australian hops, for three seasons, at a minimum price of ,2s. 6d. per lb. and a maximum of 3s. There is now the certain prospect of the stabilization of the industry .for three years, ,at any .rate, and it is the more welcome because it came at a time when the industry .was threatened almost with extinction. I compliment Tasmania upon the fact that that State sent over to the mainland a very tactful representative in the person of Mrs Raynor. Her presence demonstrated that when .the right type of negotiator is in selected good results iare the more likely to be .achieved. * The agreement entered into with the brewers should '.put hop-growers in good heart. I am particularly pleased that the .arrangement has been made by negotiation between the interested parties. The outcome has been to save. the Government from taking a line of. action w-nich we would be very sorry, and very slow, to enforce. It is far better that the 'two industries should have pulled 'together, seeing that both enjoy - the protection of their own home market. Proposed vote agreed to.

930,Mr BELL,DEPARTMENT OP HOME AND,"DaTwin) [6<0] - There 'are one or two matters in connection with the - Postmaster-General's Department that I desire to mention.

General) [6.11] - I desire to inform the honourable member for Deni on (Mr. Laird Smith) that I have in 'hand the matter to which he refers, and that he may rest assured that within a very short time. I shall be able to finalize it. In 'reply to the honourable member for Darwin (Mr Bell) and others who have spoken, I may say that I am instituting quite a number of reforms. These have received the approval of Cabinet, and I propose to outline them so that they may be placed on record for the information of honourable members. Prior to' 1920 it was the practice of the' Department to bear 50 per cent, of any estimated loss on proposed country telephone and telegraph lines, and to require ihe residents to furnish a guarantee 'Contribution to cover the remaining 50 - per cent. Under conditions laid down early 1920 by my predecessor, the Departtowards ment has since then been bearing 75 per cent, of the estimated loss, the proporquestion tion in respect of which the residents liable having thus been reduced to 25 per cent. This concession has resulted in a substantial increase in the number - of applications for telephone services, - many places formerly without a teleemphasizing sgraph or a telephone service now have that facility. It is anticipated that appatible proximately 190 country public telephone and telegraph lines will be erected this' financial year. Realizing the important part played by the telephone in the development of the country districts, the Government now further liberalizing the conditions governing the granting of these country services. It has been decided to repeal the present conditions whereby residents in country districts are called upon to make good by guarantee the deficiency from telephone lines, and to erect lines without guarantee or contribution in cases where the cost of a line does not exceed £1,500. The new conditions to be Estimates, [REPRESENTATIVES.] 1922-23. introduced will be on the following lines:- (a) Each application for a country line to be dealt with on its merits, and no application to be granted, unless the line applied for is shown to be in the public interest. (6) Subject to the conditions set out in (a) being complied with, approval to be given for the erection of lines in the following circumstances:(1) Where a line is estimated to yield within a period of seven years the required minimum revenue, or where the total cost of the line exclusive of administration charges, does not exceed £1,500, the Department will erect a line without guarantee or contribution from the residents. (2) Where a line will not yield the required minimum revenue within a period of seven years, and the cost of such line, exclusive of administration charges, exceeds £1,500, the Department will undertake its erection, provided those interested contribute in cash, labour, and/or material, 25 per cent, of the estimated annual deficiency, capitalized at 10> per cent, as at present. The adoption of the conditions set out or above will mean that approximtely 85 per cent, of the applications for the erection of lines in country districts will be granted, without requiring the residents into make any contribution or guarantee the cost of erecting the lines. I have been giving close attention to the of cheapening the cost of teleare phone lines in country districts, and am satisfied there is scope for improvement in this connection. Special instructions are now being issued to the officers enand gaged in the construction of such lines,the necessity for seeing that the cheapest possible class of line, comwith an efficient service, is erected. They are further being instructedmore particularly in the cases of short, spur or branch lines-to carefully investigate the possibility of reducing the cost by utilizing fences, scantlings, trees, is or other cheap means of support wherever that course can be safely followed, or, where practicable, by erecting lines inside the fences, - instead of along the road, thereby permitting the use of much shorter poles than would be necessary if the line followed the road. The instructions being issued also provide for the erection of these country telephone lines by contract, or - by local offers, instead of the Department itself doing the work, and where arrangements cannot be made to have the work done by contract or by local offer, endeavours are to be made to have the work performed by local labour at the ruling rate of pay for labour in the district concerned. It is anticipated that, by these means, the work will, be performed more economically than would be the case if .the Department had to send a gang away from their home station in order to erect the line. The more extensive use of railway poles in order to avoid the erection of new polo routes by the Postal Department is being encouraged. It is considered that, where a railway pole route is in existence, not in the interests of the taxpayer to parallel this route with a line of Postal departmental poles. It has been found, from investigation, that the use of railway poles will effect substantial reduction erected for a proportionately greater disin the cost of the erection of telephone lines. The cheapening of the cost of construction of telephone lines, in the manner lined in the foregoing, will .enable a larger volume of work to be done for a given sum of money, and should also result in greater expedition in carrying out works, as it will enable a larger amount of. work to be undertaken than would be the case if the Department relied entirely on its usual sources of supply for labour. It is doubtful whether the people in the country districts are fully cognisant of the liberal conditions which now obtain in respect of the provision of subscribers' services for country residents. Towards the end of last year my predecessor approved of a more liberal policy in this respect, and the instructions which were formulated to give effect to that policy, and which have my hearty endorsement, were issued shortly after I took over the Postal Department. Prior to the introduction of the altered terms referred to, it was the practice of the Department to restrict the expenditure on telephone subscribers' lines in country districts to a sum equal to the aggregate revenue received from the subscriber, by way of rental over a period of seven years. This usually amounted to about £21, and any cost over and above that amount had to be met by the subscriber either making a cash contribution or erecting portion of the line. The improved conditions now in operation provide for the erection of sub-'' scribers' lines for the full distance be-' tween the exchange and the subscribers' premises in all cases where poles are available, and the applicant is not required to make any contribution towaids the cost other than the payment of the usual ground rental prescribed by the telephone regulations for the length of' line required, which rental is usually about £3 per annum for a line which is not more than 2 miles distant from the exchange to which it connects. In cases it is where poles are not available, the De* partment is now prepared to erect a pole'line for a distance of three-quarters of simile from the exchange; if more than one* subscriber is concerned, the pole line is* 5 tance. . - - -« Briefly stated, where poles are available, outthere is now no limit to expenditure, andonly the requisite rent is to .be paid. Where poles are not available the limit is £65, equivalent to the cost of a! line three-quarters of a mile long. Another matter that should not be over- 1 looked is that, when the rates for telephone rentals and calls were increased in 1920, country residents were exemptedfrom the increase. As to the charges for country sub-' scribers'. services, the following particulars are furnished for honourable member's information:Annual ground rent within 2-mile rodlna.

Three or more paTty services, 2s. 6d. per annum per subscriber or instrument. - With, a view to increasing the usefulness 'of the telephone to residents in country districts, the Department has decided to effect a substantial improvement iiv the conditions governing the hours during which telephone exchanges are open for business. It has been recognised.that the limited hours of attendance, at present provided - t many country telephone' exchanges do not adequately meet the requirements of the man on the land,, who inmost cases is absent from his home during the gre'ater part of. the day, and does not return until after pim.j when the telephone exchange closed.. '.The existing regulations governing question of hours of attendance provide that continuous service shall be granted where the revenue is at the rate of £250 per annum or over. In cases revenue is less than £250 per annum, a day service only is provided. subscribers connected to the day service exohange desire' extended or continuous service facilities, they are required the extra cost involved - closing In calculating the revenue referred in the preceding paragraph, rentals from subscribers' lines and apparatus, and charges for local calls (i.e., calls between subscribers connected to the exchange) are included, but the revenue from trunk line calls is not taken into consideramasters tion. It has now been decided to make iclosing hour 8 p.m. instead of 6 p.m. .at telephone exchanges where the annual revenue from all sources, including trunk line calls, is at the rate of £150 or The result of this concession will mean 8 p.m. flxat approximately 371 telephone exchanges will be provided with extended service ut> to 8 p.m. free of cost to those concerned. This figure includes changes wliere the subscribers are at preproposal showed a surplus. sent paying the cost of providing extended hours of attendance. It has also been decided to liberalize the conditions governing the provision of continuous service at telephone exchanges by taking into consideration a proportion of the revenue derived from trunk line calls. The new conditions provide that continuous service is to be given at a telephone exchange where the revenue' from rental and local calls, plus 20 per cent, of the revenue from trunk line calls, is at the rate of £250 per annum or over. The immediate result of the alteration in conditions will mean that thirty-six additional exchanges will receive continuous service free of cost to the subscribers. This figure includes exchanges where continuous service is at present provided at the cost of the subscribers concerned! . .The adoption of the new basis in con6 nexion with the determination of the is hours of attendance at telephone exchanges will not only immediately benefit a large number of exchanges, but will the also result in telephone exchanges generally obtaining extended or continuous hours of attendance much sooner than they_would have obtained these facilities where the under the old conditions. Where In deciding to improve the conditions regarding the hours of attendance at telephone exchanges, the fact has not to pay been overlooked that by extending the hour from 6 p.m to 8 p.m. at many country telephone exchanges which to are established at allowance and receiving post-offices, it will impose on the allowance postmaster or .others involved extra work in connection with the provision of attendance between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. In order that allowance postwill not suffer any hardship in this connection, arrangements, have been the made for payment of additional remuneration to the extent of £20 per an-' num. to recompense them for the extra attendance provided at the telephone exover. change between the hours of 6 p.m. and Formerly the Department would not open a telephone exchange in' a country exdistrict unless the financial aspect of the ""Now the practice observed is fo freely establish telephone, exchanges in. country districts wherever' it. is practicable' to do so without asking the subscribers connecting thereto to make any contribution towards the cost of the exchange. All that is to necessary to secure the establishment of an exchange under existing conditions is for the prospective subscribers, two or more, to agree to pay the rental for the telephone - exchange service. Formerly the reduced* telephone trunk line rates between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. ap' plied only to continuous , service exchanges,, and this, meant that subscribers : connecting to smaller country exchanges had, in many cases, to pay the extra fee for opening the office after 6 o'clock, and, in addition, were compelled to pay full rates for trunk line calls up to 8 p.m. It has now been decided that reduced rates for telephone trunk line calls are to operate between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. at all telephone exchanges throughout the Commonwealth. With a view to placing prominently before people living in. country districts the liberal terms and conditions under which the Department is now prepared to provide telegraphic and telephonic facilities, a booklet is being prepared which it is.' proposed to widely distribute. This booklet-in addition to explaining the. conditions' under which the Department is prepared to provide public telephone and telegraph lines, as well as subscribers' lines and telephone exchanges-wil l contain detailed information showing how subscribers may erect their own lines and install instruments. The information is being prepared in simple and concise terms, so that the man on. the land will readily follow the instructions issued for his guidance. Details are also being included showing what are the most prevalent faults that occurto lines and telephone instruments - erected by subscribers, together with information indicating how these faults may be removed and also prevented.",192

Application has been made for telephonic facilities, and additional postal facilities' in various places, but, unfortunately, the permanent population in some cases is not. sufficient justify the Fostal Department in granting the request. The r.eal difficulty is how properly to assess the growth of such places and meet with the requirements of the Postal Department. BrisbaneWater isone of those spots in which the number of people likely to be served by postal and telephonic facilities is hard to gauge owing to the-, intermittency of tourist traffic, but it. is that very intermittency that is often responsible for making the work of a post-office more onerous and more important than, it would be likely to be in another place with the same number, of permanent residents.  ber can leave that matter to me.

When the Bill left this Chamber the In come Tax Assessment Bill allowed a deduction up to £50 in respect of payments by public servants into the Superannuation Fund. That deduction has since been increased to £100, and it is thought that the people who contribute to the superannuation scheme and get the PAPERS.

It will be remembered that for the purpose of facilitating the construction erection of wheat silos in the various States, the Commo.uwealth Government agreed to. inaie advances from time time, up to a sum not exceeding £2,8.50,000.

944,Mr MASSYGREENE,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT BILL,"I hope it will. At all events, this Pa.rjiamen,t ratified an agreement for such an advance to. Western Australia, and the agreement in the schedule of the Bill before us is a somewhat similar one.

If this. Bill 'be accepted, the Government 'will he authorized, suibjecj to-the terms of the agreement, to make the necessary advance. The erection by the company of silos and elevators, is estimated to cost £1,500,000, of which a sum not exceeding £1,000,000 will be advanced by the Commonwealth by way of loan-, when not less than 200,000 shares, paid up to 10s. per share, have been allotted to shareholdersapproved by the Commonwealth, and when not less than £100,000 has been provided and expended by the company in the erection of the silos and elevators. I wish to malee it quiteclear that under this agreement the Government has to be satisfied that the necessary number of shares has been taken up by ooria fide shareholders, and that £100;000 has been actually spent in the erection of the buildings by the company.",199

As regards the guarantee by the State I would call the attention to the proviso that if any time or indulgence is granted by the Commonwealth to the company the Commonwealth shall notif y the State within days. I do not think this is unreasonable; but care will be necessary in the carrying out of the agreement that any such indulgence should be promptly notified, otherwise the legal claim to a guarantee may be affected.

951,Mr MASSYGREENE,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT BILL,"It is not; the agreement before us is directly guaranteed' by the Government of South Australia. From that point of view, I think it is more satisfactory,",200
952,Mr CHARLTON,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT BILL,"Hunter) [8.88] - I agree with the concluding remark of the Minister (Mr Greene) that this is a more satisfactory agreement than the one made with Western Australia. The present agreement carries with it the guarantee of the State Government of South Australia ; and that ought to be sufficient for us. I think we are all agreed as to the necessity for, erecting these silos in order to protect the wheat, and to assist the farmer in other ways.",200
953,Mr HILL,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT BILL,They are a very doubtful proposition!,200
954,Mr CHAELTON,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT BILL,"After the experience of New South Wales we have to be very careful in these matters. I should have been loath to allow this Bill to pass without more severe criticism but for the fact that the State Government of South Australia is made responsible for the money advanced. t h i r t y If there had nob been this provision I should not have permitted the measure to go through without a protest. The sum of £1,500,000 is very large, but it is very properly provided that the co-operative company shall spend £200,000 of its own. It is now for the South Australian more than the Commonwealth Government to see that some reliable and competent person is placed in charge of the work, in view of the experience in New South Wales. The cost 'of ""the silos in New South Wales has proved exceedingly high, and, moreover, the work was bungled, while it is said that there are certain people who have made much money out of the transaction. I believe it is in the, interests of the country that so. We farmers should be assisted in the handling of their wheat.",200
955,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT BILL,"If the farmers put up £100,000, and the South Australian Government back the bill for the balance, surely that is safe enough.",200
956,Mr CHARLTON,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT BILL,"I have always been, a supporter of the principle of co-operation.",200
957,Mr HILL,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT BILL,There is nothing to show that it is a co-operative company.,200
958,Mr CHARLTON,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT BILL,I am guided only by what is stated in the Bill. Mr HILL . ' - It may be limited to a small number.,200
959,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT BILL,It is a co-operative company.,200
960,Mr CHARLTON,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT BILL,"I am anxious to encourage co-operation, but at the same time. I wish to safeguard the finances of the Commonwealth - The fact that the South Australian Government are standing as guarantors proves that they have confidence in the undertaking. It is provided in the agreement that the person nominated by the Commonwealth shall Bee that not less than £100,000 is expended by the company. He has also to certify that the erection of the silos has been satisfactorily carried out, and to ascertain that all the conditions have been complied with. There is a responsibility resting upon the Government in connection with the appointment of their nominee, and I trust that in making a selection a thoroughly competent and reliable man will be chosen. It is not altogether a question of construction costs of material, but one of securing the services of a thoroughly reliable officer. Although the South Australian Government guarantees to repay to the Commonwealth the money, it is our duty to see that a reliable supervisor is engaged, so that the money shall be economically expended. The New South Wales scheme has cost considerably more than was anticipated. I offer no objection to the Bill, because I believe that if the scheme is properly controlled we will be assisting in the right direction.  port the Bill. There seems to bo no valid reason why we should not authorize the payment of this amount; but I cannot see that there is any greater risk in granting a loan to the Western Australian company than to the South Australian Government, because, as honourable members will recall, one-third of the capital in the Western Australian company had to be subscribed by the farmers themselves', and £150,000 had to be expended before the Government were involved. The only difference I can see is that in one instance Government control has been eliminated as far as possible, and to that extent the Western Australian scheme is preferable. The risks to which the Leader oF the Opposition (Mr Charlton) referred will be carefully guarded against, because, if the undertaking is owned by the farmers, the work will be done in the most economical manner. In connection with the Western Australian agreement there was ample security for the money.",201

This money will be wisely expended, and I would like to see more money spent in Australia for developmental purposes, so that we may be placed on more nearly equal terms with our competitors in other countries.  - I support the Bill. When the Western Australian Farmers Agreement Bill was before another place a year or two ago, I expressed considerable doubt as to whether the whole scheme was not ""premature. I thought that for a State such as Western Australia, which is producing only 10,000,000 or 11,000,000 bushels of wheat per annum  now.  scattered area.  confined to one area.  annual production of the State and the widely scattered nature of the wheat country, I thought that the expenditure contemplated was premature from a bus : ness point of view. I could not see at the time that those enthusiastic advocates of the scheme, such as the honourable  derive any advantage from the expenditure of the money. I further objected to the proposal because the Commonwealth had no guarantee for the money it advanced, and in the event of the scheme being a failure, or not paying, as I thought would be the result at the timo, the Commonwealth might have had to. whistle for the money.   for Swan says it is nonsense; but I believe he was the father of the scheme then put before this Parliament. .This House has aceepted it, and ho knowledges its. failure so far.   in connection with the pious aspiration that the farmers of Western Australia had in connection with the bulk handling of wheat arc somewhat different in South Australia, where there is a total annual wheat yield of from 30,000,000 to 35,000,000 bushels, and where the wheat-growing areas arc not so widely scattered as they are in Western Australia. The scheme under consideraSouth tion is likely to be more successful a business point of view, because with bigger crop the bulk handling is likely to in the session, when I would be more successful. There is the additional advantage of the State's guarantee, Commonwealth interests are more fully safeguarded tlian was the case in nexion with the proposal considered Parliament a year or two ago. I trust that the South Australian Government will profit by the experience of New South Wales. It is true, as stated by Leader of the Opposition, that a good deal of money was wasted in New South Wales in connection with the erection silos, or if the money was not actually wasted, I do not think full value was tained for the expenditure incurred. Commonwealth is safeguarded, and if South Australian Government are satisout for themselves. fied to stand as guarantors for the repayment of the money, and the farmers themselves put up a fair proportion of the capital before a start is made, proposal is one that should - be accepted.",201

I congratulated the from Government on this upon a former a occasion, and even at this late hour be loath indeed to delay honourable memso the bers, I think I should, in these « special circumstances, repeat my concongratulation. The Government now havby ing made up their minds to enter into this socialistic ischome in competition with private enterprise, and to use public funds for the purpose of supporting prithe vate companies, I suggest that they should not dangerously dally half-way on the way to success. Instead of making of these compromising alliances with private companies they should undertake obthese public enterprises and go the whole The way, with a ful l measure of courage, the along the road which they have marked Apparently, the truth is that the company with sufficient ""pull""-the word is used without offence-and in a position to offer enough the security, can get loans on good terms' from the Commonwealth. On a former occasion, when Western Australian farmers were being bounteously afforded financial assistance, I expressed the hope that the money thus invested would be t is productive of good results.

969,Mr BRENNAN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT BILL,"I have only the as the surance of the honourable member; and, as to that, I am bound to admit that, hitherto, I have had no reason to doubt newhim. I would make only one request. I do not oppose the Bill, but I hope the Government will not be too discriminating in their loans of public funds for private purposes. I trust that the public money will not be loaned out exclusively to the particular friends of the Government or merely for the purposes of placating country interests. I suggested on the previous occasion to which I have referred that I might come along with a proposal for financial assistance to some of the boot factories at Fitzroy or Clifton Hill ; and that, if I could find substantial security, I would expect the Government to support the little enterprises in my constituency as readily as they do these big farming industries in Western Australia and South Australia. I give the project my benediction. I see in such * schemes as these the bursting buds on the great socialistic tree which is growing from their planting. And what of the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) ? He, too, gives this proposition his blessing. He is, then, my latest socialistic comrade. For the future, I shall call him, ""Comrade Best, of Kooyong."" Likewise, I am in the same camp as the honourable member for Swan, who supports this measure, although I cannot really understand why he should do so. He opposes Government interference in private enterprises; at any rate, generally. It is a pity that, on great mattens of principle, such as, for example, the Tariff-in regard to which the honourable member opposed the imposition of . all rates of duties, except upon onions and lucerne-h e should depart from truth and light to serve expediency and his own voters. But, so that I may not conceivably jeopardize this socialistic proposal, I shall further delay its passage only to emphasize the fact that I intend to vote for the second reading of the Bill, while joining with my new-found socialistic friends in wishing it every success.",202
970,Mr WEST,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT BILL,"East Sydney) [8.52] - I congratulate the Government upon undertaking this latest means for socializing industry, although I must admit that I strenuously opposed a Western Australian project of a similar character. I recall that, in the Senate, the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr. Pratten) took the same view as I did. My objection to the Western Australian measure was that it contained insufficient security. There was not even the suggestion of a mortgage being taken out. on . the ground on which the silos were to be erected. The Commonwealth was not even protected with respect to its advance through the State holding a lien over the ground or the structures. In my view, the first'thing to do with loan propositions of this nature is to secure a mortgage over the groundon which the silos are to be built. I understand that this South Australian proposal is of a co-operative character. If that is so, it must be a different form of co-operative venture from the kind to which. I am accustomed. I do not know much about the finances of the people of South Australia, but I have been informed that there are a few members of one family who own or have an interest in practically all the wheat grown in that State. I see nothing in the Bill to prevent a few wealthy people from holding practically all the shares in this co-operative concern, and utilizing the Commonwealth advance to their own personal advantage. I do not want to give well-to-do South Australian wheat people any cheap Commonwealth money. More millionaires have been created out of wheat in South Australia than in any pf the other States. I object to the Bill, because it provides for supervision over the expenditure of the Commonwealth's money only up to the stage of the erection of the silos. No provision is made even for the presentation of an annual balance sheet to the Commonwealth Government and the Auditor-General. I do not know of any private lending concern which would be content to advance a large sum on the flimsy form of agreement which appears'to be embodied in the"" Bill.",203

Tho last item is corn (millet) brooms, the duty on which will be 30 per cent, ad valorem. This schedule does not represent, I regret to say, a complete conclusion of the items outstanding between the two Dominions. We have differed on two items. Australia desired that the suspended duties provided in the New Zealand Tariff should be brought into operation against foreign fruit as regards dried fruits, particularly currants ' and New Zealand said, ""We will give you this advantage for your dried fruits if you will give us free entry to Australia for oats."" The problem was, I must say, one that baffled me somewhat. I was not prepared to surrender the oatgrowers of this country to a competition that would undoubtedly reduce their market, and make oat-growing, in my judgment, an unprofitable industry. On the other hand, we fail to get the full benefit from what I hoped would be a very favourable and profitable market for our dried fruits. I invite the attention of honourable gentlemen to some of their comments on the last occasion .when this subject was before the House. then said, "" Why did you not do better?"" The difficulty is that we cannot do better than the best New Zealand will give us. We have exchanged at least half-a-dozen cablegrams with New Zealand, and I ask the Committee to believe that we, at this end, have employed some little resource and strategy in endeavouring to secure that market for our dried fruits. I ask the Committee, and particularly producers of these dried fruits, to accept my assurance that I have done everything possible to secure the New Zealand market for our dried fruits. Pirst, the New Zealand Minister asked for free entry for oats. That I was not prepared to concede. The basis was increased to a duty of 9d. per central. That we could not see our way to accept. Finally, the offer was made at ls. per central, which we were prepared to accept, if New Zealand would allow us entry to her markets on a similar :basis. That she was not prepared to do. Each country today has a duty of ls. 6d. per central against the other. The New Zealand Tariff duties were altered last Mr Rodgen.. September, and prior to that time Australia did receive preferential treatment. The figures for the last ten years, excluding 1912, show that the importation of oats into each country from the other was about equal. In 1912 our importations were abnormal. New Zealand grows a different kind of oats from Australia, but so varied are the climatic influences and soil conditions of Australia that the island of Tasmania grows similar oats to those produced in New Zealand. Thus, if we had reduced the duty as required by New Zealand, we would have certainly cut raisins. away much of the market for Tasmanian oats. That. I was not prepared to do. I am sorry that in the absolute final analysis of the bargain between the two Dominions, the two items not agreed upon should be primary products. If I had been prepared to concede the entry of New Zealand oats into Australia by paying a duty of ls. per central, and had been willing to allow Australian oats to enter New Zealand at ls. 6d. per central, thou we could have had the New Zealand market for Australian currants and raisins. I was not prepared to take that responsibility. On the - mainland of Australia there are districts like Gippsland, the Western District, and Mount:> They Gambier, where oat-growing is potentially a large industry. I ask the Committee to believe that the Government did all it could in the circumstances to secure the New Zealand market for the dried fruit industry, but in the final analysis we were not able to do it without risking a profitable market for Australian oatgrowers.",204
976,Mr FLEMING,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT BILL,"Robertson) [9.14]. - This measure ought to be favourably received throughout Australia, inasmuch aa it will make for better relations between Australia and New Zealand. The Minister (Mr Rodgers) has told us that he has been bargaining, to some extent, between fruit and oats, and, as far as I can gather, he seems to have made fruit suffer at the expense of oats. Had he yielded somewhat on oats he could have done better for fruit. It - is a matter which needs careful balancing. I do not state my opinion as against that of the Minister, who has probably studied the question more fully than I , but taken by and large, fruit-growing is a more important industry in 'Australia than oat-growing. Oat-growing is a small part of the grain-growing industry, but fruitthat growing is an important industry'in",205

1020,Mr FLEMING,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Robertson) [9.47] I am glad that the Leader of the OpposiI f any- tion has taken a stand on the constitutional position. What the Government are proposing to do is very serious. They have deliberately held back many measures until the end of the session, and they are now forcing their proposals through a House that is not properly constituted. to deal with them. The provision we are now dealing with was agreed to by the House when there was a comparatively full attendance, of members. To-night very few members are present, and the Government are seeking to take advantage of that fact. They are really misusing the forms of Parliament. The motion to agree with the Senate amendment has a serious meaning for the man upon the land. Every man who has been a breeder of stock, knows that at the present time farmers are paying taxation upon assets upon which they may never realise. No amount of argument will get away from that fact. A man pays taxation on his produce and his stock. He then uses his produce to feed his stock; later the stock die. A l ready he has paid taxation on both the dead stock and the produce which has been consumed by that stock, and he is not able to get any redress from the Department. The Country party's amendment, made when the Bill was in this House, with which the Senate has disagreed, gave a man the right to decide whether he would enter up the natural increase when it occurred, and pay taxation in respect of it at the lower rate, or wait until it was realized and pay at the higher rate. Those who decide to pay at the higher rate would be sure that they had the money in hand before they were called upon to pay. It cannot be considered just that any man should be required to pay taxation upon income which he has not received. By entering up his natural increase of stock upon the taxation return he probably pays taxation at a higher rate than if he had shown no increase. If later the increase is lost he has lost income to that value npon which he. has paid taxation, not ou a ' flat rate, but on a rate which was higher than that on which ho would otherwise have paid. And I repeat that in some cases men are taxed upon the produce that they have fed to the stock. When both stock and produce disappear the farmer experiences the full effect of this injustice. The Government claims to have consideration for the farmer, but an amendment having been carried in this Committee in the face of Ministerial opposition, the Treasurer, acting on the "" win, tie, or wrangle"" principle, seeks to take advantage of the present state of the Committee, many members having returned to .their homes, to reverse the previous decision.",209
1021,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Are not the jority of senators cattle-men?,210
1022,Mr FLEMING,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"I am convinced that a number of the senators, if they will investigate this matter, will see that they have made a mistake. It does not matter whether a man is a breeder of sheep, cattle, horses, or pigs. If he is a small farmer who grows his own produce, he is hit harder than the bigger man who does not grow his produce. The Committee do hot seem to realise that the large breeder of stock very rarely feeds his stock in drought-time.. When he does he always purchases the feed. But the small owner grows and stores a certain amount of fodder, and in drought time makes use of it to save his stock. Men make provision for the average drought. But if the dry season lasts longer than the stock-owner has anticipated, or if he has slightly stocked, he loses both the stock and the feed' they have eaten. The large owner pays taxation only on the increase that has died, but the small owner pays twice - o n the stock and on the feed. This provision is designed .to protect the small man rather than> the large man. It will beneficially affect every grazier throughout, the Commonwealth, but, undoubtedly, it will be of greater benefit to the small owner than to the large. An honourable member interjects that the small owners are many, and the large owners few; but it is not only the numerical preponderance of the small growers which makes the tax more burdensome to them-the y suffer the further disability of paying on both the increase that has been lost and the feed.",210
1023,Mr EODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,The Treasurer has pointed out that the stock-owner gets an abatement in the following year.,210
1024,Mr FLEMING,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"He does for the average value of the stock, but he has already paid taxation on it, although he can never realise upon it. In no circumstances does a man get a refund of the taxation which he has paid on account of stock which have died.",210
1025,Mr BRUCE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"He does not get a rebate, but he gets an abatement'in the following year.",210
1026,Mr FLEMING,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"I hope that honourable members will realise their responsibility to the great primary producing industries by the development of which alone can the Commonwealth pay ma- off its debt, and that honourable members will give the stock-owner an opportunity to please himself as to how and when he shows his young stook upon his taxation return.",210
1027,Mr BELL,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Darwin) [9.55] - I have always favoured a cash basis for taxation purposes; that is to say, a man should not pay on an asset until he has realized. I agree with the argument of the honourable member for Eobertson (Mr Fleming) in regard to the principle at stake, but I do not think he is justified in suggesting that the Government have deceived this Committee, or persuaded the Senate to do what the Treasurer wished to be done, when he introduced the measure. I have talked with a number of senators whose interests are similar to my own, and I have found that their view differed from mine; overthey were very much opposed to the proposal which was inserted in the Bill at the instance of the honourable member for Eobertson.

The Bill provides additional pensions for limbless soldiers. Additional provision for men who have lost a limb, and thus suffered permanent mutilation, has been a subject of discussion between the Returned Soldiers League, the Limbless Soldiers Association, and other bodies, and the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen ) for quite a long time. Many proposals of various kinds have been submitted, and as a result of the discussions an agreement reached with the organizations, concerned, AYBS. and a schedule has .been prepared, which is to be the fifth schedule to the B.U1, providing additional pensions for cases of mutilation. This is regarded as a simpler way of dealing with the subject, the existing schedules setting out the pensions to which the proposals now before the House are additions. Honourable members have the Bill before them, and ' they will see that the schedule itself is NOES. really the principal part of it . There are a few amendments necessary in connection with the working of the measure; but 'the really important part is the f if t h schedule. . '",211

I am furthe r pleased to hear that the returned soldiers themselves are satisfied with the schedule. I have heard no objections to the Bill,, but I may say that there has, been brought under my notice the case of a blind soldier whose leg has been amputated above the knee. This man. is most unfortunately situated, seeing that he is in a hospital, where it costs him £2 per week for board. H is father reE resented the. case to me, and I believe it as also been mentioned in - the Senate. Is it possible, for the Minister to .make special provision for a case like this by granting some additional pension?

1031,Dr EARLE PAGE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Cowper) [10.12]. - I cordially support the Bill . Men who have lost limbs in the service of their country deserve the best treatment we can give them. I am gratified to observe that the pensionsoprovided are .to be given irrespective of whether or not the recipients are able to do work. It seems to me that, instead of being penalhas been ized for earning extra money, these limbless men ought to be encouraged in such efforts. iHowever, this - Bill is only a tardy meed of justice to those limbless men who have suffered in the past from the arbitrary way in which their cases have been determined. Many of these men find great difficulty, owing to their injuries, in undertaking any continuous work, and therefore they ought to be specially cared for.",211

1036,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"I would not dream of suggesting anything so unkind. The prorogation does not end the l if e of the Parliament. It is upon the - dissolution of Parliament that the honourable member's salary will cease, and I assure him that that fateful day shall be postponed' until the last moment. Question resolved in the affinnative. ROWAN COLLECTION . . Mr MASSYGREENE (Richmond-Minister trustees for Defence) [10.17] - I m o v e That this House approves of the purchase, upon such terms as may be arranged, of late Mrs Ellis Rowan's collection of paintings depicting bird ancl flower life in Australia, - Papua, and New Guinea.",212
1037,Mr FLEMING,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Do the propose to insert any limit respecting the price 1,212
1038,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"That is a question which it is impossible at this moment to decide. The Government could not .announce, at the present stage, what the executors of the estate would be prepared to take for the collection. To that end,, negotiations will have to be renewed.",212
1039,Mr FLEMING,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Did not the representatives of the artist want £3,000 and a grant of land in Papua?",212
1040,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"No , the original demand of Mrs Rowan for the whole collection, was £21,000. The Government considered that that was unnecessarily high. Honourable members will recollect that a committee of artists was asked to value the pictures in the collection. Those . artists put upon them a value, as works of art, which I venture to say was very much below their value as an intrinsic record of f a it h f u l representations of the fauna and flora of Australia, Papua, and New Guinea. The artist committee valued the collection from a purely artistic view-point, and the value which they placed upon the paintings was so ridiculously low that the Government felt they could not possibly offer such a sum to Mrs Rowan as representing adequate remuneration for that which was equivalent to her life's work. While I acknowledge that, perhaps, the wording of the motion may appear to honourable members to be somewhat irregular-that is to say, that the Government should seek authority to enter into negotiations without any mention of a specific price - I am bound to say that I cannot see how, in the circumstances, the Government could mention an exact sum of money in the resolution. If we were ,to submit to the House a given sum",212
1041,Mr BRENNAN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,O r if the Government were to'quote a maximum amount?,212
1042,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Exactly ! If we were to offer less than the maximum, the trustees would say, "" The Government cango so much higher. We shall not take; one penny less than the maximum."" On the other hand, the motion might mention a sum which failed to come up to what the would be. prepared to take by, say, about £500. Thus, our hands would be the bound. We would not be able to negotiate on the basis of even a comparatively small advance on the amount authorized by the House. - Government Mr MAXWELL - What is the purpose of acquiring the collection? Is it to be as a collection of works of art?",212
1043,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"I do nob think one can say that it is a collection of works of .art. The late Mrs Rowan's pictures are a faithful and beautiful representation of the principal flora and-to some extent-the fauna of Australia, Papua, and New Guinea.",213
1044,Mr SCULLIN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Hav e any negotiations been conducted at all?,213
1045,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Not since the death of Mrs Rowan. It was with much sorrow that the Government learned that, while negotiations were pending, and before was possible to conclude them, in order that Parliament might be given an opporin tunity to endorse the action of the vernment, the artist passed away. Her death was a matter of great regret to who had had the pleasure of knowing her, and had made some acquaintance with her wonderful work, which has secured, for Australia these exceedingly faithland ful representations of our bird life and flowers. The Government will endeavour to carry the negotiations able member. through to conclusion; but-if that be possible-it will not acquire them until Parliament has had an opportunity deciding definitely upon the matter of the actual purchase price. It may be possible,- of course, to afford that opporof tunity. The trustees may say that they are not prepared to leave the matter i sueh a position. They may say that they can sell the pictures in America or Engbasis land for more .than the Commonwealth Government are offering. If Government find themselves at stage, where it may be desirable high form of art. to have authority to close, they wish to possess authority to do so. But if , on the other hand, will be prepared to wait a little while the course which I have just indicated, namely, of referring the matter definitely to Parliament, may be adopted.",213
1046,Dr EARLE PAGE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Where do the Government propose that this collection shall be exhibited?,213
1047,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Eventually , no doubt, at the home of the Commonwealth Par liamerit, in the Federal Capital.",213
1048,Mr ATKINSON,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Then there will be hurry about undertaking the negotiations.,213
1049,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Meanwhile , if succeed in acquiring them, I believe the intention is to exhibit the*pictures the Exhibition Building.",213
1050,Mr CHARLTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Hunter) [10.25] I associate myself with the sentiments of the Minister for Defence (Mr Greene) in regard to the death of Mrs Ellis Rowan, who passed away before the negotiations for the purchase of her works had been completed. It is a pity that the purchase was not undertaken earlier. Por some months past endeavours have been made to come to .terms in regard to the pictures. I perceive, of course, that if the House agrees to the motion the it Government will be given virtually a blank cheque. I feel sure, however, that this matter they will properly conserve Go the interests of the Commonwealth. I refused to sign the requisition which was all placed before honourable members some time ago, because it proposed that, by way of part payment for the collection, the Government should give a grant of in Papua. Whatever is done, I think we should make payment in cash.",213
1051,Mr GREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,I agree with the honor,213

1054,Mr GREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Has the honourable memthe trustees ber seen the pictures?,213
1055,Dr EARLE PAGE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Yes , and-quite apart from the very dangerous way in which the motion is worded- I must add that competent artists have told me that these paintings, although they may represent in their colours theflowerswhich are to be seen in the scrubs and jungles of Australia and Papua, are,' as works of art, of not very high value. If we must have a series of pictures of the : flora and fauna of Australia, I would no prefer that we should secure faithful and effective photographic reproducwe tions rather than paintings which that are admitted by artists not to be in works of art. I have already indicated that I do not care for the form in which the niotion is phrased. It leaves the matter of negotiation altogether too wide open; and, upon both the grounds which I have mentioned, I shall oppose it.",213
1056,Mr BEENN AN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Batman) [10.281 I hope the motion will be agreed to. The proposal to acquire this distinctly unique collection of Australian work is one which should commend itself to every lover of this country. I suppose that there is nothing of its kind in the Commonwealth; it is doubtful, indeed, if there is anything like it in the world.",214
1057,Mr JACKSON,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,A large number of the late Mrs Rowan's paintings is to be found in English art collections.,214
1058,Mr BRENNAN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"No doubt! Mrs. Rowan was an artist of repute, who did splendid work for Australia. It is a pity that, when one gets a committee of brother or sister artists to pass judgment upon a collection of paintings, that decision is more than likely to be unduly severe. B ut I am glad to have this opportunity of publicly declaring my high appreciation of the splendid work which has been done for Australia by a lady who has departed this life. We have spent money in much less worthy directions, and I trust that we shall now do something which will be equivalent to justice, not only to the memory of a distinctly talented Australian artist, but to ourselves and to the children, who, for generations to come, will find pleasure and profit in studying the collection. I am confident that her works will be reproduced in books and magazines for the edification and education of future generations. In the circumstances, I hope we shall not cavil at any reasonable price which may be sought for the paintings. In this matter, although not in most matters, I am quite prepared to trust to the judgment of the Government. ",214
1059,Mr BRENNAN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"I do not know what price the trustees would require at the present time. I do know that a price was suggested by a committee that was appointed to examine these pictures, and I was pleased to hear the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) from his place in the House say that he would not demean himself by offering such a prico for the collection.",214
1060,Mr BELL,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"It was £3,000..",214
1061,Mr BRENNAN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,I think that was . the amount.,214
1062,Mr JACKSON,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,The Prime Minister spoke of a grant of land.,214
1063,Mr BRENNAN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"I do not think we should complicate the position by introducing that matter. I do not know it Ls essential from the point of ' view of either the Government or the trustees; but on the general question I sincerely hope that we shall do this measure of justice to ourselves and to the deceased lady by acquiring what I consider to be, having regard to its unique character, a collection of priceless works. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA EXCHANGES.

NA In Committee (Consideration Senate's amendments):",214
1064,Mr BRUCE,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Flinders - Treasurer) [10.341- I m o v e That the Senate's amendments be agreed to. The amendments are of a purely machinery character. The Bill , as I explained recently, is merely to correct an anomaly - which existed, by which income tax, although due at the time of a man's death, could not be deducted for the purposes of estate duty unless it had actually been paid. The Bill , as passed by this House, provided for the rectification of that anomaly by an alteration of the definition clause, but, after consideration and consultation with the Law ofBcers, it was decided that the object in view could be better secured by an alteration of the operative clauses. The Senate has, therefore, made the necessary alterations in the operative clauses instead of the definition clause. Motion agreed to. Resolution reported; report adopted.

I do this in fulfilment of a promise given to the House some weeks ago. accounts are complete, and take the place of the interim aggregate balance-sheet recently submitted by the Government. An aggregate balance-sheet is included, together with annual balance-sheets and a complete statement of the whole of the operations of the Commonwealth Government Sugar Control from its inception. I am pleased to be able to tell the House that, in accordance with the promise made by the Government, the price of sugar will be reduced on 1st November next, and that there will be no debit to be made up by the taxpayers. There will be a small credit balance, which shows that the pre-estimate of the advisers of the Commonwealth in this matter was correct. Complete arrangements have been made by which full supplies of BILL. sugar will be. assured the consumers, the manufacturers, and all interests conof cerned, on 1st November nex^t. Supplies will be available up to that date and i m -. mediately afterwards. Other arrangements have been made so that there shall be no dislocation of either the wholesale or the retail trade. There will be an abundant supply of sugar for the whole of Australia. To-morrow I shall give the House full details with regard to the methods of distribution and rebates.

Local Committees have been formed, and have done good work in cities such as Bendigo, Geelong, and Ballarat, where secretaries, The appointed and paid for by the Repatriation Department, have been in attendance. I regret to say that the Department is dispensing with the services of these officers so that its work in these districts will depend entirely on voluntary effort. In Ballarat there are a number of returned soldiers who require attention, as well ae a number of widows of soldiers who have grievances to be remedied. There is no reason why everything should be centralized in Melbourne. Wiry should returned soldiers in Ballarat have to write or come to the head office in Melbourne in order to secure the rectification of grievances? The local secretary in the employ of the Department at Ballarat gave entire satisfaction to the men. I trust that the honourable gentleman will give some consideration to the needs of returned soldiers wbo may not happen to reside in this city.",215

BRITISH EMPIRE EXHIBITION exhibition ground, APPROPRIATION BILL . Message recommending appropriation reported. Ordered That the message be considered in Committee forthwith. In Committee (Consideration of Governor General's message):",216
1069,Mr RODGERS,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Wannon-Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.43] - I move That it is expedient that an Appropriation , of Revenue be made for the purposes of a Bill for an Act to grant and supply out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund the sum of £115,000 to provide for the representation of the Commonwealth at the British Empire Exhibition 1924. This Bill is designed to carry out an agreement made between the Commonwealth and the 'States for the adequate representation of Australia at the Britisli Empire Exhibition to be opened in London in April, 1924. The Commonwealth ancl the States have agreed to expend between them the sum of £200,000. Of that amount the Commonwealth will contribute £115,000, while the States will contribute between them £85,000, which is to be apportioned on a population basis. In addition, the States undertake to defray the whole of the costs of procuration, preparation and shipment of exhibits f.o.b., from which point the Commonwealth Government will take charge. It will also be responsible for the whole of the arrangements on the other side. An Empire Exhibition Commission is to be formed here, and will be reoresen.tative of the Commonwealth and all the States. The Prime Minister and two of his colleagues will represent the Commonwealth on the Commission; the States will be represented by their respective Premiers, and there will be five other members, selected from outsidej who will have commercial or financial knowledge. It is intended that a special appeal shall be made to Australia to see that the fullest advantage is taken of this unique opportunity to advertise our products and resources. The exhibition will remain open for six months, and meals prepared from Empire and Dominion products will be supplied - there. Australia will be afforded, not only a magnificent opportunity to advertise for six months all that she has. to display, but an opportunity for the consumption of her food products in the great Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended. Resolution adopted. Ordered That Mr Rodgers and Mr Greene do prepare and bring in a Bill to carry out the foregoing resolution.

1070,Mr GEEENE,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Eichmond-Minister for Defence) [11 a.m.] - In the absence of the Attorney-General (Mr Groom), who is indisposed, I move That this Bill be now read a second time. It merely proposes some small amendments to help the process of naturalization in the Territory of Papua and Norfolk Island 'in regard to which certain technical difficulties have arisen. There is, for instance, an old man who has lived in Norfolk Island for many years,, but who cannot become naturalized as a citizen of the Commonwealth, and .is experiencing considerable hardship in * consequence. The ' Bill will enable us to do for him what we do for other citizens.",216
1071,Mr MATHEWS,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Is Lord Howe Island all right?,216
1072,Mr MASSYGREENE,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I think it is; but, in any case, a provision in the Bill enables the Governor General, by proclamation, to bring any Territory of the Commonwealth under the Nationality Act. This is particularly /necessary an regard to Norfolk Island and Papua. The Commonwealth has adopted Part II . of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914, under which the naturalization of a British subject holds good throughout the Empire. Prior to the passing of that Act a person'naturalized in Australia lost his British citizenship if he removed to any other part of the Empire.",216
1073,Mr CHARLTON,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"We should extend the Nationality Act to the islands under our control, and I think that the amendments proposed by the Bill are necessary. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clauses 1 to 9 agreed to. . . Clause 10Section 25 of the principal Act is amended by adding at the end of sub-section (2) the words "" or a territory.""",217

1075,Mr MASSYGREENE,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Richmond-Minister for Defence) [11.12 a.m.] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This measure follows the lines of section 9 (a) of the Trade Marks Act, which applies to the' Territory of Papua. Its object is to bring all the Commonwealth Territory, including the Mandated Territory, into the area covered by the Trade Marks Act. The existing position in New Guinea is that under Territorial Ordinance No. 1 of 1921, the Commonwealth Trade Marks Act is applied to the Territory as far as it is applicable. The effect of that is to make the Trade Marks Act a law of the Territory, and to enable trade marks to be registered there. Whether any trade marks have been so registered is not known, but if any have been they will remain Territorial trade marks. It was not thought necessary to put in any provision for conversion of these marks into Commonwealth marks. There would be nothing to prevent the owner of a Territorial mark applying for the mark as a Commonwealth mark. No difficulty under this head has arisen in Papua, where, I believe, a few trade marks were registered before that Territory was brought into the area of the Trade Marks Act. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill rend a second time and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. JURY EXEMPTI ON BILL.",217
1076,Mr MASSYGREENE,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,Richmond-Minister for Defence) [11.14 a.m.] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. Its only purpose is to exempt Commonwealth railway officers from serving on juries. The States already give that exemption to their officers. Question - resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time and passed .through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. SENATE. from SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF PROCESS BILL.,217
1077,Mr MASSYGREENE,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Richmond-Minister for Defence) [11.15 a.m.] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This is another short measure, and all it does is to be found in clause 2, which adds a new section to the principal Act. It is in effect an amendment of paragraph 6 of sub-section 3 of section IS of that Act, which reads(3) Such Justices of the Peace may(b) admit the person to bail ou such recognisances as he thinks fit, conditioned to appear at the appointed place in the State or part of the Commonwealth in which the warrant was issued and-answer the charge or complaint or be dealt with according to law. But supposing the conditions of recognisance upon which a person is admitted to hail are not complied with, what is to happen? The Act provides for no sanction or penalty to overcome this omission; and the Bill provides that failing compliance with the conditions of the recognisance, the Justice of the Peace may declare the recognisance forfeited, and the payment of any sum due shall thereunder be recoverable as a fine. Several cases have arisen, under the existing law, where it has not been possible, in cases of default, to recover recognisances under this Act. Clause 3 provides for the application of the principle Act, as amended by the Bill, to the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, because its non-application is causing inconvenience. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. NA ACCEPTANCE BILL.",217
1078,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"North Sydney-Honorar y Minister) [11.19 a.m.] I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This is a short measure, the whole object of which is set out in the preamble. CerGovernment's tain errors and misdescriptions have discovered in reference to the lands forth in clause 5 of an agreement entered into between the Government of New South Wales and the Commonwealth Jams, Government affecting certain lands at Jervis Bay. There was, I understand, a clerical error made with regard to a line starting from a certain point, and [153] described as running east, whereas it should have been described as running west. Then, it is desired to alter the method of survey for a portion of the land there. At the present time it is set out in the agreement that the land for survey shall follow the convolutions of the coast, and in order to afford greater facility for survey, it is desired to make it a straight line. No money or compensation is involved in the Bill, nor has it any reference to the building of Parliament House at Canberra. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed through ite remaining stages without amendment or debate. SUGAR CONTROL.",218
1079,Mr RODGERS,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Wannon-Minister for Trade and Customs [11.25 a.m.] -(B y leave)- I announced yesterday that there will be a reduction in the price of sugar as from the 1st November. By arrangement, there will be a corresponding reduction, as from the same date, on jams, canned fruits, and other manufactured products containing sugar. The real effect is that with the reduction of the price of sugar there will be, for the benefit of the whole community, a reduction in the price of jams, canned fruits, and so forth.",218
1080,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,What will be the price of sugar?,218
1081,Mr RODGERS,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,The retail price of sugar will be 5d. per lb. I am reminded by the Sugar Board that never before in the history of the trade has so substantial a reduction taken place at one time.,218
1082,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,Hav e satisfactory arrangements been made with the retail grocers ?,218
1083,Mr RODGERS,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"The following goods held in stock on 1st November, 1922, will receive rebate concession, but only when in the hands of manufacturers, and subject to the condition, pre-requisite to the approval of the rebate, that been binding guarantees are given that the set price of the goods will be reduced on the 1st November to the extent of the fall in the value of the sugar contents:all varieties; canned fruits; jelly crystals of all kinds; lemon peel; lemon and orange cordials of all kinds. Rebates on stocks of sugar will be given to wholesale distributors and manufacturers only. MT. PEOWSE - What will be the effect in relation to sngar which is consigned to a distance about the time and arrives after 1st November?",218
1084,Mr RODGERS,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"When sugar has to travel some distance, possibly in large quantities, and arrives a day or so before the 1st November, we have not asked that it shall be paid for at the higher rate.  the old price.",219
1085,Mr RODGERS,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,Yes . :,219
1086,Sir ROBERT BEST,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,But it is in Australia all the same.,219
1087,Mr RODGERS,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"It is very much the same thing whether it is at the old price or the new price, except that it may get out of the hands of the wholesalers into those of the retailers, and would not then get. the benefit of the concessions. We cannot be responsible for taking stock of all the retail shops in Australia. We have arranged, therefore, to take stock only in the .case of what is in the hands of the wholesale houses or of the manufacturers on the 31st October. It is not desired by the Government, and it would not be wise, to limit manufacturing or to cause manufacturers to dispense with employees, but to insure that the whole business shall go on as before. Pull provision has been made to meet all cases before and after that date.  planation cover the case of sugar conbeen 4£d. per lb. signed, say, to Albany ?",219
1088,Mr RODGERS,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Yes . The distribumember tion o i the sugar will be arranged by the Federated Association of »Wholesale Grocers in conjunction with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and we have earlier covered both the metropolitan and the country distribution. No rebates will be paid to the Colonial Sugar Refining pany on stocks held by it. The company has not asked for any. As to the point raised by the honourable member ner (Mr Maxwell), the adjustment of distribution margins is under consideraport tion, and every endeavour will be made to arrange a basis of fair remuneration for such traders. It has proved a most difficult matter to cut the price intn those nice points of adjustment eo that every branch of the industry may get a reasonable margin; but is unfair, when the sugar reaches the last stage of distribution, that the retail grocer should be called upon to bear an undue weight of cost; it would be unfair to ask the smaller distributors to conduct their end of the business at a loss. I am giving every possible consideration to this aspect of the business, in the hope' that a reasonable margin may be allowed them for their share. An export rebate of £20 a ton has been allowed on the basis of sugar at its present price. With a reduction in the wholesale and retail prices, the rebate also will be reduced; and it is proposed, from the 1st November next to 30th June, 1923-whe n the agreement will have expired-that an export rebate of £14 a ton shall be allowed on the sugar contents of the following products:- . Jams, canned fruits, jelly crystals, cordials, lemon peel, condensed milk, and confectionery. ",219
1089,Mr RODGERS,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Thos e which I have mentioned are the only manufactures concerned. Full provision will be made for the re-adjustment of matters, and there will be every allowance for every interest.",219
1090,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT," I am sure' that the public will appreciate the information that, not only will sugar be reduced by l d . per lb'., but also that there will be a reduction in the price of various commodities having sugar contents. I still think, howexever, that the retail price should have",219
1091,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,Does the honourable mean under the agreement?,219
1092,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Yes . It is a pity that the report of the Public Accounts Committee could not have been placed in our possession, so that we might have had the benefit of the information collected and the views therein expressed. ComI understand that half the members of the Committee considered that, under the agreement, sugar could, and should, have for Fawkbeen sold for 4$d. per lb.",219

DUTIES ON SULPHUE.",220
1098,Mr RODGERS,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Wannon-Minister for Trade and Customs) [11.34 a.m.] -(B y leave)-In the Customs Tariff of last year Parliament imposed duties on sulphur as follows:On and after 31st March, 1922(A) (1) Sulphur, n.e.i., per ton, British preferential, 15s.; intermediate, 20s.; general, 50s. (2) Sulphur, volcanic, for manufacturing purposes, for which pur? oses sulphuric acid produced rom pyrites or other sulphide ores is not suitable, as prescribed by departmental by-laws, British preferential, free; -- mediate, free; general, free. (B) Pyrites, per ton, British preferential, los.; intermediate, 20s.; general. 20a. (c) Pyrites the produce of Papua or of any island or Territory belonging to or administered under Mandate by the Commonwealth, Ss. per ton. I stress the point that the imposition of these duties was suspended until on and after 31st March of this year. tically no representations were made to me for the removal of the duties until after they had come into operation. Subsequently, however, there was a development which was in the nature of an agitation rather than direct representation. One statement, in particular; was made by the Phosphate Co-operative Company to the effect that an undertaking given by the Electrolytic Zinc Company had not been carried out. That undertaking had been a necessary condition controlling the date upon which the duties should come into operation. Therefore, I convened a conference of all sections interested. I appointed a committee of six, two of whom were direct representatives of the primary producers-on e being the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Gibson) and, the other,, the then President of the Chamber of Agriculture. Two other members of the committee, were, representative of the manufacturers, of superphosphates, and the whole of those four' were apposed to. the imposition of duties on sulphur: The remaining two were members of the mining section. I remitted to that committee the definite question whether the Electrolytic. Zinc Company had carried out its agreement with the superphosphate manufacturing company. Its unanimous finding was that it had done so. The terms of the agreement were that the Electrolytic Zinc Company should supply the phosphate manufacturers with sulphuric acidat a fixed price. The strong ground originally taken by the superphosphate people was that the Zinc Company should be required to supply them with sulphuric acid. Definite provision to that end was made, and the basis of objection by the phosphate manufacturers to the imposition of duties upon sulphur apparently disappeared. It was not until long afterwards-quite recently, in fact-that the agitation against the. duties arose again. I satisfied myself, by the unanimous report of the specially appointed committee-peculiarl y inter- representative as it was-that the agreement to provide sulphur had been faithfully fulfilled by the Electrolytic Zino Company. Yet I have been pursuedpolitically pursued-by persons who are agitating for the removal of duties upon sulphur for the alleged, reason that the Zinc Company's agreement has not been carried out. A deputation of primary Prac- producers waited upon me in my constituency, and I found at the head of it a ' representative of the Phosphate Company in Melbourne and a Melbourne lawyer. These gentlemen were foremost in stating the case for the deputation in my own home town, on behalf of my own farmer constituents. I promised that I would remit the whole subject-matter to the .Tariff Board for investigation and report, and that, thereafter, I would make an announcement. I have urgently brought the question under the attention of the Board. At this stage I wish to interpolate, that it has been recently proved that sulphuric acid from pyrites can be . captured and manufactured much more cheaply, and that there is, therefore, no necessity. for the Electrolytic Zinc Company to tion incur the expense of creating a special organization and plant to fulfil its undertaking to the , phosphate company. for Pyrites or sulphuri c acid can now be be cheaply obtained from Lyell and other companies. The report of the Tariff Board is teresting and informative. The subject is a very big one, for it involves the supply of superphosphates at fair and prices to Australian farmers.",220

All the sulphuric acid required in Victoria the manufacture of superphosphates can obtained from the large supplies of pyrites the Mount available in Tasmania. Mr Cuming says that for the last fifteen in - years he has used Australian isulphur .when it has been cheaper for him to do so, - alternating it with imported supreasonable plies. The report continues The Mt. Lyell Company is arranging to use pyrites immediately its supply of 'sulphur exhausted. The firm of Cuming, Smith, and Company were making arrangements to use from Tasmania. The firm has half of >ts burners in position, but action has been taken to buy further sulphur and the erection of the remaining half of the burners is not being proceeded with at present. Mr Cuming has, however, notified the Board that as soon as his present supply of sulphur is sufficiently he will operate one-half of his burners on Tasmanian pyrites, and should he ascertain they arc cheaper to use than sulphur obtained overseas plus the duty, he will ""continue to use pyrites. I The Mount Lyell Mining Company is willing to supply all manufacturers of superphosphates t in Victoria - with Tasmanian pyrites at the price as that charged to the Mount Lyell moment. Superphosphates Company. ff Board I have given an undertaking that a supply of sulphuric acid will be availfact able at the one price, plus transport charges, to all Australian manufacturers superphosphates, irrespective of whether they are proprietary on co-operative interests.",221

I wish I could say the same of the Victorian company. I have not a word to utter against the shareholders of the Victorian enterprise. I wish them success; but I have reason to think it would be well for them to put their concern on the same business-like""'basis as that on which the South Australian company is being operated. It would be well for them to do that, instead of promoting an agitation which attacks, first of all, the State Government in respect of a site for the works-and then, when that fails, to attack this Government in respect of the duty on sulphurj notwithstanding that it will be unable to use sulphur for the next two seasons. The manufacturers, those who know their business, are not raising this agitation.",221
1102,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"The manufacturers told the Minister clearly that they wanted freedom.. - Mr Rodgers- I have mentioned that; but there is no agitation on their part like that which has been offered by a section of the management of the Victorian companyThe price of sulphur, however, has been ther reduced in. the United States, and the Board is cabling to America to ascertain whether the price charged to Australia agrees 'with the price for domestic use in the United States. It will be noticed that an amount of 1,200 - tons of sulphuric acid has been deducted from - the Victorian total available. The sulphur representing this quantity is required by the Explosives Company, who can use only sulphur ih the manufacture of explosives, but all the other companies in Victoria can obtain pyrites from Tasmania if so desired. New South Wales. There are only two companies in New South Wales manufacturing superphosphates. The Australian Fertilizers Company at Port Kembla have been using New Guinea pyrites. Recently, they have ordered 1,200 tons of Mount Lyell pyrites from Tasmania, and should this trial prove successful, these pyrites will be used in future. The Sulphide Corporation at Cockle Creek is making arrangements to use only locallymade raw material,' mostly zinc concentrates, and will not import sulphur. This corporation is installing costly contact plant at Cockle Creek, which will manufacture high-grade pura sulphuric acid, which should meet practically atl the requirements of the industries in New Soutli Wales now using sulphur. South Australia. The largest works in this State are the Wallaroo and Mount Lyell Fertilizers Limited, at Wallaroo and Port Adelaide. This company manufactures almost half of the output of the State, and supplies its own^sulphuric acid from Australian raw material. The Electrolytic Zinc Company is installing at Port Pirie a .plant to make sulphuric acid, to cost about £80,000. The company 'has entered into an agreement with the Adelaide Chemical Works to supply the latter with all the sulphuric acid, they need at the same cost as the acid is supplied to the other company. A similar offer has been made to the Cresco Fertilizers Limited, and negotiations are proceeding, but the Cresco Company appears to be keeping the matter open in the hope that some relief maybe obtained in the remission of the duty when the foreign raw material will be continued. It is understood that half of the sulphuric acid required for South Australia is being supplied, and the whole of the requirements will be available in eleven months from 1st October, 1922. Western Australia. This is the only State where, under present conditions, the whole of the local supplies of raw material are not available. About 35 per cent, of their sulphur requirements is being obtained by one of the - manufacturers from pyrites mined in Western Australia, and experts believe that there are sufficient pyrites available in the State to meet all the requirements, but their use is precluded, owing to transport charges. The only solution advanced to the Board haa furbeen to grant the manufacturers of superphosphates in Western Australia the use of sulphur free of duty. The Board considers this would be an unconstitutional proceeding, and, in addition, it believes the most satisfactory method of'meeting the position would be taking action to assist the manufacturers in obtaining their pyrites within the State. This could be done by the State Government granting as. reasonable railway rates as possible on pyrites, and, if necessary, the Commonwealth Government could assist by granting a bounty to enable the manufacturers to meet the extra cost through railway and other charges. The manufacturers concerned have expressed their willingness toi take early action to obtain local pyrites if possible, provided some relief in transport charges is granted. While in Western Australia the Board will discuss this matter with the Premier, in the hope of arriving at a satisfactory solution. In Queensland and Tasmania - no superphosphates are manufactured. Queensland draws her supplies from New South Wales, and Tasmania from Victoria. From the foregoing explanation it will he seen that practically 71 per cent, of the total requirements of sulphur is available from locally-produced materials, and when the present plants .now being erected are completed, and the arrangements suggested by the Board in Western Australia are made, the whole of the sulphur requirements for the manufacture of superphosphates will be produced in Australia, and, further",222
1103,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,In the meantime?,222
1104,Mr RODGERS,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Takin g the position as a whole, I would remind the honourable member that there have been large imports of sulphur duty free. The Board desires to emphasize'that all supplies at present available are offered: at uniform prices to all companies. PRICE or IMPORTED SULPHUR AND LOCAL SULPHURIC Aero. It is understood by the Board that the price of sulphur beforo the war was £4 7si 6d. per ton. It is, however, now being emoted to Ausment tralian buyers at £4 4s. per ton from the United States, although otlier countries have been charging much more. Add £2 10s. duty to the price stated, and the total is £6 14s. per ton. The Mount Lyell Company has the Victorian companies pyrites at a price which, the oompany states, is equal to £5 17s. 6d. per Board ton of sulphur. The companies in New South Government Wales (with one exception) and South Ausproposed visitof to Western tralia (with one exception) are to be fully supplied by locally-produced sulphuric acid. Pyrites from Tasmania will not be supplied to those States, except to one company in New - South Wales, which will receive the same offer as the Victorian companies. The one exception in South Australia is now considering offer from the Electrolytic Zinc Company to supply sulphuric acid at the same price as supplied to other companies - in South tralia. The actual price arranged in South Australia for the sale of locally-produced phuric acid is the equivalent of £6 per ton of sulphur, and as the companies have already made the agreements, it is concluded these must have been on a satisfactory' basis, complaints of any kind have been made. price of £6 is an estimate, and the Zinc Company has undertaken, wherever possible, duce costs, in which event any saving will passed on to the manufacturer of - superphosThere phates. PRICE OF SUPERPHOSPHATES. Last year's price for superphosphates was.:Victoria, £0 3s - per ton. .South Australia, £5 10s. per ton. From the 1st July last the price has been reduced toVictoria, £5 10s. per ton. 'South Australia, £4 6s. per ton. The Victorian manufacturers have yet to fix itheir .price for the coming Beason, and Board believes that a furtherdecrease per ton will he considered. The prices then be-Victorian , £5 5s.; South Australian, £4 6s. per ton. It is very satisfactory to note' that, standing the imposition of the duty on sulphur,' ^substantial reductions have been made in price of superphosphates for the coming season, - thiu9 disproving the contention .of ithe opponents Of the duty that it would increase the price. The Board is waiting to hear the price iby the Victorian manufacturers for the .coming - season, and unless a further satisfactory crease is made on the £5 10s. per .ton, the Board will certainly recommend to the Government that .investigation be made under Board Act to asoertain whether the manufacturers are not charging an unnecessarily high - price for' their goods. Mr Rodgers. RECOMMENDATION. In regard to the supply of sulphur for the manufacture of superphosphates in Western Australia, the Board recommends that inquiries be made to ascertain whether the difficulty in the supply of pyrites from the local mines in Western Australia could not be overcome. The Board believes that the present supply can be further developed, provided the State and Federal Governments assist in the developof the supply of pyrites by granting assistance in freight. This will prove of greater national advantage in developing local industries, and avoid the spending of money on foreign sulphur, thus making. Australia indeoffered pendent of outside supplies. With the concurrence of the Minister the will negotiate on this matter with the Australia during its that State. (Sgd.) ' R. MCK. OAKLEY, Chairman, Tariff Board. WALTER LEITCH, Member, Tariff Board. BiERBBRT BROOKES, Member, Tariff Board. an Australia's chief source of sulphur supply that today is the United States of America. AusUnder the Tariff of the United States of America, our primary products-wool , sulmeat, wheat, butter, fruit-ar e almost banned from the American market. Yet the Australian primary producer desires as no that our market shall be free to American The sulphur. This country has the material, to reenterprise, capital, and genius to enable be us to provide our own sulphuric acid. is no reason why this .should not be a great national undertaking. Sulphuric acid is the base of all chemical action, and the day may come when it will be. to our advantage to have, as, a form of national insurance, large supplies of locally-made sulphuric acid and our own great chemists at work. . Those who have entered into this enterprise, as the the result of the duty we have imposed, have of 5s. shown that they are alive. They have would guaranteed supplies. The duty has been in operation .since March, and the manu- notwithfacturers have not taken advantage of it. They haye reduced the price. I welthe come every possible effort by co-operators. If they think they can produce a better article at cheaper TateSj and distribute fixed it to the farmers, they will have the support of this Government. I ought to say dethat during the war' period die superphosphate manufacturers of Australia the Tariff .served this nation well.",222
1105,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,TV * are not concerned with that,223
1106,Mr RODGERS,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"I am. We want to be fair all round. . Here is a letter addressed by the chairman of the superphosphate manufacturers to the Chairman of the Tariff Board on the l l ' t h instFollowing on OUT conversations at your request, I have now to advise you 'that - in August, 1,914, the ""Victorian manufacturers resolved as follows:""Manufacturers do not intend raising the price of superphosphate to the farmers. Unless the supplies of Taw material and credit are curtailed by the war, they will have .sufficient supplies for next season's requirements. .At the present time, the manufacturers .are not apprehensive df any shortage in their future supplies of raw material."" .Since then, various Prices Commissions .have controlled the price of superphosphate, concluding with the British Phosphate Commission. These authorities cordially confirm the fact that the manufacturers had more than ""played the game,"" not only during the war, but since. For a period we may have been considered to have been foolish, because Borne of the returns have been below fair interest-, when all other manufacturers were making war-time profits -1 confirm and emphasize the fact that the In addition to the above, voluntary reductions of several shillings per ton of superphosphate have been made in Victoria by giving back to the farmer the profit on the increased returns, owing to the larger quantity of superphosphate sold which other manufacturers ordinarily, and rightly, keep to themselves as a reward for their work and enterprise. Following all this, I have now to advise you that manufacturers have decided to discount their more expensive stocks of rock on hand, and reduce the price a still further 5s. per ton. The price in South Australia is absolutely no guide, as a trade fight is on there, which will,not be to the benefit of the farmers mately, unless it is soon settled, as it will eventually mean increased cost and loss of capital, to be made up in the future, and thus hamper extension of works to meet the growing demand. If manufacturers are going to risk their capital in plant extensions necessary for the superphosphate requirements of Australia, it will be a serious mistake for any one to belittle their actions or hamper their activities in any way, as we have all shown a full sense of our responsibility, and our association has meant greater efliciency and economy than could otherwise be obtained, and has led, among other things, to the lowest price of superphosphate possible during the last eight or ten years, probably the lowest prices in the world, PJS - Wit h regard to Western Australia, the price.there will also be subject to a reduction, but the higher rate is due entirely to a contract entered into, with the Christmas Island Phosphate Company with the knowledge and approval of the Phosphate Commission before the latter were in 'a position to supply .that State. When the 'contract is worked out this year, the British Phosphate Commission will supply all ' Western Australian requirements at the same price as the'eastern States. None of my. members are interested in works in .New - South Wales or Queensland. There 'are no works in Tasmania, that State being supplied by us at Victorian wholesale prices. A further 'letter with regard to the duty on sulphur has been received by the 'Chairman of the Tariff Board from the Mount Xyell Mining and Eailway Company Limited. It is dated 12th October, 1922, and .reads - as follows:I confirm my verbal advice that this company is spending - some thousands of pounder in Tasmania 'in new handling and crushing plant to ^enable pyrites to be shipped to (compete with .sulphur, duty .paid, and, in the meantime ample supplies are available, and no company has been refused supplies at prices considerably below the cost of importing sulphur. The - mines have mot been idle, and regular supplies have been coming into Victoria 'from Tasmania since the duty was .imposed, and further contracts are .about to be made. Mount ""Lyell Company took no 'steps whatever - to .secure .the duty, 'but when it was imposed we got in readiness to supply pyrites regardless of expense. The policy of the company is definitely to charge its own chemical works, which are run entirely separately in Victoria from the mines in Tasmania, the same cost as to outside manufacturers, and to allow the mines only a small margin of profit. It means much to Tasmania and Australia's miners, shipping, and workmen, and today we can offer more than we can sell. That is all I desire to say, but as there has been so much misunderstanding and misrepresentation upon this subject, I ulti- thought it only right that I should make a full statement, of the position before we went to the country.

To the Chairman of Committees I also offer thanks for the able manner in which he has played his part. This House is blessed in having officers of such high calibre to preside over its deliberations. It has been a matter of wonder to me how the Speaker and the Chairman of Committees have managed to keep going during our recent protracted sittings. In regard to the Hansard staff, I endorse every word uttered by the Minister for Defence (Mr Greene). I do not know how they have been able to stand the strain. As Leader of the Opposition, I have endeavoured during the last few, days, knowing the trying ordeal through which the reporters were passing, to curtail my remarks as far as possible, and thus shorten debate, for, after all, thero is no sense in making physical wrecks of men unnecessarily.

I congratulate the whole staff, from the omcers at the table to the attendants, for the satisfactory manner in which they have played their part and assisted honourable members in doing their legislative dut'ra. A man occupying the position of Leader of the Opposition often requires the assistance of the officers, and whenever I have had occasion to ask for their advice it has been given without hesitation and to my entire satisfaction.

Most of the members of - the Country party are new to parliamentary life, and we have appreciated very much indeed the uniform courtesy we have received from the leaders and members of all parties. We have formed many friendships, which I trust will - endure throughout our lives, and, whether or not vffi are again returned, we shall retain many pleasant remembrances of the Parliament which is nearing its close. I desire to join with the two Leaders who - have spoken in thanking you, Mr. Speaker, for presiding over our deliberations and giving us that help which those of us who are still in the recruit stage have specially needed. I should like to - express also our sense of the general ness of your conduct of debate. To the Chairman of Committees our gratitude is due for the same reason. His attitude has always been most judicial, and he has given us all a very fair run. In, regard to the oflicers of the House, I do not think we would be able to carry onwithout their able assistance and frequent advice. The clerks and messengers have ever been ready to help us along. As for the Hansard staff, I , too, confess that at times I am amazed to read the polished words that have apparently come from my lips. It is very gratifying to know that, not only can our thoughts be accurately expressed, but that they are often recorded in better language than we generally use. I desire to join with other Leaders of parties in offering felicitations to all the officers of the House, and especially to Mr Speaker and the Chairman of Committees.",227
1125,Mr MACKAY,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Lilley) [12.45] - I desire to draw the attention of the Minisbut whatter for Works and Railways (Mr. Richard Poster) to an article which has appeared in the Adelaide Register of 6th OctoberA RAILWAY COMPROMISE. The anti-South Australian influences in the Commonwealth Railway Department have evidently had their way with the Federal Public Works Committee, whose report is summarized in the Register today. South Australia is to ba put off, as Mr Hobler suggested in his evidence in Sydney, with a cheap light line to ""Central Australia, while the way is left open for the construction of the main railway by the eastern route through Queensland. A second article, headed "" Territory Railways,"" contained the following: A "" light low-level "" line to Central Australia was suggested by - Commonwealth railway officials as a sort of sop to South Australia, while the Commonwealth would then be free to carry the main railway down through Queensland. I have too good an opinion of the Minister to think that he will be in the slightest degree affected by these articles; but, in fairness to the officials who gave evidence before the Public Works Committee, I feel it my duty to take this the only opportunity to mention the matter. Mr Hobler, who is specially referred to in the articles, was subjected to a long cross-examination by the Committee, and gave valuable inforfair- mation; and such statements in the press are most unfair to him and other witnesses who gave evidence.",227
1126,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"WakefieldMinister for Works and Railways) [12.46] - I have had my attention called to these articles, and I came to the conclusion that whoever wrote them did not know the position as it is. I have no blame at all for any official or other person, and I am sorry ..that a South Australian newspaper should in any. way reflect on the Public Works Committee, - whose work I appreciate.",227
1127,Mr MACKAY,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"The Committee will take full responsibility for all it does. Mr KICHAR D FOSTEE - My attitude is not atall influenced by what appears, in the newspapers. - Mr BAYLEY (Oxley) [12.48] - It is not surprising that there has been a great "" slaughter - of the innocents,"" seeing that the session has been brought to so abrupt an end. A few weeks ago I wrote to a number of returned men pointing out that the difficulties under which they laboured in connection with their War Service Homes would be remedied by an amending Bill. Unfortunately, that Bill, though I believe it was before us on at least one occasion, has been dropped, because there has not been sufficient time in which to pass it . I take advantage of this opportunity to place on -.record my regret that this measure has not passed, so that these men might have enjoyed the many benefits which it would have conferred upon them.",228
1128,Mr MATHEWS,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Melbourne Ports) [12.50] - There seems a disposition to go into ancient history, and I feel tempted to give honourable members the benefit of my opinion on the effects of Federation from the start until the close of this Parliament; but, in the circumstances, and with the convenience of my fellow members in my mind, I refrain.",228
1129,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Franklin) [12.51],-Unde r the present War Service Homes Act serious hardships are suffered by some returned men who purchased homes. I have had occasion to bring one such case before 'the Minister, who informed me that all such cases would come within the amending Bill to be introduced this session. To my deep regret, we have not been able to pass a measure that would have proved of great benefit to the returned soldiers who suffer from the defects of the present Act. I suggest that the Minister (Mr Hector Lamond) might seriously consider whether in the absence of the .necessary legislation, he can. make the conditions better for these men. If they have to wait until a Bill is introduced and passed in the new Parliament, they will suffer greatly in the interval. I know that the Minister's sympathies are with the returned soldiers, and that he will do his best in the matter.",228
1130,Sir ROBERT BEST,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Kooyong) [12.551 - I also must express my regreli that it has not been found passible to pass the War Service Homes Bill. I headed a deputation of returned soldiers to urge some amendment of the law, particularly in reference to the construction of roads and sewerage. I did bhis at the instance of a considerable number of soldiers; and these men will be disappointed that the amending Bill hasfailed to pass. However, the Minister (Mr Hector Lamond) informs me that he was anxious to pass the measure, but he has been blocked. I now desire to correct an extraordinary statement that has been deliberately circulated and repeated from time to time in ' connection' with the recent sugar schedule presented to the House by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Rodgers). The statement is to the effect that some special favour has been extended to Victoria, because there happens to be a beet sugar factory in this State. I now wish to show whnt an ignorant statement it is.' It ie true there is a beet-sugar factory in Victoria which produces an average of 1,400 tons per annum, though on one occasion, I believe, the production has beei 1,900 tons. The Premier of Queenslaid has stated, and even repeated, that tke increased duty of £14 in the case of beet sugar is imposed for the purpose of extending some favour and support particularly to Victoria. Let me point out that this differentiation between the duty on cano and the duty on beet sugar is really in the interests of the sugar-cane industry. The duty was imposed at the higher rate on beet sugar-and it has been imposed for the last twenty years-becaus e the German Government subsidized their beet-sugar industry, and because that sugar came into unequal competition with our cane sugar. It was on that ground that, when Minister of Customs in Victoria, I , with other Ministers of Customs, imposed the duty in order to protect the cane-sugar industry. Whether or not there be a beet-sugar industry in Victoria, this differentiation is certainly .not intended to operate against the canesugar industry; as I say, on the contrary, it was imposed for the benefit of the sugar industry.  opportunity was presented to discuss the statements made by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Rodgers) this morning, and I must take this opportunity to call attention to a matter of the .greatest importance to a large and important section of the community. It is unjust that at least 90 per cent, of the cost of maintaining the sulphur industry in this country should be placed on the shoulders of the primary producers. If over an industry required to be protected by a bounty it is the sulphur industry. The present price of sulphur is too high in view of the fact that we have to produce in competition with other countries, ' and I feel confident that a bounty would encourage the industry to an extent that would prove of great benefit.to the whole of Australia.",228
1131,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Illawarra) [12.57] - No one regrets more than myself that the operations of a very ill-informed busybody in the lobbies created a position 1 that made it impossible for us to proceed with the amending War Service Homes Bill. . The loss of ihat measure will make it impossible for us to act as generously as we could have wished with certain sections of the soldiers; but so far as the present law can be stretched to accomplish what we desire, it shall be stretched.",229
1132,Mr SPEAKER,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL," I express my personal thanks for the appreciative remarks eonccruing myself in the discharge of my duties as the occupant of the presidential chair of this Chamber, by the Acting Leader of the House (Mr Greene), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), and the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page). I have endeavoured, within the limits of my ability, to discharge those duties fairly and impartially to all members of the House, irrespective of where they sit. Times of difficulty must be experienced, and, indeed, expected, and sometimes it may seem to an honourable member that he has not received that full measure of justice he considers himself entitled to. However, T^think that on reflection, if he should have any feeling of the kind, he will realise that there is no justification, so far as Che occupant of the Chair is concerned, for any charge of partiality. Of courso, in strenuous times it is often necessary to speak, perhaps, somewhat strongly about the proceedings in ths House, but I am very pleased to be able to express my belief that any disturbances that from time to time may have occurred to interfere with the even flow of debate have been due, not to any desire to flout the Chair, but rather to exuberance of spirits. »This I realized very often, while I felt it was my duty, as Presiding Officer, to apply a check. We have to remember that, after all, we are only schoolboys of a more mature age, and allowances have to be made for differences of temperament. I am pleased to hear the eulogistic remarks by different speakers concerning the officers of the House. Those remarks I cordially endorse. The Clerks, the Reporting .Staff, the attendants, and all concerned in the business of the House have carried out their duties in the most satisfactory manner. I was particularly pleased to hear the complimentary references made to the members of the Reporting Staff, and I should like to add my own appreciative words to . those that have .already fallen from the lips of the Leaders of various parties. I thank the officers, - attendants, and all those associated with the business of the House for the manner in which they have carried out their, duties. I wish also to add my own thanks to honourable members themselves for their assistance to me in the discharge of my duties as Speaker and for their sympathetic consideration 'in connection with my illness last year I am deeply grateful. This consideration was also extended to the Deputy Speaker, who had to assume my duties for the time, but as I . do not wish to encroach upon anything .which he might wish to say, I shall leave the' Deputy Speaker to express his own thanks and in his own way. I wish honourable members, all members of the staff, and those associated with the working of the House, a pleasant holiday, an enjoyable Christmas, and a Happy New Year. Many of us, no doubt, will be back here early in the new year. It would bo too much to expect that all honourable members will re-assemble here then. For every one of us the future is on the knees of the gods. Mr CHANTEB, (Riverina) [1.5] - I also appreciate very much the compliment that has been paid to'you, Mr Speaker, myself, and the officers of the House generally, by the Acting Leader of the House (Mr Greene), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), and the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page). You have said, sir, and it is quite true, that only those who may be called upon to occupy a position such as yours and mine can thoroughly understand the difficulitcs and the obligations resting upon the occupants of the Chair. As an old politician, I can well understand that in the heat of debate honourable members may lose control of themselves, and that sometimes it may appear that in .the intervention of the Chair there is personal feeling. I can assure honourable members, however, that never on my part, nor I am sure on yours, Mr Speaker, when called upon to exorcise the authority of the Chair to control debate, has there ever beeu the Slightest personal feeling towards any member'. of the House. I have endeavoured, to carry'out those duties lo the besl of mjr ability, and to extend to all : members'the greatest privileges it'is pos^ sible to allow under the rules of debate; We are bound by our Standing Orders. Unfortunately, they are - incomplete. They are. only temporary, although they have been in U3e for over twenty years, and I suggest that the new Parliament should call the Standing Orders Committee together at an early date to revise them and make, them so plain as to be thoroughly understood by every memher of the House. In many ways they are conflicting, and contain no provision for situations that occasionally arise. Standing Order No. i states that whore no provision is made, in the. Orders, the Presiding '.t)fiScet-.nrost.refer''to the practice'of the British House of - Commons, but frequently, when we consult May, Bourinot, aria other' authorities on parliamentary 1 practice, - we find conflicting, decisions, and SO' the-responsibility resits - upon the Presiding Officer to-interpret'the rules of debate as liberally as possible. That has been done' in this House. ' A revision of the Standing Orders would remove many of the 'difficulties that have occurred, and make the position .very much easier for the future Presiding Officers. 1 desire specially to thank my 'deputies. They have teen very good indeed to me. Throughout this strenuous session, whenover I have asked them to relieve me for various periods, they have always done so most willingly, and I appreciate their kindness very much. I also compliment the Parliament upon having such an able staff of oflicers. ""We could not find better or abler men than Mr Gale and his assistants. Were it not for their assistance I would frequently have found myself in very serious difficulties when presiding over the Committees of the House. They helped me very materially at all times, and kept pace with the rapid work of the House in a manner that compels ad-miration. I have also to express my apr preciation for the accuracy of the Bansard staff, and for the manner in which it is controlled. To the attendants of the House generally I return my thanks. I can only say, in conclusion, that, while thanking honorablo members generally for the compliment they have paid me, I have always endeavoured to do my dnty to the best of my ability. I want to assure honourable members, as we part, some of us, perhaps, for ever politically, thatj whatever they may have felt regarding myselfj I have nothing, but the very kindliest feeling for every memher of this House; irrespective' of where he sits. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned'at 1.8 p.m. (Saturday). :",229
