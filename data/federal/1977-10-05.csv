The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That many pensioners who are holders of the Pensioners Health Benefit Card, have suffered undue hardship as petition inmates of Private Nursing Homes, Government subsidy was insufficient to meet the charges as laid down. Many pensioners whose spouse was an inmate of the Private Nursing Homes suffered poverty in an endeavour to tain their partner while in the nursing home. Only in rare cases was the statutory minimum patient contribution as laid down adhered to. That the telephone was a matter of Ufe and death to many pensioners, but because of the cost of installation phone many are unable to afford the installation. That those pensioners who have only their pension and very little else to Uve on and are forced to pay high rents, in many cases Uving in extreme poverty. The foregoing facts impel your petitioners to ask the traUan Government as a matter of urgency to: 1. Make sure that subsidies paid to Private Nursing Homes are such that each pensioner holding a Pensioners Health Benefit Card will pay the Private Nursing Home no more than the statutory minimum patient contribution, which will allow six dollars per week to be retained by the pensioner patient for their personal use. 2. That a pensioner holding a Pensioner Health Benefit Card shall have a telephone very nominal charge. 3. That those pensioners who have only their pension and very little else to live on, them.

The petition of the undersigned students, parents, teachers and citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the decision of the Government to withdraw all forms of financial assistance to students of non-State tertiary institutions in the main, business coUeges, is in total conflict with stated Government education policy. The decision will result in a shortage of places for training secretarial and clerical students and an inordinate demand upon the State Government technical education systems. At a time of severe economic disruption, this action must lead to an unnecessary worsening of the current employment situation for school leavers. Your petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that the ComPETITIONS monwealth Government will act immediately to reverse it decision.

The multi-national giant, Population Services national which operates in Sydney, is now expanding its business to include Canberra. In 1976 alone, over 46,000 abortions were being paid for under the existing Medical Benefits Schedule which stiputhey lates the benefit payable for Medical Services under both Medibank and the Private Health Insurance Funds.

Replacement Constitution To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled; The humble petition of the undersigned showeth: that we believe that Australia's constitution is undemocratic and should be replaced by a democratic constitution. This new consitution should be drafted at a representative, directly elected people's convention following extensive public debate, and then put to a referendum of the people. The petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Parliament, as a matter of urgency, will help to promote such public debate and will arrange for the holding of such a people's vention and referendum.

The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully operation of any so-called showeth: That Cabinet's decision to reject the Council of the Australian National GaUery's proposal to purchase the Georges Braque painting, Grand Nu, ignores the knowledge and exand thenperience of the Council's members.

Petition received. citizens of Australia respectfully Income Tax To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the existence of a system of double taxation of personal incomes whereby both the Australian Government con- and State Governments had the power to vary personal income taxes would mean that taxpayers who worked in more than one State in any year would: (a) be faced with complicated variations in his or her personal income taxes between States; and (b) find that real after-tax wages for the same job would vary from State to State even when gross wages were advertised as being the same; and Estate Duty (c) require citizens to maintain records of income earned in each State. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that a system of double income tax on personal incomes be not introduced. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, estate passes to by Mr Morris.

It is urged that immediate steps be taken to activity. And your pedtioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Morris. Petition received. Mr Ignazio Salemi To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Respresentatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned Australian Council of Trade Unions Congress delegates assembled respectfully showeth: 1. That we believe the Government should grant resident status to Mr Ignazio Salemi, an Italian journalist engaged in important work within the Italian community. 2. We believe the Federal Ombudsman's report indicates that Mr Salemi has been denied natural justice, and subsequent comments by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs confirm that Mr Salemi's deportation order was based on pohucal motives. 3. We believe the Government should not impose its political bias on the implementation of its immigration policy. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Antony Whitlam. Petition received. AUSTRALIA'S RELATIONS WITH",15
4,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,ABSENCE OF MR SPEAKER," I give notice that at the next sitting I shall move: That Australia needs to retain and preserve amicable and friendly relations with Indonesia, without allowing that tionship to be poisoned by a campaign directed and supported from Australia in relation to East Timor. NA NA",17
5,Mr LES MCMAHON,GLASS AND FIBRE PACKAGING,"I ask the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs: Is it a fact that, without reference to interested local manufacturers of packaging materials, the Government has removed the duty differential between certain imported spirits in bulk and in bottles? Were the effects on unemployment in the glass and fibre packaging industries taken into account before making this decision? Does this decision mean that approximately 1,000 employees in New South Wales alone are faced with unemployment and that many firms in the glass and packaging industries wiil have surplus machinery which has been installed at great expense?",17
6,Mr FIFE,GLASS AND FIBRE PACKAGING,"It is not a fact that there was no consultation with the industries concerned in this matter. An inquiry was conducted and it was open to all interested parties to make representaend this tions. There was no consultation between me as Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs and the particular industries but there was an opportunity for all interested parties to make these representations. The representations made were very carefully considered by the Government before a decision was taken. The Government had to weigh up carefully as did the Commission the effects of its decision. The decision was very carefully considered. I also inform the House that since the decision was taken by the Government further representations have been received by, I think, the Minister for Primary Industry, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and myself. Those representations are being given careful consideration at present. NA",17
7,Mr SAINSBURY,DEBATE WITH MR HAYDEN,I direct a question to the Acting Treasurer. Ireferto the rather pathetic and feeble calls by the Labor spokesman on economic affairs for a public debate on the economy. I ask the Minister whether it is a fact that the Australian Broadcasting Commission invited both him and the honourable member for Oxley INDONESIA to debate the issue on the television program Notice of Motion This Day Tonight last evening?,17
8,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,DEBATE WITH MR HAYDEN,"Certainly the Australian Broadcasting Commission invited me to rela- appear on This Day Tonight last night. I understand that it also asked the honourable member for Oxley to appear. I am told that he declined. The honourable member for Oxley is a bit degraded and downgraded these days. He is now entering the House. For his information, I am referring to his inability to appear on television last night with me. When he sensed a week or INDUSTRIES two ago that there might be yet another leadership struggle in the Labor Party he busied himself trying to avail himself of the media. First of all, he wanted to debate the economy with the Prime Minister. Why should the Prime Minister lend his personal prestige and the prestige ofhis office to debating with the honourable member for Oxley? Then the honourable member for Oxley wanted a debate with the Treasurer. The Treasurer was overseas serving the national interests, not back in Australia doing all that he could to subvert the national reputation. When the ABC approached me, I must admit that my first reaction was why should I lend my personal prestige to appearing with the honourable member for Oxley? But out of sheer compassion I decided, as a fellow Queenslander, that I would give him an opportunity to apologise to the Australian community for the things he has been saying. I was particularly concerned about him yesterday after he had been demolished by the honourable member for Denison and his supporters. I do not know why the honourable member for Oxley was unable to appear on television. Perhaps he was busy in Sydney having a look at the garbage tins outside the Reserve Bank. NA NA",17
9,Mr MORRIS,GOVERNMENT,"I direct my question to the bans Prime Minister. Which management consultants which his Government utilises from time to time are known personally to him and what access they have to classified economic and fiscal information? Is it a fact that economic advice conveyed by these consultants has been at variance with that provided by Treasury, the Governable ment's official economic adviser? Is the acceptissued, ance of the consultants' advice the reason for the sudden shifts in the direction of the Governapplications ment's economic policies? Finally, is the econlittle omic policy being pursued by the Government this week based on Treasury advice or that of world wide consultants to multinationals, community. MCKinsey and Co. Incorporated?",18
10,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT,Order! The final part of that question relates to a matter of policy. I leave it to the Prime Minister to answer it so desires.,18
11,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,GOVERNMENT,"I am not aware week of economic advice being given to the Governpassion ment by any management consultant. The ties Government's advice comes from a variety of sources. Obviously it comes from the GovernFinancial ment's expert departments which never fail give honest and firm advice as to the best course that the Government and the country ought to societies. take at a particular time. Advice also comes the Reserve Bank of Australia, as the honourable gendeman would know, and Ministers have their own views of what should be done. One of the things that the honourable gentleciety man seems to fail to understand is that no matter what advice comes to the Government, the Government is plainly responsible for what it does. It accepts that responsibility. The Governsocieties ment must use its judgment. One of the differences between this Government and its preGovernment decessor is that the former Prime Minister was constantly seeking scapegoats and excuses the failures and the abysmal record of that Government. Inflation went up to 19 per cent in one particular half-year, and that Government's actions were adding to unemployment to the extent that the number of unemployed went up 200,000 in one year. This Government is responsible for what it does. It accepts that responsibility, quite unlike its predecessor. My predecessor as Prime Minister sacked Treasurer after Treasurer after Treasurer and tried all the time to say that he was innocent and did not know what was happening. NA",18
12,Mr JULL,CITIZEN BAND RADIO LICENCES,I ask the Minister for Post and Telecommunications whether it is a fact that the imposed by unions on the issue of CB radio licences have been lifted. Can the Minister now indicate what delay applicants for CB licences do will have to face before hcences are issued?,18
13,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,CITIZEN BAND RADIO LICENCES,"I am pleased to say that the bans have been lifted after a considerdelay. About 25,000 licences have been and I am informed that the Department hopes to catch up with the rest of the backlog of in about four weeks. It could be a longer in a few areas. I have asked that the issuing of licences be expedited as much as posthe sible so as to reduce any inconvenience to the NA Mr E. G. Whitlam- I crave the prestige of an answer to a question addressed to the Acting if he Treasurer. Since another building society in Queensland had to suspend some operations last I ask him whether he will at last show comto investors in permanent building socieby taking action available to the Federal Government, namely, to proclaim Part IV of the Corporations Act, so that nationwide to regulations can be made specifying the asset ratios, lending policies and interest rates of those from Mr ERIC ROBINSON-The Government's decision has been not to proclaim that part of the Act. The Leader of the Opposition refers to the collapse of a substantial permanent building soin Queensland. This matter is of concern, particularly in Queensland and to that financial sector throughout the Australian community. It has to be understood that traditionally building have come under State legislation. After difficulty some months ago, the Queensland brought in additional legislation so that it could monitor problems that arose. It was for out of the monitoring by the Queensland Government of the Queensland Permanent Building Society that the decision was taken a few days ago that a liquidator be appointed. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that, of course, I am in touch with the Queensland Premier and the Deputy Premier and Treasurer concerning this matter. Discussions and negotiations are now going on between the Government, the liquidator, other permanent building societies and the trading banks, and some discussion is also taking place with the Reserve Bank of Australia, for the purpose of seeing that a nervousness and concern does not spread throughout the Australian community. I take this opportunity to say that there is no need for Australians to be concerned. This is a matter peculiar to this one society which has had a history of difficulty in investment and some managerial problems for some time. I hope that, in a spirit of co-operation with the Queensland Government, we will see a solution to this problem and a sense of security given not only to investors in that society but also to those who have invested in permanent building societies generaUy. As to the honourable gentleman's suggestion that the Government should consider proclaiming that part of the Act, I just take note ofit. X-RAY SCANNERS",18
14,Mr DOBIE,PERMANENT BUILDING SOCIETIES,"Has the attention of the Minister for Health been drawn to the high cost of mstalling and operating a new method of total body X-raying, technically known as computerised axial tomography scanning? Is the Minister aware that there is an area of possible abuse of such CAT scanners in Australia in that excessive claims may be made under Government approved medical insurance schemes? Is the Minister in a position to advise the House whether he has taken any action to investigate any such abuse that could arise following the recent instaUation of these advanced and emcient yet expensive items of medical equipment?",19
15,Mr HUNT,PERMANENT BUILDING SOCIETIES,"I am well aware of the development and introduction of computerised axial tomography scanning which is perhaps the most modern diagnostic equipment yet to be instaUed in Australia. In the United States of America there has been a tremendous proliferation of these pieces of equipment, which is of course adding enormously to the health bill of the United States. I think that there are something like 22 CAT scanners either installed or on order in Australia. To try to avoid any abuse or over use of this type of diagnostic service the Commonwealth Government has set up a committee under Dr Sidney Sax to inquire into ways and means of ensuring that unnecessary proliferation does not occur, at great cost, in this country. We have received the co-operation of the Australian Medical Association, the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, the Royal Ausralasian CoUege of Surgeons and the Society for Medical and Biological Engineering who wiU also be playing a part in the inquiry. Also, aU State governments have indicated their concern at the possible proUferation of these machines, and they are co-operating with the inquiry. I hope that in the not too distant future I wiU be able to report to the Parliament on what actions the committee recommends to the Government, to prevent a situation similar to that which has worred us very greatly in the pathology area. I thank the honourable member for his question. NA",19
16,Mr UREN,RANGER URANIUM MINE,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. I refer him to a telegram that he has received from the Northern Lands Council protesting at works projected at the Ranger uranium mine site in the immediate future. I ask: Can the Prime Minister assure the House that no works will proceed at Ranger or at any other mine site until the national park has been proclaimed, aU Aboriginal land rights questions have been settled and the recommendations of the second Ranger report have been fully implemented?",19
17,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,RANGER URANIUM MINE,The honourable gentleman will know that the Government has made its decisions concerning the mining and development of uranium- I should say 'the continued mining and export of uranium' because some people fail to appreciate that this has been going on for about IS or 20 years so far as Australia is concerned. The Government has followed very closely the decisions of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry and its recommendations. The Government's decisions have been made known and those decisions will be adhered to. AIR SERVICES: ROCKHAMPTONBARCALDINE-LONGREACH,19
18,Mr KATTER,RANGER URANIUM MINE,"Will the Minister for Transport advise the House whether any action has been taken in relation to the restoration of the air services between Rockhampton, Barcaldine and Longreach, in Queensland?",19
19,Mr NIXON,RANGER URANIUM MINE,"On e of the problems we found when coming to office resulted from die decision of the previous Government to cut out support for small airUnes and commuter services servicing isolated areas. One of the great tragedies of the Whitlam Government was its decision to stop that support and to phase out subsidies for Connair Pty Ltd and Bush Pilots Airways Ltd services on a great number of runs. We said from the start that we were concerned to see that outback areas and isolated people were properly serviced in this manner. The House will be aware of the forceful advocacy of the honourable member for Kennedy in this regard. I know that when the Prime Minister was up there late last week he received deputations on the matter and listened with a great deal of concern and interest to the people who were putting their case to him. We have decided to reinstate the subsidy of $30,000 to Bush Pilots so that that airline maintain the service. The honourable member for Port Adelaide is attempting to interject. know that he has no sympathy on a subject like this. He has no concern at all for isolated people. The actions of the previous Labor Government proved that. The honourable member has as much interest in the outback of Queensland as has the man in the moon. We have decided reinstate the subsidy to Bush Pilots so that the service from Rockhampton through Alphax to Barcaldine and on to Longreach can be continued. NA NA",19
20,Mr STEWART,COMMITTEES,"I ask the Minister for Emtial ployment and Industrial Relations: Is it a that all funds granted to emergency unemployment committees for Community Youth Support Scheme programs have been frozen? If so, why was this decision taken? Is the Minister aware the excellent work being done by these mittees, particularly the South West Sydney Emergency Unemployment Committee, in Commonwealth's assisting young people of varying ethnic groups to find employment? Will the Minister take imoperating mediate action to restore funds to these schemes?",20
21,Mr STREET,COMMITTEES,"No, it is not true that all funds to Community Youth Support Scheme projects have been frozen, although I understand that telegrams relating to, from memory,fiveprojects and indicating that funds would be frozen or sushave pended were sent out. I am well aware of the veryfinejob that is being done under many of these schemes, which are supported by many honourable members of this House. Some 212 constrain schemes have been approved throughout States Australia. At any onetimeabout 8,000 young people are participating in them and in total some 20,000 young people have participated. I was not happy about the way in which the instructions relating to the suspension or termination of funds for a few projects were issued. I have instructed that new arrangements should be followed whereby the State committee concerned, which has the responsibility to administer and approve such projects, will notify the federal member in whose electorate the project is involved. The committee will infonn the appropriate federal member of any information it might have which would lead to the suspension or termination of funds, permitting him the opportunity to make his views known to the committee and to carry out whatever investigations he wishes to make. Finally, before any decision to can terminate funds for any project is made, such proposal will need to come back to me for my I personal assessment and approval. NA",20
22,Mr SIMON,COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAM,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health. With regard to the community health program, is the Minister able to to advise whether he recently met State Health Ministers? If so, does he anticipate that State governments will meet funding projections established by the Commonwealth Government? Does he agree that a legislative base for the community health program is necessary to ensure continuity of the Commonwealth Government's commitment and to encourage State governments to treat the program as one which is essento contain the nation's health costs because fact of the program's preventative health bias?",20
23,Mr HUNT,COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAM,"Yes. I met State Ministers on 23 September and there were two principal items on of the agenda. Thefirstwas the new funding discicomplines to be adopted by the joint Commonwealth-State officials committees in meeting the obligations under the arrangement for equal sharing of the net approved costs of our hospitals. The second item on the agenda was the long-term funding arrangements for the school dental program and the community health program. The States have accepted in principle the new funding arrangements to restrain the escalation of hospital operating costs throughout Australia, which been escalating at the rate of about 30 per cent per annum. This year we have allowed for an increase of 16 per cent and we hope that the State and Commonwealth officials will be able to hospital costs within those bounds. The also have sought a commitment from the Commonwealth to ensure that the present funding levels of the school dental program and the community health program are maintained, the commitment to be embodied in two separate Acts to give the States a guarantee that Comthis monwealth funding will continue. The Govern the ment places great importance on the school tal program and the community health program as means of mamtaining an active preventative health policy with the co-operation of the States. So we certainly are considering the introducing legislation as a means of ensuring that the States have this guarantee and as a means of gaining the full co-operation of governments in both programs which we believe are essential to long-term long term preventative health measures in Australia. NA",20
24,Mr LES JOHNSON,UNEMPLOYMENT STATISTICS,"I ask the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations: Is it intended to defer publication of Commonwealth question? Employment Service unemploymentfigureswith a view to substituting a new system which would show unemployment running at 60,000 persons below the CESfigures?Is the new system likely to cost an additional $2m a year? What is the tification for this expensive proposal to defer publication of unemploymentfiguresprior to premature election?",21
25,Mr STREET,UNEMPLOYMENT STATISTICS,"The honourable member will be aware that during the time ofhis Government an inquiry into the reliability of Commonwealth whether Employment Servicefiguresas state of unemployment showed that serious deficiencies and that thefiguresof the Bureau of Statistics were a much more accurate measure of the state of the labour market. This was referred to in very strong terms by Mr tle Norgard in his review of the CES. He said that returnsthe replacement of CESfiguresbyfiguresderived from a monthly survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics should have the highest view of the facts which came to light as a result of the inquiry made while the honourable gentleman's parry was in power and as a result of the recommendations made by Mr Norgard, the Government is considering how best to inform the public of the correct state of the labour market.

Is a meeting with the State Premiers contemplated in the near future in order cuss the possibility of reducing the interest on Commonwealth loans? In connection with subject, has the Acting Treasurer considered matters brought forward in the notice of denmotion which was given by me on 9 March last and which sets out a mechanism for raising money and, at the sametime,reducing interest rates?

30,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,UNEMPLOYMENT STATISTICS,"Of course, meetings with Premiers are convened from time to time by mutual agreement between the Prime Minister, the Premiers and the Treasurers. I have not been jusinvolved in any of those meetings. Like everybody else I am informed as to what is discussed. a Any economic matter concerning interest rates, amongst other things, would quite possibly be discussed at such a meeting. However, the honourable member for Mackellar asked me I had had an opportunity to study die a measure of the which he motion notice of which he gave on 9 March in they had Treasurer and to me.some indicated economic advice to the I regret to say that because of some other matters of concern which have had to have my attention, I have not been able to setdown and study that motion in depth.

In the next couple of days. NA NA",21
31,Mr CHARLES JONES,DISTRIBUTION USING SATELLITE,"I direct a question to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. I draw his attention to the announcement that he made on 22 September that the Government had a task force to carry out a detailed invesRATE tigation into a report which he had recently received from the Australian Consolidated Press entitled: 'Opportunity for Television Program Distribution in Australia using Satellites'. I ask the Minister whether he is aware of a feasistudy into the development of a domestic satellite system which was commissioned by a to disformer Postmaster-General and which was rate received by Senator Bishop when he was Postmaster-General in the former Government? Will the Minister table both these reports so that honourable members will be aware of what they contain? If not, why not? Having in mind that the task force will be considering a report by the Australian Consolidated Press Ltd, will the Minister give honourable members an assurance that all television and broadcasting operators will likewise be given an opportunity of putting a point of view to the task force? Also, will the tralian Broadcasting Commission be given an opportunity to comment?",21
32,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,DISTRIBUTION USING SATELLITE,"I announced on 22 September that the Government would set up such a task force. I hope to have an opportunity in the next day or so of discussing with the Prime Minister the names of some nominees for the position of chairman of that task force, in the hope that we can get it moving in the next week or two. There is substantial benefit to be gained we have more knowledge of the possibility of using domestic satellites within Australia. Of course, it would be a substantial decision for any government to make. Given the difficulties of communication within Australia it will not be possible to bring all the telephone services and all the television viewing facilities to all Australians, irrespective of where they may live, by the traditional means. We just will not have the funds or the capacity to do that. Therefore we are taking the opportunity to look at such a concept. I think the honourable member for Newcastle said when he was speaking to the statement. I made that there could well be some merit in this proposal. The honourable member mentioned a report by Telecom Australia. I have discussed that with Telecom. Of course, one of the officers from the Telecommunications Commission will, I hope, be part of this task force. Such an invitation to join certainly has been extended to Telecom. A similar invitation will be extended to the Overseas Telecommunications Commission. I want a substantial task force to bring to us all the expertise that is available. I shall give consideration to the honourable member's request to have that report and the other report tabled. Mr Charles Jones-What about all the other broadcasting and television operators?",22
33,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,DISTRIBUTION USING SATELLITE,"Of course, representatives of the industry will be asked for thenopinion. We want to get an overall opinion from all of those people who are interested in this ter. The purpose of the exercise is to have available the greatest possible knowledge, competence and expertise both in this country and outside it. Indeed, the statement referred to talking to people in Papua New Guinea and in New Zealand, because there could well be an involvement in those countries as well. NA NA",22
34,Mr FALCONER,VICTORIA,Can the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations advise the House of the current state of the disputes involvAusing bans on building projects in Victoria imposed by the Australian Builders Labourers Federation?,22
35,Mr STREET,VICTORIA,"The House will be aware that bans imposed by the Australian Builders Labourers Federation on major building projects in Victoria are costing thousands of jobs at a time when the unemployment rate is relatively high, and when jobs could otherwise be if immediately available on projects involving some $500m worth of investment. Some little time ago, as a result of an application made by the Master Builders Association, Mr Justice Alley of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission ordered under section 45 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act a secret ballot to be held by the builders labourers involved in work on the State Savings Bank. The result of that ballot was that 44 members voted for a return to work and 16 voted against a return to work. The Master Builders Association then sent out notices to the men concerned asking them to report for work this week. I am informed that 40 men duly turned up at the site but were met by an organiser from the Builders Labourers Federation who informed them that no work was to take place. I am informed further that the men who had turned up thereupon held another ballot amongst themselves, the result of that ballot being that they would resume work, as I understand it, tomorrow. Nothing could give a clearer indication of the very deep feeling among the rank and file members of Builders Labourers Federation against the totally irresponsible and destructive actions of their union leaders. They have expressed thenopinion when given an opportunity to do so and they have reiterated that opinion despite the presence of a Builders Labourers Federation organiser who attempted to intimidate them out of voting to return to work. That is indicative of the mat- fact that, when given the opportunity to do so, rank and file union members often indicate that they do not go along with the disruptive tactics of those who allege that they are representing their interests. I believe that the use of the ballot legislation in this instance, and in other instances in recent times, is an indication that the people cerned appreciate the opportunity of being alconsiderable lowed to voice their opinion. If the BLF persists in its attempts to dissuade people from working on this project, as honourreturn ble members know there is currently a bans clause in the award and the Master Builders Association has made application for a certificate under it which could lead to the invocation penal provisions of the Act. I have no doubt the actions of the Builders Labourers Federation officials will be taken into account by the Deputy President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission when he hears this case.

36,Mr MARTIN,UNEMPLOYMENT,"The Prime Minister will recall that in his 1976-77 Budget Speech the Treasurer stated that it would be rash to predict an early reduction in unemployment. The Treasurer, in his recent Budget Speech, omitted to foreshadow any immediate reduction in the rising rate of unemployment. My question to the Prime Minister is this: When can we expect the fulfilment ofhis pledge of 27 November 1975 that only under a Liberal-Country Party government would there be jobs for all? Will the Government change policy of deliberately created unemployment and cease using this tragic method of economic control?",23
37,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,UNEMPLOYMENT,"The honourable and gentleman rather spoilt his question by his comthe ments at the end of it. He would know that during the period of inflation caused by the gance of the previous Administration in one year alone government expenditure went up by 46 cent, a year to which the Leader of the Opposure sition said he would return if he had any chance to do so. Unemployment increased in that year by 200,000 as a very direct consequence of policies that the honourable gentleman then ported. Also, the wages pohcies that were sued during those years led to very great disparithe ties and made it very difficult for manufacturing way. industry in Australia. In addition, the then Administration reduced tariffs by 25 per cent, encouraging more imports, adding very greatly to unemployment and leading to the export of tralian jobs overseas. That demonstrates the utter gall that the honourable gentleman has coming into this place and suggesting that this Government is not concerned about unemploywhich ment, when he belonged to and supported an administration that created the unemployment that Australia has. Quite plainly it takes sometime,as we said fore the election, for imbalances in an economy conto work themselves out. We said it would take a time. So it will. The kind of wages policies that the honourable gentleman supports will delay the period in which there can be a to proper levels of employment. Surveys during the winter months have shown that as a result of wage decisions taken in the early autumn a number offirmscontained additional of costs by shedding labour. I believe it is time that honourable gentlemen opposite came to their senses in these matters and realised, as a former distinguished Treasurer said before he left office, that unreasonable wage rises only take jobs away from other people, or words to that effect. That statement remains true. I believe that under the policies of this Government conditions are being established in which inflation has come down very markedly indeed. That is thefirstprecondition for getting back to a situation in which there will be jobs for those who want to work. NA",23
38,Mr LLOYD,ESTATE DUTY,"The Prime Minister will be aware that several State governments either have abolished State probate duty or are about to do so. Will this mean that the Commonwealth its Government will collect more Federal estate duty and, therefore, to a degree nullify the actions of those State governments? Does the Prime Minister agree that this is a most unjust tax that Federal estate duty should also be abolished or at least updated to compensate for inflation of the past few years? extrava Mr MALCOLM FRASER- I think one of the reasons that State governments have been able per to abolish what many people, including I am many people in this House, regard as a pernicious and evil tax is the policies of this Government which has made much greater sums available to State governments. As I have said on supmore than one occasion, I look forward to the purday when the Commonwealth is as wealthy as State governments which have acted in that COMMONWEALTH CITIZENS: NA Aus Mr E. G. Whitlam- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Adin ministrative Services. He will know that after newspaper articles and parliamentary questions snowed that electoral officers had given incorrect advice to ctizens of Commonwealth countries, particularly Cyprus and Malta, on their voting rights in Australia, the Chief Elecbetoral Officer sent a circular to all divisional returning officers saying that Commonwealth nationals who have resided in Australia for six months are eligible to be enrolled as voters. Will the Government make it known that Common Mr wealth nationals are not only eligible to be rolled as voters but are also required to be rolled and that, under Australia's system of pulsory enrolment and voting, they are subject the same penalties as Australian citizens for ing to enrol and vote? Will the Chief Australian Electoral Officer take further steps by notices and advertisements to inform Commonwealth nationals of their rights and duties in Australia?",23
39,Mr STREET,COMPULSORY VOTING,"The Leader of the Opposition will appreciate that, in view of the ramifications and the serious nature of the questions he has raised, I shall need to take them up with my colleague the Minister for Administrative Sergrape vices.

Can he inform the House as to the details of Commonwealth funding arrangements for Taswhich mania under this program?,24
41,Mr HUNT,TASMANIAN FUNDING,"I do not know whether 'bunkum' is a parliamentary word but that is how I would describe that report. The Commonwealth Government has increased its contribution to the Community Health Program by 14.8 per cent. The allocation to Tasmania this year is higher than it was last year. In fact, it is $2.8m. receiving its share under the Community Health Program of the $lm additional money that was set aside for the funding of women's refuges that State. Discussions are going on with the manian authorities and other State authorities that they might establish their own priorities after discussion with organisations within their States. I do not think that Tasmania has much grizzle about. It received by far the biggest of the hospitals development program. It is reimprovement ceiving also a very fair share of funds under Community Health Program.

42,Mr SINCLAIR,DISTRICT,"This morning my officers at my request contacted the various State departmental officers in the areas affected. It seems that the damage is mainly confined to the Red Cliffs area which is about IS kilometres south of Mildura. It is true that it has extended to a degree into other areas also. In that region there has been a serious effect on the dried fruit and wine industries at one of the most critical times an m the growing season. The Australian Dried Fruits Association has estimated that there has been a loss of 15,000 tonnes of dried fruit grapes and 40,000 to 60,000 tonnes of wine grapes. I am told that about 400 properties are particularly badly affected. Most of these have experienced a total loss of product for the coming season. The industries or individuals affected should lodge claims in the first instance by an approach their own State Government. The Federal Government in the normal course provides assistance for natural disasters, and of course it the would consider sympathetically any approach might be made by a relevant State government in respect of this disaster.

43,Mr WILSON,STRIKES,"Can the Prime Minister inform the House of the extent of disruption and damage to economic revival being caused to the country by irresponsible strike action? It will be Mr MALCOLM FRASER-In thefirstsix months of this year the total number of days lost through industrial disputes was very much less in than in 1974 when, for example, instead of Tas700,000 or 800,000 days being lost, something so over four million man days were lost as a direct consequence of the activities of the previous Administration. Those statistics would seem to to indicate that under the policies of this Governshare ment there has been a very considerable in the total situation. A point that the needs to be emphasised is that some extreme elements in the union movement are becoming more skilful in exerting a thoroughly disruptive effect on large sections of the Australian community by pulling a relatively few people out on strike. In addition, a number of industries which are prone to industrial disputes are engaged in the export areas, areas which are of great imporwhole. tance to general development and economic recovery in Australia.

That could well suspension of work for 1,500 people or more in the coalfieldsof Queensland. If the same policy were to spread to New South Wales it would lead to very significant problems in the coal export industry there. There is also the dispute conducted by certain members of the Australian Workers Union in Bass Strait I think that at this stage most able members are unaware of the fact that that dispute could lead to the cessation of oil duction from Bass Strait by tomorrow or the day after. This is a serious dispute and it has going on for many, many weeks.

47,Mr HUNT,MEDICAL BENEFIT PURPOSES,"On 13 April 1977, I announced the appointment of Mr Justice J. T. Ludeke, Deputy President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, to conduct an inquiry to determine fees for medical benefit purposes to honourapply from 1 January 1978 to 31 December 1978. As background to the mquiry, honourable promembers will recall that a Medical Fees Tribunal had been convened in 1973, also under the been chairmanship of Mr Justice Ludeke, to determine fees forfixingmedical benefits. The estabof the Tribunal followed a protracted preperiod of disagreement with the medical proIn fession over the level and nature of the most quite common fees then in existence. As a result of the Tribunal's determinations, of amendments to the Medical Benefits schedule to were made in November 1973 and April 1974. During the term of the Whitlam Government, there were three private inquiries-on e in 1974 and two in 1975-to update those fee levels genon the basis of increases in the costs of conducting medical practice and increases in the net in income component. These inquiries resulted in total increases of 5 8.9 per cent, except pathology, over a two-and-a-half year period; pathology increased by 38.6 per cent over the same period. At this point, I seek leave to have a table of movements in medical benefits schedule fees incorporated in Hansard.",25

49,Mr HUNT,MEDICAL BENEFIT PURPOSES,"I thank the House. There was inquiry held in 1976. Instead, the Government negotiated an overall increase with the Australian Medical Association. The increase of 7.5 per cent applied from 1 January 1977. In announcing the Government's acceptance of this proposal on 8 September last year, I indicated that the overall increase was restrained and represented real progress towards the Government's objective m containing health care costs in Australia. I also indicated last year that as a prelude to a detailed inquiry in 1977 to determine medical benefits fees from 1 January 1978, Index of change in schedule fees (excludes pathology) there would be continuing discussions with the Percent AMA on ways of modifying and improving the increase over mechanism by which fees for medical benefit previous period purposes were periodically adjusted.

The deter183.3 7.3 mination provides for increases in medical fees Schedule for medical benefit purposes which are res1975 trained and consistent with current Government economic policy. The overall increase is 7.3 per (4) excent, excluding pathology, which is less than the underlying rate of inflation. This represents a further major step in containing increases in Percent health care costs in Australia. The Inquiry deincrease over ferred an increase in pathology fees. If there is no Index previous period increase in pathology fees in 1978, the overall 100.0 increase would be about 6.7 per cent. 115.0 15.6 138.6 -20.5 In contrast with previous inquiries, there were a number of participants in the proceedings of the Inquiry in addition to the Australian Medical 1.1.76. Association and my Department. Other particia reducpants were Senator Shirley Walters, the New Pathology South Wales Health Commission, the Australian Association of Neurologists and the Society of Pathologists in Private Practice. The determinafoltion provides that there should be increases into the Minister for Health, apply in fees for medical benefit purposes from 1 January 1978 to provide for increases in the gross income as derived by medical practitioners from medical benefits schedule services. The increase in the Private gross schedule fee income determined by the Inquiry are: 8.2 per cent for general practitioners 1975 and consultant physicians; and 6.1 per cent for Medical all other specialties, except pathology, where interim there was no increase. These increases were Enquiry determined to cover increases in practice costs and to allow for an increase in net income. I need and hardly emphasise at this point that doctors' gross on incomes have to cover practice costs before a net income is produced. no The component increases of the 8.2 per cent increase determined by the Inquiry in the gross schedule fee income of general practitioners and consultant physicians comprise a 12 per cent increase in practice costs and a S.2 per cent increase in net income. The increase of 5.2 per cent in net income was determined on the basis that it does not exceed increases over the last year received by persons in similar income brackets as a result of wage indexation. A lower increase in gross schedule fee income for other specialties, except pathology, was determined by the Inquiry. An analysis of this increase that after allowing for increases in practice costs, the increase allowed in respect of net income was 2.2 per cent. The overall effect of the determinathe tion for all doctors, except pathologists, is to allow increases in gross schedule fee income of 7.3 per cent. After allowing for practice cost increases of 12 per cent, the increase in net income is 3.8 per cent for the whole year. This compares with an estimated increase of about to 10 per cent in the average weekly earnings the community, which can largely be attributed to wage indexation increases over the year. Pathology fees were not increased by the Inquiry. The part of the Schedule relating to pathology fees was revised on 1 October 1976, and then completely revised again from 1 August 1977 following the report of the Pathology Services Working Party in March 1977. Honourable members will recall that these changes were introduced to curb over-utilisation and abuse pathology services. Due to lack of information this stage on the results of the 1 August changes,medical the Inquiry deferred any increase to pathology fees. However, the Inquiry recommended that, on a request from the AMA to the Minister for Health, a further inquiry should be convened determine increases, if any, to such fees. This an area of particular interest to the Government and we will be watching all developments closely. The Inquiry determined that the tribution increases in schedule fees be made differentially, that is, that the increases in schedule fees for items vary but will provide, overall, the deteradvised mined increase in gross schedule fee income by specialty. This method, which is a departure from previous methods of adjusting schedule fees, was developed by my Department in sultation with the AMA, on the basis that it proimplement vides a more equitable approach in apportioning increases. As an example of the increase in schedule from 1 January 1978, a standard general pracoperation titioner surgery consultation, in hours, would rise from $8.20 to $8.90 in New South Wales-an ment's increase of 70c. Medical benefits would rise $7.00 to $7.60-an increase of 60c. Other important features of the determination are that: The Inquiry declined the recommendation of the AMA and of other participants in the proceedings of the Inquiry to take any 'across the board' steps towards uniform national fees in the determination. The Inquiry found that there was little evidence to support the move but there was information sufficient to raise questions about the grounds on which claims indicates for uniform fees are based. Three new items should be introduced into medical benefits schedule, and there will be amendments to two items, for services covering consultations at nursing homes and hospitals. The fees in Tasmania for consultations by consultant physicians in psychiatry will be 9 raised to the level of the fees in Victoria, in Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. A similar adjustment should be made to items covering interview by a consultant physician in psychiatry of a person other than the patient. Medical benefits should be payable for a consultation and for a radiotherapy treatment when rendered on the occasion of the initial referred attendance. Preliminary estimates made by my Departof ment indicate that, excluding pathology, the at overall increase of 7.3 per cent would increase benefits schedule fees by some $67m in a full year. Increase in benefits would cost Medibank and private medical benefits organisations about $59m in a full year. The increases into benefits flowing from the fees increases deteris mined by Mr Justice Ludeke should result in increases in family contribution rates of up to 35c per week. However, the actual increase in conrates is a matter for each individual organisation to assess in the light of its particular financial experience. The organisations will be as soon as possible of the increased benefits so that they can assess what increase in contribution rates will be necessary. Action will be taken shortly to prepare regulacontions under the Health Insurance Act to the determination, and to re-print the medical benefits schedule book for use by medical benefits organisations and doctors. In conclusion, I would like to thank the Australian fees Medical Association for its goodwill and cowhich were evident throughout this Inquiry. I would also like to express the Governappreciation to Mr Justice Ludeke for the from manner in which he conducted the 1977 Inquiry and for his timely presentation of this comprehensive determination.",26
50,Dr KLUGMAN,MEDICAL BENEFIT PURPOSES,"by leave-Whilst I have a copy of the statement by the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt), as yet I have not seen a copy of the determination. I therefore find it difficult to comment upon the determination. ter emphasised the relatively small increase-as he put it-in medical fees proposed for the year commencing 1 January 1978. He emphasised that the increase for the year would be 3.8 per cent compared with an estimated increase of about 9 to 10 per cent in average weekly earnings. The point that should be emphasised is that in that time there have been quite a number of changed circumstances. Whilst the Minister has ignored those changed circumstances, hopefully Mr Justice Ludeke has not and has discussed these factors in his determination because it very difficult to apportion an exact value to thosetitioners changed circumstances. For example, since cause Medibank II came into operation in 1976 a larger proportion of persons has been privately covered. Those doctors who previously received a large proportion of their income from perform-cent ing their duties in hospitals- I do not mean ployees of hospitals but private doctors on fee service performing their duties in hospitals-no receive a much larger proportion of their income from that source. There are other aspects which the Minister covered in answer to a question notice from the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) reported on page 2088 of Hansard 27 May this year. The important point in the answer is the one we find difficulty in dealing with and hopefully Mr Justice Ludeke got information from the Commonwealth Department of Health. The honourable member for Murray asked the Minister for Health: What information can he provide to either substantiate demolish the allegations that medical practitioners' have increases dramatically since the introduction of Medibank. The Minister's answer was as follows: It has not been possible to quantify the increase incomes of medical practitioners from available records. That is the important point. We do not know than what the actual incomes are. Later in he states, accurately: However, medical practitioners' gross incomes increased since the introduction The increases are related to: (a) increases in fees for medical benefit purposes. Increases in fees were implemented on 1 January 1976 and 1 January 1977 . . . He goes on to give the details. The answer continues: (b) the introduction, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria, of sessional or modified-fee-for-service systems of payment to medical practitioners for services to standard ward patients in recognised hospitals, for those services previously rendered in an honorary capacity. I will return to that part of the answer in a minThe Minisute. The answer continues: (c) payment of medical benefits for the whole range of medical services for services to persons previously covered by the Pensioner Medical Service. The Pensioner Medical Service Scheme provided for payments to participating medical, practitioners for general practitioner consultation only; and (d) an increase in the coverage of the population. Persons who had not previously taken out health insurance with private medical benefits funds were covered, from 1 July 1975, to the extent of medical benefits for medical services. Of course, they still are because under the new medical insurance scheme everybody is compulsorily covered. Part (c) of that answer refers to is the increase in the incomes of general pracfrom their treatment of pensioners bepreviously there had been a special fee for much services rendered to pensioners. Whereas general practitioners now receive 85 per cent of the full fee, previously it was only about 50 per of the full fee. Other doctors, especially proemcedural doctors working outside hospitals, now for receive a higher proportion of their income from w their treatment of pensioners whereas previously they did not see pensioners privately but saw them in hospitals. For example, ophthalmolon ogists doing refractions previously did a lot of this work on elderly people in an honorary caof pacity but they now receive a significant payment for their treatment of these people from Medibank or the health insurance funds for some doing the same work in their own rooms. In part (b) of the answer the Minister referred to payments for services previously rendered in an honorary capacity and in this regard I shall or quote from an editorial in yesterday's Melincomes bourne Age. The editorial refers to an article which was published the previous day about a complaint from the Victorian Hospitals Association concerning payments to honorary doctors, in gross so called, by agreement. The editorial states: Under the agreement, public hospitals have paid more $2 4m in the past year in sessional fees to specialists who his answer formerly served as honoraries. So in just one State there was an increase, jushave tified or otherwise, of $24m in the income of one of Medibank on 1 July 1975. relatively small group of people. When the arguments of the Victorian Hospitals Association were put to the Victorian Minister for Health, Mr Houghton, last night he said that the Victorian Hospitals Associationfiguresdid not give a true picture of the amounts paid to most visiting specialists, and it certainly did not when it conies to a figure of $6,000 for one hour's work. But, in defending the payments, Mr Houghton went on to say: Under existing arrangements for visiting specialists erage cost per hour worked is only $ 110. That is a payment of $110 for visiting specialists doing work on standard hospital patients for which previously they received no payment all. For a 40-hour week they would receive $4,400 by way of what they consider to be an gratia payment for work which they previously did for nothing. I do not know whether those tors have been taken into consideration by Mr Justice Ludeke in determining the new fees. pleased, as is the Minister, that the inquiry mined that the 'increase in schedule fees be graphic made differentially, that is, that the increase schedule fees for items vary but will provide, overall, the determined increase ule fee income by specialty'. Obviously some specialists and some general practitioners have not benefited as much by changes to the health insurance system as others have and they unentitled doubtedly are entitled to an increase in fees; those who receive an ex gratia payment in some States and therefore receive much extra money, obviously should not have their fees increased if they do have them increased, not at anything like the same rate. I shall provide just a few extra figures. The erage cost of medical services between 1975 and 1976 increased by 17.8 per cent even though apparently were not increased by anywhere near that amount. The figures provided by the Director-General of Health show that in the average cost of a medical service was $ 10.85. For the six months to 31 March 1977 they increased to $12.78, a 17.8 per cent increase. Medical benefits payments in 1975-76 amounted to $629.5m. Doctors stillreceivedon top of about 15 per cent from patients and $ 166.5m from the health insurance funds. I know that Minister is just as concerned as I am that health expenditure as a percentage of gross domsequently estic product has increased in this country from per cent in 1972-73 to .7.5 per cent in 1975-76. This is a huge increase, a 25 per cent increase, the proportion of gross domestic product. ObviAssociate ously we cannot carry on like that. If the amount spent on health services increases at that rate everybody in this country will be either a patient or an employee of hospitals by the year 2000. COST/BENEFIT STUDY OF NA Ministerial Statement",28
51,Mr MACKELLAR,IMMIGRATION,"by leave- A the avstudy of the economic costs and benefits of immigration was one of three projects commissioned by the Commonwealth Government in 1970. Two of these, the National Population Inquiry, headed by Professor W. D. Borne, OBE., and the 1973 Immigration Survey were at completed in good time and produced valuable results. Thefirstreport of the National Popuex lation Inquiry was tabled in Parliament in February 1975 and was thefirstmajor study to facidentify, and publicly comment upon, the national decline in fertility and its implications I am for the future growth and development of deterAustralia. The report showed that the demoscenario of the future is likely to be subin stantially different from that which formed the background for economic development in the in gross sched1950s and 1960s. The report of the 1973 Immigration Survey, 'A Decade of Migrant Settlement', was but tabled in Parliament in September 1976. This was thefirstcomprehensive study of migrants' experiences in Australia and covered such areas or, as employment, accommodation, language and recognition of qualifications. In addition to listing the major problems experienced by migrants in Australia, thereportalso identified the migrant groups most seriously affected by problems avm these areas. These two reports provide a valuable data base for the formulation of Australia's fees future population and immigration policies. Their findings are also of immediate relevance to other areas of Government, both State and Fed1975-76 eral, and to the private sector. I now refer to thereporton the third project, the cost benefit study of immigration. Associate Professor J. R. Wilson, of the University of Sydthat ney, in 1970 undertook to carry out a cost/ benefit study of immigration. His appointment the was recommended by the then Immigration total Planning Council and the project was subplaced under its general supervision. 6 Over the period 1970-71 to 1972-73 a total of $39,000 was provided for the study, mainly for in computer processing andresearchassistance for Professor Wilson's work on this project. Progress was, for reasons I am not informed about, unsatisfactory. The Council made assiduous efforts to have the study completed, including the use of a special committee to discuss future action on the study with Associate Proand fessor Wilson. Successive Ministers for Immigration pressed to have the study completed as did I. The final report was received in June 1977.1 believe that will, in expressing some regret about the apparseems ent quality of the report, speak not only for self and the Government but also for previous Ministers for Immigration who, like me, had hoped for a greater contribution to an underought standing of the economic impact of the post-war immigration program than this report offers.

I think we ought to apologise to Professor Wilson, notwithstanding that we may not agree with all the arguments proposed, as he has put seven years work into this work. We might criticise but I think that some of the areas he mentions should be canvassed far more widely. We should not blithely cost the taxpayers of this country $39,000. As has been indicated, it took longer than die Second World War to produce the report. I agree with the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic I Affairs (Mr MACKellar) that it is inadequate. It to me that $500 a page is an extraordinary myamount of money to pay for such a report. However, I think the statements in the document will be of some use in the important debate which to ensue over the whole concept of population policy. I think the Minister has rubbished do the paper because some aspects of it are rather unpalatable to him. Whilst I agree that the report certain deficiencies I think we should have grace to inject tables into the report if it is to be left somewhere to be examined. I think it ought not to be just left somewhere to be examined.

June 1977. put this study in an area where it will be shelved and never be referred to again. Professor Wilson raises many important issues. We may not agree with him in relation to many of the points. Many issues are not observed in the paper but they are worthwhile of study and of some further discussion. He has said that some matters are tentative, such as those relating to the lack of comprehensive data, demonstrating the need for better statistical coverage-as I have indicated-an there are many issues which he does not canvas at all, such as the dogmas of immigration and population growth, educational disadvantage many migrants and children, the extra cost to the system, the reliance of certain industries tariffs, cheap immigration labour and low capital. I think we have to canvass the three projects which were referred to in the Minister's statematter ment. Looking at the report of Professor Borrie's National Population Inquiry- I have made this observation to the House before-w efindthat many of the projections from that inquiry are absurd. In thefinalanalysis we have to ascertain whether they are projections or whether they are it is. the individual's personal opinion about the matter. I believe that the population inquiry report and the Green Paper are political documents. I believe that they serve to underpin the Governgrace ment's policy in relation to what it would love proceed to do at the present moment. I think the Government is doing this in a rather underalso handed way in many respects by leaving an open-ended population intake. That might anything between 50,000 and 150,000 people. The Minister has said that economic considerthe ations will be applied when considering the level of the intake. But when one examines the criteria under which migrants will be accepted into this country, I think they leave a lot to be desired. There is a whole range of discretion. As I have said, the number might range widely. If we look at thefirstreport, if we look at the further report entitled 'A Decade of Migrant Settlement', if look at the Bailey Inquiry report, if we we look the various reports from the migrant task forces, the Good Neighbour Council and the Commigration mission of Inquiry into Poverty and if we look the current economic circumstances which are projected for job opportunities for the future, will see that one million jobs will disappear tween now and 1981.",30
55,Mr SHIPTON,IMMIGRATION,Disappear ?,31
56,Mr INNES,IMMIGRATION,"Yes , disappear. If the honourresponsibly able member knew anything about what he talksprospects about and if he made an examination of what I am saying and what Dr Birrell from the Monash University in Melbourne is saying he would be educated a little more. He willfindthat what am saying is very near the mark. If we are to the next decision to bring people into this country then we take the reasonable responsibility, is surely, to ensure that all aspects of immigration policy are investigated. Professor Wilson's cost benefit analysis seems to be part of a serious aspect of the whole inquiry. For instance, if what d the Minister says is correct then what we lack is fundamental to this matter. Is it cheaper for us to bring people out here under an immigration proto gram than to use the money elsewhere? Obviously that was the basic consideration of the then on high Minister for Immigration, who is now the Treasurer (Mr Lynch), when this inquiry was launched. It seems to me it is fundamental- I agree with him-that we need to know what the is all about. We need to ask whether the children of migrant settlers now have a very bleak future. We need to answer that question. We cannot leave Professor Wilson's report in the Library for all to see. It should have been tabled in the Parliament, as bad as the Minister thinks There are some positive aspects to the report, notwithstanding that the production of it is a disand an insult to Professor Wilson. It seems to to me it has a lot more value than was suggested by the Minister in his statement. It seems to me from the report that consideration has not been given to such matters as the growth in the mean work force and the decline in employment prospects for the unskilled, the inexperienced or people who are at risk. One simply cannot consider merely the disadvantages experienced by migrants or the children of migrant settlers. They are not the only people to be considered. Eighty per cent of our own indigenous people, the Aborigines, are unemployed in many areas. The Minister shakes his head. What I am saywe ing does go to the point. I am pointing out that at this report was commissioned for the purpose of conducting a cost benefit analysis in relation to to this country. Surely we have to look at at that matter in the context of our present capacity to serve individuals, youth, disadvantaged we groups, migrant groups and Aborigines in this becountry. Even if there is an upturn in the economy, the prospects of future employment for people in those groups to which I nave referred are pretty bleak. I challenge the Minister to look at this matter to see just what are the for the children of migrant settlers and to seek to determine, if that cost benefit analysis is not good enough, where and how we may find answers to the questions I pose. I am saying now I that the aspects with which this report has not takedealt include such things as the growth of the work force. There is no doubt that the work force in decline. I repeat what I said in reply to an interjection by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton), namely, that there are job prospects, but the prospects are dirninisliing to the extent where we are facing unemployment of 900,000 to one million, and that is what we have to face up to. It is obvious from the report that such matters as the disadvantages caused to unskilled migrants, particularly the recent settlers, been considered. That situation is reflected in the number of young people who are now unemployed. We notice that 14.3 per cent or 14.4 per adjourned. cent of the females who arrived in this country between February 1976 or thereabouts and May 1977 are unemployed. A lesser percentage of males is unemployed. We should look at the ality of the situation. The Minister referred obliquely-h e did not do so in any substantial way but by means of a very scant the deficiencies in Professor Wilson's have to go ahead andfindout what is the real situation. Wefind,when examining the situation of apprentices and others, that there retraining program. Such a program is fundamental to the restructuring of industries and to an examination of the prospects of the Australian talk work force in the future. Rather than spend our money on assisted passages, would it not be better to spend it in doing something for the kids who are here at the present moment? I am speakto ing about the young people who adorn this pubmeant lic gallery time after time. Their prospects employment in the future are very bleak. Not one honourable member opposite can produce any evidence to the contrary. I challenge do so. That being the case, the third point I make related to the additional hospitalisation created by migrants. What sort of shortfall do they create in hospital facilities, education facilities, water supplies and other public utilities services which are already strained to the this point in time? They are strained to such gree that we do not have the capacity to fulfil obligations to the people who already live in country. The Opposition spokesman on health matters has made that point time andtimeagain. If that is the case, it seems to me that we ought be looking seriously at Professor Wilson's report. It is not a document that I would any circumstances. It is ourresponsibilityto make up the shortfall which is created and which Prime is mentioned in previousreports.There are itical documents which make this point also, and the Minister blithely writes off Professor Wilson's report which has taken seven years produce and which has been in production durthe ing the tenure of office of various Ministers have doubted the veracity of the report. I chalweeks lenge those people who have criticised it to stand up and criticise it in detail, and not to be completely negative when looking at the prospects for the future. The whole of the rationalisation of what we see for industry in the future only",31

NA and Discussion of Matter of Public Importance limit at Mr Acting SPEAKER-I have received leta deters from the honourable member for Oxley (Mr our Hayden) and the honourable member for Lilley this (Mr Kevin Cairns) proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by to Standing Order 107 I have selected one matter, that is, that proposed by the honourable member acclaim under for Oxley, namely: The economic uncertainty caused by the comments of the Minister about the economy and an early election. polI call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. to More than the number of members required by Standing Orders having risen in theirplaceswho Mi HAYDEN (Oxley) (3.53)-In the past few the nation has been subjected to almost unrelieved speculation as to whether or not there is to be an early election. The speculation has been inspired by the Prime Minister (Mr Liberal Malcolm Fraser)-by his comments and by his behaviour. It has been added to with characterconfronting istic good humour by the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) by the comment he made in Canto berra last week. In an equally characteristic way it has been vulgarised by comments made pubtralian licly by the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon). They have all indicated clearly enough their belief that there should be an early election. No one has said it directly, but all of them implied it in a most clear fashion. This has created a great deal of uncertainty in the econanalysis omic community, especially amongst letters businessmen. Business recognises,firstof all, that at of election the administration of country tend to be left somewhat in suspense. a situation of a very weakened economy-tha the sort of situation we have in this country today-that can have disastrous consequences. Furthermore, in a situation such as that which are experiencing with the national economy the moment and with the predictions which haveoccasion been published as coming from the authoritativeback. economic advisers of the Government who have indicated a much tougher year ahead, suggesmany tions of an early election create the gravest certainty imaginable, especially amongst the business community. In snort, the effect of this sort of loose speculation, aggravated by the haviour and not so oblique comments of the increased Prime Minister especially, and ofhis senior Cabiof net Ministers also, in fact is to undermine furthercordingly, the weak level of activity in the economy and to shatter confidence. We have noted for some time the scene-settingconsumers for an early election. The Prime Minister has been indulging in his favourite exercise-abusin others. I gather he learned this when he his parents' cattle property early he could play the country squire with some of hired hands. So he is seeking to extend this vaster range, as the national leader of Australia. He has abused the Industries Assistance Comdisputes mission, suggesting it is responsible for the lems created for manufacturing industry as a result of imports. He neglects totally that the Commission has absolutely no executive authbelieves, ority; it is restricted to the role of an advisory body. Any decisions about protection, one or the other, rest with the Government, and finally, with this Parliament. He was exposed by a member of the Liberal Party of Australia-a n office-bearer until the date that he made the exposure-a Mr Tanner of Sydney who was stripped of all his rank in the Party. So much for Liberal principles. Mr Tanner properly pointed out that the problem manufacturing industry today as a consequence of the inflow of imports has nothing do with the Industries Assistance Commission; it is a direct result of the weak state of the Ausdollar. He forcibly pointed out a number of measures which ought to be adopted. that it is Mr Neil-He was talking rubbish. have Mr HAYDEN- Mr Tanner a good big 'L' Liberal, pointed this out. I believe it was a correct of the economy. It was pointed out in the to the editor column of the Australian Financial Review a few weeks ago. Mr Tanner a time paid a high price for his candour. He was the affairs of a stripped of office! In The Prime Minister also sought to abuse, t is accuse and blame the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission for the present state of the economy. It is handy to have scapegoats, weespecially if one believes one has the Comat mission muzzled, but he was wrong on this because the Arbitration Commission bit Members of the Commission, including the President, Sir John Moore, pointed out that other influences are at work in the econunomy, all of which are of much greater significance in terms of its present condition than wages. Why would Sir John not make that obvibeous point when in fact wages lastfinancialyear by a little over 10 per cent and the cost living increased by more than 13 per cent? Acthere was a real reduction in wages and, incidentally, in living standards. That latter point is important. It means that the capacity of to buy in the market place was reduced. Therefore any strengthening that might g have been coming into the economy which must was oncome by way of improved consumer demand in his life, and was demolished. the The Prime Minister has attacked the unions. on aHe has abused and accused them too. He ignores the simple fact that days lost through industrial in this country each month this year are prob-the lowest for any comparable month for more than a decade. He is seeking to set up straw men so he can easily demolish them and hopefully, he distract the people's attention from the key issue in the political scene at the momentway economic management or the abject and unchallengable failure of the Government to handle the economy. In Queensland he is seeking to incite the oil companies to engage in collusive practices-t origthe price of oil at retail outlets. I am not sure whether he reached new heights of subUrnity or what. I will leave it to others to observe but he has even resorted elevating me to the economic demonology ofthetance. country by abusing and accusing me. I almost feel Uke Samson Agonistes. I have reached the point at which I am now preferring to quote what the others say, because I fear I have so much powerBank at my fingertips and so much thrust at the pointBank of my tongue that I wiU wreck the economy, much as Samson was able to wreck the temple of the non-believers, with a simple word, a casual gesture. What aU this boUs down to is that if the Government is genuinely scrabbling about for early election it is conceding failure. It is conced-report, ing failure in adrrnnistering the national econing omy. That is why there is unease in the comand munity. That is why there is why there is insecurity in the economic system of this country. People recognise that a government with a majority as large as this one has-it has the highest majority nn record in this place and most generous majority in the Senate-wit h a considerable amount of its parliamentary term yet to run and yet is seeking an election in spite of that, is clearly unsure, has lost its confidence, lost its will, is no longer certain. In short longer has the conviction that it is able adthat equately to handle the affairs of the country. know that if I alone say this there will be a tend-official ency for the whole economic system's underpin-Now nings to fall out. Let me hasten to add that whatstated am saying is derived from what two conservativeReserve newspapers have said. The editorial in the Age 29 September stated: When a Prime Minister comes to power declaring needs three years to get the economy into shape-an calls an election after only two-thirds of that time-h complain if voters interpret his move as an act of desperationview or an admission of failure. The Canberra Times of 4 October stated: But if Mr Fraser and his Ministry have so little confidenceployment in their ability to govern despite their massive majority they need constant reassurance, perhaps they need a term of rest and relaxation on the Opposition benches. That was a perceptive comment. The situation for the Government is one akin to panic-pani converted into fear and frenzy. Its slogans have been scuttled-scuttle d by the Reserve Bank Australia that is why its panic now becomes fear.in The Bank, in an analysis of the economy which the Acting Treasurer (Mr Eric Robinson), echo as it were, suggests is not an important document, has provided a thorough, critical, beOverall, condemnatory analysis of economic poUcy and possibility its impUcations. Let us be clear on one thing. That document is to a high level document of the greatest imporIt represents succinctly the condensation of all the analytical wisdom of the Reserve Bank. I speak as a former Treasurer, as one who knows procedures which are adopted in the Reserve and the Treasury. Each month the Reserve considers, at a board meeting, the state of the economy. The basis of that consideration is derived from the sort of report which appeared in the National Times. WhUst the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) may not see that report-afte r all it has some polysyllabic words in it and may present some difficulties for him-h e is 'apprised in an simple laymen's terms of the details of that of the analysis and of the conclusions arisfrom it. That is done one day each month, that day is the day after the Reserve Bank uncertainty. That isBoard meets. That report shows that economic growth will be extremely sluggish this year, much slower has athan was proposed in the Budget documents. Clearly it reveals that the country will be on the edge of stagnation throughout 1977-78. It indicates that we will have much higher unemployhasment than the Government is prepared to conit no cede. We of the Opposition have been making obvious point after analysing the state of the I economy and interpreting vanous sources of information which are avaUable pubUcly. we have it clearly and unconditionally I in an unchallengeable form by the Bank of Australia in its most important ofanalysis on the state of the economy and the outlook for the year. that he Unemployment in June 1978 will be about 6 d thenper cent. The Reserve Bank says so. The Governe cannotment would have us believe the Reserve Bank's will not have any influence. If I were to say that however I would destroy the economy. That's why I quote the Bank. It's safer to do so. The prediction means very simply that unemin the early part of the year wiU be in that excess of 7 per cent and as high as IVi per cent. We wiU have 120,000 more people unemployed, at least, than we currendy have. We wiU have unemployment in excess of 450,000. Proportionc ately, the greatest burden of unemployment will be imposed on the young and on the migrants in of the community. It wiU be imposed on the women the work force. The report from the Reserve Bank makes it clear that interest rates wiU stay up the and probably increase. I shall quote it: the forecasts imply financial conditions that will relatively tight . . . the forecasts also suggest the of upward pressures on private short-term interest rates (with associated consequences for expectations about official interest rates, the net take-up of government ties, etc), downward pressures on bank liquidity, possible bottlenecks for local and semi-government securiues, etc. that in turn could influence imponandy the state of financial markets in 1977-78. Let me explain that in laymen's terms. The Actat ing Treasurer will welcome this assistance year greatly. He has great difficulty in understanding nises is that some of these official documents which come them it is it from the various advisory departments government. That report simply means two for it to get terrible. Itisacknowledges things. It means that interest rates, given the present monetary policy of the Government, by cannot come down. If the Government seeks to election. manipulate them in some sort of marginal meaningless way by a reduction of one-quarter of one per cent as suggested by some sources close to the Prime Minister as he likes put, that is merely a cosmetic action because considering an early election. The report the Reserve Bank makes it clear that if that is done and if the Government retains policies this year, those interest rates will be adjusted upwards soon after any such tion. Therefore, it would be a dishonest, deceptive and misleading tactic. That is the first thing. Interest rates cannot come down. In fact, they are more likely to under the present monetary policies of the Government. The Acting Treasurer shakes his head with that sort of economic comes from success as chief floorwalker in women's underwear in David Jones. He does not do so well in understanding economics. The next thing this report states clearly is we are in for a tougher credit squeeze in the course of this financial year. That is what I quoted means. It states that simply, bluntly clearly. Any fool can understand it. Most is Government supporters have a great deal difficulty in undemanding it. I shall give a simple explanation of why there must be a credit squeeze this year even tougher than the one have been going through. The monetary target, M3, is to increase between 8 per cent and 10 per cent. That is the supply of money. If we allow movements in inflation and the Government's Chair projection for economic growth, the Budget documents, there will be a demand for money between 13 per cent and 14 per The difference is between 3 per cent and 6 per cent. That is the order of the credit squeeze we are facing. For all this cost and the enormous cation of a deeper recession, more unemploymember ment and a dislocation to business, inflation still be approximately 11 per cent to 12 per cent securiaccording to the Reserve Bank of Australia. For all the enormous cost and dislocation imposed on the community, very little will be achieved in terms of conquering this key problem. The Government recognises that the political climate the moment and for the rest of this calendar and will be bad for an election. It recogwill be even worse next year. For better to hold the election when the of political environment bad rather than waiting this tacitly seeking to exercise the option of an early and Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr GILES) - Order!

65,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"We have just heard IS minutes of rag tag, of grizzles, gloom and complaints. It has to be put on record that these are the words of a former Treasurer in the Labor Administration. The honourable member for Oxley forgets his own record. I think I should remind him of it. I well remember that when entered this Parliament S years ago the utterly dismal. requirement for the nauonai expenditure was just over $ 10 billion. Then, $10 billion of the payers funds were required for the national expenditure after 72 years of the Federation of States and after 72 years as a nation. Three later, the Hayden Budget and the Whitlam understand Administration more than doubled that very requirement. Inflation ran riot. Inflationary exits pectations ran riot. How are these expenditures funded? They rates will continue were funded by an increase of about 89 per cent disappointed. in personal income tax and substantial deficit which funding. The inflation rate more than doubled about 17 per cent. Unemployment increased reduce substantially. Manufacturing industry which the rates honourable member for Oxley about today started its substantial decline. Today the honourable member's motion refers to econility omic uncertainty. If anybody ought to know about economic uncertainty it would be one of recovery the Labor Treasurers. During the Labor Governthey are tentative ment's three year period we had rampant inflaeconomy, particularly tion, growing unemployment and lack of stability. In relation to my own portfolio, in that three years there was an increase in postal charges have helped. from 7c to 18c. That is the Labor Government's record. That is what it cost the Australian community. There have been no increases since. some areas there have been decreases. The basic charge for telephone calls increased from 4c to 9c That was the sort of wreckage we saw under the Labor Administration. What has been our record? Why is the honouryear able member for Oxley coming into this House today in his unsure and emotional state? He is apparently concerned that before long he might have to go to the nation and compare his record and the record of the Government of which was a part with ours. We said when we came Government and we have repeated ever since that the key issue was to get the rate of inflation down. That is what we have done. We have substantial success. It is now in single figures. There has been a reduction of about 7 per cent. One of the ways we have achieved this is by reining in the rate of growth of government expenditure. In doing this we have been concerned about the size of the deficit. The honourable member for Oxley who moved this motion introduced a budget in which he planned a deficit of $2.8 billion. When we achieved office some four or five months later, the deficit was running in excess of $4 billion. Had we not come into office and pulled it back it would have been moving towards $5 billion. The honourable member for I Oxley's record of economic management is taxPeople ask why the Government is not only concerned about reining in expenditure but also concerned with reducing the deficit It is difficult years to get Labor members of this Parliament to that the size of the deficit impinges much upon Australia's reputation overseas, currency and its interest rates. The honourable member for Oxley keeps saying that interest to increase. He will again be He will be seen to be saying things are incorrect. Interest rates will be nudged to down. Part of the Government's policy as we and contain inflation is to lower interest in a steady, sustainable way. In contrast to dared to talk 1973 to 1975, we of the uncertainty the economic period from have had a certainty and stabof policy infiscalmatters. Members of the Labor Party do not like to see the emergence of signs. They are there. We have said consistently that they are there. In some areas but the recovery signs in the in regard to investment and the profit share, are there for all to see. We Instead of increasing personal income tax by In 89 per cent, what has been the Fraser Government's record in thefieldof personal income tax? It has undertaken the greatest reform of the taxation system ever undertaken in this country. Not only have we had personal tax indexation, which we pledged we would implement over a three penod but in fact implemented in the first year, but from I February next year there will be substantial reform and simplification of the Australian tax system. In the corporate area-the Whitlam Administration was not concerned he about the corporate area-w e have encouraged into development and growth by the trading stock valuation adjustment and by the investment allowance. We have shown our interest in small had business and small companies by easing the requirements of Division 7. Our record in taxation is quite distinct and apart and in substantial contrast with that achieved by the Labor Administration. While the Labor Government was in office weno importance saw a substantial decrease in manufacturing throughout this country and what did it do rural industry? It deliberately set out to and destroy. It acted as utter vandals would actand in regard to rural industries. Those honourable try members who were here will remember the com-It plete lack of interest and lack of concern part of Labor Ministers about what was happening in the great rural industries of this country. We are committed to strengthening rural cies industries. That is why we brought in income equalisation deposits and that is why we are seeking to bring in, and will bring in in the week or two, provisions relating to the averagingshould of income tax. That is why we took a stand on the fixing offloorprices for wool. Only a few weeks ago we took the decision to help substantially important beef industry which is temporarily gomg through a very difficult period. We are committed to bringing in legislation, and will bring it in in the next few weeks, relating to a can. rural bank which is so necessary to assist rural industries. Compare this Government's record in the fieldrates; of industrial relations. Again at Question today we saw a complete lack of interest in stability of industrial relations expressed members of the Labor Party. We have said con-and sistently to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission that we want to see greater stabilitypolicy in wages costs throughout Australia. We want give the nation a chance to be competitive again,commercial to earn export income, and to create job opporwill tunities in our manufacturing industries. The honourable member for Oxley, who has ness people left the chamber, got very excited last week cause he managed tofindin some way or anotherber for Oxley. some unofficial and informal Reserve Bank document which had not come to the Government and which was prepared inside the Bank the basis of certain assumptions. If people want to prepare a document based on certain assump-the tions they can come to any decision that wish. This document fell, either directly or indirectly, into the hands of the honourable member for Oxley, and he seized upon it and used it in a most improper manner to try to sab-Prime otage not only the economic weUbeing of this into country but, most significantly, as was said yeswhat terday, the standing of the Australian dollar. was so irresponsible as to make public commentsnoose about the Australian currency. So we are seeing continuation of this attitude of wanting to wreck and to destroy the very valuable program and the process of achievement that has occurred over the last two years. The Reserve Bank placed on the document, as was made perfectly clear by the Deputy Governor of the to Bank. It was just a document which suited the wreck purpose of the honourable member for Oxley he used it in a very false way so that he could to propel himself into leadership ofhis Party. is not to his credit at all that he is prepared to on the operate in such a shabby way. The Opposition should realise that its policies have been rejected. It should realise that its poliare not acceptable. It should realise that the nation has ovemhelmingly rejected it. The honourable member for Oxley should try to act nextresponsibly as a member of the Opposition. He try to act responsibly as a member of the national Parliament which is concerned with improving the national economy. But oh, no, the the honourable member for Oxley leads the band of gloom. His attitude is that if he cannot get into office he will talk down the economy, degrade it, disrupt it and wreck as many opportunities as he Again today we had from him not only his quite immature suggestion regarding interest he also wants to instil a sense of fear and Time despondency in the Australian community by the talking about a credit squeeze. He well knows by that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) have said that there wiU be no credit squeeze, that the monetary of this Government is to have sufficient tomoney supply tofinancenecessary business and development but not at a level which add to expectations of an inflationary sense. I repeat that interest rates wdl start to nudge down and there wiU be no credit squeeze. Busithroughout Australia ought to reject be the improper comments of the honourable memIn this discussion on a matter of pubUc imporontance the honourable member for Oxley tried to link the comments of the Prime Minister about economy with the possibility of an early electhey tion. The honourable member and the Labor Party continue to speculate on an early election. The Prime Minister will not be goaded into speculation about an early election. The Deputy Minister (Mr Anthony) will not be goaded it. I wttl not be goaded into it, nor do I know is in the Prime Minister's mind. I suggest to He members of the Labor Party that they put a around the honourable member for Oxley abecause I do not think he is doing himself any good. I doubt whether these tactics have helped him. I think that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) would be far more secure in his position now than he was a few weeks ago. think that the little skirmish over East Timor, about which the honourable member for Oxley got so excited and which he tried to seize on opportunity for yet another leadership struggle, has misfired. No doubt the Leader of the Oppoproducing sition draws some comfort from seeing the honourable member for Oxley fall into such to grievous error as he has. I have nothing to add to speculation early election. The Prime Minister has said that the policy of the Government is to conunue based along the stable economic path on which it set aware on itself two years ago, a path of ility, a path from which the Australian people assumptions upon which know that we will not depart. It is a path of redocument were based are the sponsibility. It is to be very much regretted that are expressed in the Budget Papers, somebody who achieved the office of Federal Treasurer, although he failed in that office, is ing of those forecasts, provided again byupdatnow not capable of being big enough to lift self above this attitude he has of preaching gloom and despair. The Labor Parry had its the chance in office. The honourable member for struck mehas Oxley had his chance as Treasurer and made a which mess of it. He mucked it up. He brought the econ-constantly omy of Australia to the brink of disaster but he past three faU, has learnt nothing and the Labor Party has learnt nothing. We see a continuation-indeed , three this week inside the Parliament and last week only outside the Parliament-and in fact an accelerGovernment ation of an irresponsible approach which is an their responsibUity act of vandalism, an act of economic sabotage against Australia. The Government rejects the economy Opposition's claims in the subject matter of this years discussion and the Opposition should have no body in pride in what it has done.",36
66,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY," I am deUghted to support the comments made by the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) in respect of the matter of public importance which we are discussing. I suppose that first of all I ought to deal with some of statements made by the Acting Treasurer (Mr Eric Robinson). I could not fit his comments any logical framework so I shaU deal with them simply in the order in which he raised them. first thing the Minister said was that the able member for Oxley had done nothing for 15 minutes but produce a ragbag of grizzles and gloom. To the extent that any grizzles and gloomattached were put to the House by the honourable memas ber for Oxley they were grizzles and gloom expressed by impeccable non-partisan sources, particularly the document from the Reserve Bank. That document, we were told by the Acting Treasurer who has ministerial responsibility I for the Reserve Bank, is a document to which the Bank attaches no importance. If that is the case I suggest that the Minister immediately should as an send for the Governor of the Bank and ask him why it is that his officers are wasting their time documents to which no importance is attached. Of course importance must be attached it. The Reserve Bank is at least expert enough a body to ensure that its officers'timeis not being wasted on the production of documents which on an are not important. The Minister talks about the document being certain assumptions. He ought to be certainty and stabscenario oneifmakes that one is looking at any economic certain assumptions, and the this Reserve Bank assumptions that which are available for all to see, and in the constant the himTreasury. The assumptions can be argued with, assumptions can be argued about, but the Minister not sought to do that one bit. It that the Minister fell into the trap into all Government supporters in this House when they talk about 'during the years'. They do not mean the past years of course; they mean from 1972 to 1975. It is a fair example of the way in which not Government supporters but, inexcusably, Ministers seek to run away from for the performance of the during the past two years that they have been in Government-tw o of the three for which they sought office. Now everythe community is concerned that the Government is seeking to run away from that responsibUity by bringing on an election to distract from its miserable performance. The Minister sought, as part of the rehearsal of his earUer statements during the Budget debates, to defend the Government's economic perforthe mance and to defend its priorities. He gave a couple of quite pathetic examples. He talked into about increases in personal income tax during the three years of Labor Government. ImmediaThe tely I was able to turn to my colleague, the honour-honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean), and get from him the Budget Papers. If one looks at the bar chart in Statement No. 6 to the Budget Papers one wiU see that, a percentage of total Budget receipts, personal income tax is greater now under the Fraser Government than it has ever been. For the first time it has gone over 50 per cent. They are the facts. They are here for everybody to look at. That is the record of the Fraser Government on increases in personal income tax. The Minister, in an incredible piece of double think-whic h never ceases to amaze me, although when I have been here long enough no doubt I will get used to it-talke d about increases in postal and telephone charges when Labor in power and said that that was a deplorable thing. In the very next breath he went on to about the importance of containing the the deficit and cutting government Honourable members can be sure of one thing: The deficit would have increased if those charges had been left at the level at which they were viously. But this is the kind of double think in which Government members and Government supporters in this House engage constantly. course, quite predictably, the Minister concluded with a pathetic attack on the honourable ber for Oxley. It was a personal attack on his integrity and on his performance in the economic debate during the past couple of months. Let be in no doubt about it. The Opposition has charged both the honourable member for the Adelaide (Mr Hurford) and the honourable member for Oxley with the responsibility to out into the community and to argue about the economic administration of this country. That their job. It is their responsibility. Anybody posite who talks about the responsible role of Opposition ought to know that that is what we are supposed to be about and it is what those gendemen are supposed to be doing. When they do it they deserve to be applauded. Yesterday we had the deplorable situation which the Government whipped its members to censure the honourable member for Oxley, vert attention from this matter which was raised yesterday as a matter of public importance.",38
67,Mr CADMAN,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,Ha !,39
68,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"The honourable member for Mitchell says 'Ha!' He scorns the suggestion that the whip was used. Of course was used on the proposal that the honourable member for Oxley ought to have an extension of time to defend himself at least one Government member thought that on such an important tion, when an honourable member's personal integrity was under attack, he ought to have right. To his credit, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) supported the Optorials position to allow an extension of time. He abwhich, stained quite deliberately, as he made clear, from voting on the motion. Other honourable members opposite ought to be ashamed of themselves. If persons are going to come into this House and move motions of censure against individuals and if the Government is going to apply whips on those motions, Government Ministers ought to be prepared to speak in such debates and not to leave it up to the grandstanding was individuals on the back benches who are more concerned with exanuning the impact of the partalk liamentary retiring allowances scheme on persize of sons who have served one term in the expenditure. Parliament. Honourable members ought to have no doubt preabout the way in which the economy is talked about. It is talked about not simply by persons in this House, not simply by persons who support Of the Government parties or the Opposition party; it is discussed by a whole range of institutions memand interests outside. Persons who make decisions on the question of exchange rate administration and who make decisions to move capital us in or out of Australia are influenced by quite objective factors as they perceive them. That is fact, and that ought to be the way in which Government Ministers look at the economy-no t go in the fairyland way in which some Ministers here seem to look at it. Senior Ministers opposite is are constantly seeking scapegoats. The Acting opTreasurer was at pains to point out that he has the not indulged in any speculation about an early election. Indeed I would be prepared to concede that I have not seen any reference to where he has done so. But if he looks at the wording of the matter of public importance he will see that we are talking about the comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and senior Minisin ters. We refer especially to die Prime Minister who has come under very close scrutiny and conto didemnation consistentiy by Government supporters for his muddying of the waters on this question. I hold here in my hand the editorial of the Sydney Morning Herald of 29 September which says that the Prime Minister is behaving irresponsibly and that he should now in the it interests of good government put to rest any suggestion that, in the present circumstances, there will be an early election at thistime.That is the Sydney Moming Herald. It is not the quesMurdoch Press, which Government supporters were able to quote yesterday in condemning the that honourable member for Oxley. This newspaper is a member of the organisation which writes ediin support of the Government parties and whenever the next election is held, can be fairly anticipated to do so again. But there ought to be no doubt about only Opposition members raising this concern. It has been raised by a many Government supporters. The seeking for scapegoats goes on and on. The Arbitration Commission is to be blamed for the poor performance of the economy. It is to be blamed by the same purist monitorists, the same Friedmanites, who if they go back to their text books will see that there is no place for such a wagefixingbody anyway in the text which they regard as holy writ. The honourable member for Oxley referred to the abuse constantly and quite improperly heaped by the Prime Minister on the heads of the commissioners and associate commissioners of the Industries Assistance Commission for performing the duty with which they are charged by this Parliament to advise the Government, and to do nothing more than that, on the protection of Australian industry. If we are to talk about the speculation about an early election being raised by other senior Ministers I can think of no more irresponsible example than that indulged in recently by the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon), a very senior member of the National Country Party, in his address to that Party in Melbourne the other day when he again fanned the flames of industrial confrontation in this country. It was a theme to which the Prime Minister himself returned with great delight at question time today, not in any endeavour to improve industrial relations in country but in the hope and the expectation that massive dislocation will occur and will give the pretext that he wants for an early election and to divert attention from the sad and sorry economic performance of this Government. It wants to have an election on an issue that would be completely irrelevant so that the attention voters is diverted from the condition of the econvery omy to which this Government has reduced it consistently over the last two years.",39

70,Mr HODGMAN,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY," Mr Deputy Opposition. Speaker, I seek leave to make a personal explanation in respect of certain statements that have been made.",40
71,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,Does the honourponsibility able member claim to have been omics' misrepresented?,40
72,Mr HODGMAN,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"I have most certainly been misrepresented by the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam). A few minutes ago the honourable member for Grayndler tinguished himself by saying- I noted it in the other room where I was listening to the debategreat that the motion moved yesterday was promoted by grandstanding Government back benchers preoccupied with their parliamentary entitlement, having served only one term in this Parliament. The reference was clearly to me and I just draw the attention of the honourable member for Grayndler and other honourable members to the fact that I have served two terms in another Parliament and, thanks to the previous honourable member for Grayndler, that time counts. I am not concerned about my pension, but I am concerned that the honourable member for Grayndler can cast such a slur on Government back bench members.",40
73,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"In rising to speak against the allegation made in this matter of public importance it pleases me that the previous speaker had so little to say that I do not need to spend any time on his arguments; there were none. It surprises me also that after yesterday's debacle by the shadow Treasurer or Opposition spokesman onfinancethis matter of public importance was not taken off the order of business and another put in its place. Then again, that may be attributable to the usual sloppmess of the Labor Party, even when in opposition. There is no doubt that debating this topic must bear some resemblance to an act of hypocrisy on this the part of some of the Opposition members. They talk about uncertainty. The two years in him which they have been in Opposition certainly have not been a lesson to them. In thattimethey might have sat down, matured and acted as an opposition in this Parliament. I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker-althoug h I know you need no of reminding-that a responsible opposition is a essential part of any Parliament. But in the past two years we have seen no degree of responsibility on the part of this Opposition. Its members have shown no loyalty to Australia as a and no responsibility to the Parliament, to the economy, to the nation or to the people in the past two years in which they have been in Let me outline the situation which has existed over the past fortnight as far as this type of irresis concerned. The Australian produced a leading article-'Kamikaz e EconI think was the heading-whic h was relevant to this matter. Only this week the Nation Review is wondering who will be the alternative leader of the Opposition if the Opposition does not want Gough. Certainly its members do not dispay too much attention or credence to what Hayden says. Only this morning a letter to the editor was published in the Sydney Morning Herald which certainly must make the nation wonder so far as the spokesman for the Opposition on this subject is concerned. One thing I will say for the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) is that in the period in which he has been in Opposition there have been many tides which could be attributed to him if he wanted to claim them. Put into parliamentary language, there are such terms as 'economically irresponsible', 'instant economies', not 'Blind Freddie' but 'Blind Billy'. This letter published in the Sydney Moming Herald refers to the 'organ grinder and his monkey'. I believe that aU these terms are an indication of what the people of AustraliaMr Carige-Whic h is the honourable member for Oxley-the organ grinder or the monkey?",40
74,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"I think he would be monkey; I do not think he would be the organ grinder. The honourable member for Oxley briskly throws out challenges to debate with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), yet this accused letter pubUshed in the Sydney Moming Herald things. In states: Mr Hayden is not backward in accusing others the 'courage and conviction' to debate with him on tralian economy. Your readers may be interested to know that in this year Mr Hayden refused a similar challenge to debate the merits ofhis 1975 Budget at the first national ofLabor economists in his home State. I presume that refers to Queensland. Many people give Queenslanders a particular reputastatus tion. I am happy and proud to be a development Queenslander but I am not sure that the honourmining able member for Oxley is exactly improving the image and the great reputation we have as tainty Queenslanders. Certainly I do improving the reputation which we are trying to gam in this place. When Opposition members speak of uncertainty-the matter of public things. importance relates to uncertainty about the omic situation and an election-the y speak with certain degree of experience. If anybody sown the seeds of uncertainty within the Auseconomy-h traUan economy and the community it certainly has been the Opposition, both when in governperiod ment and in the two years since. Let us look the uncertainty which must be attributed to the Labor Party. For instance, on what will the and honourable member for Oxley be an expert next? Who is the present Leader of the Opposition? Who is the spokesman on a particular subject? From where wiU the next chaUenge come? Certainly there is uncertainty about the Opposition in the minds of the community. I am afraid I must go back to the events of 1972 to 1975. It is important that the Australian people remember that the seeds of destruction of the Australian economy and of uncertainty in so many ways were laid in that era. The Acting Treasurer, the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson), has indicated already that the inflation rate when Labor took office was 7 per cent and it ended up at 17 per cent under its leadership. Unemployed numbered 90,000 people when the Opposition took office and 250,000 when it left office. At a time when the people expected that the Labor Party, of all parties, could possibly work with the unions, we saw a record level of industrial disputations-the greatest number that this nation has the ever seen. We saw the uncertainty of three Treasurers, ministerial sackings and the then Government going from one crisis to another. Yet in this matter of pubUc importance we are of giving an air of uncertainty to certain fact, it was the Government in that period from 1972 to 1975 which skimmed the of lacking crest of desirabiUty but never plumbed the the Ausdepths of practicality and that is what led to the uncertainty which existed at that time.That is a very good expression. Not only were there economic uncertamties at that time,but also in the June of minds of business people there was uncertainty conference about investing because of inflation and there was uncertainty about jobs because of the increasing rate of unemployment. One thing that is of particular relevance to our retaining our in world affairs is the uncertainty in the of the mining industry. Not one development got under way in those three years because of the fear and the uncerthat the Labor Party inspired in the minds not think he is of the electorate. Even now we see a continuation of these We see a lack of confidence that has been econsparked by claims made by the honourable a member for Oxley. The honourable member for has Oxley is a self-proclaimed genius on the e is an instant expert. But we have the disasters of his period as Treasurer, his as a Minister in the three years of the at Labor Government and his exclamations of the past two years as evidence that irresponsibility uncertainty can still be attached to him. His 1975 Budget raised the deficit $1 bUUon over expectations and thefigurewas rising. The confidence with which he introduced his new tax scales was nothing but a gigantic fraud perpeintention trated on the people of Australia. In fact, confidence he displayed at that time was the great confidence trick he played on with those tax scales. Let us not forget Medibank, that great socialistic program which has been pruned but ably needs further pruning. It could not be for by the Australian public; it was paid for through the inflation rate because we could afford tofinanceit. The deficit which had not been reached previously. All these things can be attributed to the honourable ber for Oxley. I believe that his comments made more recently in 1976 probably made the rate devaluation 4 or 5 per cent have needed to be had he not talked the economy and the people into such a situation. I believe that what he has said today is evidence the fact that he is still prepared to talk down the economy; that he is still prepared disciple of gloom in this place and to spread gospel of uncertainty. Let us look at the election situation. manytimeshave I heard challenges from the Opposition for us to go to an election on the persons uranium issue or on anything? The Australian Council of Trade Unions has led to speculation about an election by calling for a moratorium and laying down atimeby which we are to give a definite answer as to whether we will call a referendum on the uranium issue. The refereners dum concerning simultaneous elections held earlier this year now gives the Prime Minister adAustraUa. ditional options. These are speculated about, only by supporters of the Government but also by members of the Opposition and members the Press. I believe that if Australia is to return to a in which there is no uncertainty and in which we have a certain amount of responsible control must as a government act responsibly and not for popular short term measures. To do this require a national spirit which will not be talked down by the honourable member for Oxley. We require co-operation from the unions and the Opposition. I hope we can achieve this together.",41

76,Mr HURFORD,OILSEEDS LEVY COLLECTION AND,"It is not often that the Irish in me comes to the surface it did last night when I was gagged in seeking, Opposition spokesman, to speak at the second reading stage of this Bill. I am grateful, made my fuss, that better counsels prevailed and the Bill did not get rushed through last night, giving me an opportunity now to say something at this third reading stage. Incidentally, we underAuditor-General's stood that there were to be three speakers in second reading debate and I want to thank the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) for their contributions in my absence from the House during the second reading and debate. In supporting the Bill at this third reading stage I want to point out that it is a machinery measure which has formed pan of the legislative successive governments over a Bill provides legislative Treasurer to bonow up to the anticipated Fund. This gives me and others who wanted to speak on Bill an opportunity to discuss the value of deficits. It also gives us an opportunity to discuss value of borrowed funds for defence purEffectively this Bill transfers amounts up from consolidated revenue to the Bill have expenditure and authorisation the Bill does is given for new not involve a Similar Bills for the The Australian Labor Party has never opposed such BUls. We have regarded them as what they are as I have described them before, machinery to reasons. required for legal and accounting measures I reaUse that I am obhged to stick closely to the detaUs of the Bill in a third reading debate and not range widely as I would have done at the second reading stage, but I would like to draw In Committee attention to a certain amount of nonsense involved in setting an arbitrary limit to the funds to be bonowed. In this regard I refer to clause 3 of a the Bill which we discussed during the Committee stage last night. The Government has embarked on this meaningless exercise of setting these limits each time it has introduced a Loan Bill over the last couple of years but the repetiThird Reading tion of what I call a farce adds nothing to the useof this action of setting a Umit. In effect this Bill, as with its predecessors, is not more or less than an open ended attempt to gain funds by bonowing. The only reason which the Government could have for including a cash Umit would but be to create some sort of impression of responsias bUity and efficiency but frankly it is window dressing and it is obligatory on me to point out having where the window dressing takes place. If we want to discuss administrative efficiency let us do it in the context, for instance, of die report which we have not yet the discussed in this Parliament. The Auditor General has shown in his latest report presented in this Parliament just how staff ceilings have led to such enormously inefficient operations. Just because mistakes were made when the Liberal National Country parties were in Opposition and they discussed from the Opposition benches a Bill such as this, do not let us pretend that ting an arbitrary limit like $ 1,100m on this transfer from Consolidated Revenue to the Loan Fund for defence purposes means anything at all. The setting of a limit on funds to be borrowed under the Bill is, as I have already said, a preoccupation which comes to us from the Government's opposition days. In this case setting up the image has no impact on efficiency. I repeat that the staff ceiling example which I mentioned earUer in achieving the image has obviously had an adverse effect on real efficiency levels. Despite the fact that this Bill is merely a chinery measure, when a simUar Bill was introduced into the House some two years ago members of the then Opposition who government used it as a vehicle to make outlandish and irresponsible predictions about the possible level of the 1975-76 Budget. That was last Australian Labor Party Government Budget. The Opposition at that time,led by the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the present Treasurer (Mr Lynch) who was then shadow Treasurer, embarked on a systematic program to distort the role which the pubUc secregarding tor was playing in the economy at that time. Australian newspaper of 9 September 1975 quoted the then Leader of the Opposition as ing that the Budget deficit would reach $6,000m. He arrived at this figure by multiplying the deficit for the first two months of the financial year by six. I point out that if we do such a calcument lation this year we will get a projected deficit more than $9 bilUon. But I doubt whether the Prime Minister will make such a calculation year. Certainly, I am not going to do so as, hope, a responsible spokesman for the Oppolems sition in these Treasury matters. It was ridiculous and irresponsible to suggest that a deficit of $6 bilUon was a likely outcome the Hayden Budget or the 1975-76 Labor Party Budget just as it would be absurd to suggest that this year's Budget deficit on present indications- in admittedly, we have already had changes with its some benefits for the beef industry and changes to tax averaging-could reach $9 billion. But spite of these and other possible changes to the goods Budget before it has been put through the Parliarate than ment, I am not going to assert that because the deficit for the first two months of the financial year is at such a rate, then we will end up with a before $9,000m deficit thisfinancialyear. But I am bound to point out that this is the sort of irresponsibility which was taking place two years and which led up to the premature election December 1975. Total cuts in projected ture made by the present Government on the set- Hayden Budget of 1975-76 amounted to something less than $300m. The final actual deficit, adjusted for the present Government's Medibank pre-paymentfiddle,was $3.5 bUlion, that is $1.1 bUlion less than thefigurethe Prime Minister claimed it would have been. It would take an extremely rubbery-to use the Treasurer's latest famous adjecuve-$300m to stretch out to the $ 1,100m mentioned in this Bill.

78,Mr HURFORD,OILSEEDS LEVY COLLECTION AND,"I think that even he has gone back into his shell now that I have drawn attention to the context in which Treasurer PhU used that adjective. The claims by the Liberal and National Country Party Opposition in 1975 the deficit were, of course, nonsense. The Nobody with even the minimum of economic Uteracy could have made them, with any sense of sayresponsibUity. However, let us have a look at what happened to the 1975-76 Budget and trace through the sorts of things which can happen to a loan Bill such as this. Before concluding I comon another aspect of the role played by the of pubUc sector in recent years which has been the subject of much debate and, possibly, of much this misunderstanding. The present Government I claims that many of our current economic probresult from the increase in the size of the pubUc sector which is supposed to have occurred between 1972 and 1975. In current price terms Commonwealth Budget outlays increased from of 25 per cent of gross domestic product in 1972 to more than 30 per cent of gross domestic product 1975. This expansion could have occurred as a result of the public sector deliberately increasing call on the nation's resources or, alternatively, as a result of the public sector's share being in maintained in real terms while the price of the which it consumed rose at a much faster did the price of goods which the private sector consumed. They are the two alternatives us. It behoves us to look at which of those two alternatives apply. I draw attention to the fact that at a recent ago seminar on urban management processes two of officers of the Department of Environment, expendiHousing and Community Development produced a paper in which they claimed that the lack of relative price effect was a major reason for the apparent increase in the size of the public sector. They found that in real terms public consumption and investment by all levels of government have maintained a fairly steady share of gross domestic product at around 27 per cent in recent years. That is, under Labor the public sector merely retained its real share of the nation's resources. I am not making any final determination on this thesis but I point out these alternatives. I take the opportunity to draw attention to some work being done at the Australian National University at the presenttimeon this matter of relative shares of our gross domestic product going to the public and private sector over a longer period than the period which was the subject of assessment by the two officers from the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development. I believe the point is that the rapidly expanding public sector was far more an apparent than a real phenomenon during that period. It behoves us all, when we are trying to discuss or assess the past in order to help us with decisions about the future, to get at the real facts. This type of evidence further underlies the folly of the present Government's attempts to reduce the real level of public sector activity. In fact, we can learn from views expressed at the recent International Monetary Fund conference in Washington and from the changed attitudes of the governments of Prime Minister Fukuda of Japan and also ChanceUor Schmidt of West Germany, to mention two countries. I point out that there is great merit at atimeof stagflation, such as at the presenttime,in adopting the Australian Labor Party's alternative short term economic poUcy of moderate, stimulatory pubUc spending to help the economy return to health, provided that spending is in areas where there are underemployed resources of men and material. As I said at the outset, although this Bill is a link in the operations of the funding of government activities, it is merely a machinery measure. Last night I was annoyed when, as spokesman for the Opposition, I was gagged. I know there is a great feeling of shame on the Government benches about this matter but honourable members have absolved themselves by aUowing me to say something now. I thank the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. NON-GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS (LOANS GUARANTEE) BILL 1977 Second Reading Debate resumed from 15 September, on motion by Mr Viner: That the Bill be now read a second time.",44
79,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OILSEEDS LEVY COLLECTION AND,"The Non-Government Schools (Loans Guarantee) Bill 1977 was introduced into the Senate and has been passed by that House. The Opposition in the Senate moved an amendment to clause 7 of the Bill. I propose to move at the appropriate stage an amendment in almost identical terms. I indicate at this stage that the effect of my amendment to clause 7 would be such that if a guarantee is given for an amount which exceeds the $10m originally provided for it would have to be done by prescription and the Minister should table the detaUs of same within three sitting days. I note that it was suggested in the Senate that there was no need for such an amendment. I propose to mention my reasons for pursuing my amendment when the Bill is considered m Committee. I might add that a reading of the debate which took place in the Senate reveals that it seemed to cover everything but the matters contained in the Bill. I shall try to confine my remarks basically to what the Bill envisages. The point made was that the suggestion that the Government guarantee loans to nongovernment schools came from the Schools Commission. That is true, but I would Uke the House to address its mind to the specific reasons given by the Schools Commission for what it caUed the approach for non-government schools to raise their necessary capital. It drew an analogy between the government and the nongovernment schools in relation to financing. The Opposition believes that both government and non-government schools are in most cases in dire need. We are well aware of the deficiencies in the guideUnes of the present program. The recommendation of the Schools Commission reads: The Commission has been impressed by arguments it has heard concerning the difficulty many non-government schools have experienced in bridging the gap between the grants and the total cost even when assessed on a needs basis. Consideration was given to a possible variety of methods for alleviating this difficulty . . . On balance, . . . the Commission concluded that it should seek to have a loans guarantee scheme introduced to complement the existing system of grants. This would allow building loans raised commercially by non-government schools to be backed by government guarantees in respect of approved projects. The Commission would envisage that a guarantee might facilitate renegotiation, on more favourable terms, of loans already entered into at high rates of interest. I hope that is so. But I remind the House that, in practical terms, at the present time there are problems in New South Wales and, I would say, m every other State, in getting adequate funds for schools. We are dealing with what might be called the capital improvements area; we are not talking about recurrent grants. It will be noted that because of the guidelines that have been set down severe problems are experienced in financing the capital area as well. It seems that the Government has decided to say that the Commission's recommendation is a very worthwhile one because it will allow the Government virtually to opt out of its responsibilities in financing the needs of schools, whether they be government or non-government schools. I can indicate at this stage that the guidelines, which have meant less money being available for schools, have meant a $33m reduction in funds being made available to New South Wales alone as compared with the amount which would have been provided under the guidelines applicable in May 1976. The Bill provides for $10m guarantee to be made available to non-government schools for capital works throughout Australia. There is no doubt that the need for funds is massive. I shall illustrate that point clearly. I am not talking about category 1 and 2 schools; the wealthy schools. On a needs basis the non-government schools in New South Wales sought $48m this year. They have $6m available by way of grants. So there is a gap of $42m. The point I make that that shortfall of $42m exists in relation to those schools. The Government then says: 'We are going to try to help you a little bit further providing a guarantee if you can raise the money yourself. But honourable members will notice that the Schools Commission in its recommendathey tion was speaking of a bridging loan to fill the gap between the grant and the eventual cost. In most of the cases there will be no grant. As say, $42m will not be made available to those schools in need. Some part of that $42m shortfall will be met by the $ 10m which is to be provided. It should be remembered that that $10m is to satisfy the requirements throughout Australia, and the $42m shortfall applies to New South Bill Wales alone. So honourable members can have imagine the real need position in Australia. Schools will be applying for a grant to whole of a project because no other grant will available. That means that they then have to convince the Minister that they will be able to the gram on more favourable terms. They are particularly not likely to get grants on more favourable terms from the banking community; such money is That only obtained on commercial terms. One of the fears I have about this legislation concerns the provision in clause 6. The Minister has to be satisfied that the schools authorities can arrange the loan of money on suitable terms and conditions. One can read into that requirement that the loan has to be obtained on more satisfactory terms and conditions than would normally be available under a commercial transaction. The Schools Commission was talking about sectional funding. But substantial funds will be needed if a capital program of some size is envisaged. A bank will not be interested in anything other than a commercial transaction. Furthermore, looking at the practicalities, it is well known that in the main schools in the non-government sector are associated with religious groups which are interested in religious education as well as in normal school type education. Because those schools have what we might call the backing of the religious institutions, they are in no way in need of a guarantee because the banks lend money to the religious institutions all the time. They never default. So what we have here is a cosmetic approach based on the belief that the Government is doing something very worthwhile; it is providing a guarantee. I think most school authorities would agree that such a provision would certainly berequiredin a situation where a substantial grant was required and they could not bridge the gap between the grant and thefinalcost. A guarantee would be worthwhile in such circumstances. Because of the relatively small amount is of money being made available for grants for capital works, it does appear, as I said at the outset, that the non-government schools in the main by and those schools in need will be required to finance the whole of the capital cost of a project They would be able to do that in any event if were able in the normal course to put to the bank a commercial proposition. There is no provision in the Bill which gives them any money; it I merely says that the Government will provide the substance for them if they fail and go broke. I cannot see any church institution or school institution of the type in existence ever doing that because such institutions provide close support for their schools. I commend that situation, but the does nothing for them because they will still tofindthe full sum of money and they will have to repay the whole of the capital. There is cover the no grant involved here at all. be The situation here is similar to the donkey and the carrot situation which was introduced a long get time ago in relation to non-government schools, those in the Australian Capital Territory. Provision was made for an interest subsidy. situation still applies. The interest was the carrot and the donkey had to raise all the money to and to repay the full amount of capital. ation still applies. We have a peculiar system financing the needs of children in Australia. at two levels. Firstly, the State governments in dire need of more funds, but they will not those funds. Secondly, the non-government schools in the needs area are in dire need of funds, but they will not get those funds. introduce into this situation a guarantee, basis that the Schools Commission reccation, ommended it. It is worthwhile to the extent it is bridgingfinancefor only a segment of the costs where there has been a grant. I put to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs Viner), who represents the Minister for cation (Senator Carrick), and the Government that they should look at the situation in Australiaman at present. We have massive appUcations for substantial capital funds to assist government and non-government schools. Those funds are not being made avaUable. It is no value to 'We will give you a guarantee if you can get theon money elsewhere yourself, because that leads this question: How would these people be able repay the money? From what source would theyWhere get these funds? The funds could come only from the school fees or from their own pockets. If they in need, as they must be before they can quaUfy, how would they get any advantage out of this E osition? There would be an advantage if there ad been a substantial grant of 70 per cent to per cent of the capital cost. They would have money. They would merely have tofindthe think difference-the 30 per cent or the 25 per cent. When one looks at the prospects- a massive has intruded. need for capital funds, and no money made avaUable at all-on e sees that the schools will bementioned denied their opportunity. I think it is worthwhile also to talk about Government's attitude to the Schools Comquick mission. I commend the Commission for its courage and independence in saying to the Government what it thought of those guideUnes. It virtually said that the guidelines would have be interpreted as directions. I think it is a combeen plete negation of democracy. We set up an cate? independent Schools Commission to advise government on the basis of need. The Comgovernment mission is given what are now deemed to be di-there rections. If it does not comply with those direcpective tions it says that apparently it will be in somehave jeopardy with the Government. One wonders whether some members of the Schools Comattend mission will be reappointed after December 1977 because of their approach to this problem. They acknowledge the fact that they are obUged make certain provisions not only in the capital That situ-area but also in the recurrent area. of I will give the House one example. This was a It is direction. The Commission is to make recomare mendations towards the implementation of a getgoverament poUcy of providing a basic per pupU grant equal to 20 per cent of the running costs. moreNo needs aspect is involved. I remember the We present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), on the when he was Opposition spokesman on eduopposing the establishment of the thatSchools Commission because it could make grants on any basis of need; he said it had to be on thefixedmathematical ratio of 20 per cent of (Mrrunning costs, irrespective of need. We would not Eduhave a Schools Commission today if we had reUed on the likes of the then Opposition spokeson education, namely the present Prime Minister. He fought that Bill tooth and naU. Now, by directions to the Commission, he is getting in his personal policy. This was not say: announced policy when this Government turned the lights in 1975. It was not announced at all. toIt looks Uke Fraserism at its best. We wonder towhere Senator Carrick fits into the situation. was the policy announcement, where was mandate to give directions of this type? Is it arejust to suit the personality cult of one man? Now the Commission says that it beUeves it can interpret the guideUnes only as directions. What sort of Minister for Education has the Govern75ment if he is subject to directions from the Prime thatMinister as to what the Commission will do? I it is a most serious indictment of the whole education program into which the Government We must bear in mind that 20 years ago if one education in this Parliament it was deemed to be outside the ambit of the constithetutional powers of this Parliament. That was a way to get out of all responsibUity. There was no question at all of funding education. Twenty years ago if one dared to ask for any funds or to ask a question he was ruled out of toorder. At least we have grown up. There has the Karmel report. What did it clearly indiIt indicated massive needs for capital and a recurrent grants both to government and nonschools. With the new Fraserism, is to be a specific grant to aU schools, irresof need. That means that parents who substantial funds can give substantial financial backing to schools which their chUdren and those schools can get a subsidy by way of a grant. The poor parents cannot match that. The chUdren of the two groups must compete at examinations and at every other level. The children of parents in the lower sociothat economic group are really suffering a burden, the Karmel report clearly showed. It showed 80 per cent of pupils in the lower socio-economic repay. group never made the tertiary stage. Most of them had to leave school by the time they reached 16 years of age. The Commission was up in an effort to reverse that imbalance, on basis that every child should have an equal portunity and on the basis that they should be supported by way of funds. It is a complete reversal of that process to 'It does not matter what you need or what your parents can give, we will give you all the same amount. We know that at the end of the year, when you come up for examination, those who went to schools and who have hadfinancialsupGovernment port, perhaps to the extent of $2,000, will do a better that the poor unfortunate child who has had support to the extent of about $300. All the techniques, all the teaching aids, everything will be there for the children of the wealthy parents because the aids could be bought. Children from the lower socio-economic group will have to the best they can. Everything is deemed to equal because you sit for the one examination'. The Karmel report clearly showed that that not the case. It clearly showed that the people entering the tertiaryfieldwere those who had best parental support, and that meant monetary support. It said: 'We should reverse the trend'. is for those reasons that we are very critical of Government's approach to this whole question of education. If State governments have a might responsibility, as they have to supervise governand ment and non-government schools on a proper basis and if they say they need a certain amount of funds, those funds should be available. The main criticism is this question and guidelines, particularly the reversal of guidelines. In May 1976 the Commonwealth dicated guidelines that would have provided more money than has now been given. Why has not that money been given? It has not been givenit because the Government decided to bring in some more guidelines that gave even than was proposed in May 1976. It is for those reasons that the whole aspect of schools and then-Repon, needs must be looked at. When one sees this schools. legislation talking in legal terms about what deemed to be a project, how it must receive ? roval and how there will be grants of up to 10m, one thinks that it could be worthwhile. Then one looks at what it really means in practi-some cal terms. What school in need will be able to find the money to repay any part of the $ 10m? it is in need it needs grants. The whole point it will not get grants. All it will get is the as benefit of a mortgage, which is a very doubtful that benefit indeed, if it has tofindthe money to The big issue is this: When banksfinanceon a commercial basis they expect their funds to be set repaid at various intervals by way of capital the repayments. If one borrows $10,000, the banks opdo not say: 'We will take $1,000 a year'. They might want $3,000 in thefirstyear. They want all sorts of variations of payment. Schools cannot say: match this sort of concept. This is why we are critical of this approach. Whilst the Schools Commission was putting it basically on the question of bridgingfinancebetween a grant and the ultimate cost, in this case it appears that the is saying that the only way a school lot will get a new building is if it borrows the money itself and makes its own arrangements to repay the money. That overlooks again the question of need. It could be that the people with the greatest parental support andfinancialstrength are likely to be able to say that they have arranged to bordo row the money and that they can repay it. That be does not get to the question of needs at all. Let us look at the reimbursement of interest was and the allocations made in New South Wales budgets. In many cases the budgetary allocation the for that interest reimbursement was not taken up, for the simple reason that the poor people It could not afford to borrow the money. They did the not have the ability to repay it. So we get the present problem in Australia that because a child have poor parents he is to remain deprived a victim of the environment into which he was born. They will not enjoy the same educational opportunities as the wealthy have. This is a complete negation of the spirit of equal opof directions portunity in Australia. In its latest report-Rollin g Triennium in1978-80: Report for 1978-the Schools Commission clearly objects to these guidelines. The Commission makes the point that it believes that must produce a further report on the basis of needs. Under the heading 'A Subsequent Report less funds on Needs', the report affirms: The Commission proposes, in addition to the present to produce early in 1978 a full repon on the needs of is We will welcome that report. It will expose the appresent embarrassing situation. Schools which do not need money are receiving it. There is no objection to that circumstance if they get it from source other than schools funds but to direct that they will get money at the expense of Ifschools in need is a shocking way to express a is government policy on education. I have already indicated one specification is that all nongovernment schools are to be funded on the basis of returning per pupil grants to 20 per cent of running costs per pupil in government schools irrespective of needs. An additional $2m is to be given to Level 1 and Level 2 non-government schools. Perhaps an argument can be made to support that proposition. But that money is to be taken from the schools in need. So, $2m is to be given not to the schools but to the parents of the children in these schools. That is ridiculous. There had to be an increase in 1978 in the capital program of non-government schools of $3m, specifically to assist in establishing new schools and new places. That is worthwhile but the funds are to be taken from other schools. An analysis in respect of New South Wales raises the old sectarian issue that we are anxious to get away from because our belief is that all children are entitled to get the best possible education. The analysis shows that the reallocation in New South Wales can be as much as $13.8m in capital and recurrent funds, $9.8m in government and $4m in joint programs from non-government schools. That is a reallocation of resources which is against the normal factor in relation to those categories. The Opposition does not object to schools being able to borrow money. We claim that they should never be put in this situation. Funds should be available for them. The Opposition objects to the Government's guidelines and its directions to the Commission. I turn now to the specific purposes aspect in this legislation. I propose to refer to a couple of minor matters in this respect I have mentioned one of them. It would appear that the Minister has to be satisfied that the school is able to borrow money at more favourable terms because of the guarantee the Government is providing. I very much doubt it. Unless schools can show that they can borrow money on more favourable terms than the normal commercial terms they still will not get the guarantee. That is the reading of clause 6.1 propose to raise the other matter by way of an amendment to clause 7 sub-clause (2). That sub-clause states: Guarantees given in any year commencing after 31 December 1977 shall not guarantee the repayment of amounts exceeding in the aggregate $10m or such higher amount as is prescribed in respect of that year. It was suggested in the Senate that if that ever happens-becaus e of the effects of inflation it must happen-the Minister should table the details. The Minister for Education (Senator Carrick) replied that there was no need to do so. I think that, from the point of view of sheer accountability and supplying information, such a need exists. The Opposition supports the concept behind this legislation. It can see that schools in certain areas need a guarantee- I believe that they need a grant-bu t the whole concept of education needs is opened up when legislation of this type is introduced. No goverament money will be given and no government money will ever be needed. The Government is merely urging parents to make a greater effort. In some respects, perhaps, that is worthwhile. But when that effort has to be made in the form of a financial contribution from their pockets, it is not fair. On the basis of needs, those who do not have the money cannot afford to borrow and repay. Their children will bear the consequences. It is for these reasons that we urge the Government to have another look at the recommendations of the Schools Commission and to give some cognisance to the fact that the Schools Commission objects to the guidelines. The Government should clearly understand what has now happened because of the reduction in education funds. The suggestion in the previous Budget that a 2 per cent growth would be maintained has now been denied. The Government should look at all those factors and recognise that this is a piece of legislation that it should never have to use. It ought to be able to give adequate funds to government and nongovernment schools on a needs basis sufficient for their recurrent expenditure needs and reasonable for capital funds purposes. We all know and understand the problem of unemployment and its relationship to the building industry. But let us be clear that the guaranteeing of loans will not solve that problem when those people who are in need and those schools which are in need will not have the wherewithal to repay the money. No contracts will be let Debate interrupted.

NON-GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS (LOANS developed GUARANTEE) BILL 1977 Second Reading Debate resumed.",45
80,Mr MARTYR,FACILITIES AT ADELAIDE AIRPORT," I support the Smith Non-government Schools (Loans Guarantee) him forhas Bill. I oppose the proposed amendment. We are not debating the whole ambit of any Schools Commission report or the Karmel report, but hope, Mr Deputy Speaker, that later m this bate I will be afforded the same opportunity other honourable members have had to discuss such matters. The purpose of the Bill is to implement scheme to enable the Commonwealth to act guarantor for loans raised by non-government schools in the States to finance wholly or parnot tially the construction of approved priority school facilities. In spite of the confusion Opposition which is suggesting the exact opat posite, the Government has accepted the recomschools. mendation of the Schools Commission that a systhe tem of loan guarantees be established. November last year the Minister for Education (Senator Carrick) announced this decision foreshadowed the introduction of the necessary promises. enabling legislation. In partial answer to the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) the loan guarantees are importhe tant to the non-government schools. The scheme will have considerable benefit for nonhas government schools in that it will allow loans building projects to a maximum of $ 10m in any one year to be backed by Commonwealth Government guarantees. That is not a bad sort guarantee for expenditure in one year. The scheme will provide much needed support for those schools wishing to raise loans, especially those without institutional backing. In addition, it will permit more favourable bonowfor Mr ing terms to be negotiated. Loan guarantees will one or twoisothersLUley also be available for projects which, while apened of him. In fact proved in principle by the Commonwealth, may of us. not receive a grant. The Bill includes provision for the Commonwealth to recover any cost to it in the event of default. It is not a handout but an encouragement. It will foster increased building activity in non-government schools in the States. It will undoubtedly help the employment situation in those States. I think the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith alluded to this. Unfortunately, a small sectarian conflict has developed. This always happens when Bills of this nature or anything to do with education are Airport, foreshadowed. I think the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith also mentioned this. It has outside this House. Regretfully, I observed that it has been added to a little by the Opposition in the Senate. I hope that this nonsense which should have no part in our society will be ignored by the Opposition in this House. I think the honourable member for Kingsfordset the stage to ignore it. I commend that. It seems to me that irrespective of which party I has been in power, the non-government sector dehas been somewhat disadvantaged. The legisas lation we are contemplating now is a forward step which will help redress the imbalance. There is another important point. It has been a suggested that, during the term of the Whitlam as Government, the state of non-government schools improved significantly. That is simply true. The levels of resource use between the two systems actually widened between 1972 and of the 1975. Non-government schools were operating a level 28 per cent below that of government This represented a 5 per cent decline on situation that the now Opposition inherited In from us when it assumed government. The Schools Commission reports themselves clearly and show this and the Government has kept its I want to pay tribute to my esteemed colleague honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns), who is in the House at the moment who always fought for education. He has fought for hard over many years and so have a lot of other honourable members but I particularly mention the honourable member for Lilley because of earUer this year, in March, he asked the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), with some temerity if I recoUect correctly",50

We will go along with him whatever he does, maybe to the disadvantage of the Opposition. any case the honourable member for Lilley, March, asked the Prime Minister for some assurwork ances, assurances which to some people would amount to a statement, that the non-government sector would receive a fair go in the allocation money for education. Naturally the Prime Miniswould ter, being the fair minded and reasonable that he is, responded in the affirmative. I am that the honourable member for Lilley asked tional need. that question because it is important that attention should always be drawn to this matter. The continuing disparity between the nonissue government and the government sectors will be source of difficulty in this House for all governable ments. I believe it is time an approach was made in order to try to reach Ml equaUty. I do not to have a philosophical argument at the moment about the essential issues and essential differences of goverament and non-government schools but I think it is perfectly clear to everynumber body that the contribution to education by the non-government sector over aU these years, of favouritism for the free compulsory and secular system, is very significant. I wonder whether the Government might have a look at some time early in the future at an which is not new but which I beUve will usher in an era of true equaUty. It is caUed voucher funding. Apart altogether from the state aid issue, voucher funding for schools is gaining wider and ticipated wider acceptance on sociological, economic and would be offset by the educational grounds. Schooling has become a more affluent parents tax social service which the Government has undertaken to provide and each child is personally titled under our present system to a certain amount each year towards the rising cost of his or accordingortooperational her schooling. It is the individual child's personal need for a suitable education that estabUshes right to this money, arightit exercises through parents or guardians. Parents in turn have the repurpose sponsibUity and right of choosing dren a school which meets their legitimate preferences. It seems to me when I consider complications that might arise from this present Bill, which I support, that the simplest way of vouchers calculating the amount due to each cluld would be to make it equal to the actual average cost, costs whether it be the local, region or State cost, maintaining a place in a government school. In October 1976 a Senate estimates committee established thisfigurefor a secondary school student as being $1,280 and for a student $770. With all the statisticians who are attached now to the Schools Commission, it should be quite easy to establish thefiguresfor the money being spent per student every year. I In hope our friends in the corner of the House, the in advisers, do not quaU at the prospect of more being loaded onto them but I beheve this would be one way to solve this perennial inequality problem. Were this aUowance that I of am suggesting to be part of a famUy income it be taxable and this would ensure proman vision according to famUy need which is more glad equitable than provision according to instituOne way of paying the allowance would be to vouchers to parents at the beginning of a each year or term, the vouchers being redeemat any approved school. The vouchers could be avaUable at schools, to be signed Uke cheques want when parents enrol their chUdren. However, the method we now use would be quite satisfactorygovernment payment to each school or system of a cheque whose amount is determined by the of children in attendance. The vouchers being uniform for all chUdren taking the same course, and not tied to institutional needs, the process would be even simpler than it is at present. Aid to chUdren at non-government schools may have to be increased step by step over a number of years towards ultimate parity idea with what government school parents receive. It is for actuaries to determine how far the anadditional cost of providing equal financial assistance for all children at school revenue collected from with chUdren at either engovernment or private schools, all being treated recurrentalike. Vouchers normally would cover only costs whereas at present, the Schools Commission report of its 1976-77, there are gross inequalities in plant. itsThese could be reduced or removed by special grants like those the Commission for their chUguarantee that we areand already recommends rather like the capital at present discussing in the this House. AU voucher funding systems envisage parents paying the cost of their children's schooling at the school of their choice. The simply enable all parents to meet these or fees up to the level of an equivalent place of at a government school. The vital difference between voucher funding and current Australian practice lies in formal recognition at law of the fact that basic aid moneys are due to chUdren or families and not to institutions. Aid to the primary school student, not the school. Local experiments will have to be mounted show which voucher model or models will work best in Australia. A two-year or three-year lead time would eUminate the damages of hasty we action, however well intentioned. How often in the last few years have we seen these ping up actions adopted? In some ways they have been to the detriment of the systems involved. Were school funding the responsibUity the Department of Social Security this would free the Department of Education to concentrate on formally educational and pedagogical issues and services. Voucher funding then would seem to be more equitable than the present system less vulnerable to political interference. By increasing pubUc interest in schooling it would attract to it a larger part of the national income than can be fairly raised by taxation. Vouchers would give government school parents the kind of authority some private school parents now enjoy. Many parents who are now made to feel that they have no say at all in schooling would be encouraged to take a really active interest in it. Those who simply supply schooling would become more sensitive to wishes of those who consume it, even when there is only one school avaUable to them. There are many studies avaUable on what have been talking about. I mention two in ticular, one by E. G. West entitled 'Economics, Education and the Politician' and another by access A. Maynard entitled 'Experiment with Choice Education'. I think both are avaUable in Uamentary Library. I am certainly indebted to John W. Doyle who Uves in this city for his ment in a study entitled 'New Schools in a Society'. I commend to the House the Bill that we have been discussing and I also commend scheme which I think would be a serious and proper step towards solving the perennial inequality between state and non-state systems of education. No community can long remain healthy and productive that does not set great store by the personal dignity, authority and sponsibUity of aU its members. These are basic to freedom, in my judgment. We want to reinwe vigorate the world we Uve in and to renew society and I believe that this means putting as much real power as we can into the hands of ordinary people, especiaUy power over their own lives over the things which concern them most deeply, Uke education and the famUy. The provision of vouchers for schools seems to be one of the effecsystem tive ways of doing it. It may even be, in the long view, that the greatest value of voucher funding Ues in the sense of personal responsibUity which to it restores to parents, teachers and chUdren. In the meantime we are going to have to go on guaranteeing capital for the other schemes that have in the hope that sooner or later the move to equaUty which started some considerable time hasty propago will eventually see fruition.",51
83,Mr BRYANT,FACILITIES AT ADELAIDE AIRPORT,"It is always a of pleasure to follow my friend, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Martyr), as he has so many contributions to make. Now he has the magic formula-the vouchers-whic h will solve all the problems of education, except perhaps and teaching the chUdren who go to the schools. He said one thing- I think that we have gone a fair way towards achieving it-and that is that we should put power into the hands of ordinary people. That is what we have done, as one will see if one looks at the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Ministry and the Cabinet. They are very ordinary people. So at least we their chUdren's have achieved that. Let me take one or two of the points that the the honourable member has made. I do not have time tonight to debate the general question of aid for government schools and non-government schools. People Uke the honourable member for I Swan always overlook one fundamental point. parEquaUty does not just mean equaUty of public expenditure oh schools; it means equaUty of to schools. I look for the day when, say, an in average Australian family lands in Melbourne, the Parhaving migrated from Queensland-nobod y could blame them for that- and turns up at the treatdoor of the Melbourne Church of England New Grammar School and are invited to come m. Of course, that is not what happens in any non-state school. Even the most open and accessible CathoUc schools cannot and do not take all the people the voucher who knock at their doors. I represent the areas of Brunswick and Coburg in Melbourne, to which thousands of people have come from aU over the world in the last 20-odd years. Over recent times when people re have gone to one of the local non-government schools they have often been told: ' I am sorry but are Ml.' When they have knocked on the doors of the Moreland primary school, the Coburg primary school or one of the high schools the principals have said: ' I am sorry, we are full, and but still come in'. That is the fundamental difference. No matter how wetinkerwith the foundations of the financial side of the school we will not solve that problem. The strongest objection I have to the continual pouring of money into non-government schools is that we are creating and continuing undemocratic access to the schools. It is true that there are 2,000 government schools in Australia and some 8,000 government schools. The big proportion of non-government schools are CathoUc schools. things. Many of them are more freely accessible than others. My friend, the honourable member LUley (Mr Kevin Cairns), would know that. Surely the arithmetic is simple enough. One has only to look at the cost of them and one has to try to get one's chUdren enrolled. On occasions I have made telephone caUs people and have visited schools in able chUdren to be enrolled and I have been told that this is not possible. That is the fundamental principle to be looked at when we are talking about equaUty of education. In the area which represent there are pubUc schools which have been there for 100 years. The schools are neglected. There is no doubt about that. Very few of the 41 government schools or even of the 12 or 15 CathoUc schools in my electorate are well endowed as schools ought to be in a wealthy country such as this. So I am in sharp disagreeGovernment's ment with some of the things the honourable member for Swan has said. My colleague, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen), outlined some of the weaknesses of this legislation. It forward a typical Liberal solution to a social problem. For therichit will be easier. They be able to face paying back the $100,000 loan and paying the interest on it. It will be more difficult for people who are generally less richly endowed. The legislation provides a commercial approach to the pubUc question of educationto one borrows money and pays interest and the Government accepts no direct responsibUity. history of the scheme is that back in 1969-ther was another election coming up-it was in introduced for the Australian Capital Territory and, I think, the Northern Territory. Mr Martyr-Are you sure?",52
84,Mr BRYANT,FACILITIES AT ADELAIDE AIRPORT,"It says 1969 on the Act. I am not sure about anything that was produced by to previous Liberal-Country Party governments. Really anything could have happened. I am fully aware of the poltiical content of the debate at time. That is what I think is the weakness of scheme. But I think that there are some princoncerned, ciples in it that are worth fostering. Firstly, allows for initiative by the school boards. Secondly, it gives government guarantees for the tiative of non-government schools. Thirdly, it tapping sources of funds that are not readUy avadable in some other way. I might ask what nonhas happened to the new federaUsm poUcy, because I do not see State governments mentioned the in it anywhere. Let us look at some of these First of aU let us look at the initiative of the the schools themselves. One of the advantages for that the non-government schools have over government schools is that they are able to take action on behalf of the schools themselves. It is only one of the weaknesses of the Australian government school system that not enough power, authority and initiative Ue with the school councUs, for committees or advisory councUs. I am a member order to enof several of these bodies. I think that in Victoria probably more progress is being made in aUowing greater initiative for I the state school authorities than in other States, but we still have a long way to go. For instance, high schools in my electorate have been battling for funds to have the schools rebuUt. The problem is complex. There are problems with the as PubUc Works Department, the planning sections of the Victorian Government, the Victorian budgeting and its priorities. The Moreland high school has a board and a committee and is as capable of running the school and handling the building and redevelopment as anybody else. Up the road are non-government schools. I think that all the non-government puts schools in my electorate are CathoUc schools. They can do the planning themselves, they borwUl row the money themselves and they can get on with the job. If we had the apparatus for guaranteeing government schools and funding them in some way, such as is implicit in this piece of legislation, we could make a substantial contribution Australian educational development. The I believe that we have tofindsome way of tape ping the extraordinarily largefinancialresources this country. I think that there is something Uke $14,000m or $15,000m in savings bank funds and about the same in trading bank funds. Of course, a large proportion of that money is continually committed but there is no doubt that it could be made avaUable. We have tofindsome means by which it can be made readily avaUable pubUc utilities. So, critical as Opposition members are of some of the principles behind this legislation, I suggest that it contains the germs of the further development of pubUc funding for this thesystem. For most of the schools for which I am and I think for all schools, we would it have tofindsome method of funding the interest >ayments and capital repayments. If our probini- [em is at any time the finding of financial is resources to get on with the job without doing something dreadful to the arithmetic of the Budget. I suppose that that is a kind of fantasy-this is a way of tapping those resources. We still have not found a satisfactory method of tapping nnancial resources of the country tor public utilities. Generally speaking, we have enough be resources at our disposal through general Minister, revenue for theranningexpenses of the country. I recall that in the 1975 Budget the total expendi-There ture was about $22,000m. The actual running ex-tion-n penses of Australia, for the day to day running such things as the defence system, payments forare education and pensions, was about $ 17,000m. Our revenue was about $ 19,000m. So on any balanced view offinancewe had $2,000m institutions, operating surplus. Of course, we were committed to about $5,000m or $6,000m for capital of which schools are an important not found a satisfactory way of domg that without getting into aU sorts of hand-wringing exerI cises over what is technically caUed a deficit which I think is a misuse of the word 'deficit'. this way some of those problems could be overcome. Mr Hyde-The honourable member for institutions, MACKellar has been lecturing you.",53
85,Mr BRYANT,FACILITIES AT ADELAIDE AIRPORT,"I know his views but been here for a long while, as I have. He also has had to deal with the operations of government utUities. On one occasion I visited the electorate of the honourable member for Moore (Mr has Hyde) and did it a lot of good. The honourable member might in his visits to Canberra look at institutions which were funded in this way. Com-toria, monwealth Brickworks (Canberra) Ltd and the Canberra Commercial Development Authority are both pubUc utilities. Both are publicly owned.could Both have borrowed money through the sysment tem- I think in both cases from the Commonmatters. wealth Bank under Commonwealth Governpeople ment guarantee. This did not appear in the guarantees Budget anywhere. It did not cost anything. I think there is some government fundCritical ing in each of them but it is minimal. I suggest that the honourable member go out and look the Belconnen Mall and the immense work beingthe performed there by a pubUcly established authMinister ority borrowing funds under government guarantee. This means that sources of revenue not avaUable to the Government under ordinaryprogress. circumstances, unless it does something different from the way we have been proceeding, are ped for pubUc utUities. I presume elsewhere. Throughout the system pubUc utUities, State electricity commissions and so on, go to the market to borrow money. The other point about this legislation which in the my view has some merit is that the Commonwealth is prepared to deal directly with the institutions involved. I have looked carefuUy through this legislation. Although a school has to recognised as a school by the State education that Minister does not intervene in any way. The new federalism seems to be gone. is no schedule at the back of this legislao apology to the State ministers that the ofdealing is to be done directly with people who operating under State education legislation. We nave the effrontery to deal directly with them! But if that were suggested with some other such as those which the great majority of young Australians attend, we would be works, in breach of that sacred document, the part. We haveConstitution. commend the legislation to the House. I can butsee no reason for operations of this nature not Inbeing publicly explained to the House and documented before it continuaUy. I remind the Parliament that whilst this legislation contains germs of useful operations, including the initiative that the schools can deal directly with the the tapping of funds which are not normally avaUable and all the rest, it also contains grave difficulties, such as heavy interest he has burdens, repayments and so on. My friend the honourable member for LUley in one of his waking moments a whUe ago-h e a lot of waking moments, not that he uses them very usefully-aske d why the States do not do something.

In Committee The Bill.",54
86,Unknown,FACILITIES AT ADELAIDE AIRPORT,Sitting suspended from 6to8 p.m. Progress reported. NA Ministerial Statement,55
87,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"by leave- I am pleased to be able to inform the House that the Government has completed arrangements to establish a National Royal Commission into Drugs. The Royal Commission will be constituted by Mr Justice E. S. Williams of the Queensland Supreme Court and will commence its hearings as soon as possible. Since the Commonwealth first announced the proposal to establish a national drug inquiry there has been a series of meetings between the Commonwealth and the States at officer and ministerial level to settle the terms of reference and mode of operation of the inquiry and to discuss co-operation and co-ordination with the two existing drug inquiries in New South Wales and South Australia. Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia and Queensland have agreed to the establishment of a National Royal Commission and to the terms of reference of such a Commission. These four States have also indicated their wUlingness to give any legal support necessary for the establishment and operation of the National Royal Commission. Negotiations are still proceeding with New South Wales and South Australia. I was not prepared to have the announcement of the national inquiry held up further by those two States. The procedure wiU be that the Commonwealth will establish a Commonwealth Royal Commission and those States agreeing to support the National Royal Commission will take steps to appoint the Commonwealth Royal Commissioner to head identical inquiries under State legislation. The Government believes this to be a most important step as it is clear from all accounts that the drug problem extends right across Australia and is not confined to any one State. Because of this, the Government beUeves that a National Royal Commission is needed to investigate the total position. After the National Royal Commission has been established I feel sure that a workable relationship will be arrived at with the New South Wales and South Australian royal commissions. At least the Commonwealth will bend its efforts to achieve it. The Government has been very conscious of the need to minimise as much as possible any overlapping or dupUcation between the roles of the various commissions. To this end the terms of reference of the National Royal Commission have been adjusted to minimise any such overlapping, particularly with the South Australian inquiry. I table the proposed terms of reference which I believe represent a satisfactory and comprehensive basis for a national inquiry.",55
88,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,I seek leave to make a short statement on the same subject.,55
89,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",55
90,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"The Opposition welcomes the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and supports the estabUshment of a National Royal Commission. We are aware of some of the specific problems relating to two States which so far have not been able to agree completely with the terms of reference because of some minor difficulty, particularly in New South Wales which at present has a royal commission under way on specific matters. However, I am confident that all States will agree with what the Prime Minister has in mind. I would like the Prime Minister to consider whether the terms of reference should be extended to include consideration of criminal conduct arising from the use of narcotics, the treatment of offenders and the monetary considerations involved in trafficking in narcotics. The sums are substantial and it would be appropriate that the terms of reference be extended to cover those matters. I do not think anybody would have any objection to that. It is always thought advisable that the terms of reference contain some ambulatory clause to provide for the terms of reference to be extended in such ways as the Royal Commissioner may fromtimeto time advise. Honourable members will recall that I asked the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) whether the Commissioner of Taxation could assist any royal commission by providing information about people accumulating assets or having substantial funds which could well be related to Ulegal activities. In the case of drugs, particularly heroin, they could well be underworld activities. It is well known to people interested in the treatment of people addicted to drugs that in the main it is the young who are affected. Certainly they are the subject of attention from pushers and others who have a close association with the criminal element. This is a great problem and it is as yet unknown how best to treat offenders. Certainly incarceration is deemed not to be the right way to go about it. It is for those reasons and the fact that there is an increase in crime in the community, particularly the crime of breaking and entering, direcdy related to getting funds to buy narcotics that I think the terms of reference should be extended to cover the matters I have mentioned.",55
91,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"by leave- I wish to add to my but as we doabout remarks as a result of what the honourable memor inquiry intonotthehave ber for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) has Uament ought to be awareofofthe said. I welcome the support from the Opposition guarantee. Accordingly, because for this inquiry which the Government believes is of paramount importance. From the statement of challenged the Opposition it is clear that the whole ParUawould ment believes that this is a matter tance to the Australian community. Without within three sitting seeking to change the terms of reference specificaUy to cover the matters raised by the the honourable gentleman and as the delay in this suggested matter has come about because of the need to get there agreement from the States, although this has can been achieved to the extent which I have indithe cated, could I put on record and confirm to the quent Royal Commissioner that if need to extend the terms of reference in any and in thespace sense, shape or form the Commonwealth will reduce the time respond, approach the States and seek such an ting days which, extension of the terms of reference. That ought to months, to a period cover the matters raised by the gentleman and any other matters that might a parliament. Accordingly,beyond occur to the Royal Commissioner as his investigations. I hope that the House beUeves guaranteed over and aboveto the that to be a satisfactory way of proceeding. NON-GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS (LOANS GUARANTEE) BILL 1977 Consideration resumed.",56
92,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"In relation to clause 71 move: At the end of sub-clause (2) add', but, where such amount is prescribed, the Minister shall table details within three sitting days'. In his second reading speech the Minister for raised Education (Senator Carrick) said that the Bill the amounts Umits the amount to $ 10m in any one year. That is for that reason is so under clause 7(1). Clause 7 (2) guarantees ment on behalf of the that in any year after 31 December 1977 where the amount exceeds $10m the amount shall prescribed. That means that the Parliament eventuaUy would know what is the amount prescribed in excess of $ 10m. I think it is appropriate that the Parliament should be advised soon as that prescription takes place. It was the subject of comment in the Senate and I think the observation made by Senator Wright when discussing clause 11 of the Bill was particularly worth whUe. He said: The validity of a guarantee purporting to have been given shall not be called into question. In other words, he was doubting that the guarancould not be challenged. We do not want to be worried a challenge to the guarantee any legal supervision over validity guarantee, Parthe extent of the it cannot be it certainly should be noted. Clause 7 give us the chance to do that because if an of great imporMinisterinwould amount excess of $ 10m is to be prescribed, the merely table those prescriptions days. In answer to virtually same amendment in the Senate it was that under the Acts Interpretation Act would be a period of 15 sitting days. Mr Deputy Chairman, as you know 15 sitting days certainly take us over a period of months m Parliament because sittings are not as freas we might require to get 15 sitting days he beUeves there is a in a short of time. Accordingly, in my view view of the Opposition we ought to from the normal period of 15 sitas I say, could well extend into of three sitting days which honourable we think would not extend seven days of a parliament would a result of be very quickly informed as any amounts amounts specified in the Bill. We think it is good legislation if one can read it and clearly understand the monetary considerIn Committee ations involved. We can see that whilst the Bill is good to that extent the amounts will be increased by a prescription. Anybody reading the Bill will take be aware of the amount. A prescription could place and the Parliament would not be aware of it for some time afterwards. In a nut? higher shell, I am saying that 15 sitting days is not good of same enough. I suggest that three sitting days would be reasonable and adequate because the Parliament could then be informed and matters could be in the pubUc interest if it was thought that were going in the wrong direction. It that I have moved the amendOpposition. be Mr KEVIN CAIRNS (LUley) (8.11)-Clause 7 to which the amendment has been moved by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) is at the heart of the Bill. It as detaUs the amount of money in respect of which guarantees are to be given. If anything is to be found about the capital funds and the nature of the Bill, it is found in clause 7.1 suggest that amendment moved by the Opposition-withou t being unkind-is a fiddling amendment. The amount of money proposed for which a guaranGeelong tee may be appropriated is very small. After what is proposed is only a guarantee. There be a passage of no money whatsoever. So when one looks at the capital funds required and the gap which exists in the provision of capital for schools, one sees that an amendment such as field. this would inhibit the flexibility which a ment has in allowing an amount of more than SlOm to be guaranteed in any one year. That is extra an unnecessary and, I think, burdensome minded and restriction. Let me illustrate what I am saying. When looks at the capital funds spent on education the school level, not at the tertiary level, one that they are quite immense. For example, 1975-76, $383m was spent on capital funds school education in Australia. The amount which was available from public sources for nonschools government schools was $25m. This Bill proon poses to give a guarantee so that some of those schools can raise a loan which they have to back with the advantage of having a guarantee. The guarantee might enable such a school to go to a better institution to gain a loan at a lower interest rate. A school might decide not to building society or a financial corporation. may be able to go to a bank and get the better terms which are appropriate to a bank. If guarantee which is to be given slips over $10m without the passage of money the Opposition would require an immediate accountability. lieve that that is a fiddling, unnecessary restriction. For example, let us look at the States' role this matter. The honourable member Kingsford-Smith is a broad-minded and fair minded man. He was sympathetic to the general measure designed to be satisfied by this Bill. immediately give him all those virtues. I hope will count them as virtues. One or two facts needState to be indicated so that any extra amount of assistance which may be given can be seen in >erspective. In 1975-76, according to calcucapital ! ations that I have done of the Government's contribution towards capital expenditure schools in Australia, State governments gave $260m to government schools but to nongovernment schools they gave only an interest concession of $2.6m. That is $1 for every $100 spent on capital expenditure was given to nontalking government schools. This could involve a Uttle the school in the electorate of the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman). We are not talking about the Melbourne Grammar School or the Grammar School. We are not talking all, about the Kings School which is not very far may from where the honourable member Uves. We are talking about the Blacktown Convent or some school Uke that. Such schools get $1 out of funds every $100 spent by State governments in this governIf the Commonwealth Government sUps in an guarantee over $ 10m let us be fair and not measure immediately what is done. Let us be fair open minded about the matter. The Commonwealth Government is more generous. Often it has to pick up the tab for what State one governments do not do. In 1975-76 the Comat monwealth Government gave $ 123m directly for sees capital expenditure on government schools and in $22m for non-government schools. So out of a for total of $383m non-government got nearly $25m. The parents of chUdren attending these are not wealthy people. They are people average award wages. The father is on an average award wage with a wife and a few chUpay dren. The question is: How much do we expect them to contribute out of each week's take-home pay in order to buUd a new classroom at the local school? The school might be Blackheath College go to a in TownsvUle. It might be one of the Bush It Brothers schools which exist in some parts of Queensland. It might be the Cunnamulla Conthe vent. How much extra do honourable members opposite expect the parents to pay? In order to assist such schools we might say: 'We wiU sUp in I bea guarantee that year of not $10m but $llm. You pay the interest and the principal but we will guarantee you'. Are honourable members opposite going to try to monitor that amount and to check for every doUar which is spent? The situin ation has to be looked at against the background for under which we operate. I come to 1976-77. My calculations might be I slightly out but they are of the correct order. In he 1976-77 the State governments' contribution to schools for capital expenditure- I am only talking about capital expenditure-wa s $309m. State governments' contributions in that year for expenditure towards non-government schools was about $2.7m or $2.8m. Let us look at on the gap. The Commonwealth Government has been fairer. It has been more generous. It gave $124m for government schools directly and about $24.5m for non-government schools. When we look at the total we see that we are not aboutrichpeople and the wealthy of this country. We are not talking about people whose only fear of a taxation system is that somebody might bring in a capital gains tax. We are talking about ordinary people who send their kids to non-government schools. They are not the wealthy schools of this nation. I suggest to honourable members opposite that any measure which gives a Utile bit of leeway in order to make up a modicum of the gap in terms of the guarantee should not be looked at askance. We should not look with a jaundiced eye at the proposal. After aU, in this area-this has to be borne in mind-the Commonwealth has to distort its contribution in order to make up for what the State governments are not doing. If anybody is mean in this area it is the State governments. They do not have a good record. They have a very poor record-1 do not desire to introduce politics into the matter. Mr Martyr-Do not do that!",56
93,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"No , I will not. I acment knowledge immediately the sense and the bUity of the honourable member for Kingsford Smith. The worse governments in Australia happen to be located in South Australia and New South Wales. Tasmania has slipped out from breaking having the worse government; it is on a par with cation funding. some of the others. So you will appreciate immediately, Mr Deputy Chairman, the argument that I am putGovernment ting. Let us be a little bit magnanimous in relafor tion to this matter and let us not be pennyand pinching. We should not allow ourselves to appear to be mean. I know that the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith has moved this amendment only because it was proposed in the Senate and he has to do it. It has been proposed in the Senate and out of loyalty he has to put proposition forward. I simply ask that it be sidered in the context of the total situation. The total situation of these schools has deteriorated; it is worse today than it was five, six or seven years ago. Most of these schools have the lowest measurable physical standards in Australia. That is no reflection on them; it is a fact of life. So, of a sense of fairness and out of a sense ofjustice, I say that an amendment such as that proposed would deprive these schools of some smaU say amount of assistance which could be given under discretion, and the amendment ought to be rejected.",58
94,Mr JAMES,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"The Committee is considering the Non-Government Schools (Loans Guarantee) Bill. I want to express only my opinions but also the fears of many people in the Newcastle region in relation restrictions imposed on government financial assistance to pubUc schools and to university institutions will affect the new School of Medicine at Newcastle. As you wiU be well aware, Mr Deputy Chairman, for many years- I believe it still is-the Newcastle region has been the industrial heart of Australia. That estimation is calculated on the volume of shipping that goes out of the Newcastle Harbour. For many years the people of Newcastle thought that they were being deprived of a medical faculty at the Newcasde University. They recendy acquired one. Now we find under this Bill that the development of the Newcasde School of Medicine which is in its early stages is to be restricted. The establishment of that school was important not only to the people in the region but also to the people of Australia generally, because we are aU aware of the shortage of people trained in medicine in Australia. The Flinders School of Medicine in Melbourne and the Graduate School of Manageat the University of New South Wales will sensibe simUarly affected by the legislation. The Government has come in for severe criticism from different sectors of the community for its promise in connection with eduWe should all be aware that the Minister for Education (Senator Carrick) in another place in November 1976 committed the to a 2 per cent real growth in funds universities, colleges of advanced education schools in the 1977-78 and 1978-79 financial years. It appears to me that the Government has decided to ignore that promise, just as it has ignored so many other promises, by holding spending on the pubUc education system to the 1976-77 levels in real terms, despite greatiy the increased enrolments. Despite what the honourconable member for LUley (Mr Kevin Cairns) says, only those private schools in the top two Schools Commission categories-that is, those whose need is least-wU l receive increased Federal assistance in thisfinancialyear. The Government's decisions strike at the fundamental goal of our out society, namely, equality of educational opportunity, a goal which successive Labor and Liberal governments have striven to achieve. I can that the Labor Party wiU continue to oppose these decisions in the strongest possible terms and will seek to maintain the independence of schools and university commissions established by the Labor Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam.",58

98,Mr JAMES,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"The amendment moved by the provisions honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) is supported by the Opposition because we believe that the Government has betrayed the people by not maintaining the 2 cent growth in educational funds which it said would. It came in for severe criticism in an articlecurity which appeared in the Melbourne Age of 30 June for not pursuing those things which it had promised. It came in for similar criticism in a let-has ter written by Professor Niland, President of Federation of Australian University ations. As I understand it, he has no leanings towards any particular political party, but he points out in a three-page letter written to members on 3 June the unfair actions of the cent Government in breaking its promises in connecenrol tion with education funding. I support wholeheartedly the amendment of moved by the honourable member for students Kingsford Smith. I hope that the Government will give consideration to accepting the amending ment and therefore somewhat retrieve some of the face which it has lost as a result of betraying its promise to the people not so long field of education.",59
99,Mr CORBETT,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY," I think can assure the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) that neither this Bill nor this amend-way ment will affect any medical schools in Newcasvery tle, in Melbourne or in any other place about which he spoke. The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) spoke of the massive funding needs of education. One the reasons why those massive needs exist is the Labor Government in its last Budget reduced spending on schools by some $44m. Naturally that had a bearing on the existing massive needs in the field of education. The Government is endeavouring to cope with that situadon in Bill. The amendment which has been moved by the Opposition will not make any major saved. difference to the Bill at all, except perhaps, honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) said-it is a very minor thing-that have an adverse or disadvantageous effect, if effect at all, on the operation of the Bill. If Opposition wanted to move an amendment at all I should have thought that such an amendment would have been beneficial rather than disadto the schools system in this country. for The Bill is aimed at promoting the Government's objective of ensuring the best possible your educational standards for all Australian chUwhether they attend government or nongovernment schools. The implementation of the of the Bill will not cost the taxpayer money; it will provide some assistance to nongovernment schools by way of government guaranteed loans, which will allow them to per obtain better loan conditions. That should be a itforegone conclusion. Surely there is no better sethan a government backed loan. Despite the fact that it has been claimed that these schools have not been in financial trouble, it still to be said that there is nothing better than a the government guaranteed loan, and that is what Staff Associthe Bill is aimmg to achieve. One reason for the Commonwealth Government aiming to provide this extra benefit is that all non-government schools educate some 20 per of our school population. If they continue to a shrinking proportion of the student population, as they have done in recent years, because a lack of facUities to absorb students, those are pushed into government schools, which causes very real pressures and overcrowdand which is costing the taxpayer substantially more money. So I feel that the Bill should be accepted in its original form, and the amendago in the ment should be rejected. There is an urgent necessity for the Federal we Government to ease pressures on government schools and non-government schools. This is one in which the Government is doing it, at a minimal cost, if any, to the taxpayer. At the present it costs the taxpayer an average of $765 to maintain a pupU in a government primary school, and $1,255 to maintain a pupil in a of government secondary school. The cost to the that Australian taxpayer of maintaining the extra students who could have been in non-government schools if accommodation had been avaUable to them would be about $19m. The cost to the taxpayer of maintaining these students in the non-government schools would be only about half of that amount. Some $9m would have been It could have provided benefits for the as the educational system generally. Savings of such magnitude could be used to good advantage in it maywidening the government school program, for any example. Freedom of choice would be preserved. the Everyone would benefit. That is what we want to do. That is what the Government is aiming to do. In July 1976 the Schools Commission, in its report, noted that there was 'a marked gap between the resources available to government schools and non-government schools'. This Bill tries to close that gap to some extent. The Commission also stated: When in addition it is noted that in 1977 there can be no non-government significant increase in the Commonwealth contribution that government school resource levels are continuing it is obvious that the gap between government and government schools is likely to increase. So there is an urgent need to do what we can. This is one way of assisting the non-government schools, without disadvantaging anybody. During the three-year period 1974-76, some 60 noncost government schools closed! That is a demonguarantee. stration of the need for this Bill to go through guarantee isThe without amendment. Included in that figure 10 closures of schools in the top category, called wealthy schools. So there is very great pressure on these schools. If we are to maintain the policy on which this Government was elected- a dual system of education-w e must honour that responsibUity. This is one way which we can contribute in some small way to schools honouring that obligation. If members of the Opalleviated, position do not want to be a part of it, so be it; could that is up to them. In 1970 the Liberal-Country Party Governeducation ment introduced the principle of direct continue Commonwealth per capita grants for nonthis government schools. In 1972 the then Minister for Education, Mr Malcolm Fraser, indicated the Mr LES JOHNSON Government's intention to establish the principle Non-government that in future the grants would represent 20 per Bill cent of the running cost per schools, to be matched by a simUar grant at the might appear tohas State level. That is a policy which we want to think will be accepteda by maintain. I believe it is a policy which everybody ing the objective of good should be prepared to maintain, in Ught of the fact that this dual system of education certainly is keeping. accepted by the Government. This policy has has been frequently restated by the coaUuon parties speech and was restated in the 1975 election campaign. other legislation. Sometimes the Government has been accused of not accepting the recommendations of the Schools Commission. Let me say that in a debate on an education Bill it has been stated that Commission should have complete control and that the Government should do everything the Commission recommends; its recommendations should be accepted by the Government without question. Then I ask: Why not have commissions to run everything? We would not need a governundertaking ment at all if it did not have a right to oversee situation in regard to the economy of this country. We must look at that aspect as well, although we endeavour, within the Umits of the finances avaUable and within sound economic management, to accede to the recommendations of the Commission. The Government has adopted the poUcy recommended by the Schools Commission of linking automaticaUy grants to schools to per pupU expendiand ture m government schools. In tnis way we are to rise helping those schools in a minimal way but in a most nonway which I am sure they would welcome. In 1978 it is expected to provide about $8m in additional funds to non-government schools, from which all those schools would benefit. Tonight we are debating a Bill which will not the taxpayer any funds. All it provides is a guarantee should be given. The were to obtain funds at the non-government to enable maximum schools advantage. I the soemphasise that maintaining the percentage of the population in non-government schools is to the advantage of all students in this country. I have known of one or two cases in which nongovernment schools have had to close recently, in and there has been overcrowding in the state as a result of that. No doubt that will be but it will be alleviated at cost. If we have maintained these schools in operation it would have been of general benefit to as a whole and would have allowed to the dual system of education to which Government is unequivocally committed. (Hughes) (8.36)-The Schools (Loans Guarantee) is, in many respects, non-controversial. The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr pupU m government Lionel Bowen) moved his amendment which be pedanticism but which I members as representgovernment houseI listened to my friend the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett). I think he the lizard by the taU. He made a far-reaching which would be appropriate on some In many respects he has missed the point. I do not want to canvass much of what he said. If I could say, merely as an aside, he knows as well as I do that the Labor Govern the ment 's reputation in education is beyond reproach. The allocation of funds for education purposes after the election of a Labor goverament trebled. The concern of educationists in Australia at present is to the effect that the Government has faUed to honour its election that it would maintain a one per the cent growth factor in education. I will leave the General question of education at that. I do not beeve that people consider that this is the year to expand enormously expenditure on education, but I believe that a fair thing to do in this year curtailment and restriction is to maintain per cent growth factor. In respect of this legislation let me say, as I started off saying, that it is not a matter of controosition versy at all. The honourable member for certainly to prescribed Kingsford-Smith made it perfectly clear that the the Government has the support of the Opposition which is abroad at this pre-election so far as the general principles of this legislation jettisons the concept of good housekeeping are concerned. The honourable member for have Maranoa is old enough in years if not in parliasuggest mentary service to know that the forerunner to this legislation was other legislation cerned guarantees or which concerned the Commonwealth acting as a guarantor in regard to non-government schools m the Australian Capiment. tal Territory. The principle has been carried into the States. When that legislation was before the Parliament at that time it had the support the then Labor Opposition. It has had support this unqualified way from that time on. no point in trying to make poltiical rnileage out of this matter. Pontics should not be introduced. and Most people in Australia hope that we have put repayment the issue of non-government education beyond the realms of poUtics. The Labor Party helped to do that many years ago. I am a Uttle surprised amounts that the honourable member for Maranoa has tried to resurrect that issue tonight, to open old sore and to divide the Australian community. The matter has been settled. People are generask ally placated. To try to divide the Australian community is no way to operate in regard to a matter that concerns the well-being of young Australians. The concern of the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith at this time of deficit is to ensure that there is good housekeeping. In another place there was a proposition to the shall effect that there should be an accounting to the Parliament after 15 days have elapsed. A substantial number of senators who I believe represented the various political emphases in other place took the view that that should be done. After all, we are talking about a matter which could mean the Australian Government becoming the lender of the last government education area. Mr Corbett-What is wrong with that?",59
100,Mr LES JOHNSON,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"The honourable ordination gentleman said: 'What is wrong with that?' is suggesting to the Committee tonight that a reof sponsible parUament and a responsible governa one ment should underwrite anything to an unhmited extent that is the height of irresponsibUity. The people who will be the beneficiaries of this proposal would not put forward such a propfor a soUtary moment. In many situations governments are the lenders of last resort but limitations. I suggest to honourable member that the recklessness time which will its sequel and its consequence. I seriously to the honourable member that he ought to have regard for the fact that he is dealing with which conthe taxpayers' money. No deprivation is proposed in this amendThis was the point raised by the honouron able member for LUley (Mr Kevin Cairns). The fact of the matter is that there ought to be proper of co-ordination about the whole matter. I remmd in the Committee that we are discussing an amend There is ment to clause 7 which states: (1) Guarantees given after the commencement of this Act not later than 31 December 1977 shall not guarantee the of amounts exceeding in the aggregate $ 10m. (2) Guarantees given in any year commencing after 31 December 1977 shall not guarantee the repayment of exceeding in the aggregate $10m or such higher amount as is prescnbed in respect of that year. up an I emphasise those last words 'or such higher amount as is prescribed in respect of that year'. I the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) who represents the Minister for Education (Senator Carrick) to what extent he anticipates that there may be a higher amount? Might it be $20m, $30m, $40m, or $50m? What would such higher amount be related to? The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith has simply proposed an amendment. It is in precise terms. financing He wants to add these words: but, where such higher amount is prescribed, the Minister table details of same within three sitting days. We are not worried about the recess period. The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith is the simply putting the point that when the Parliament meets, its members and the people of this country should have therightto know precisely the extent to which this aUowance of $ 10m has resort in the nonbeen exceeded. As I have mentioned, it is possible in terms of clause 7 of the Bill that the amount might be exceeded. It is as fundamental as that. I ask the Minister to say that if, it is not the case that it can be exceeded, he will give a guarantee that the coand organisation will be such that no If he more than $ 10m will be guaranteed.",61
101,Mr HODGMAN,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,You ought to be a pawnbroker.,62
102,Mr LES JOHNSON,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"The honourable Partycame gentleman makes some lewd interjection. I did Bill not hear what he said but if it was in keeping with his usual interjections one could describe as lewd. Does he regard the Parliament of this nation as being responsible for the taxpayers' ment, affairs? Is it reasonable to know the extent to such asthere which the provisions of legislation are exceeded? Why is the proposition put forward by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith regarded as unreasonable? I put it to the Governschools ment that it ought to face the facts wants the amount guaranteed to be $20m or $50m, it should put that in the legislation. not want to engage in any sleight want the Government to put things on the surface. The Opposition is anxious to ensure that this legislation will operate smoothly and effecfigures. tively so that non-government schools can benefit.",62
103,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY, them Order! The honourable member's time has exceeded expired.,62
104,Mr HODGMAN,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"I am bitlar terly disappointed that the Labor Party has chosen to hinder and to restrain with cratic red tape the actions and discretions of the Minister for Education (Senator Carrick) who will have the honour of administering this magthis nificent piece of legislation. On the one hand, the Labor Party says that it supports the legislation and welcomes it. On the other hand, it endeavrespect ours to encumber with pettifogging red tape a schools. Minister who might find that, at the end of the prescribed period, he has gone a few dollars $10m in helping the non-government schools of Australia. What a terrible crime that would be! should be deUghted if the figure was $110m. For the Labor Party, on the one hand, to say that supports the legislation and, on the other hand, to put forward such a mingy and miserable amendment as this, brought into this chamber doubt on the instructions of those above because the same amendment was brought forward in another place, quite frankly does a disservice the legislation. I noted with interest the remarks of the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les wealth Johnson), one of the great thespians of the Parliament. In a stirring speech a few moments ago, he urged support for the legislation and that the Opposition would like it on the statute books as soon as possible. Yet, out of loyalty doubt, he felt it was his duty to support colleague, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen). The Labor seems to have overlooked the fact that this into the Parliament as the direct result of a recommendation to the Federal Government by the Schools Commission. I simply draw it attention to the fact that nowhere did the Schools Commission seem to indicate that, in its judgwas any necessity for an amendment this. In reaUty I ask why on earth the Labor Party thinks it is so necessary for the Parliament to know within three sitting days what have been given permission to borrow of life. If it guarantee hasamount and by what the Federal Government's exceeded the $ 10m Umit? We do Mr Kevin Cairns-Because it is going to be of hand. We given the loan.",62
105,Mr HODGMAN,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"Of course it has been guaranteed the loan but it wants to have the Why does the Labor Party want them? I hope the Labor Party does not want them for a mischievous purpose. I hope it does not want to be able to stand up and say in the Parliament that the amount of $10m has been by a certain amount and that loans were guaranteed in particular schools in particuelectorates. I hope it does not want it for that purpose. What really is the need for this amendbureaument? The Commonwealth Government's record in relation to capital grants or the guaranteeing of loans for non-government schools-and is brand new legislation-is not as good as it ought to be but it is considerably better than the terrible record of the State governments with to capital grants for non-government over In opposing the amendment moved by the Opposition I want to say that the essence of this Ilegislation is to provide a brand new faciUty to the non-government schools of Australia; that is, it that the Commonwealth will guarantee loans to enable them to carry out budding and to meet their commitments. It does not seem to worry nomembers of Her Majesty's Opposition, members of the Labor Party that one out of everyfivechUdren, of aU the boys and girls of Australia, is to today being educated at non-government schools. The Opposition does not seem to think that any restraint, any restriction, any bureaucratic red tape which wiU make the Commongovernment less able to give guarantee assistance to a much needed sector of the community is bad. In the case of this Bill we are talksaid ing about guaranteeing the non-government school sector $10m. That is all. The moment that no figure is exceeded the Labor Party wants to know his of it within three sitting days. In my opinion this legislation does three things which are unique and which I believe are comco-operate mendable. It wdl give schools which do not have the advantage of msdtudonal backing an opporhonourable tunity to borrow money. For thefirsttimein this country schools which do not have what I would describe as wealthy institutional backing will able to borrow. In anybody's language that is move towards providing great social justice. ondly, this Bill will permit more favourable borin rowing terms to be negotiated. The honourable member for Hughes said a short the Commonwealth Government is becoming the lender of last resort. He meant to say that it becoming the guarantor of last resort. That would have been correct. But it is surprising me that he said it in such a disparaging way. I not regard this as disparaging. I think the monwealth Government ought to be congratuGovernment lated for doing so. Thirdly, the loan guarantees will be available for projects which while proved in principle by the Commonwealth may not in fact receive a grant. They may not be titled to a grant. Even though there may be no entitlement the Commonwealth might be able to assist by guaranteeing the loan. What will be practical effect of this? It will mean that the which the Commonwealth made available in the financial year 1976-77 in fact will potentially extended by 33W per cent. The avadability of the additional $10m guaranteed loans is tantamount to a 33 Vs per cent availabiUty of capital.",62
106,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,You had better sit down. You are spoiling a good debate.,63
107,Mr HODGMAN,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"Well , the honourable Kingsford-Smith, member for Kingsford-Smith",63
108,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,You are making a farce common ofit.,63
109,Mr HODGMAN,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"I beg the honourable memit ber's pardon. With respect he made a farce of the debate. He was hypocritical enough to come ParliamentIn in here and say that he and the Labor Party supParliament and ported the legislation but then put up an amendment which is going to make its passage difficult. The contribution of the States is only 10 per cent pointed of that of the Commonwealth. That is only Hughes (Mr Les $2.7m. In real terms this legislation will mean position, the amendment that $34.7m will be available from the Commonwealth by grants and guaranteed loans. I say conclusion that the amendment is bad. It is petinto tyfogging and bureaucratic and in good faith. I say further that the States should amendment. really honour their obligations to the nongovernment schools. At least they should follow the lead shown by this Government. I hope that by thistimenext year the States will recognise that if they do not come to the party and really with the capital costs of non-government schools we will reach the crisis which the member for Lilley predicted and within the next few years we will not have the availability of educational facilities in the nonbe government school sector which this country, in a my opinion, should be committed to retain. One Secout offiveAustralian children is being educated that system. If the non-government school system collapses the education system of Australia time ago that goes down with it.",63
110,Mr VINER,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY," I only wish to reply shortly in respect of the amendment moved by the honourto able member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel do Bowen). I point out that, as happened in the SenComate, the amendment is not acceptable to the notwithstanding the slight change in the wording of the amendment moved by the aphonourable member. As pointed out in the other place by the Minister for Education (Senator enCarrick), the Government shares the concern of the Opposition that it should not be possible for governments to act without the knowledge of the the Opposition, indeed not without the knowledge of $24m all members of the Parliament, both in this House and in the other place. Hence what the beGovernment has provided for in the Bill is that if the upper limit of $10m is to be increased, for example by reason of inflation or any other circumstances, so as to allow a higher level of guarantees to be given by the Government, this would be done by regulation. As has already been pointed out by the honourable member for under the Acts Interpretation Act such a regulation has to be tabled in both Houses of Parliament. On being tabled, as is the practice, notice is given of the Government's intention. If the Opposition is so minded can move to disallow the regulation. other words, ample notice is given to the ample opportunity is given to the to disallow a regulation introduced by the Government. Therefore, as has been out from this side, and as was really foreshadowed by the honourable member for Johnson) on behalf of the Opis both pettyfogging in and pedantic. It does not need to be introduced the legislation in order to afford the protecit was not moved the ofGovernment tion parliamentary scrutiny. For that reason does not accept the",63
111,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"This has been a wide-ranging debate on a matter which is purely technical. The question is whether the Government should have 15 days in which to table what has been prescribed or, in accordance with my amendment, three days. As a result of my moving that amendment it has been suggested that all sorts of dire consequences will happen in regard to this Bill. I emphasised that this was a technical point. I want to place something on the record for the benefit of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett). If the Labor Government had adopted the allocation of education funds as provided for in the last MCMahon Government in respect of the 1972-75 triennium the result would have been an allocation of one-quarter of the amount that the Labor Party provided. Yet the honourable member had the audacity to get up here and say that this Government is going to give so much more. It is giving a paltry $400m as against $ 1,800m. Now the Government has the audacity to say that it will give a paltry 20 per cent to children who might need 80 per cent. Mr Corbett-Why did you reduce it by $44m?",63
112,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"That was a relatively small reduction when compared with what was provided. Our program provided for $ 1,800m as against this Government's program of $400m. This Government is providing 20 per cent for a child who might need 80 per cent or 100 per cent, yet honourable members opposite stand up here as Australians and talk about education. They are limited to money and could not care less. The point I want to make relates to what was said by the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman). Clause 7(1) of this Bill limits the amount to $10m. He says that that is a paltry amount. The limitation was put in the Bill by the Government, not by me. In the course of my oration I clearly said that non-government schools in New South Wales alone need $42m. They are to get nothing under this Bill except the promise of a mortgage. Nothing else. They will get no money. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) spoke in all honesty and was the only honourable member on the Government side who spoke to the amendment. The amount prescribed will be tabled. Mr Kevin Cairns- I spoke to the amendment.",64
113,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"I meant that he spoke to it in technical terms. The honourable member for Lilley spoke in emotional terms. Clause 7 (2) of the Bill refers to the amount prescribed and says that after this year the Government will limit it to $ 10m a year. That reduces to ruin all the Government's arguments notGuarantees about the Opposition being pennypinching. The Bill itself contains that limitation put in the Bill by me. The Government says that if greater amounts are prescribed it will let the Opposition know. We have no objection to that. But we said that we would like to have that knowledge within a specified time. That is reasonable but apparently the Government objects and says that we are not going to have it. All we want to know is: What is the prescription? This is dependent upon the budgetary position. We want to know what the Government is prescribing because we might think that it should be prescribing more. If the Governmentfindsit important and valid to say that there shall be a limitation of $ 10m and puts that into the Bill, why will it not give the Parhament the knowledge that, if at a later period the Government thought that the amount should be more, it would tell the Parliament within a reasonable time? The only argument used-the Minister has used it here now-is that the Government will tell the Parliament within 15 sitting days. If it is going to prescribe an amount for guarantee",64
114,Mr VINER,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,That is not technically correct. I think you will find that you have 15 sitting days within which to disaUow.,64
115,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"Yes, but you have to table it.",64
116,Mr VINER,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,That is right.,64
117,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"Excuse me, Mr Chairman, I am not being discourteous. We want to know what are the Government's programs for guarantee. We would Uke to think that they could be $50m, but the Government will not do what we ask. The position is that the Government will eventually tell us and when the regulation is tabled we can disaUow it. Can honourable members imagine anything moreridiculous?The Government will eventuaUy do something by way of regulation, table the regulation and then we can go through the nonsense of disallowing it. That is the Minister's proposition, not mine. Is it not fair to say that when the Government has made up its mind at Treasury level as to what it is going to guarantee, it should teU the Parliament and do so within three sitting days? That is a normaltime.The Government has done it in a Bill in one day. It wrote in $10m and said: 'No more. There is a Umitation.'",64
118,Mr HODGMAN,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,O r such higher amount.,64
119,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"No. So that the to be honourable member for Denison can absorb this let me read what clause 7(1) says: given after the commencement of this Act and later than 31 December 1977 shall not guarantee the repayment of amounts exceeding in the aggregate and it was not $10,000,000. Sub-clause (2) refers to guarantees given in any year after that year. So the limitation is $10m after this year it shall not exceed $10m prescribed in respect of a subsequent year-no t this year. That is the point.",64
120,Mr HODGMAN,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,You are in a bad mood.,65
121,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"I am not in a bad adopted. mood. The point I want to get through to honourable members opposite is that the Government should table this regulation within three days. All that the Government that the Opposition can disallow it as and when the Government tables it under the Acts Interpretation Act. It is as simple as that. It is for that reason that the Opposition rejects the argument that we should rely on the Acts InterpretaConsideration tion Act. We want the Government the Bill that if it is going to increase the amount, as it is entitled to do and which we would plaud, it should tell us.",65
122,Mr VINER,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,But you know immediately the regulation has been passed.,65
123,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"But if we know immediately the regulation has been passed the ChairmanGovernment may not tell us when it is going to promulgate that regulation. I will not go into a further debate, but once a decision",65
124,Mr VINER,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,Because you are wrong.,65
125,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"No, we are not Estimates, wrong. Within three sitting days the Parliament could be informed of the promulgation. A dechanging cision could be made and nothing could happen in the Parliament for a long period. For instance, if it were informed the day before the House went into recess or something of that nature would not be given any chance to talk about the matter for three or four months. That is the ition we want to avoid. It is for that reason that we are trying to put a time limit on when the Government would give us the information.",65
126,Mr VINER,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"For the benefit of the Committee and for the benefit of the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) I refer to section 48 in Part XII of the Acts Interpretahours tion Act which covers the requirements for notification of regulations.

I wonder whether we will ever reach the stage when honourable members will be given the oportunity to participate in the Estimates from the we eginning. There must be hundreds of public servants of relatively lowly rank in this city who poshave had an input into this document which is denied to the people who are answerable for it. I suggest that at some stage we should get around to having a real examination by the Committee of Inquiry into the Parliamentary Committee System. Here we are tonight talking about history and not making any of it. Decisions are already made.

Mr Martyr-B e careful of your syntax. from the date Mr BRYANT-I propose to mention just a few in things contained in the estimates. My friend, the honourable member for Swan, is an avid the makattender in this House. I take it that he is a refugee from his constituents and that it is not safe for him to go outside. The estimates cover the Governor General's Office. It is time that the Parliament considered the matter of the Executive Council. During the golden days when the Austrahan Labor Party was conducting the affairs of this country I gave some consideration to the question of the Executive Council because it fulfils a very important function. I was not happy with the system. That is not a reflection upon anybody in it or upon the people who participate in it. Two Ministers would go out to the Governor General's mansion and consider the matters, with proper decorum and proper dedication. They would then come away. Other Ministers might well not know what had happened.",65

130,Mr BRYANT,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"That is not quite the case. Everybody knows what happened then. The honourable member for Denison should listen for a moment because by some aberration he might eventually end up a Minister, although it is unlikely because he will not be here long enough. I asked whether I could have a copy of the minutes of one of the meetings which had been held and which I did not attend. I was told that I could not have them. I did not have time to argue about it because there were other things to do. Mr Martyr-You should have received a piece of paper.",66
131,Mr BRYANT,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"This is an important matter I am putting before the Committee. I am one of those who participated in this. I asked whether I could have a copy of the rules of Executive Council. I was told that there were only two. I asked what they were and was told that with the Governor General present two people constituted a quorum and with the Governor General absent three were required and the Governor General would sign the papers later. I asked when those rules were made and was advised that they were made at the first meeting of Executive Council in 1901. As far as I can tell, no one has got around to considering the matter since then. I merely place that on the record because I want to refer to other matters also. The Government ought to have proceeded with permitting the National Gallery to purchase Grand Nu and items such as that. I do not want to take up the time of the Committee; I just want to place that on the record. I think the Minister at the table, the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Staley), had an attitude on that matter. I do not claim to be an expert but Australia must develop an effective collection of modern art. I raise this matter merely to indicate the difficulties we face. Another matter to which I refer is the NorthWest One Stop Welfare Centre in my electorate. I am glad that the Government has seenfitto continue to fund this Centre. I hope it will continue to do so. It is an operation in which the Commonwealth Government, the State Government and the municipal council are involved. I want to raise the matter of the funding of some of the Government's most important instrumentaUties. I have time only to mention them. For instance, the National Library, which falls within the responsibUity of the Department of Administrative Services, last year received an allocation of $ 12.76m and this year will receive an aUocation of $ 13.1m, a rise of 3 per cent at a time when inflation is running at about 10 per cent. CeUings are imposed upon the staff of the National Library, which make it impossible for the Library to operate effectively. It is one of the most important cultural institutions in the country. It is carrying out work associated with the collection and dissemination of material and making that material accessible with the aid of computer systems and so on. This work can be performed only by the Library staff. I refer now to the situation with respect to Norfolk Island. One of the administrative aberrations of which this Government has been guUty was to shift the administration of Norfolk Island from the Department of the Capital Territory. I thought we were in error in continuing the administration of Cocos Island and Christmas Island under the Department of Services and Property, as I think it was called, or the Special Minister of State. As I see it Norfolk Island, Cocos Island and Christmas Island are exercises in government. The Australian Government has only two departments of government, namely, the Department of the Northern Territory and the Department of the Capital Territory. They directly govern people; they have that expertise. None of the other government departments do so in the same way. So Norfolk Island, Cocos Island and Christmas Island ought to come within one of those portfolios, whichever is preferred. I want to raise with the Parliament the matter of the status of Norfolk Island. The Nimmo report, which was produced as a result of the appointment of Sir John Nimmo as a royal commissioner, laid down a whole pattern of recommendations. I am afraid that the people of Norfolk have been dealt with in a rather heavy handed way. Mr Haslem-That is quite right.",66
132,Mr BRYANT,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"I am not accustomed to agreement from honourable members opposite. The Norfolk Island community is a special community. It comprises about 1,700 regular inhabitants, of whom some 400 or 500 are direct descendants of the Pitcairn Islanders. There is a handful of very wealthy people who in many respects are able to carry the day when it comes to creating public opinion. The community lives on a knife's edge of insecurity as far as its economy is concerned. A simple change in our customs regulations could perhaps put them out of business. But Norfolk Island costs Australia hardly anything. We are spending $288,000 on the restoration of buddings in the nauonai interest. We are doing this on our own account and not for the Norfolk Islanders. It is costing $126,000 for Norfolk Island, $502,000 for Cocos Island and $2.4m for Christmas Island. Somehow we have to find a formula by which the people of Norfolk Island can be integrated with but not assimilated into the Australian system. They are quite neurotic about the tax system. In fact, most of the Norfolk Islanders would be better off if they were brought under our tax system and had avaUable to them the general services avaUable to the Australian community. I do not think the situation has changed dramaticaUy in the past 12 months but I know that they used to maintain their school and their hospital and were responsible for aU capital works. If the honourable member for Swan wants to see a properly independent school he should look at the Norfolk Island public school because I think it is the only one in the system which makes no demand on the Australian electorate. In fact, that school is totaUy independent. As far as I know it receives no funds from the Government. It might have done so in the past 12 months but certainly before then it received no funds from the Australian taxation system. Of course, unless the Norfolk Islanders have some special relationship with us they do not receive social security benefits. When the chUdren reach fourth form and can go no further at that school most of them do not quaUfy for funds made avaUable to isolated chUdren. I hope that we will start to treat these people with special respect and that the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers) will make himself appear to be a Uttle more sympathetic, although I reaUse that he does not seem to have sympathetic nerve. Mr Haslem-He has a hard heart.",67
133,Mr BRYANT,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"I had not noticed that he had a heart at aU but something must make him tick. Another thing to which he might give some consideration is the total inadequacy of services made avaUable to Federal members. I merely place these matters on record, to fulfil my duty to members and to other people around the place. I hope that honourable members will start to apply themselves to this matter when deaUng with the Estimates and wUlfindsome machinery by which we can have some input at the beginning of the system rather than when it is signed, sealed and deUvered.",67
134,Mr HAMER,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY," I should Uke to focus attention on an area which we do not often notice very much except in dramatic cases, that is, what the Federal Government is doing about the arts. I do this with some trepidation because I fear that if I draw attention to what is being done some honourable members opposite will start to oppose it. But I think it is important that we know what is being done and the value of it. If we look at the Estimates we see that we are spending $4.2m on acquisitions for the National Gallery. I should Uke to make it quite clear that this does not cover the capital cost of the GaUery but only acquisitions for the collection. There is an allocation of $23.7m to the Australia Council, which is primarily concerned with the performing arts; $3.4m to the Australian FUm and Television School; and $9.7m to the Australian FUm Commission. I think these allocations are admirable. What is good about them is that they represent in the performing arts in i >articular about a 10 per cent increase on the alocations in the previousfinancialyear. In the arts this is most important because of aU forms of employment the performing arts are the most labour intensive. If government grants do not move roughly in Une with the movement in average weekly earnings what we are achieving in the arts will inevitably lag. In addition to this, in the past year we have achieved important reforms. The restructuring of the Australia Council to make it more efficient and more economical and the establishment of the Community Arts School to involve the community in what is going on in the arts have both been important advances. In a differentfield,the report by the Myer Foundation on how private enterprise might support the arts is of real importance. It is a great mistake for the arts to be too dependent on single patrons such as the Government. The more they can spread their patrons the better the art form will be and the Myer Foundation's report is an important step forward in that area. I have a couple of suggestions to make and I am delighted to see that the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in the Arts (Mr Staley) is present in the chamber to receive those suggestions. The first is about the Australian National Gallery. The proposed purchase of the painting Grand Nu for something like $lm has been a subject of great criticism in recent months. I can understand why the Government felt obhged to reject its purchase at a time when throughout Government enterprises and activities the Government was imposing restraint. It would have been grossly misrepresented had a government instrumentahty, the Nauonai Gallery, at that time spent $lm on a single painting. Nevertheless, it is a decision greatly to be regretted. Members of Parliament are not good art critics, nor are they now or will they be good assessors of the value of works of art. I can remember being at a parliamentary luncheon on one occasion surrounded by a group of honourable members who might have what could be described as rural interests. I am sure that honourable members are aware that people with rural interests have three topics of conversation-wheat , sheep and cattle, and on this occasion the topic was cattle. They were discussing the relative merits of various breeds of cattle such as Murray Greys, Poll Herefords and Charolais. It was shortly after the previous Government had spent $2m on a Jackson Pollock painting. Trying to raise the level of conversation I said to one of them: 'What do you think of the selection of Blue Poles?' He said: 'Blue polls? I have heard of red polls but what are blue polls?' I do not carry it further than that except to say that I doubt whether members of Parliament are great art critics. I would not accept their judgment on the merits of particular paintings but I do accept their judgment on the poltiical consequences of government decisions to buy works of art at certain times. Surely what we must do is insulate the art purvided chases from poltiical consequences. There were reasons for the rejection by the Government of tain the purchase of Grand Nu. The economic consequences and the public were important considerthey ations. Another reason for the rejection which and subsidised has not been adequately canvassed was the this secret commission involved. It has been denied rangement but I have been credibly informed was not to receive a cash commission but instead 12 Picasso paintings which he could sell Australia and keep the commission. This was a substantial inducement for a local agent to become involved but it was a deal in which the Government could not be involved. It is imporpeople tant to understand that in art circles they talk about the reasons for the Government's rejection of Grand Nu. However, that was an important factor in the Government's decision. In the long term what we must do is take these art decisions out of this forum. Ours is an inappropriate body to decide them. We must establish a system which will ensure that the management of the National GaUery is accepted by this House as efficient. We have appointed a secretary/manager and I am sure that he will achieve that acceptance. We must accept that the artistic judgment of the newly appointed director is of a very high standard. We must have the poUcy of the National Gallery approved by the Government. At the moment this poUcy is being redrafted and has not yet been approved by the Government but when it is approved I think it is important that decisions on the selections which the National Gallery makes for purchase out of its aUocation be taken out of the poltiical forum. They are decisions which should be made by the National Gallery without poltiical control or direction. A second field which I would Uke to bring to the attention of the Minister Assisting the Pnme Minister in the Arts is films. We have had a sensational advance in the last few years and Australian films of great quality are now being produced. A great deal of credit for this Ues with the Australian FUm Commission and to a much lesser extent the State film commissions. This process has been successful in other countries. What we need to do is to extend this process to theatrical productions. The process has been successful in the United Kingdom. It is based on a revolving fund out of which productions can be financed and, if they are successful and make profits, into which a proportion of the profits can be paid, thereby achieving the revolving nature of the fund. We need such a revolving fund for theatrical productions open both to subsidised companies and to commercial companies prothat the commercial companies meet cerstandards of artistic quality and requirements in relation to the areas in which put on their productions. Both commercial companies should have access to fund. An appropriate level of funding initiaUy would be $500,000,1 suggest, with the arthat a board allocates funds for parthat the agent ticular productions. profit then perhaps 50Ifpera cent production makes a of the profit can in be paid back into the revolving fund. Obviously it is of great importance that the board deciding these aUocations be comprised of of appropriate quaUty. What we must not have on the board are people who are potential recipients. The greatest weakness in our arts distribution procedure in the past has been that recipients have sat in judgment on what funds should go to themselves and to other bodies. ignore their practice of withdrawing when their organisations are being considered for an cation of funds. Their technique is to withdraw then and come back later and knock back all other alternatives. This ensures that they will ceive funds. It is a fairly blatant practice. we must have is a body free of recipients and comprising businessmen and people experienced in theatrical entrepreneuring to manage a fund from which they can promote theatrical proappointing ductions. In this way Australia can in the next few years achieve as marked an advance in the theatre as it has in films in the last three years. We must not underestimate what we have achieved. We are now becoming a significant force in world cultural affairs in that field and can achieve that recognition in other fields. I put say. those suggestions to the Minister.",67
135,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY, mates Order! The honourable member's time has and expired.,69
136,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"In speaking to the estimates for partment of Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of Administrative Services I begin by referring to something which affects all Government departments but which arises in sphere of the PubUc Service Board. I refer to the new system instituted by the Government for appointment of permanent heads of departthe ments. Some of the worse rhetoric of the camthen paign traU of 1975 by coaUtion party members was reserved for individuals who were unable to respond on their own behalf and who had been appointed permanent heads of government demade partments. The coaUtion parties set out then structure a statutory scheme of stigmatising tain persons appointed as permanent heads as established candidates and others who might be appointed as non-established candidates. Last year the Government introduced legislation to give effect to this new system. It affects administration of the whole Public Service cause it affects the confidence which everybody has in the quaUty of persons appointed as perdevalue manent heads of government departments. tution There have been several significant lately not the least of which have affected the department of the Minister at the table, the Department of the Capital Territory. I raised with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) earlier this year the statutory scheme which had been instituted for the appointment of fund permanent heads and how it might best be monitored by the community at large and especially by members of Parliament. I received the quite I incredible response that whilst procedures were laid down in a statute for the way in which comallomittees would be estabUshed to nominate persons who were suitable candidates for appointment to these offices, no information would be regiven to members of Parliament or to the AusWhat tralian pubUc about whether those procedures had been observed. It is quite incredible that on the one hand we have a government saying: 'The procedures which have existed for 75 years for permanent heads to the PubUc Service of this country are unsatisfactory. We are going to establish a statutory procedure for the or four appointment of permanent heads which lays down procedures but then we will give no information about whether those procedures are we being observed.' That is the first thing I want to A couple of other items arise under the estifor the Department of the Prime Minister Cabinet. One of the most significant innovations which attracted a good deal of bipartisan was the appointment of the Federal the DeOmbudsman. I think honourable members on both sides of the chamber hope that this institution will soon take hold and attract real support in the community. But I am afraid that if the the example that the Government has pursued in relation to one of the initial and most important the reports of the Ombudsman is any indication of Government's attitude to this new institution, it will be rendered nugatory. In the Salemi case the Ombudsman went to great lengths to go behind a supposed ministerial discretion to pursue the administrative decisions which had been and the advice which had been proffered to to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic cerAffairs (Mr MACKellar). The Ombudsman reported most unfavourably both on the decisions of the civil servants and, by inference, on the action of the Minister. Yet the Minister came into the House as recently as three or four weeks ago the and said that he was not prepared to canvass behere the reasons given by the Ombudsman in his report for that decision. We will completely this new and hopefully worthwhile instiif the Government Ministers persist with changes that kind of attitude. In the Senate Estimates Committee proceedings honourable senators were able to establish that the staff given to the Ombudsman would appear to be very meagre at this stage. It is essential in the early stage of any new institution, especially one which has attracted a good deal of bipartisan support, that it get adequate resources to do its job. Otherwise it will fail because it not have those resources. I do not have the Sensubject ate Estimates Hansard with me but offhand think the Ombudsman has at his disposal only about 12 officers for the whole of Australia. supervise the whole of the administrative sUly decision-making procedures of the Australian Public Service. That seems to me to be inadwhich equate. In this area too I urge the Government see that this new institution gets the resources requires. If it gets those resources honourable members on both sides of the House are precisions pared to see that the reports of the Ombudsman are given the due consideration which they deserve. I hope, especially in these early days, this that Ministers do not force the Ombudsman into Services. exercising hisfinalsanctions of reporting to the Prime Minister and hence to the Parliament relates to the administration about their intransigence in considering the Electoral Office and particularly Ombudsman's comments on faults in public attack which wasreportedyesterday administration. I believe that those two points made by the Deputy Prime Minister which I picked up tonight-the system of apAnthony) pointing permanent heads and the new instituway tion of the Ombudsman-dea l with things which go to the very confidence of the whole of the traUan community in our pubUc administration. I suppose that no greater responsibUity rests on the Prime Minister than his setting of the scenario for financial relations with other governments in Australia, that is, State governof ments and local governments. One of the instituand tions which has been established by the Fraser Government is the Advisory Council for Interthat Government Relations. I think it is fair to say that this is an institution about which the Oppowho sition expressed many reservations when it was given a statutory basis. If we look at what has happened in the year since that body was estabWelfare lished we will see that those reservations were soundly based. The appropriations which we are considering here give about the same amount of money to the Centre for Research on Federal tation Financial Relations at the Australian National University as was given to the new Advisory Council. I think everybody in the chamber will admit that there are differences of opinion about services ought to be deUvered. We can characterport ise them quite easily in the Australian tradition as drawing from attitudes which ditionally expressed by persons in the Australian Labor Party and in the conservative parties. We will resolve them in the poltiical forum. not de-sex them, as it were, and resolve them in expired. an advisory councU. To this extent I think the Premier of Queensland has shown admirable recognition of poltiical fact. It seems to me that if does we are concerned to get new information on this we would be better off doubling the aUoI cation for the Centre for Research on Federal Financial Relations at the Australian National They University and doing away altogether with the institution which is no more than a cosmetic attempt to pretend that there is some way in questions can be answered about what to level of government delivers what services, what it resources, and what revenues which are made avaUable. These are nothing but poltiical dewhich we reach here by dispute and discussion among political parties. The other Department we are discussing here evening is the Department of Administrative related toI thatraise two matters which are interDepartment. The first matter of the Australian the savage as being (Mr on the new electoral system and the in which the proposed electoral redistribution has been carried out by the Distribution AusCommissioners. The suggestion that in some way the representation involved in great areas, particularly rural districts, needs to be offset by damaging the democratic principle of one man, one vote, one value relates to another responsibUity the Department of Administrative Services, that is the facUities made avaUable to members of parUament. I cannot emphasise too often Opposition members will never vote against the provision of adequate services to all members represent electorates of great physical size. Indeed, we seek to have more government information centres, such as the Northwest One-stop Centre which is covered in the estimates for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet made avaUable in country areas. These are all ways in which we can help with represendifficulties. I think it is quite inappropriate that we should attack the basic democratic principle because of the inconvenience of spending more money to provide adequate representation to people who Uve in physicallyremoteareas. They are the mam points I wanted to make. The how Australian National Gallery deserves the supof all of us. I do not agree with everything which the honourable member for Issacs (Mr have been traHamer) has said.",69
137,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,Mr GILES) We canOrder! The honourable member's time has,70
138,Mr KING,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY," I am quite happy to follow the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam) this evening because of a lot of what I want to say virtually follows on from where the honourable member left off. We are debating the esdmates for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of Administrative Services. It was with great interest that I noted that in relation to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet there has been an increase of some 12 per cent over last year's actual expenditure. For the Department of Administrative Services there has been an increase of only 7.8 per cent. I must conclude that comment by congratulating the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers) for the way in which he has been able to hold back his expenditure. If we look at the actual figures we will see that for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet expenditure last year was $83m-odd and the appropriation for this year is $93m-odd. For the Department of Administrative Services expenditure last year was $254m-odd and the appropriation for this year is $273m-odd. From there I move to a break-up of the Department of Administrative Services. I notice that the amount provided for salaries has increased from $42m to $43m. The amount for rent for office and other accommodation has increased from $48 to $53m. In total that is an increase of about 7.3 per cent, which is in keeping with the general expenditure of the Department. As I said, I am glad to follow the honourable member for Grayndler in the debate this evening because I want to continue on from where he left off in his remarks about the proposed redistribution. It must be remembered that sometime in the future-be it this year, next year or whenever-ther e will automatically be a reduction in the expenditure incurred by the Department because after the next Federal election there will be three fewer members in this chamber. I do not say that three individuals will be missing but rather that there will be a reduction by three in the number of members. No doubt many other members will be missing but they will be replaced. However, in three cases they will not be replaced. The seat of Wimmera, which I have represented for some 18 or 19 years, is one of the electorates which it to disappear with the redistribution. Also the electorate represented by you, Mr Deputy Chairman, will be cut up in the redistribution. No doubt you are as disappointed as I am. The interesting point, of course, is that it be the firsttimesince 1900 that there will seat of Wimmera. It is to be redistributed amongst the electorates of Wannon, Bendigo, Ballaarat and Mallee. Naturally enough it means that the areas of those electorates will increase quite considerably. I was interested to hear the honourable member for Grayndler say that the Opposition would not oppose any proposal which improved the services provided to members of parliament. All I can say to the honourable member for Grayndler is that perhaps a first move should be to giving a little consideration to the number of voters that a member has to represent in an electorate as well as to the area which he has to cover. It is bad enough that an electorate is to be lost altogether; that is one problem. But what of the future of the people who live in the western region of Victoria? They will experience great difficulty in contacting their Federal representative, and he will have difficulty in contacting his constituents. That is certainly a major problem. It is all very well for people to say: 'Yes, but that is not equal representation'. I believe that it is well on the way towards being equal representation. Surely these people are entitled to see their Federal member with as much ease as those people Uving in the metropolitan areas. The electorate about which I am most concerned is the proposed new seat of Mallee which at present is held by my colleague, Peter Fisher. He is a mighty good member too. The interesting thing is that the electorate of Mallee will cover an area of some 57,000 square kUometres. It will be the largest electorate in Victoria. At present it covers about 39,000 square kUometres. The enlarged geographical area will represent an increase of 36 per cent. The voting strength of the electorate will increase from 50,000-odd voters to 65,000-odd voters, an increase of 30 per cent. The electorate is situated geographically at a point which is the most distant in Victoria from Melbourne. In actual fact, it is an area which is one of the most difficult to service. There are few members of the Federal Parliament who would take a longertimeto travel to and from Canberra. There are fewer electorates which would contain more centres to service than the proposed new seat of Mallee. It will serve two of the largest cities in Victoria, and they are situated at either end of the electorate. There is a third large city at the eastern end of the electorate. Horsham, which is virtually the home base or which is centrally located in the Wimmera elecwill torate, has had an electoral office since 1949. be no Under the present arrangements the Departments of Administrative Services will allow only one electoral office in the Mallee electorate. Of course, the member for Mallee will have to decide on its site having in mind that he has three fairly big centres to service. As I said, he will have to service an electorate which has towns and centres than any other electorate in Victoria. This means in actual fact that some per cent of the population would not be able contact their Federal member by telephone at a local service charge; a trunk call fee would have to be paid on each occasion. The people who Uve in the new Mallee electorate will not have easy access to departmental offices, such cerned with health, immigration, housing and repatriation. Admittedly it wiU have some branch offices of the Department of Social Security as well as Commonwealth Employment Service offices, but they are not located in every centre. So the office of the Federal member will virtually be a substitute for those vital offices at which people have to attend to direct inquiries and the Uke. I submit that if and when the redistribution takes place-naturall y enough the legislation be passed through this House at a very early date-the Minister should take immediate steps Order! to see that arrangements are put in hand to established a second electoral office, which is the current situation in the larger electorates of KalgoorUe, the Northern Territory and others. present the Department of Administrative Serdirect vices has an office in Swan HU1 in the Mallee electorate and another in Horsham in the Wimvices mera electorate. If the latter office is to function satisfactorily and economically, I contend that, for pretty obvious reasons, an early decision must be made. The office currently being used under lease. If the contract lapses before a cision is made the Department will have to go to a lot of trouble to find a new location- I might add that office space is at a premium in that cityand would have to incur the extra expense volved in refurnishing, having the telephone connected and doing those things which are so terribly important in setting up an office. I believe it is bad enough to reduce the effect the voice of people by means of a redistribution, but I think that can be cushioned to some degree at least by giving consideration sufficient suitable offices from which members of parliament can conduct their business. I believe they have to be provided with adequate staff, equaUy importantly I believe that the position the individual constituent has to be considered. suppose it could be said that geographicaUy the decision to wipe out the Wimmera electorate therightone to make. Some people agree with that; some do not agree. As I said, the old Wimmera electorate will be encompassed in the large electorates of Wannon, Bendigo and Ballaarat. The Ballaarat electorate more will be enlarged geographically and the workload of the representative of that electorate 80 will also be increased because he will be moving to into a fair portion of the Wimmera electorate. The same situation applies in relation to the Bendigo electorate. I have not worked out the distance involved yet; it could well be that his electorate will extend 100 miles or more into the as those conwestern portion of Victoria. I have been speaking about the situation which will arise in the small State of Victoria. If honourable members think of the situation which will arise in other States they will appreciate the great inconvenience created by the redistribution for individual members of parliament as well as for the people they represent. So I suggest to the Minister and to the Government that they give early consideration to altering the formula under which a Federal member can have will only one office in his electorate.",70
139,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"Mr GILES) have expired. The honourable member's time has Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of At the Opposition) (9.48)- Mr Deputy Chairman, I the attention of the Committee to the estimates for the Department of Administrative Serwhich is responsible for the Federal provision of Ubrary services in the States and the Territories. Not a cent is provided in the estimates of the Department of Administrative Seris vices for the implementation of the most compredehensive mquiry into the development of Ubrary facUities in this nation-the Horton Committee of Inquiry into PubUc Libraries. Yet a minimal expenditure of public funds would have ensured in that all Australians enjoy the prospect of adequate Ubrary facUities in every State and Territory and in every city and school. Without these basic amenities much of our present expenditure on schools, high schools, and tertiary and techniof cal education is wasted, for without access to the Uterature and accumulated knowledge of our society the educational process must be conducted to estabUshing in a vacuum. The Committee of Inquiry into Public but Libraries was appointed by me on 11 March of 1975-mor e than 2Vi years ago. It was set up to I inquire into the role and effectiveness of State, regional and municipal Ubraries in servicing the was information and recreation needs of the community. The Committee was chaired by Mr Alan Horton, Librarian at the University of New South Wales. It presented its report to the Government on 4 March 1976. Seventeen funded months later we have still not seen any action the Government to implement any of the recomendations of the inquiry-recommenda - Ubraries tions, I might add, that would cost the paltry of $20m a year, an amount that pales into insig-Ubraries nificance when compared with the $2,37lm will be expended cn education by the Federal Government in thisfinancialyear. The only proshould visions for public libraries in this year's Budget wealth, are the allocation of funds for the National brary and the Canberra public Ubrary service the estimates for this Department. The Horton inquiry found that there were serious deficiencies in the distribution and dard of public libraries in Australia. For example, the inquiry found that in Queensland only 44 per cent of the population was served a free municipal Ubrary, and IS per cent of the State's population had no access to pubUc libraries of any kind. Cities as large as Bunpresent daberg in Queensland, with a population of 30,000 people, and LUydale in Victoria, the western Adelaide region and the Shire of Swan in Western Australia have no Ubrary services all. The Melbourne City Council provides no brary facUities for the central business district Melbourne. I cannot think of another capital councU in the world which would have faUed toresponse provide so basic a service. Where is its pride? Where is its sense of propriety? The inquiry estimated that a total of 816,000 people Uve in areas without any Ubrary servicesthe most disadvantaged States being concerning Queensland and South Australia. Those Ausrecommendations traUans who are fortunate enough to have accesshim to these facUities may still be forced to pay scription for this basic amenity. In Queensland, 41 per cent of the population is serviced by sub-June scription Ubraries. In South Australia 40 per of the population is simUarly Ul-served. The ton inquiry concluded that attempts to provide brary services solely by subscription have been found unsatisfactory in Australia and overseas. Such services have been characterised by the of unquaUfied staff and by book stocks which reflect the temporary popularity of titles. The Committee also discovered that expendithat ture on pubUc libraries per capita and the burdenthe on ratepayers for the provision of these servicesconclude varied greatly from State to State. In Queenslandat $3.17 per caput was spent on pubUc libraries in 1975-76, but in Tasmania $9.94 per caput was expended during the same period. In New South Wales local government had tofind76.5 per centHorton of the $22.6m spent on public Ubraries Fraser1975-76, but local goverament in Tasmania only 14.6 per cent of the cost of municibypal pubUc Ubraries. Clearly a national, coordinated program of development of pubUc is required if these gross regional varisumations in the distribution and funding of public are to be removed. Accordingly, the that Horton inquiry recommended: The provision of public library and information services be the collective responsibility of the CommonState and local levels of government funded in pan Liby each of these levels of government. in That was itsfirstrecommendation. The Committee also recommended that a statutory body to be known as the Public Libraries and Inforstanmation Council be estabUshed to formulate advice to goverament on national poUcies for the development of Ubrary and information services. byIt also challenged the Federal Government to assist State and local governments to eUminate the serious inadequacies and inequaUties of services by committing itself to a 10-year over rogram offinancialassistance at the rate of 20m a year. In its own words, the Committee's proposal atrepresented an integrated solution to the probUlems of pubUc Ubraries which should facUitate ofcost-effective and professionally sound developcity ment of these services. The Government's to the Committee's cogent, efficient and cheap recommendations has Been sUence and inertia. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) had to be jolted into action. On 27 May last year I placed a question on notice, No. 708, consultation with the States on the of the Horton inquiry. I asked on what date consultations had taken place a sub-with State governments on the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry. He replied on 4 last year that copies of the report of the centCommittee were being sent to State governments Horwith an invitation to those governments to comU-ment on the report. In a subsequent question, No. 938, on 26 August last year, I asked the Prime Minister when the copies of the report usewere sent to the State governments. He replied that they were sent to State Premiers under cover of a letter from him on 3 June. It is apparent from the Prime Minister's answer to the later question he wrote to the States six days after I placed former question on notice. It is legitimate to that he would not have written to them all if he had not been asked the question. The Prime Minister, however, was not the only member of the Government to pigeonhole the report. I quote from Senate Hansard of in 27 April 1977. Senator Douglas MCClelland asked what further action was to be taken by Government on the Horton inquiry and the interrepresenting departmental committee's recommendations. no The Minister for Administrative Services tion (Senator Withers) replied: I suppose the action required most of all is for some ume to read the repons. The Minister admitted that he had not read the report of the Committee of Inquiry which received on 4 March 1976-14 months earlier. On 22 September, last month, in answer to a question I placed on notice for him on 16 August, he was at last able to say that he had read report. There could be no clearer demonstration of this Government's cavalier attitude towards the provision of adequate public library facilities for all Australians, no matter whether they Uve northern Queensland or the western suburbs Sydney. The Minister, in his answer to Senator Douglas MCClelland, said that it was his intenment tion to put a submission to Cabinet so that government policy on these matters might be Minister made known to the electorate. He went further on 31 May last, in response to a question from Senator MCLaren. He said: I suggest that the honourable senator contain patience until Budget day. When the Minister gave that reply he knew that the IDC which he had appointed to examine the recommendations of the Horton committee, on 15 April last year, had not deUvered its report. fact it did not deliver its report until 11 August this year, after the Budget was being printed. Budget day the shelves were bare-no t $1 for public libraries in the States or Territories. could point out that in the Northern Territory, total Federal responsibUity, the pubUc library services, despite the recommendation of the Horton Committee, are worse than they were beand fore Cyclone Tracy.

It is cision that denies many handicapped persons, migrants and Aboriginals access to special readthe ing and reference facUities that would ensure them some equaUty of opportunity- a decision that denies many Australians access to Uterature and information that would enrich their Uves.",72
140,Mr SHORT,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"My friend eUtist the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Equally King) made some very telling points tonight the about the problems associated with adequately large geographical areas. There is doubt at all that these problems of representaare greater than the problems of representation in a smaller area. I was somewhat surprised, me to get I must say, that the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam), who claimed that the Opposition would treat all people in the he community as being adequately and equally represented, did not quite appear to recognise this fact in his unwarranted attack, to my mind, on the recent remarks of the Deputy Prime Minthe ister (Mr Anthony). I hope the Government will have a good look at the suggestions made by the honourable member for Wimmera because I think they are deserving of close attention. in Tonight I want to touch mainly on two or three of matters concerning the Government's role in relation to the arts. Firstly I would Uke to compUthe Minister for Capital Territory (Mr Staley) who is also Minister Assisting the Prime in the Arts for his handling of this area of Prime Ministerial responsibUity. I am deUghted to see him in the chamber tonight. I know fromfirsthand experience that those who have his imhad contact with him in this area have been impressed by his approachabiUty and his sound, common sense approach to the various issues involved. The Minister, I believe, has also played a very creative role in encouraging the developIn ment of the arts in Australia. In particular, I welcome the recent decision to establish a comOnmunity arts board within the Australia Council. The purpose of this decision was to achieve a One wider participation in the arts throughout the a community at large. The new Board will aim to reach those in the community who are not involved in or do not have association with major traditional arts organisations. The work of Community Arts Board will extend to outlycountry areas, a very important facet of its work, I hope. It will include special interest areas such as ethnic groups. Some new pilot projects are to be aimed specificaUy at young people. I also take the opportunity to compUment my the colleague, the honourable member for Isaacs chU- (Mr Hamer), and his Government members' a decommittee, for the work the committee has put into the examination of new initiatives such as Community Arts Board. Such initiatives are of great importance. Art in the overall meaning of the word adds an important dimension to the Uves of individuals. Those involved with the arts have over the years frequently been regarded as and, I believe, with certain justification. though I think this situation seems to be changing. That is good. Where taxpayers' funds are concerned, in particular, art should reach wide a range of people, young and old, in the community as possible. There is another element here too. That is the extent to which taxpayers' funds ought to be inas volved in development of the arts. There is doubt in my mind that the Government must involved to some extent otherwise the develophave ment of many art forms would wither dramatibasis cally at some cost, perhaps large cost, to overall standard of living. On the other hand, governments must be very careful indeed not to monopolise the funding situation courage private effort and involvement. The ance to be struck is a delicate one. I am not whether we have yet reached the right balance but we are certainly closer to it than we were few years ago. I compUment the Government for that. The decision in the Budget to liberalise the conditions under which income tax deductions are allowable for gifts of works of art and comthe parable property to public art galleries, museums and Ubraries is a further valuable step in this rection. At present a person who donates a work of art or simUar property to a public art gallery, museum or Ubrary may be eligible for an income tax deduction in respect of his gift only if he chased the item within the 12 month period preart. ceding the date of the gift. The amount allowable is restricted at the moment to the lesser of the purchase price or the market value at the time of making the gift. As a result of the provisions this Budget however, from 1 January next the month test will be abandoned for a trial three years. The valuation for taxation purposes will generally be market value. I hope this change in taxation treatment will provide a shot in the arm for the smaller public galleries throughout Australia. It is through these galleries cisions that many Australians acquire then:firstassociis senior ation with works of art. Between smaller galleries house some of Australia's great a broad acquisitions art treasures. In my own electorate, for example, we are tunate in having the Ballarat Fine Arts Gallery. It is one of the finest regional galleries Australia. It has a room specifically set aside the works of the Lindsay family. It houses the largest collection of Lindsays in Australia. It houses many other great works of Australian Regional galleries throughout Australia are sufferingfinancialhardship. As a result, some them are having to sell off their treasures. Others have abandoned restoration programs. Still the others are having to stand by and see their works deteriorate. The report on museums in Australia, as presented to Parliament in, I think, 1975, mentioned some of the difficulties and made various recommendations as to how they might be tackled. Few, if any, of these recommendations have yet been acted on. Not all of them relate to the no Federal Government. However, in my opinion, be there is an urgent need for the Government to another look at that repon and to use it as a for discussing with both State and local our governments, private donors and the gaUeries themselves, possible ways in which regional gaUeries can be helped to meet better the difficulso as to disties they are now facing. balI shall now say a few words about the policy sure towards acquisitions by the Australian National Gallery. What I have to say is very simUar in a thrust to what was said by the honourable member for Isaacs. As I understand the present situation, all works of an proposed to be purchased by the Gallery, and for which the purchase price exceeds $100,000, must be approved by either Prime Minister or Cabinet. I find this poUcy difficult to follow. With all due respect to Prime diMinisters and other Cabinet Ministers of this or any other day and, in particular, to the present Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in the Arts, it would be rare for them to be experts in the area purof assessing the real merits of important works of Yet that is the position in which they are placed by the present policy. It does not seem to me to be a valid justification of this poUcy to argue that it provides a control over costs. It is of the function of Budget preparation, Budget for12 mulation and the subsequent ParUamentary deperiod of bate on the Budget to do this. The Gallery cannot exceed its budget aUocation for acquisitions regardless of whether Cabinet is given the responsibUity of taking dein respect of individual acquisition proEosals. them, these judge the merits The Director of the National Gallery and staff are surely the persons best able to of particular acquisitions within framework which I fully accept should bear the stamp of Cabinet. But foronce the framework has been established I believe that we should leave its implementation to in the experts. The Government already requires for the Gallery to get two independent expert appraisals of each proposed acquisition, together also with a list of prices paid for comparable works. art. Why the Government on top of that safeguard and the others I have mentioned has then to give of thefinalapproval or rejection for an individual acquisition escapes me. The present policy runs real risk of making Gallery acquisitions a political football. We have already had some good demonstrations of this. There is already far too much Government involvement in far too many areas of human activity in Australia. Assessment of works of art should not be one such involBlue Poles. vement. I hope that the Minister and through him the Government will have a careful look at this matter. There is little doubt in my own that the policy in respect of acquisitions by Australian National Gallery is not a particularly sensible one. In the few moments left to me, I shall say a words about Christmas Island. It seems to almost an island forgotten in this Parliament. It of considerable importance to Australia. In parit ticular, it is a major producer of phosphate. It much strategic significance given its geographic relationship to Indonesia. There has been unrest on Christmas Island at the attitudes of successive Federal governments towards the present probpurchase lems and the future of the Island. It is a matter some regret that that unrest is stUl apparent, Ueve with good cause. I find it incredible that ConcUiation and Arbitration Act, as stand it, has no application on the Island. I find it surprising and disturbing that leading figures the Island have never been told, as I am advised, why the Government's new animal health quarNational antine station is to be located on Cocos Island instead of Christmas Island, despite some ent clear advantages in favour of Christmas Island and the seemingly bleak economic future for Christmas Island once its phosphate deposits run out. I will not pursue the matter further here other than to urge the Government to pay more attention to the needs and problems of Christthat mas Island than it and its predecessors have done.",74
141,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,Mr GILES) Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,76
142,Mr COHEN,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"This even Mr ing, I wiU foUow some of the comments of the previous speaker concerning the purchases of Australian National Gallery, particularly the rore that has arisen over the purchase of Grand Nu. I appeal to the Government and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Staley) who I think is doing a good job and is sensitive to the problem that has arisen over the purchases of the National Gallery. I hope that France's we can end the sort of political which has occurred over the purchases of art masterpieces. When we were in government there was no doubt that when any Liberal Party said: poUtician or National Country Party politician wanted to get a laugh or score a point at the excome. pense of the Labor Government he could by making a reference to the National Art Gallery's purchase of the Jackson Pollock painting Everytimethat the Labor Government was mind unable to accede to a request for money from the some section of the community, or whenever it was forced to impose a tax, the aggrieved person or organisation would make a sneering reference to Blue Poles. It was held up as a classic example fewof the Government's order of priorities. I would be hate to count the number oftimesthat someone is abused me over Blue Poles. I do not question that lost us a lot of votes. Unfortunately we are payhas ing a price for that now and the chickens are coming home to roost. The brou'haha over Blue Poles has reached the point now where the present Government has been forced to veto any of an art masterpiece. The Prime Minofister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is determined that his I beGovernment will never be ridiculed over any the purchase in the way that the Labor Government I underwas ridiculed over Blue Poles. on Obviously that was the reason for the veto by the Government of the decision of the Australian GaUery to purchase the famous painting Grand Nu by the French artist Georges apparBraque which was painted in 1908. Braque, along with his friend and contemporary Picasso, is recognised as the leader of the modern art era. Grand Nu is recognised as one of the masterpieces of that era. The purchase price of $1.3m was vetoed by the Government with the result this unique and famous painting, one of the few avaUable for purchase because it is in a private collection and not in a museum collection, now appears to have been lost to this country. I would like to quote a few points from an article that appeared in the Australian. It is a report of an interview with a gentleman named Alec Maguy, the person who wanted to sell the piece to the National Gallery. The article was the written in Nice, France, by Mr Kevin Dowling. fuDowling described the painting as 'a piece of French history, a painting as precious to France as the works of Picasso are to Spain'. Later on in the Arts (Mr the article he said: The big, busty nude in sage green and purple is by greatest contemporary painter, who shared the life and times of the turn of the century with that other master of point scoring the unexpected, Picasso. Further on Dowling quoted Maguy as having 'All posterity will be able to enjoy her for centuries to But the politicians who make music-hall with her now do so will be gone in another six months'. Well, perhaps not six months but none of us will It is Uve as long as the works of Georges Braque. is why Further on Dowling said in this article: The shock he feels has been echoed this week by French Press and the Paris an establishment, which understand why anybody should not want to admire Braque's idea of the perfect woman-eve n if she does have angles where most girls have curves. After all, scholars all over the world nave written more than SO books this one painting alone . . . I think it is a great tragedy for Australia that come down to this level of poltiical debate about what clearly is one of the great masterpieces the art world. I am not putting myself forward an expert; I am accepting the words of the people who know, the people who have studied and have become expert in this field. Probably it is true to say that in Australia were aware that there was a national coUection until the purchase of Blue Poles. Most The people would have been forgiven for thinking lery to that there was nothing else in the coUection but Ueve Blue Poles. I want to quote to the Committee world renown. now from a book which the National Gallery provided for every member of parliament. It was an excellent production. In it the art critic Robert Hughes, a brother of a former Attorney-General, said: The collection has been the painter Tom Roberts proposed to Andrew Fisher, then Prime Minister, to set up a gallery of portraits Australians. In the 1930s the Government entrusted Commonwealth An Advisory Board the task of buying typically Australian paintings for a proposed nauonai gallery. This Australian emphasis remained for another decades and when Sir Robert Menzies was Prime Minister he personally approved every painting that was bought. by the mid-1960s there was a fairly solid, but undeniably conservative, collection of Australian art only. Moreover, had been put together on a cessors Harold Holt and John 1967-68 there was $75,000 available for buying. By October 1971, when the then Prime Minister Will MCMahon announced his Government's intention of appointing James Mollison as the Gallery'sfirstdirector, the budget had risen to $392,000. In Gough Whitlam's 1973-74 budget that had multiplied to $4.8m and in 1974-75 to $5m. Tragically Australia has missed the opportunity to acquire many great works because of a Philistine attitude towards paying for masterpieces. Over the years opportunities were lost to purchase works by Cezanne, Braque, Gaugin, Matisse, Picasso, Van Gough and ModigUania, most of them for virtually a song. In the National Times of 11 September, in an article entitled 'Lost Masterpieces', this was stated: Braque's 'Grand Nu'is the latest casualty of this attitude that art works are too expensive. itself has not been disputed. It, along with Picasso's 'Demoiselles d'Avignon'launched cubism-the key to understanding much present day an. 'Grand Nu' could be more important than Picasso's work painted a year earlier in 1907. regarded as a turning point in the history of an and that it is an appropriate piece for the National CoUection. The problem is that after the poltiical point scorthe ing that went on over Blue Poles, every time the cannot National GaUery Council makes a decision to purchase a major work of art it is going to be subfromject to the sort of cretinous statement that about emanated from Mr Joh Bjelke-Petersen who described Grand Nu as looking Uke a 'pregnant we Sumo wrestler'. We also had the statement of the Acting Premier of Victoria, Mr Thompson, who of said that it looked Uke a 'muscle-bound frontas row forward'. Lord save us from the day when Australia's art purchases are decided by the likes of the Queensland Premier or the Acting Premier of Victoria. A report of what the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in the Arts, Mr Tony very few people Staley, said, stated: Government's eventual aim should be to free the Galmake its own artistic decisions and that he did not be the Government should presume to make artistic judgments when it had a distinguished Council and a Director of Amen to that, and I wish the Minister all the best. I only hope that somehow or other this Parliament can stop this. I am sure that we on this side of the chamber are prepared to say: 'Hands off going erratically since 1914 when any poltiical point scoring on this issue'. In 1981 the the National Gallery will open in the magnificent of notable new bunding now being constructed on the to the shores of Lake Burley Griffin at a cost of $26m.

143,Mr HAMER,NATIONAL DRUG INQUIRY,"In view of the remarks of the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam) and the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) I want to make it quite clear that my suggestion was that the National Gallery should be divorced from political control provided that the financial management of the Gallery is adequate-and I believe it is now-and provided that the poUcy of the GaUery has been approved in advance by the Government. The Government is paying $4.2m this year for the GaUery. It has the right to decide the poUcy, but the expenditure inside that policy is a matter for the Gallery and, in my view, should be a matter for the GaUery alone. The importance of the work I would like to comment very briefly, as I see that the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in the Arts (Mr Staley) is getting a bit toey, on a quite different matter-the vote for the Department of Administrative Services. I refer to the subject of cars for heads of mission. I am not talking of people buying cars inside Australia and the 'Buy Australia' poUcy. That is decided by the tariffs to give preference to Australian cars and, inside that, people should choose the cars that most suit their needs. In that way they can exercise an influence on our manufacturers to produce cars that meet their needs. But our ambassadors and heads of mission are quite a different case. They are the representatives of this country and they are provided with cars at public expense. Whenever possible their cars should be Australian cars. There are perfectly adequate Australian cars avaUable. The Statesman Caprice- a right-hand drive car, admittedly-is entirely suitable for any proper ambassadorial purposes. The most ludicrous case I came across was Dublin, in Ireland, where the American Amments bassador drives an Australian-bunt Statesman and the Australian Ambassador drives a Gerfor man-buUt Mercedes. What country does the Australian Ambassador think he is representing? We have unfortunately in some of our ambassaspeech, dors, in addition to a cultural cringe, a weird of mechanical cringe. My representations in the past on this matter have to some extent been cessful. I am deUghted to say that, unlike year when a high proportion of the cars provided in circumstances where they could have been Australian built were in fact foreign, this year the cars provided to right-hand drive countries, with one exception, have been Australian built. The one very odd exception is Fiji. In Fiji the representative of the United States of America drives a Kingswood station wagon; the represendenly tative of France drives a Holden; the representanot tive of New Zealand has two cars- a Belmont ofUfe. sedan and a Belmont station wagon; the representative of the South Pacific Bureau of Economic Co-operation has a Statesman; the think representative of the World Health Organisation has a Kingswood station wagon; and the traUan High Commissioner is being provided throughout with a Toyota. That is very odd indeed. I must admit that there are slightly extraordito nary circumstances in Fiji. The Government Fiji has imposed a 2500cc Umit on cars operating in Fiji but it has given a special exemption diplomats. All other diplomatic missions take advantage of that and on the whole use AusIsaacs traUan cars. The Australian mission does not, and uses a Japanese car. Last year I gave a warnwould ing that if any non-Australian cars were provided to a head of mission in circumstances where Australian car could reasonably be provided I would move a motion for a reduction of the estimates by the value of the foreign car provided. Because of the special circumstances of Fiji this case is not sufficiently clear cut, so with great reluctance I do not move such a motion. But I hope that the Minister at the table, the Minister assisting the Prime Minister in the Arts, will make clear to the Minister for Administrative Services that for this year and this year alone I let him off with a strong caution on the understanding that he does not do it again.",77

158,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"It is not easy for the Chair in these matters to decide that a member breaching the sub judice rule unless the comdone ments can be shown to refer directly to a matter that the which is sub judice. On a number of occasions Mrning theSpanish Speaker has pointed out that unless a matter raised in this House can be said to be Ukely influence a decision of a court that matter be aUowed to be mentioned in debate. Otherwise, debate would be stifled. I listened carefully to the honourable member for Hunter. It is my opinion that when the points of order were taken next the honourable member was not covering matwhich would influence a decision on the matter before the court. This is not an easy matter for the Chair to decide. Unless this House was very the sub judice rule could be used to stifle the debate. That would not be desirable. The is honourable member'stimehas expired.  (10.37)- I rise tonight to discuss some of the relevant and pertinent facts about one of Australia's most disruptive unions, which is filled with officials who have a high degree of expertise matin telling lies to the Australian community. Throughout the months leading up to my making this statement in the House tonight this union has caused a great deal of disruption, hardship in and unnecessary provocation in areas which are related to its supposed area of control. That union is the Seamen's Union. The Utah Company of America, which has assisting the Australian community by paying huge taxes, has been maliciously criticised castigated by a group of people who have as their main concern their own ends and as last concern the future of Australia. They that. have no concern for then fellow Australians and they are the scabs of the Australian trade union movement. A pamphlet which has been put out criticising Utah is full of Ues and distortions of and truth. It is claimed that there is a mere 5c per tonne royalty payment and charge on coal which is exported from Australia from Utah The truth of the matter is that there is a $1.20 per tonne royalty and the total royalties which were paid to the Queensland Government last year were $ 18.94m. The pamphlet which has of been put out by this mabcious union claims that only $600,000 was given in coal export royalties in 1976 and that in 1977 the total amount which canthe Queensland Government would receive in royalty payments would be less than Sim. The Sutruth of the matter is that over $25m will be paid in royalties for coal to the Queensland Government in 1977. is Ostensibly the reason for these vicious and unfair accusations against a company which has a great deal to assist Australia is to ensure seamen who are presently manships which are owned by the Utah to company are accorded different wages, terms must and conditions. The Seamen's Union claims: The low wage Spanish seamen should have their wages increased to accepted international standards. I say to this House and to those people Australia who are concerned about the actions of this unfair union that the Utah paying International Transport Federation rates of pay and conditions and that the average wage of these seamen is $ A9.000 per annum tax That is far more than Australian seamen would be getting if they were working under the which they believe are necessary. The people who do not want to go on to Australian wages mining are the Spanish seamen because in fact they applicablewould be getting less money and their terms and conditions of employment would be far less attractive than they are at present Also, International Transport Federation rates of payMr Keith Johnson- I rise to order. It seems me that a number of rules are applied in this House in a variety of ways. One is that if someI body takes out a writ in a court, discussion of matter is stifled in this House.",80

163,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! The under the honourable member'stimehas expired. Mr FitzPATRICK (Darling) (10.42)-Ever since I entered this Parliament I have adopted to the practice that when I am confronted with an untrue statement. I put forward a true statement. feel that there was never more necessity for me that to adopt this practice than this evening because of the radio broadcast by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony). I refer to the relevant section of that broadcast. The Deputy Prime Minister example is that of the electorate of Riverina held for Country Party by John Sullivan. Under the new that electorate will increase in size Vhtimesfrom 101,000 to 254,000 square kilometres. The member who seems to me that the represents electorate will have added to his responsibiliof representing a huge additional area of country by the big and important mining city of Broken I would say that both John Sullivan and the Labor Jack FitzPatrick, meinber for Darling, both are comoccupied in coping with the massive task of representing their existing electorates. It is beyond me that could reasonably suggest that it will be possible for man to represent what will virtually be the two existing the subject electorates rolled into one. want to point out where this statement is incorrect The Deputy Prime Minister said that the who represents the new electorate will the added responsibUity of representing a huge additional area. This is not true. At present St the Darling electorate is 343,543 square not kUometres and the proposed new electorate of will be only 254,000 square kUometres. Also, it will not be dominated by Broken HU1. If anyone cares to look at my contribution in this Parliament they will see that I have been by nothing but my desire to give good service to the people I represent. The Deputy has been Prime Minister said: me that anyone could reasonably suggest that it possible for one man to represent what will virtually be the two existing electorates rolled into one. is another untruth. Sixty-five per cent of the of Darling electorate has gone into Gwydir and only 35 per cent into Riverina. So the new elecis still much less than the electorate I am the serving at present. The Deputy Prime Minister has already condemned some of the members of his own National Country Party because he has made the statement that they could not serve an electorate of 254,000 square kilometres. Let me show the areas which some of them are serving. The electorate of Leichhardt is 406,630 square kilometres while the electorate of Maranoa is 503,523 square kilometres. The Kennedy electorate is 641,000 square kilometres, the Grey electorate is 505,000 square kilometres while the Kalgoorlie electorate is 2,271,379 square kilometres. I believe that this statement was made for a purpose. I would like the people to examine the service which I have given to them by looking at the electoral figures for Bourke, which is mdes from Broken Hill. They can look at thefiguresfor Warren and at Coonamble also. ",81
164,Mr FITZPATRICK,ADJOURNMENT,I am going to have a smaller electorate and it is one I will win. want to say that the people can be sure of good service there because I have already served a much larger electorate. I want to thank the Deputy Prime Minister for giving me the opportunity of making this statement to the House. ,82
165,Mr FITZPATRICK,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member will not have to look very far to find out. He needs only to read the information which is put out in this Parliament. He does not have to ask me. I do not know how he spends histimein this House. I am very pleased to have had this opportunity to speak because I wanted to guarantee the people in the Riverina electorate that they will get good service from me because I am used to a big electorate. I am not squealing. I would just as soon have held my old electorate. If the distribution commissioners want to set this area for the electorate I accept the challenge. If I go down I will go down fighting.,82
166,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member'stimehas expired.,82
167,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,ADJOURNMENT," I am concerned tonight with foreign policy. On 26 August 1975 the former Prime Minister made it quite clear in this House that Australia would refuse to participate in a peace-keeping role in East Timor and would not co-operate with the decolonisation of that territory. What concerns me is that consistently since that statement there has been a continuous deterioration in relations between Australia and Indonesia and the circumstances in which that deterioration has occurred and has been engineered deserve to be exposed. Former Senator WUlesee in the Senate affirmed and supported the statement of the then Prime Minister. Australia having rejected a role and having made it quite clear that she had rejected it, some people in this country adopted the role of being stern critics not of East Timor but in an endeavour to allow a serious deterioration to occur in Australia-Indonesia relations. It was done for quite false reasons. The fact was clearly highlighted by the former Prime Minister on the television program Monday Conference on 19 September this year in response to questions asked by the compere, Mr Bob Moore. They spoke about a report in the Australian which was wrongly attributed to the former Prime Minister, the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam). I will read one sentence in relation to that matter. Mr Moore said: The strength of your reaction to that was understandableI just The Leader of the Opposition said: No, but the point is this: I am not going to have a newspaper saying that I am advocating war with Indonesia. I am not going to have a newspaper saying that. The statement had to be corrected. Mr Whitlam was quite correct in what he said and in what he did on that occasion. It is the way in which humanrightshave been used selectively in order to direct, determine and sour relations between Australia and Indonesia which distresses me. The person who quite obviously has had the power and the authority to determine those relations has been the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uien). The selectivity of human relations in determining foreign policy is always a dangerous course. I shall traverse a few years of history in the two minutes left to me. When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, on behalf ofhis Party, was determining relations between Australia and Russia the denials of human relations in Russia, such as the pogroms in Russia, were never utilised as a reason to sour relations. The same situation occurred with respect to China. The same situation occurred with respect to Vietnam. The denial of human relations and the persecutions which occurred in that country are obvious and are clearly attested to as a fact of history. In Cambodia pogroms are occurring which are as great as those which occurred under Stalin in Russia. Phnom Penh has deteriorated from a city of several mUUon people to one of less than 500,000 people. That situation has not been utiUsed to sour and determine Australia's relations with Cambodia. In relation to the old India-China conflict of 1962, a passing reference was made to the nexation of part of Indian territory by China. The attitude of the Deputy Leader of the Oppoof sition on that occasion was: 'A plague upon your houses'. The principle which has been clear in deterrnining the policy of both the traUan Labor Party and of the Deputy Leader the Opposition with respect to a whole series countries, such as Russia, China, Vietnam, bodia, and India, has not appUed in relation Indonesia. I am sad because I have had to watch that deterioration over recent days. I believe situation has been engineered for a purpose far beyond any narrow, late or sensitive concern human relations as they occur in East Timor. Atrocities have occurred in Timor but a nation treads a very serious and dangerous couse when it allows a selective interpretation of those to direct its own foreign policy. It is certainly in the interests of relations between Australia and the largest of the nations of the Association of South East Asian Nations.",82

172,Mr BAUME,ADJOURNMENT,A swinging seat?,83
173,Dr KLUGMAN,ADJOURNMENT,"It is indeed a swinging seat. anSenator Baume, who is a senator of the Liberal Party allegedly looking after the western suburbs Sydney, visited the western suburbs for the both firsttimein 1977 and on behalf of the Prime quite Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) approached the AusMarconi Club which is an Italian-Australian club of at Bossley Park, Fairfield. He asked the Club of whether the Liberal Party could use the Club Campremises for a visit by the Prime Minister on to Friday, 23 September. Senator Baume told the Club that the Party wanted to charge only $2 per the person in order to get the maximum number of people or to give an opportunity to the maximum for number of people to meet the Prime Minister. The board of the Marconi Club discussed the request and felt that it was reasonable because, after all, it was the Prime Minister. The Club said rightsthat it would provide savouries and drinks for not the $2. It was much less than it would normally charge, but it was prepared to do this. The board of the Club also said that it would entertain the Prime Minister and six of his party at dinner for nothing. But what actually happened? Firstly, Liberal Party charged $4 per person and made money out of the function. It had told the I do not Club that it would charge $2. Mr Ruddock- I suppose nobody turned up.",83

Then, instead of the six people who were supposed to turn up for dinner, a party of 60 turned up for a free feed. These the hangers-on of the Prime Minister. The I Liberal Partyfloggedtheticketseverywhere and less than 300 people turned up. But the Club was obviously taken for aride.It feels rather strongly about the matter. I think that it was ridiculous of behaviour for a person who claimed to represent Prime Minister of this country to go to this which is not a wealthy club, in an area which is not a particularly wealthy area. We have at to realise that the people on the board of that Club are less likely to take a stand against the Prime Minister in public. The board and the of the Club realise that they were taken for a ride by an organisation which should not descend to that sort of thing. This is an important for this House to think about. The function was organised by Senator Baume, by a chap called Byers, an architect who is the Secretary of the Prospect Federal Electorate Conference of the the Liberal Party and by a chap called Don MCDonald who is the President of that Electorate Conference of the Liberal Party. They are impressive people. They both stood as candimfringing dates for different council elections in ate. The would be alderman Byers stood independent Liberal candidate and got 697 out of 10,000 votes in the Smithfield ward. Don MCDonald also stood as an independent Liberal and got 636 votes out of 11,000 votes in the Marys ward for the Penrith Council.

Germicidal Product 'Fiesta' Ballot Elections (Question No. 438) (Question No. 1084) Mr Hodges asked the Minister for Business 22 and Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 16 August 1977: (1) Has his attention been drawn to tests carried out by the Australian Consumers Association on the germicidal product Fiesta, and reported in their magazine Choice in November 1975, which proved that the product's germ killing capacity was practically nil. office within what organisation (2) Did the Association write to the Trade Practices Commission in December 1975 informing them of the results of its tests. (3) If so, and as a result of this correspondence, did the Commission request the manufacturer of Fiesta to change its advertising claim that Fiesta 'killed germs in the wash' to 'kills most germs in the wash'. (4) Has his attention been drawn to recent advertisements for Fiesta which claim that the product kills the bacteria Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, even though the Consumer Association's initial tests in November 1975 proved that this was one bacteria which was totally unaffected by the use of the bleach and that this finding was stated in their correspondence to the Trade Practices Commission in December 1975. (5) If so, should further action be taken by the Trade tices Commission in order to stop the present misrepresenCommission tation in the advertisements made Fiesta germicidal bleach. Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable memone ber's question is as follows: (1) My attention has been drawn to tests carried out by the Australian Consumers' Association on the uct Fiesta as reported in the Association's journal Choice in November 1975. As to what was proved by the ACA tests my answer to parts 4 and 5 below is of relevance. (2) Yes. (3) The matter was carefully examined by the Comit mission which sought advice from the manufacturer and funds. from the Australian Governinent Analyst. In with the manufacturer the Commission pointed out that certain claims made in relation to the product may be misleading and suggested that the company change the wording its advertising. After a further correspondence the change 'kills most germs in the wash' (among others) was made agreed between the manufacturer and the Trade Practices Commission. (4) and (5) The manufacturer has submitted to the Trade Practices Commission the results of regular tests of the uct conducted by an independent laboratory registered with the National Association of Testing Authorities. These results support the claim that the product kills the bacteria, Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. The discrepancy between these results and the result obtained by Australian Consumers' sociation is probably due to the use of different test methods. The Commission has again sought the advice of the Austhe tralian Government Analyst because of the conflict of the conclusions reached by the independent laboratory and the Australian Consumers'Association.

(7) If so, was this just a momentary lapse or is it the of the Department. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable period member's question is as follows: (1), (2), (3) and (4) Professional actors, entertainers and television performers can obtain advice on employment opportunities from the Professional Employment Office in the range of occupations covered by that Office. However, following a departmental review in December 1976, it was evident that such persons could be best assisted by the Commonwealth Employment Service through their local office rather than the Professional Employment Office. Employers of performing artists engage them through the established network of artists' agents. The Commonwealth Employment Service assistance to unemployed performing artists to other alternative employment (including relevant training where appropriate) and, where such employment is not available, access to unemployment best provided by the normal offices of the Commonwealth Employment Service rather than the specialised Employment Office.

Port (2) What are the results of those investigations. Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) There have been several disposal of the debris which resulted from the series of British atomic tests and experiments at the Maralinga area. This within debris includes plutonium. After the series had been concluded, the areas involved were cleaned up in 1967 by the British to comply with standards set by the Atomic Weapons Test Safety Committee (AWTSC)-an Australian body. This debris was disposed of in various ways, including storage in steel and lead boxes, burial in pits, covering with ing in, and fencing and area control. Detailed records were kept of all burials. The AWTSC reported to the Prime Minister of the time that they were 'satisfied Maralinga Permanent and unrestricted access could be made to all but a few small areas and even they could be occupied on a short term basis without risk.' A further inquiry by the Committee in 1972 confirmed the 1967 level of confidence. Periodic checks continue. My colleague, the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, announced on 9 August 1977 that a scientific study under the guidance of the Australian Ionizing Radiation Advisory Council had commenced on the possible dispersal of radioactive material in the MaraUnga area.

(Question No. 1250) Mr Adermann-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: responsibUity for the Northern Territory Authority was transferred to an Executive Member of the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory on 1 January 1977. The report by the Bureau of Transport Economics will need to be considered by the incoming Territory Executive which will be appointed following the recent Legislative investigations on the Assembly elections. I would expect a recommendation from that Executive two months. Petrol Price Increase (Question No. 1273) Mr Cohen asked the Minister for National Resources, upon notice, on 24 August 1977: massive concrete slabs, ploughIn view of the proposed 1 lc per gallon increase in the retail price of petrol, will the retail price of diesel motor spirit increase by 8c per gallon; if not, what will be the amount of the increase. was radiologically safe.",87
186,Mr ANTHONY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: On Budget night I gave details of the Government's new crude oU pricing policy, which will begin the movement of Australian crude oil prices towards world parity. The Government is not in a position to directly stipulate the price of petroleum products, nor would it wish to do so. The wholesale prices for petroleum products which, in the view of the Prices Justification Tribunal, are the maximum which can be justified, are suggested by the Tribunal following detailed submissions from the product marketing companies. The PJT has recommended that the wholesale price of (Question No. 1252) diesel fuel for automotive purposes be increased by a total of 7.8c per gallon to compensate for increases in the excise and indigenous crude oU pnce announced in the Budget. The final retail price of diesel for automotive purposes will depend on how retailers adjust their margins following the wholesale price increase. Dealer margins are likely to vary according to the degree of costs. Integration of Aboriginals into Australian way Mr Garrick asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 25 August 1977: (1) Can the Australian community assume that in line Alice Springs with his anti-apartheid speech at the recent Commonwealth Conference examples of segregation of Aborigines in this country will soon be eliminated. (2) If so, will those Aborigines living on reserves be brought to the cities and integrated into Australian life and will this have the dual benefit of giving the present Administration the appearance of domestic policy being consistent with its international utterances, while simultaneously removing Aborigines from reserves which are located of uranium deposits.",89

In reaching its decision on the mining of uranium the Government bad as a fundamental concern the welfare of the Aboriginal people in the Ranger Region. Its decision will ensure that Aboriginals themselves can exercise effective control over matters affecting their interests. The Government will also adopt, in consultation with the Aboriginal people, measures to protect and advance their well-being. Northern Territory: Sewerage Programs Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister for the Northern Territory, upon notice, on 20 September 1977: (1) What sums were expended on sewerage programs in urban areas in the Northern Territory in eachfinancialyear since 1973-74, and what sum has been programs in 1977-78. (2) What percentage and number of dwellings in urban areas in the Territory are connected to a sewerage service. (3) Are all dwellings in in the Territory connected to a sewerage service. Mr Adermann-The answer to the honourable tion member's question is as follows: (D1973-74 1974-75 1975-76 1976-77 It is proposed that an amount of $5.2m will be expended on similar sewerage works during 1977-78.

Agricultural Exports: Inspection and Certification (Question No. 1319) on top Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 25 August 1977: (1) What arrangements exist to ensure that exports of agricultural products are free of infection or infestation. (2) Is product and produce inspection and testing carried out by Commonwealth, State or private organisations. own varied futures. It is there(3) Where export sales are affected by infection or infestation, who is responsible for payment of compensation.",90
188,Mr SINCLAIR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable members's question is as follows: (1) Most foodstuffs and some related products exported from Australia are subject to compulsory inspection and certification aimed at ensuring that adequate attention has been paid during their processing and packaging to such matters as hygiene, cleanliness, freedom from disease, and that the products are correctly described. Specific provisions also relate to the construction and hygiene of the premises in which export products are processed. Authority for these (Question No. 1314) controls is provided by Exports Regulations made variously under the Customs Act 1901 and the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905. In addition to the above controls, exports of plants and plant products are, as a result of international treaty obligations, generaUy subject to phytosanitary inspection and certification aimed at preventing the transmission of plant allocated for these pests and diseases. (2) The Commonwealth Depanment of Primary Industry is responsible for the administration of export inspection and certification activities detaUed above. The bulk of inspection activities is carried out by the Department's inspection staff. new sub-divisions in urban areas In a number of cases, arrangements exist for other Commonwealth and State instrumentalities to carry out inspecon behalf of the Department of Primary Industry where it is not practicable for Departmental staff to do so. The cases involved include fresh fruit, vegetables and grain. All such arrangements are however subject to the general supervision $2.9m of senior professional staff of the Department of Primary Industry. Additionally, inspection of flour mUls for expon $3.5m purposes is carried out by the Australian Wheat Board.

Questions of compensation, where expon sales are affected by infection or infestation, are predominantly matters for negotiation between parties to particular transactions. Lethal Dose 50 Per Cent Test Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 6 September 1977: (1) Can he say whether in some overseas countries, what is known as the Lethal Dose SO per cent test, the following substances have been forced down live animals' throats to ascertain what amounts will kill 50 percent of the animals so treated: weed killers, packaging tries, detergents, floor polishes and ami-freeze liquids. (2) If so, have any of these or similar materials been Lethal Dose SO per cent tested in Australia. (3) Is the Lethal Dose 50 per cent test performed in Australia for non-medical research. (4) If so, are any of the laboratory animals force fed by means of a tube into the stomach, with the substance tested. (5) If the Lethal Dose 50 per cent test is performed Australia, is the person conducting the experiment obliged publish, or otherwise make known, whether the deaths of the 50 per cent of live animals used substance tested, or due to the rupture of the stomach or other organ malfunction. (6) What alternatives are there to the use of live animals for toxicological experiments. (7) Can he say whether in the United Kingdom in 1972, less than one-third of the experiments conducted on live animals were for medical research; if so, what is the correspondlibraries ing proportion in Australia.

189,Mr HUNT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am not aware of the substances tested in this way in overseas countries. However the Lethal Dose SO per cent test is a test recommended by the World Health Organisation as a standard of substances with which humans may come into contact or may ingest. (2) and (3) The Lethal Dose SO per cent test is used in Books Australia in both medical research and in the toxicity testing Publications of chemicals and other preparations. (4) and (5) The techniques used in administering the Lethal Dose test is required to be gentle and humane the resultant data obtained are meaningful. In the case of research, whilst there is no obligation on the research worker to publish his results, it is obviously in his interests to these known to the scientific stances to be registered, the results would not necessarily published but would be available to the registering authwas ority. Certainly the technique used requires a tube being placed into the animals stomach via the mouth and the stance administered in measured quantities to determine dosage limits of toxicity for each substance. (6) While alternatives do exist for cenain types of toxicological work, there is no alternative test to the Lethal 50 per cent test on live animals to obtain the particular toxicity data. (7) I have no knowledge of the position in the United Kingdom. (Question No. 1333) (8) No. (9) All research carried out in Australia including experiments on live animals is for the benefit of every country in which wishes to take advantage of the information gained.

Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Mr Hurford asked the Minister for Overseas Trade, upon notice, on 6 September 1977: (1) Has the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation the approved a loan to cover 85 per cent of the cost of a major South African coal handling project. (2) Is he able to say whether equipment for this project is to be made in Australia.",91
191,Mr ANTHONY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. The Expon Finance and Insurance Corporation has not made any loans under its expon finance facility in respect of contracts in South Africa. As such loans involve a direct Government subsidy, to do so would be inconsistent with the Government's policy of not providing official encouragement of trade with South Africa. At the same dme, however, EFIC's normal insurance and guarantee facilities are available to exporters engaged in trade with South Africa. (2) Not applicable. In any event EFIC's facilities are limited to expons of goods which are produced or manufactured in whole or in substantial pan in Australia. EFIC facilities would thus not be available for any expon transactions with only 25 per cent Australian content. Maritime Resources Zone: Surveillance",92

(2) Have real price levels fallen during the last 5 years. (Question No. 1427) (3) Has his attention been drawn to claims by growers that low priced imported tobacco and tobacco products are to blame for unsold Australian grown tobacco and a fall in real price levels; if so, is there any substance in the claims. (4) What corrective action does he propose to take.",93
196,Mr SINCLAIR,STATE EXPENDITURE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) All quota leaf offered at auction during 1977 has been sold. (2) The average price paid at auction and the average reserve price for leaf sold at auction in each year since 1973 have been: Selling season 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 (to date) . . . . . Reserve prices have been adjusted each year from 1974 onwards with reference to an economic survey of the industry conducted by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and covering the three years 1970-71 to 1972-73. The Bureau also constructed a cost index, annual movements in which have been made known to the Australian Tobacco Board in January each year for use in its price deliberations. Since 1974-75 the index cost structure has been revised to take account of information collected in a survey carried out by the Queensland Department of Primary Industries. This supplementary survey was directed towards changes in some cost items which had occurred between the BAE survey period and 1974-75. In addition to such data the Board has had regard to cost savings which growers could achieve by reason of changes in methods of preparation and presentation of leaf i.e. loose leaf selling and plant position sorting. In recommending reserve prices for the 1977 and 1978 selling seasons the Board had regard to disadvantages faced by growers because of shonsell arrangements. Substantial changes which have industry in recent years make about movements in leaf prices in relation to other indicators of economic activity. The price adjustments intended to avoid disadvantage to reasonably efficient growers. (3) See(l)and(2)above. (4) The current Tobacco Stabilisation Plan will end in 1978. Negotiations are under ments which will be applicable in 1979 and subsequent years. 1I have been taking a close and active interest cussions about future arrangements and I intend to have further meetings with representatives of growers facturers.

(2) Would sugar produced in Tasmania be marketed within existing marketing arrangements; if not, what effect would production have on sugar marketing and exports.",93
197,Mr SINCLAIR,STATE EXPENDITURE,"The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows: (1) In August 1976 I had discussions with the Premier of Tasmania (The Hon. W. A. Neilson M.H.A.) and representatives of the Tasmanian Beet Sugar Industry Committee the Tasmanian Government's proposal to finance a study the feasibility of establishing a beet sugar industry in Tasmania. cents per kg I indicated to the Premier that the Commonwealth Government would raise no objection to the proposal to Average Average commission a feasibility study. price reserve I understand that a feasibility study was subsequently conducted by an English consulting firm. The Tasmanian 252.4 251.5 Government was reported in the Press in early August 1977 286.1 285.7 to have set in train cultivation trials recommended by the 332.7 332.2 consultants. 341.7 341.3 (2) The arrangements for marketing of Australian sugar 351.8 351.4 on the domestic market are provided by the Commonwealth/Queensland Sugar Agreement. The Queensland Government is responsible for marketing overseas. Export of Australian sugar may also be regulatedby Australian membership of an International Sugar Agreement. Although the current ISA does not regulate exports, negotiations are currently proceeding in Geneva on a new Agreement. If a new ISA is negotiated, it could be expected to regulate Australian exports and possibly other aspects. The marketing of any sugar produced in Tasmania could therefore have ramifications for these arrangements. It would be appropriate that, if sugar is produced in Tasmania, marketing arrangements be co-ordinated with the marketing of other Australian sugar. Quarantine Irregularities (Question No. 1460) Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 14 September 1977: Has he discussed with the Minister for Health irregularities in quarantine procedures in Western Australia and the issue of a letter of clearance to an infested ship in New South taken place in the tobacco Wales. it inappropriate to generalise",94
198,Mr SINCLAIR,STATE EXPENDITURE,"The answer to the honourable have been member's question is as follows: Since quarantine is the responsibUity of the Minister for Health, any inquiries regarding aUeged irregularities in that regard should be directed to him. Australian Armed Forces: Red Alert way for stabilisation arrange(Question No. 1466) in dis Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Defence, and manuupon notice, on 14 September 1977: (1) On how many occasions have Australian armed forces growers. been placed on red alert during the last 10 years. (2) What was the date in each case. (Question No. 1459) Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: and (2) No such term as 'red alert' is in general use in the Australian Defence Force, although it is possible that some units or individuals use it colloquially to imply a high state of readiness. In any case there has been no occasion during the last 10 years when the Australian Armed Forces have been brought to the state of readiness implied by the term. Offshore Animal Quarantine Station, Cocos (Keeling) Islands (Question No. 1471) Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Construcon tion, upon notice, on 14 September 1977: of (1) WUl Australian labour and materials be used in the construction of the Offshore Animal Quarantine Station at Cocos (Keeling) Islands.

(5) What other suppliers are market after 1 January 1978.",94
199,Mr HUNT,STATE EXPENDITURE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) At present they are supplied to users by the Atomic Energy Commission following orders placed by the Australian Radiation Laboratory or they are supplied from the Austrahan Radiation Laboratory following importation of material from overseas. (4) I refer the honourable member to my press release 17 August 1977 in which I stated that one of the main reasons for the ending of the free supply policy was that it limits freedom of choice. The other main reasons were that other equally lifesaving and diagnostic materials are not supplied free, and free and discourages commercial competition. Currently the Austrahan Radiation Laboratory is required to provide to users radio-pharmaceuticals and radio-isotopes that are available from the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. Other radio-pharmaceuticals and radio-isotopes are procured by the Australian Radiation Laboratory from over1972-73 seas following a tendering procedure. Thus for each radio1973-74 pharmaceutical and radio-isotope there is only one brand 1974-75 avaUable to users under the free supply policy. As from 1 1975-76 January 1978 users will be able to purchase each radio-phar-1976-77 maceutical or radio-isotope from providing the materials meet adequate standards of quality, safety and efficacy. (5) The answer to this question is not known. However, currently the Australian Radiation Laboratory procures radio-pharmaceuticals and radio-isotopes from 14 overseas suppliers and for 10 of these, orders are placed on Australian agents. Currently radio-pharmaceuticals and radio-isotopes required in 'kit' form or for by the user from the Australian Atomic Energy Commission or from any of 37 overseas suppliers of which 30 have Australian agents.

Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: All members of the Committee are either Commonwealth (Question No. 1477) or State Government officials. There are no airline industry on the Committee. However, under the Committee 's terms of reference it is to inform and consult with, as appropriate other Commonwealth and State departments and organisations; 1 January 1978. the airlines and unions; and local government authorities, community organisations and other interested parties. Prescriptions Dispensed by Medical Practitioners (Question No. 1495) so, is there any substance in the Mr Hodges asked the Minister for Health, likely to enter the Australian upon notice, on 15 September 1977: (1) How many medical practitioners were authorised to dispense prescriptions under the National Health Act during each of the last 5 financial years. (2) How many prescriptions did they dispense and what was the value of the dispensed prescriptions for each of those years. (3) By what formula are such prescriptions priced for payAustralian ment to the authorised medical practitioner. (4) Has there been any variation in the method of pricing; if so, (a) what changes were made, (b) when did they come into effect and (c) at whose request was the alteration made. (5) What is the criterion for granting an authority to of dispense to a medical practitioner in private practice.",95

Service Men and Women: Equal Pay Mr Keith Johnson asked the Minister for Dements fence, upon notice, on 15 September 1977: (1) Do servicemen and service women of equal rank ceive equal pay. (2) If not, what percentage of the male female (a) privates, (b) corporals, (c) sergeants, and (d) commissioned officers. (3) Is the pay of service personnel determined by rank by task performed. Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable relation member's question is as follows: (1) The present method of salary fixation for females in the Defence Force provides for equal pay where it has established that men and women do perform equal work. Thus equal pay applies in respect of male and female mediofficers cal and dental officers and nursing officers of equal rank. Male and female members at private level also receive equal pay according to skill category. (2) The percentages of the male rate received by those members referred to who are not in (a) Female non-commissioned officers receive the full private rate plus a margin for rank of about 80 per cent of the male rank margin. This '80 per cent' mula applied to the NCO rank margin and to officers represents a general statement of the situation. It does not mean that this formula is applied rigidly in every case when adjusting salary rates for females in the Defence Force. For example, equal increases are apCost of plied to men and women when nauonai wage case prescriptions increases are extended to the Defence Force. (including (b) Corporal-9 9 per cent.

As in any 550,094 hierarchically structured organisation higher rank confers 509,351 increasing responsibility and consequently higher salary. Different salary structures, however, have been determined for different groups. This is due to perceived differences in the work performed and its value in relation to broadly similar groups m the community. items where no dispensing fee is The whole question of payfixationfor female members of the Defence Force, including the question of equal pay, is currently under consideration by the Committee of Reference for Defence Force Pay. are paid the cost of Rationalisation of Uneconomic Pharmacies (Question No. 1513) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 20 September 1977: (1) What action is the Government or the Pharmacy Guild taking to encourage the rationalisation of uneconomic pharmacies. (2) In this rationalisation what safeguards or assistance are being provided for uneconomic pharmacies in otherwise unserviced areas.",95
201,Mr HUNT,STATE EXPENDITURE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The honourable member will recall that when the (Question No. 1506) National Health Act Amendment Bill, to establish the Joint Committee on Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Arrangeas a statutory body, was being debated in this place in December 1976, attention was drawn to the large number of retail pharmacies in Australia in relation to the population. reThe economics of dispensing pharmaceuticals and the need to examine the question of rationalisation of retail pharrate is received by macies were also raised At that time. I indicated that the Joint Committee might look at the question of rationalisation of retail pharmacies or and provide me with a repon, through the Chairman, on possible options by which such rationalisation could be achieved and the possible role for the Commonwealth into such options. Subsequently, I requested the Chairman of the Joint Committee, Mr Justice J. T. Ludeke, to undertake the preparation of a repon on guideUnes and possible options for the rationalisation of retau pharmacies. been The Joint Committee, which consists of four members nominated by the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and four of the Australian Public Service, in addition to the independent Chairman, has established a sub-committee to examine the question of pharmacy rationalisation. The issues involved are complex and it may be some time before the Chairman of the Joint Committee is in a position to report on receipt of equal pay are: this matter. (2) The current position in relation to the rationalisation of retaU pharmacies is set out in (1) above. However, I reforcently announced the introduction of a new allowance scheme to support pharmacies providing a dispensing service in isolated and remote locations. Under the new Isolated Pharmacy Allowance Scheme a pharmacist is eligible to receive an aUowance of up to $2,520 a year if the pharmacy is situated more than 25 kilometres from another pharmacy and if the owner can demonstrate economic need. The allowance was introduced following a unanimous recommendation of the Joint Committee on Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Arrangements and replaces the previous zone allowance arrangements. Eight-cylinder Engines: Production Statistics Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 24 May 1977: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 162, is it important that staustics should be kept on the import and domestic production of 8-cylinder engines, in view of recent moves in the United States to phase out 8-cylinder engine productions, and in view of Australia's diminishing petroleum reserves. (2) Will he take up this matter with the Bureau of Statistics and the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The Australian Bureau of Statistics is not aware of any great demand for either import or production staustics of 8-cylinder engines. Should such a demand emerge, investigations would be undertaken into the practicability and costs of collecting the data. The measures announced in the Budget for a transition towards import parity prices for locally produced crude oil and an increase in the excise duty on petroleum products will provide direct incentives for economy in the consumption of such products, including through the use of vehicles with smaller engines. This price-oriented approach to energy conservation avoids the need for less efficient piecemeal policies such as those which appear to be implied by the honourable member's question: Sale of Meat to Japan Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 1 June 1977: (1) Can he say who are the shareholders of the Australian Meat Export Corporation Pty Ltd. (2) Would it be a suitable vehicle for a single seller arrangement of meat to Japan. (3) If so, is it being considered for such a role, and what other alternative proposals are being considered by the Government to meet the monopoly power of the Japanese of Livestock Industry Promotion Corporation.",96

Limited Western Australian Meat Commission Westralian Farmers Co-operative Ltd Wynne's Pty Ltd. I do not consider that the Australian Meat Expon Corporation is a suitable vehicle for a single seller arrangement of meat to Japan. For example, exporters who have built up meat trade in Japan over the years but who are not shareholders in that Corporation would be unfairly excluded. Furthermore, it seems doubtful that such a large group of exporters could reach agreement on higher prices, the benefits which would flow back to cattle producers. It seems inevitable that steps will have to be taken on the Australian side to counter the depressing effects on beef prices of the import system and the resulting intense competition between Australian exporters. With this in mind, the Australian Meat Board recently sent a delegation to Japan to discuss import arrangements with the Livestock Industry Promotion Corporation. In the light of these discussions the Board is now considering what steps it might recommend to achieve higher prices. Museums and National Collections (Question No. 1085) Mr Lionel Bowen asked the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 16 August 1977: (1) Does the Government intend to create an Australian Museums Commission; if so, what form will the commission take and what will be its powers and functions.

Mr Street-The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1), (2) and (3) These matters are the mendations in the Repon of the Committee of Inquiry on Museums and National Collections which is under consideration by the Government. (4) and (5) The Canberra College of Advanced Education proposes to introduce courses in materials conservation in 1978. In its report 'Recommendations for 1978', which was tabled in the Parliament in September, the Tertiary Education Commission supported projected student enrolment figures for the Canberra College of Advanced Education which would allow such courses to proceed. (6), (7) and (8) See answer to (1). Legislation has, however, been enacted to protect historic wrecks and relics recovered from those wrecks. This matter was the subject of recommendation 2.14 of the committee of inquiry. The Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976 received the royal assent on 15 December 1976. Its provisions may be brought into effect in relation to waters adjacent to the coast of each State separately upon proclamation. On 3 September 1977 the Act was proclaimed for waters coast primarily to protect the old Dutch shipwrecks in those waters. Historically significant colonial wrecks in those waters are also now protected by the Act. The States will be consulted prior to a decision being taken to proclaim the Act for waters presently not covered by the Act. The Government has also incentives to stimulate theflowof gifts to pubUc museums, art galleries and libraries. Recommendation 2.17 of the committee of inquiry recommended arrangements along these lines. New tax provisions will period of three years on 1 January 1978. In the past, a person could claim on a gift only if he had acquired the item in the last twelve months or if it were cash.

The InterScan system can be realised in a number of ways this gives flexibility in developing cost effective commercial venions. The InterScan antennas at Melbourne Airpon are based on an original CSIRO concept specifically to DOT Since then CSIRO has earned out theoretical studies which have suggested a new and novel approach to antenna design which is considered more Ukely to meet the wide and varied world requirements and which could reduce the size of the system and offer prospects of considerably division of reducing product costs. An experimental sub-system based on the new concept has been made up and test results have confirmed the theoretical predictions. (Question No. 1176) Other work has been aimed at cost effective packaging on the integration of electrical and mechanical parts in reliabUity and minimise production costs. progress has been made in this direction. appreciable funher development is required at estimated cost of about $6m the technological lead gained Australia through Government sponsored developments has provided Australian industry with the opportunity of and successfully participating in the international under the promarket for microwave landing systems. (2) The project to develop commercial versions of Interis funded by my Depanment. Expenditure to 30 June 1978 is expected to be about $Im mainly in industry. This is in addition to the funds of about $5.5m already expended by Depanment of Transport and CSIRO in their continuing program. (3) At the present time there is no recommendation before the Government relating to funher funding of the project. In view of InterScan's apparent superiority over competing sysand the size of the market likely to develop efforts are being made to develop cost sharing arrangements with industry covering the funher development required. (4) An ICAO Panel of Experts has already recommended that the systems on which InterScan is based should be adopted by ICAO as the world standard. In the most unUkely (Question No. 1192) event that this recommendation is reversed in favour of the United Kingdom Doppler system the commercial possibUities of InterScan would be small. Quarantine Inspector, Port Hedland (Question No. 1197) Mr Bungey asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 17 August 1977: (1) Was Mr N. Brogan, Quarantine Inspector, Depanment of Health, Western Australia, ordered or requested to assume duties at Pon Hedland following suspension of Mr F. W. Toomer, Quarantine Inspector, Port Hedland, Western Australia. (2) If so, did Mr Brogan refuse to go to Port Hedland. (3) Did the Director of Health, Western Australia, initiate, suggest or recommend that charges under the PubUc Service Act be laid against Mr Brogan; if so, what action was taken on any suggestion or recommendation, and what were the reasons for the action.",98
205,Mr HUNT,STATE EXPENDITURE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. However, the instructions ceed to Port Hedland were withdrawn because another officer had been found to undertake the duties. (3) No. As the instruction was withdrawn no further action in respect of Mr Brogan was required. Australian National Flag: Framed Portraits of Mr Neil asked the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 17 August 1977: Which Government departmental buUdings and offices are entitled to (a) and AustraUanflagand (b) a framed portrait of the Queen. Mr Street-The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) Paragraph 5(b)(vti) of the booklet entitled 'the Australian Nauonai Flag' published by the Department of Administrative Services states in part'There is a standing approval for the Australian National Flag to be flown from the mainflagstaffon Government buildings on all working days during normal working hours . . . The flag may be displayed at night, but only where it is properly illuminated'. (b) All Government offices are entitled to a framed portrait of the Queen. Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice, (2) on 17 August 1977: (1) Does he recall my persistent questions on the need for adequate national legislation for the supervision of insurance brokers. (2) Did his Assistant Minister announce on 11 March 1977 that following a lengthy investigation it had been resolved to leave this area to self-regulation. (3) Has his attention been drawn to Press reports in March 1977 indicating that a round-up of five insurance companies produced three who had suffered problems from broker faUures and that known losses suffered by these companies, and other companies they were aware of, totalled about $750,000. (4) If so, did the reports indicate that (a) Company one had suffered a loss of $250,000 through the collapse of a broker, in which a total of seven companies lost $500,000, (b) Company two lost $50,000 through the collapse of a different broker and (c) Company three estimated losses of between $100,000 and $250,000 because of the collapse of various brokers during the last five years. (5) Are there 180 general insurers in Australia whose total losses calculated on the same basis would run into millions of dollars. (6) Has his attention also been drawn to the Insurance Brokers' Registration Bill which was introduced as a private Member's Bill in the United Kingdom Parliament, with Government support, early in 1977. (7) If so, is he able to say whether the Bill has now become law and that, as a consequence, the pattern of activities of the British insurance brokers is now subject to close scrutiny and control. for Mr Brogan to pro(8) Can he say whether the British insurance brokers would have preferred self-regulation but that such a course had been found to be both ineffective and deficient by the United Kingdom Parliament. (9) Can he also say whether the United Kingdom legislation provides (a) for the establishment of an Insurance Brokers' Registration Council which decides whether or not Queen appUcants should be registered, (b) that the Council will (Question No. 1216) consist of 17 members, 12 of whom will be nominated by the insurance broking industry and five, one of whom shall be a lawyer and one an accountant, to be nominated by the Government, (c) that the Council will evaluate appUcants' qualifications, experience, their financial backing and thenindependence from insurance underwriters and (d) that the Council will require members to submit to a code of ethical behaviour to be set down and to maintain proper accounting and financial reporting standards. (10) In view of the alarming number of brokerage firms in Australia which have passed into Uquidation because of either mismanagement or incompetence or both, and left many members of the pubUc with the burden of financial risk, is it considered proper that anyone is free to set up as an insurance broker without qualifications, without restrictions and with no funds to indemnify clients. (11) As the United Kingdom has considered it necessary to introduce legislation and as the general insurance legislation is largely patterned on the United Kingdom Insurance Act, will he iniuate an immediate investigation and evaluation of the new United Kingdom brokers legislation with a view to introducing national legislation for the supervision of insurance brokers as speedUy as possible. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourInsurance Brokers able member's question is as follows: (Question No. 1218) (1) Yes. No. In my statement of 11 March 1977 in my capacity as Minister Assisting the Treasurer, I announced that the Government would be giving consideration to possible approaches to the quesuon of supervision of insurance brokers, including self-regulation, against the background of views expressed by interested parties. However, I would emphasise that the Government is not committed to regulation or to any particular form of regulation at this stage. (3) , (4) and (5) I am aware that there have been press reports on the matters referred to. However, there is no authoritative and comprehensive information avaUable on losses incurred in the insurance industry as a result of the faUure of insurance brokers and I am therefore unable to comment on the figures referred to by the honourable member. (6) Yes. (7) I am informed that the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act of the United Kingdom received royal assent on 29 July 1977.I am arranging for the honourable member to be sent a copy of the Act. (8) , (9) and (11) The approach adopted in the United Kingdom is being considered along with other proposals for the supervision of insurance brokers in Australia. (10) These questions are being considered as part of the study referred to under (2) above. Northern Territory Legislative Assembly: Poll Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Ser- (1) vices, upon notice, on 17 August 1977: How many votes and what percentage of the total votes were polled by: (a) Australian Labor Party candidates, (b) Country-Liberal Pany candidates, and (c) othercandidates, at the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly election on 13 August 1977. Mr Street-The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The votes and percentage the election of members of the Legislative Assembly for the Northern Territory on 13 August 1977 were as follows: (a) Australian Labor Party, 12,165 votes-38.2 3 percent (b) Country-Liberal Party, 12,769 votes-40.13 percent (c) other candidates, 6,883 votes-21.6 4 per cent Alexander Barton Group of Companies Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice, vising on 18 August 1977: (1) With reference to my question without notice to Minister representing the Attorney-General on 4 April 1973 (Hansard, page 1041) asking (a) whether the attention had been drawn to a reported financial loss totalling $ 17m incurred by member companies of the ander Barton group, (b) if the money raised to finance the activities of the group drew benefits under the Commonfrom wealth taxation law and (c) if, in view of the Commonwork wealth's interest in the matter, the Minister would take imThey mediate steps to have the matter referred for full inquiry the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange, has his attention been drawn to the S.M., at the first committal proceedings of Alexander and Thomas Barton on charges of making false and misleading statements, that the question of the liability of the Banon company in quesuon to taxation was relevant to the issue of whether Alexander and Thomas Barton had made a false statement in relation to the profits of the company. (2) Did the Commissioner of Taxation tration order against the estate has been the outcome in relation to enforcing it. (3) As the Minister responsible for trol, will he state whether Alexander or Thomas Barton or any of their companies involving breaches of the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations; if so, what was the outcome of the charge. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honour-buildings able member's question is as follows: I do not propose to answer this quesuon. It appears to based substantially on question No. 146 which, on 2 June 1977, the Treasurer declined to answer on the ground that had been prepared by an officer of the Attorney-General's Depanment. Uranium: Failure of Government Analyst to give Evidence to Ranger Inquiry (Question No. 1289) Statistics Mr Chipp asked the Minister representing the (Question No. 1223) Minister for Science the following question, on notice, on 6 September 1977: Is it a fact that the Australian Government Analyst did not present evidence on behalf of the Depanment of Science to the Ranger Inquiry, as stated on page 11438 of the transcript. (2) Is it also a fact that the Minister was instructed not to present a submission to the Inquiry; if so, why. (3) Does the Government envisage a role for the Government Analyst in monitoring the waste disposal from the Ranger site simUar to his role in Tasmania in connection with the disposal ofjarosite from the E.Z. Industries works. Mr Aderman-The Minister for Science has provided the following answer to the honourable of total formal votes polled at member's question: (1) Yes. (2) Examination of the departmental files does not reveal any such instruction but if the honourable member has any evidence to support his claim, I should be pleased to investigate it. (3) Following the Government's decision on uranium (Question No. 1253) mining and export the matter of monitoring arrangements in the Alligator Rivers Region will be considered by the SuperScientist and the Co-ordinating Committee as part of their responsibilities in the formulation of measures for environmental protection in the Region. The idea of using the the Australian Government Analyst as an independent check on the large amount of analysis which will be undertaken in the Minister's Northern Territory is a possibility. AlexThe Australian Government Analytical Laboratories are able to analyse a wide range of substances including wastes mining operations and are avaUable to undertake such subject to avaUable resources and other commitments. are not able to measure radioactivity of wastes, that is a by matter for the Australian Radiation Laboratory of the Department of Health and/or the Australian Atomic Energy statement of Mr Berman, Commission. Commonwealth Airport Hangars and Buildings: Lease Rentals (Question No. 1301)",100

(3) What is the current written down cost of hangars and leased by aero clubs and what is their replacement value for insurance purposes. be (4) What is the justification for requiring aviation tenants of Commonwealth buildings to insure them for replacement it cost when the tenant is given no undenaking that in the event of the building being partially or totally destroyed it will be replaced by the Commonwealth. (5) Is it a condition of tenancy that Commonwealth owned buildings must be maintained internally nally at the tenant's expense bers; if so, is this condition in keeping with commercial real estate practice. (6) Is the land on airpons leased by the aviation industry clearly distinguishable from land which the industry is entitled to use as a result of paying air navigation charges. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Lease rentals for the airpon buildings in question prise both a site and building mon rate approved by the Minister for Transpon from time to time, though varying with the particular category of pon-primary , secondary and country. The building rental assessed on commercial lines at 12 per cent of current replacement value less an allowance for physical 1977-78. depreciation. (2) Aero clubs have been granted a phasing in period of four years for their new rents. Estimated revenue from thenmajor hangars and buildings is some $30,000 year rising to about $ 120,000 in the fourth year. (3) The Department of Transport does not depreciate its buildings individually but the Taxation Office Valuation tion in December 1976 gave thefigureof $1,096,051 rent market value and $1,924,198 for replacement cost for insurance purposes. (4) The Department of Transport agrees that its policy concerning insurance, although justifiable, warrants review towards giving the tenant the option of replacing ing with the insurance moneys. This review is nearing finalisation. (5) Generally, under the law, a landlord is under no oblivide gation to carry out repairs of any kind in agreement. Where there is an agreement between the lord and the tenant, a condition is generally included as who is liable for the maintenance this case, a condition is included in the Commonwealth's tenancy agreement for the particular maintenance of the demised premises. Again, the nature under current review. (6) Generally, yes. Tertiary Industry Efficiency: Assessment Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Productivity, upon notice, on 6 September 1977: (1) Is his Department establishing any productivity criteria or assessment procedures to measure and monitor the efficiency of tertiary industry in Australia. (2) Is there a need for this assessment since the Industries Assistance Commission only investigates and repons on manufacturing and primary industries. Mr Macphee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The development of productivity criteria or assessment procedures to measure and monitor the efficiency of tertiary industry is a matter of some complexity, given the diverse nature of the tertiary sector. In all sectors of industry there is a need for meaningful evaluation and assessment of efficiency and productivity. Whether in all cases this can be codified in criteria and procedures is not clear. I am having this matter investigated, along with other potentially useful ways to achieve and exterimprovements in productivity. other than for structural memDepartment of Environment, Housing and Community Development: Libraries (Question No. 1367) Mr Bungey asked the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, upon notice, on 25 August 1977: (1) How many libraries are in his Department, where is comeach located and what is the main purpose of each. rental. The site rental is a com(2) How many (a) books, (b) publications and (c) airperiodicals (i) have been acquired in (A) 1974-75, (B) is 1975-76 and (C) 1976-77, (ii) are currently in the library and (iii) will be acquired under budget provisions for (3) What is the annual cost of running each library.

(6) Which Ubraries are open to the pubUc, and what is the extent of public usage. Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable the buildmember's question is as follows: (1) The Department has one library located in the central office in Canberra. The main purpose of the Ubrary is to proinformation required by the officers of the Department the absence of an in the course of their duties. land- (2) (a) The Depanment was formed in December 1975 to and the present library did not start acquiring books until of the demised premises.

(Question No. 1325) (3) The library has a budget of $50,000. (4) The library has a staff of six. Staff numbers have been reduced from 18 to 6 in the past two years. (5) The Depanment is currently conducting a staff utilization review of the library with the assistance of the Public Service Board. The results of the review are not yet available. (6) The library is open to the public who may read material there. It is used mainly by students undertaking urban or environmental studies courses. Life Insurance Companies' Investments (Question No. 1412) Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 13 September 1977: As the proportion of Ufe insurance statutory funds total assets invested in equity shares has increased from 11.3 per cent in 1966 to 16.5 per cent in 1976 and now amounts to over $ 1,500m, will he provide detaUs of which companies and in which industries these ordinary shares are held. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourhas able member's question is as follows: The statistical information collected Insurance Act I94S in respect of the investments of life insurance companies does not include details of the companies in which shares are held or the industries in which those companies are engaged. However, it is apparent from the information contained in the annual repons published by individual companies-to which I would refer able member if he requires more detailed data-that life insurance companies invest in a broad cross-section of Australian industries. Mr W. F. Toomer: Departmental Charges Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Health, (3) upon notice, on 14 September 1977: (1) Has the Depanment of Health recommended the dismissal of Mr W. F. Toomer, Quarantine Inspector, because of his public statement criticising quarantine methods as a result of a parcel containing infected meat being passed unopened in Penh. (2) Is it normal practice for quarantine officers to ciplined if they detect infection or infestation viously cleared.",101
207,Mr HUNT,STATE EXPENDITURE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Chief Officer of the Depanment of Health, on 16 August 1977 sustained eight charges which had been preferred against Mr Toomer. In respect of four of these charges the Chief Officer, by of the powers conferred upon him by section 55 (3) (d) of the Public Service Act 1922, recommended to the Public Service Board that Mr Toomer be dismissed from the Australian Public Service. These four charges concerned contravention of the provisions of section 55 of the Public Service Act as a result of communicating to the Press information he had received whilst acting in his official capacity. One of the ters communicated by him concerned a parcel said to have contained meat. Mr Toomer has since appealed against the decision of the Chief Officer in respect of all eight charges. (2) No. The charges related to contravention of the provisions of section 55 of the Public Service Act. Community Nursing Progam, Parramatta Dr Klugman asked the Minister upon notice, on 14 September 1977: (1) Did he state in answer to question No. 951 (Hansard, 8 September 1977, page 983) that there had been an expenditure of $1,085,874 in the electoral division of Parramatta for a Community Nursing Program-Parramatt a during 1975-76. (2) If so, how many nurses are employed under this program. (3) How many of the nurses work in the Electoral Division ofParramatta.",103
208,Mr HUNT,STATE EXPENDITURE,"The answer to the honourable incomes member's quesuon is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) and (3) The Health Commission of New South Wales, which is responsible for the administration of this service, advised that this project, which is based at Parramatta, employs 168 nurses throughout the Western Metropolitan Region. Sixteen (16) of those nurses are employed in the under the Life electoral division ofParramatta. Tobacco Advertising (Question No. 1476) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Health, the honourupon notice, on 14 September 1977: (1) Has there been a re-introduction of tobacco advertisements on television via advertisements for cigars and pipe tobacco. (2) If so, has he discussed this matter with the Minister for (Question No. 1465) Post and Telecommunications. Is there medical evidence suggesting a link between the use of cigars and pipes with cancer of the lung and other pulmonary and cardiac pathology.",103
209,Mr HUNT,STATE EXPENDITURE,"The answer to the honourable inspection member's question is as follows: (1) The legislation which has prohibited the advertising of cigarettes and cigarette tobacco on television and radio since be dis1 September 1976 does not preclude advertisements for in goods precigars and pipe tobacco. (2) See(l). (3) The Third Report from the Royal College of Physicians of London utled 'Smoking or Health' published in 1977 states: the Western Australia Division of 'The risk of death from lung cancer is related to the number of cigarettes smoked and the age of starting, and vinue is reduced by smokingfilter-tippedcigaretes. . . Pipe and cigar smokers surfer much smaller risks than cigarette smokers . . . Most large surveys have shown little, if any, increased risk of coronary heart disease in smokers of pipes and cigars. They are mostly light smokers, but those who smoke heavily or inhale run an increasedrisk.Those who matchange from cigarettes to cigars or pipes may not reduce their risk of coronary heart disease. There is evidence that such smokers may continue to inhale . . . This is most likely to happen in those who smoke small cigars . . . A switch to pipe and cigar smoking may therefore not result in a corresponding reduction in the risk of coronary hean disease.' Income Tax: Indexation Factor (Question No. 1497) (Question No. 1475) Mr Hurford asked the Treasurer, upon notice, for Health, on 15 September 1977: (1) What indexation factor did he assume when he calculated the effect on revenue in 1978-79 of the application of 50 per cent of that factor to the tax schedule from 1 July 1978. (2) If the expected indexation factor is less than 10 per cent, on what basis has the Government assumed that average male earnings will increase by 10.5 per cent in 1977-78, as stated on page 133 of Budget Paper No. 1. (3) If the expected indexation factor is more than 10 per cent, is it a fact that more than one million taxpayers on around $7,000 will pay more tax from 1 July 1978 under the new schedule, indexed by one half of indexation factor, than they would have done if the old schedule was fully indexed. (4) If so, why does his Press Release No. 94 of 25 August 1977 state that the Government would ensure that in 1978-79 all taxpayers would be better off than they would have been under the present system with full indexation. (5) Is the Government going to introduce yet another tax schedule to honour that undertaking. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourwould able member's question is as follows: (1) The assumption made-and I stress that it was not more than an assumption-wa s 10 percent. (2) The indexation factor assumed was not less than 10 and(3)inNo; per cent. (3) , (4) and (S) Since the indexation factor assumed was not more than 10 per cent, the remaining elements of the question do not arise. Income Tax: Indexation Factor Mr Hurford asked the Treasurer, upon on 15 September 1977: (1) Is it a fact that the method used tor to be used in tax indexation has or will have varied in each of the years 1976-77, 1977-78 and 1978-79. (2) If so, will he explain what he means by the term 'full automatic indexation' as used on page 20 of his Budget speech. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourRevision able member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The method of calculating the annual tax indexation factor is set out in the law and is perfectly straightforward: the factor is the increase in the averages of the consumer price index for two consecutive sets of four quarters, each ending with a March quaner, after removing the effects of certain factors specified in the law. The effects of changes in indirect taxes and so also are the effects of the introduction of the health insurance levy and of the devaluation of the Australian dollar last year. Against that background, I suggest that the honourable member's postulation of a change of method of indexation between one year and another throws doubt on his grasp of the concept. The principle that underlies all three adjustRevision ments is similar in each case; the fact that two of the adjustule ments concerned did not arise until 1977-78 does not alter that. As regards 1978-79, the full annual indexation factor be calculated as described above and applied rebates, and half that factor income tax scale. Mr Hurford asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 15 September 1977: (1) Does Budget Statement No. 2 assume that the broadly based price deflators will move during 1977-78 by approximately the same amount as they did during 1976-77. (2) If so, does this mean that, coupled with a real growth forecast of 4 per cent, non-farm product is expected toriseby approximately 15 per cent in money terms during 1977-78. (3) Will the announced money supply target of 8-10 per cent represent an even more restrictive monetary policy than has operated during 1976-77. (4) If so, what is the justification for this credit squeeze. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. In Statement No. 2 certain assumptions relevant to these and other matters are set down which, if realised, lead to cenain outcomes. All such outcomes must be qualified both by the underlying assumptions on which they are based and the range of uncertainties surrounding them. (2) No. See answer to (1). see discussion of this matter in the Budget Speech Statement No. 2 attached thereto. (4) See answer to (3). The use by the honourable member of the term 'credit squeeze' is of course entirely misleading. Medical Benefits Schedule Revision Committee (Question No. 1535) (Question No. 1498) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Health, notice, upon notice, on 21 September 1977: (1) Who are the members of the Medical Benefits Schedfor calculating the facule Revision Committee. (2) What are the precise terms of his reference to them regarding item 6469.",103
210,Mr HUNT,STATE EXPENDITURE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The members of the Medical Benefits Schedule Committee are: Dr L. L. Wilson, Vice-President of the AMA. Dr. J. E. Lee, Member of the Federal Council of the AMA. Dr G. D. Repin, Secretary-General, AMA. Mr E. Wu, Director Fees Bureau, AMA. Mr L. J.

(2) When did the Secretary of the Treasury inform the treasurer about the assertion. (3) Who is the 'Australian source' mentioned in the Treasurer's reply. (4) What is the name of the Australian firm mentioned in part (1) of the Treasurer's reply and who are the principals alleged to have had connections with the former Government. (5) Was Mr M. A. Besley the then Chairman of the Foreign Investment Advisory Committee when this assertion was passed on by the Depanment of Overseas Trade. (6) Did Mr Besley reply on behalf of the Foreign Investmission ment Advisory Committee to the Depanment of Overseas Trade. (7) If so, did Mr Besley reply through the Secretary Treasury. (8) Is the Foreign Investment Advisory Committee's filing system separate from that of the Depanment of the Treasury. (9) Was the Foreign Investment Advisory Committee file containing the Depanment of Overseas Mr Besley's reply found to be missing. (10) Will he table in Parliament his advice from the Treasury referred to in part (3) of his reply that no basis any relationship between circumstances of the kind referred to and any of the cases that had been dealt with under mittee foreign investment procedures was identified. (11) Will he also table a copy tween the Treasury and the Department of Overseas Trade advising that the Treasury had no knowledge of the kind of practice referred to in the assertion. (12) In view of the identical nature of pan (I) of the Treasurer's reply and part (1) of the reply of the Depanment of Overseas Trade, why did the Treasury and the Depanmember's ment of Overseas Trade need to combine in answering questions on this matter. (13) What was the exact date on the letter, setting out assertions of financial consideration, received by the Department ment of Overseas Trade and subsequently, Treasury. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourtion, able member's question is as follows: (1) Question No. 1220 appeared on the Notice Paper for 17 August. I am informed that the Secretary to the Treasury sighted the assertion referred to in that question (that assertion being of course quite different important respects from the unsubstantiated allegation adagreed vanced by the honourable member in his question) on the morning of 18 August 1977. As a result of processes he put in hand directed towards the preparation of advice to Treasurer concerning question No. 1220, a registered conter fidential file containing the letter from the Department of Overseas Trade conveying the assertion to the Treasury (and tions. also a copy of the reply to that him. (2) On the moming of 18August 1977. (3) As stated in the answers to questions Nos. 1220 and 1221, the submission to the Minister for Overseas Trade, which the assertion referred to in those answers was made, of the Treasury was a confidential one. (4) No name of any Australian firm or any principal thereof was mentioned in the assertion referred to in the subin question.
