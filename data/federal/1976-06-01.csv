2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Social Security Payments: Indexation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That distress is being caused to social security recipients by the delay in adjusting pensions to the Consumer Price Index months after goods and services haverisenand that many medications, formerly a pharmaceutical benefit, must now be paid for. In addition, State Housing Authority waiting lists for low rental dwellings for pensioners become never less and funeral costs increase ever greater. Your petitioners call on the Australian Government as a matter of urgency to: Adjust social security payments instantly and automatically on announcement of increases in the quarterly Consumer Price Index. Restore pharmaceutical benefits The States Grants (Dwellings for Pensioners) Act 1974, eroded by inflation, be updated and increased to overcome the back-log. The funeral benefit be updated to 60 per cent of a reasonable funeral cost. This benefit when introduced in 1943 at 200 shillings ($20.00) was seven times the pension at that time of 27 shillings ($2.70) per week or more than twice the basic wage of 97 shillings ($9.70).

That Technical Assistance Grants and Administrative Support Grants to community organisations are needed to partially redress the gross imbalance in technical expertise and resources suffered by community groups in pressing the community's case against the exploiter. That a proper balance between the Government's program of public austerity and the need for action in conserwould be a modest increase in the budget allocations read in these areas over that of 1975-76.

That further mining and expon of uranium from Australia except for bio-medical purposes be banned. 2.

The humble petition of the undersigned zens of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. That Australia is not well-endowed with natural forest areas only amounting to 4.5 per cent of the total land area. 2. That very little of this forested area, national parks, most of the remainder being directly (as State forests etc.) or indirectly (as Crown lands, over which forestry exercises timber extraction rights) under forestry control. 3. That most of this remainder is liable to be totally destroyed by woodchip projects, due to soil erosion, nutrient loss, fire damage to young saplings in artificial forest regeneration projects. 4.

And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, Act and restore by Mr Connolly. Petition received. Income Tax: Land and Water Rates To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully Uranium showeth: That the undersigned persons believe that the $300 limit on income tax deductibility in respect of personal residential land and water rates is unrealistic and is a discriminatory income tax penalty.

And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, will take immediby Mr Connolly. wishes expressed in our petition Petition received. Cadet Corps To the Honourable the Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the three service cadet forces have great value in the development of the youth of Australia. That the disbanding of the cadet forces will disperse expertise and interest of those involved, and in citisome cases negate the effons of many people over many years. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will reconsider its decision and that the Government is reserved in will reinstate the cadet forces. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Hayden. Petition received. United Nations Conference on Trade and To the Speaker and the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.

And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Hurford. Petition received. Taxation: Home Mortgage Interest To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned citizens of Commonwealth of Australia by this our humble petition respectfully showeth: 1. That the proposal to exclude all persons from the benefit of tax deductibility for mortgage interest rates other than first home buyers in their first five years of home purchase is a repudiauon of the Government's election undertaking to maintain the scheme. 2. That the effect of the proposal will cause hardship to many current beneficiaries of the scheme, in that existing benefits will terminate, thus putting housing loan repayments beyond reach. Your peuuoners therefore humbly pray: (a) that the Government reconsider its decision to drastically curtail the scheme; (b) that the principles applying to the scheme as introduced by the Labor Government be maintained; and (c) that benefits be upgraded by indexation to take account of the effects of inflation. And your peuuoners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Les Johnson. Petition received.

The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That those who have retired and those who are about to retire, are being severely and adversely affected by inflation the fourth sesand Australian economic circumstances. The continuance of the means test on pensions causes undue hardship to them. We call on the Government to immediately abolish the importance in mean's test on all Aged Pensions. To ensure a pension for all on retirement, and a guarantee in that all Australian citizens will retire with dignity. Acknowledge that a pension is arightand not a charity. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr MCLean. Petition received. Income Tax To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the existence of a system of double taxation of personal incomes whereby both the Australian Government and State Governments had the power to vary personal income taxes would mean that taxpayers who worked in more than one State in any year would: (a) be faced with complicated variations in his or her personal income taxes between States; (b) find that real after-tax wages for the same job would vary from State to State even when gross wages were advertised as being the same; and (c) require citizens to maintain records of income earned in each State. Your peuuoners therefore humbly pray that a system of double income tax on personal incomes be not reintroduced. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Morris. Petition received. Newcastle Dockyard To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition qf the undersigned citizens of Newcastle respectfully showeth: That shipbuilding and repairs play a vital role in the economic stability of the Newcastle region. That a recent study by the Hunter Valley Research Foundation showed that 50 000 people were partially or wholly maintained by the State Dockyard. That stability is at present in jeopardy, as a new ship order is required within the next few weeks if serious unemployment and hardship is to be avoided. That the previous Government's plan for the building of a graving dock in Newcastle should be continued as proper ship repair facilities are a vital factor in the maintenance of a viable shipbuilding industry. That the Government's election pledge to restore business and cut unemployment can be implemented in Newcasde if new orders and a graving dock are granted. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government place immediate orders with the Newcastle State Dockyard and implement the previous Government's plan to build a graving dock in Newcastle. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by MrMorris. Petition received. FOREIGN AID: DAIRY PRODUCTS",18
3,Mr YATES,Unknown,"I give notice that on the next day of sitting I shall move: That this House believes that Australian foreign aid programs should take into account and use the surplus Australian agricultural products, and, it therefore calls upon the Government to consider appointing an interdepartmental study group in co-operation with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the food and pharmaceutical industries to examine at once the possibility of using the surplus dried milk and other agricultural dairy produce for the making of protein biscuits and compressed milk compound tablets for the relief of starvation and malnutrition in the countries taking cause it will be of direct assistance to the countries concerned, on the one hand, and and the taxpayer on the other. NA EAST TIMOR: GOVERNMENT",22
4,Mr BRYANT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Does the Australian Government recognise the Government of Portugal or the Government of Indonesia as the legal administering authority in East Timor and its territorial waters?  legally Portugal is still allegedly the administering authority but, after all, it opted out of that role and there have been too few prepared to remind the world community of Portugal's own delinquency in this regard. Portugal has a great deal to answer for in not bringing East Timor through steps to self-determination and taking other measures of humanitarian assistance and development. There is no doubt that Portugal with respect to its record as a colonial power in this part of the world particularly, if not elsewhere, has much to answer for. I think, however, that it ought also be borne in mind that when events changed in Portugal and the former regime was overthrown the former Australian Government could well have taken account of the pretty well accepted maxim that events that can occur in one part of the world can have a fairly immediate and direct effect far in excess of its normal sphere of influence. I would have thought therefore that the previous Government should have been taking steps-for example, during the former Prime Minister's lengthy tours overseas there was no visit to Portugal-to discuss events relating to East Timor.",22
5,Mr BRYANT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Who m do we deal with on this question? That is the point. Whom do we deal with about East Timor?  Notice of Motion we have been dealing with both the United Nations and the Indonesian Government since the latter intervened in the dispute and that is in marked contrast to what was done by the previous Australian Government which washed its hands and dealt with virtually nobody. NA,22
6,Mr FALCONER,BUDGET OUTLAYS,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer tell the House whether Budget outlays for the current year are hkely to be higher or lower than estimated at the Australian foreign aid, betime of the Budget last year? direct help to the dairy industry",22
7,Mr LYNCH,BUDGET OUTLAYS,"I can make clear to the House that the Government does expect that it will be able to maintain Budget outlays at approximately the same level as was budgeted for in the Hayden Budget last year. If this is the case-I am confident that barring any unforeseen eventuality it will be the case-it will, as I recall, be the first time since 1968 that that form of management has been so applied to maintain the target for Budget outlays as at the time of the Budget itself. I think that in itself is a matter of credit to the Government. Of course this diners very markedly indeed from the situation in 1974-75 when under the former Adiriinistration total outlays at the end of the year exceeded those which were estimated in the Budget of that year by approximately $ 1,700m. EAST TIMOR: SELF DETERMINATION",22
8,Dr JF CAIRNS,BUDGET OUTLAYS,"I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs: Does the Australian Government intend to protest to Indonesia and to the United Nations at the obvious and planned failure of the Government of Indonesia to be associated with any act of self determination for the people of East Timor, and against what in fact is the blatant denial of this right to the people of East Timor?  well known. Since this Government was elected - agai n in marked contrast to our predecessors-w e have been protesting, and not merely protesting verbally but making representations both to the Indonesian Government and earlier to Portuguese authorities. We have also long held and have constantly stated, both here and in the United Nations since we came into office, our policy on Timor relating to self determination, the withdrawal of forces and the resumption of humanitarian aid. We have also said, and again in the United Nations, that observation of the process of self determination in East Timor should best be carried out by the United Nations. In the event, regrettably no indication was forthcoming from the United Nations that it would be involved in yesterday's meeting in East Timor. We accordingly decided that it would be appropriate for us not to attend. Some form of United Nations participation and observation, I believe, is essential and we would welcome this development, in accordance with the line we have taken since being elected to Government. In particular, we are hopeful that the United Nations special representative will soon be able to visit East Timor, again in accordance with his mandate, to reassess the situation in the territory. We hope he will be able to undertake this assessment not only in the light of the outcome of yesterday's meeting in Dili but also with a view to assessing all shades of opinion in the territory. But without that United Nations participation, this Government did not beheve it could lend its presence to what took place as a further act in this tragic affair. NA",22
9,Mr YATES,AUSTRALIAN AWARDS,Will the Prime Minister tell us on whose initiative changes were made to the Order of Austraha? When does the Prime Minister propose to make these new awards?,23
10,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,AUSTRALIAN AWARDS,"The House will be aware that on the initiative of the former Government the imperial honours were to be discontinued and the Order of Australia was instituted. An independent committee established under statute with the Palace makes recommendations concerning the Order of Australia, and the Government is able to make a recommendation to that committee if it so wishes. The committee will, however, make its own decisions. That is the way in which the statute for the Order of Austraha is set up. There had been a view from the Council of the Order of Australia that limiting the Order to 3 levels was too restrictive. On the one hand, the lowest order was regarded as too high a level to provide an appropriate award for many people who have performed meritorious service throughout Australia and it was believed that there ought to be an Australian award to cover such people. At the same time it was believed that there ought to be an award of particular distinction from the Australian order which would be rare and limited to services of the highest possible quality for Australia. Therefore what has happened as a result of an initiative on the part of the Council of the Order of Australia and on my recommendation to Her Majesty is that the Order of Australia should be extended in the way that was announced by the Governor General last night. There will be 5 levels of award, and that will better enable the Council of the Order of Australia to cover the needs of acknowledging the services of Australians to the nation. Honourable gentlemen will also be aware, of course, of a decision taken by the Government that imperial awards will be reinstated. Honourable gentlemen may expect decisions to be made in relation to that to follow the pattern that used to prevail before an unfortunate interregnum occurred. EAST TIMOR: UNITED NATIONS ENVOY'S MISSION",23
11,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN AWARDS,"Can the Minister for Foreign Affairs inform the House of what progress has been made by the United Nations envoy in continuing his mission to Timor? Following yesterday's farcical procedure to integrate Portuguese East Timor into Indonesia, has the Minister any information to suggest that the United Nations envoy will be deliberately obstructed by Indonesia in his endeavours to continue his mission?  would lead me to conclude that Indonesia will obstruct the return of the United Nations representative to East Timor. I do have some information which indicates that Mr Winspeare Guicciardi still desires to return to the territory. Of course, had the questioner listened to the answer I gave in reply to the question asked by the honourable member for Lalor he would have heard me say that we have hopes for some form of United Nations presence to return to East Timor and specifically that Mr Winspeare Guicciardi will resume his visit to reassess the wishes of a greater number and more representative number of people within East Timor than he was able to do before. We would do all we could to assist his transport into the territory, if that were possible. It is quite clear that it would require now the co-operation of the Indonesian Government. The short answer to the latter part of the question is as I stated, that we have no indication that Indonesia seeks to obstruct, but we would wish the United Nations representative to act with some expedition in getting to Timor. NA NA",23
12,Mr MACKENZIE,COMMISSIONS,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. Bearing in mind the need for restraint in pubhc expenditure and the provisions in both the Postal Services Act and the Telecommunications Act, whereby the Government is required to make good any discrepancy between the revenue from tariffs and the operaung costs, can the Minister assure the House that both Commissions have been required to abide by their operating charter which relates to the provision of efficient services at rates and charges as low as practicable?",24
13,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,COMMISSIONS,"I am very well aware of the requirements of the Postal Commission and the Telecommunications Commission under the relevant Acts. I inform the honourable member, and indeed the whole House, that the Commissions were established only last July. There has been a settling down period, and now there is a greater degree of efficiency and understanding of the requirements by the Commissions. They do have to achieve at least 50 per cent of their expenditure for capital works out of revenue. The Postal Commission, of course, is labour intensive. In the case of Telecom there is a large capital requirement and proposed expenditure next year is of the order of something more than $800m. So there will be a need for internal funding of a little more than $400m by the Telecommunications Commission. The relationships between the Commissions and me are of a high order. The Commissions have a great understanding now of their need to take into account social requirements, and indeed cultural requirements, in their activities. have been asked a number of questions without notice, and indeed questions on notice, which have helped us to know what is in the minds of honourable members. Because of the discussions that have occurred the Commissions are veiy much aware of their need to serve the Australian community in the broadest sense. I hope to be announcing a little later initiatives in relation the marketing and the servicing of both the Commissions which I am certain will please the honourable member and every other honourable member in the House. NA NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Prime Minister a question without notice. Is it a fact that Mr Austin Holmes, the Director of the Priorities Review Staff in his Department and the Chairman of the Medibank investigation team appointed last January, has now been instructed to devise a new scheme for hospital arrangements with the States? When did he get these further instructions and when is he to make his report? Will his terms of reference and the names of any colleagues be announced, as was the case last January? Will the report be tabled in this case?",24
14,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,WITH STATES,"Mr Austin Holmes is a valued adviser to the Government. I believe he was a valued adviser to the previous Government There are a number of tasks in which he would be involved. What will come from a number of areas in relation to discussions that will be taking place on 11 June with the State Health Ministers is a paper concerning precise details of matters we would want to discuss with the States. I am not quite sure which public servants are involved in preparing detailed matter in relation to that. But if that is what the honourable gentleman is referring to, there are no formal reports in relation to it. The Commonwealth's view would quite obviously become fully known once it is set before the 6 States, or, if not, very shortly thereafter. What we are doing is completely within the principle of supporting State hospitals to 50 per cent of approved expenditures. But as the Minister for Health has indicated on a number of occasions, there must be concern for economy as well as for efficiency and high quality health care. I would like to pay a tribute to the way in which the Minister and his advisers have handled this matter over succeeding weeks and months. Because of necessity this was part of the package of economic proposals announced by I the Treasurer and it was not possible to have prior discussions with the funds to enable them to have their schedules ready for announcement at the same time as the Treasurer's statement, nor was it possible to have prior discussion with all sections of the Australian community that might be involved. But the Minister has moved very swiftly in these directions. It was because it to was impracticable to have discussions before the Treasurer's statement that the starting time for the new, revised and vastly improved proposals offering health care and a choice to all Australians will be 1 October. The matters of detail can be pursued appropriately in a spirit of consultation and reasonable negotiation. Whether it be the States or the funds or anyone else, they will find that is the approach this Government adopts. Let me say again that the Minister and his officials I beheve have handled a difficult matter well and with skill. They have offered to the Government, and, through the Government's adoption of the proposals, to the people of Australia, the possibility of maintaining universal government-sponsored health care of high standards which will at the same time avoid the quite tragic mistakes which have been made in countries like Britain and Canada. NA",24
15,Mr GROOM,DEVONPORT AIRPORT,"I direct my question to the Minister for Transport. Is the Minister aware of a statement prominently reported in northern Tasmanian newspapers today in which Senator Devitt, a Labor senator, predicts the closure of the Devonport Airport as a result of cuts in Government expenditure on transport? So that this irresponsible speculation by the honourable senator",25
16,Mr SPEAKER,DEVONPORT AIRPORT,Order! The honourable member will ask his question.,25
17,Mr GROOM,DEVONPORT AIRPORT,"Yes, Mr Speaker, I will proceed straight to the question. So that this comment can be effectively refuted",25
18,Mr SPEAKER,DEVONPORT AIRPORT,Order! The honourable gentleman is not obeying the instruction from the Chair. He will ask his question without comment or I will rule him out of order.,25
19,Mr GROOM,DEVONPORT AIRPORT,"I accept your ruling, Mr Speaker. Can the Minister assure Tasmamans that he has no plans to close this vital airport?",25
20,Mr NIXON,DEVONPORT AIRPORT,"I am at a loss to understand why Senator Devitt should venture to make such irresponsible statements. The facts are that this question was last looked at by my predecessor last year. I thought at that time that my predecessor had made it plain that in his view the 3 airports along the northern coast of Tasmania were a vital part of the Tasmanian economic system. I thought he said at the time that he had no intention of changing that situation. In respect of the speculation raised by Senator Devitt, let me make it quite plain that the cuts effected in the so called mini-Budget in no way affect the operations of those airports. The honourable member for Braddon can reassure his people that the future of the airports is not affected by the cuts in the Department of Transport's budget. Discussions have taken place and are continuing with the local government authorities to see whether the airports can be transferred under the local ownership scheme. That in no way cuts across what I have said. NA",25
21,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,WAGE INDEXATION,"I preface my question, which is directed to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, by referring to the decision of the Arbitration Commission last week to adopt one of the Government's options in implementing a system of wage indexation based upon the plateau of Average Award Rates for adult males- a principle in line with the application of the Australian Council of Trade Unions in the parent case in 1974.1 now ask: Can we expect that from now on the Government will support that principle before the Arbitration Commission in all future hearings of the Commission in relation to wage indexation? If so, will the Minister also support the principle that hearings of these cases should be dispensed with unless there are special circumstances justifying a Full Bench hearing again and that henceforth these wage indexation principles will be applied automatically and quarterly?",25
22,Mr STREET,WAGE INDEXATION,"The honourable member for Hindmarsh is quite correct in saying that the decision of the Full Bench on the national wage case last week followed closely the submissions of the Australian Council of Trade Unions in 1974. Indeed, I think these were not dissimilar to propositions that the honourable member himself advanced when his Party was in government and which, had they been accepted at that time, might have had a further moderating effect on wages during the intervening period. The Government notes that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission did not accept our submission in relation to 6-monthly hearings. The hearings will be quarterly, and the principles that the Commission appUed in the April 1975 decision will continue to apply-that is, the appropriateness of adjusting wages for movements in the consumer price index and, if so, to what extent, they should be adjusted, will be looked at by the Commission in the Ught of circumstances at the time. Equally the Government will be making its submissions to the Commission in the Ught of circumstances at the time. In relation to the last point raised by the honourable member, that is, the automatic application of the CPI, the Commission, in its original decision, put forward its reasons for not accepting that proposition. The Commission was very cautious in accepting the indexation proposals. One of the danger signals it saw was an automatic application of the CPI. I note that the Commission has seen fit not to alter its principles in that respect, and from the Government's point of view we believe that that is a proper decision. We do not agree that adjustments should be automatic; neither does the Commission itself. Therefore we shall be putting our submissions in the Ught of circumstances at the time and judging at the time whether the CPI has been significantly influenced in specific instances, for example, by indirect taxes, we shall be arguing for discounting on those grounds before the Commission on occasions when that may be appropriate.

27,Mr COTTER,CONCORDE AIRCRAFT,I address my question to the Minister for Transport. It follows on from a queswas tion I asked the Minister last month. Can he inform the House when he will be in a position announce a decision to allow direct overseas nights from Port Hedland to Bali? Is the Minister aware that approximately 40 000 people in the Pilbara region are anxiously awaiting this decision and that some already have made tentative travel plans pending the decision?,26
28,Mr NIXON,CONCORDE AIRCRAFT,"As I explained to the honourable member when he last asked the question, this is a much more complex matter than one would assume because certain international obligations have to be followed. There have to be discussions with the Indonesian Government and with Garuda Indonesian Airways which has an arrangement with Qantas Airways Ltd. Therefore I am unable to facilitate a fast answer for him. Procedures of governments, as he will well know, are sometimes slow. He is not the only interested person although he is the only honourable member who has asked a question about it.

Will the Minister advise the action he is taking to make equal allocations to the States on the basis population?",27
36,Mr HUNT,INFLUENZA VACCINE,"I am delighted that the honourcopies able member for Macquarie has brought this matter to the attention of the House. I had disDepartment cussions last week with the Director of the ComState monwealth Serum Laboratories to ascertain there was a disparity in distribution among various States in relation to their populations. was informed by the Director that the Laboracomments. tories had on this occasion adopted the past tice of allocating serum to the States according the orders that had been registered with chemists for sale? in the various States. It appears that in some States individuals are lodging orders for the vaccine at more than one chemist and, of course, has caused a greater demand than normal in the circumstances. I do not blame the public for being somewhat panicked because of the concorde fusion that exists in the minds of a lot of people between the 2 strains of influenza currently news. The first is A Swine influenza, a number cases of which were identified at New Jersey the United States of America some months ago. There was considerable media coverage incident and a considerable amount was given to it. Since then no further cases been identified. Medical authorities in have informed me that there is no possibihty of A have Swine influenza reaching Australia during this aration winter. The A Victoria influenza strain is not nearly as other virulent or dangerous to people. I ask people in Australia not to be panicked by the confusion that has been created about the 2 strains of influenza. I have asked CSL to examine ways and means of trying in future to arrive at a more equitable distribution of vaccines. I also say, once again, that CSL has done a tremendous job. It has worked 7 days a week since it began manufacture, and by the end of June it will have produced 2 million doses of the vaccine. It is to be commended for what it has done. I think produce was the first country in the world to the vaccine. The honourable member may rest assured that we are doing what we can to see that there is an equitable distribution of the vaccine to all parts of Australia. NA",27

39,Mr CORBETT,SERVICES,"Can the Minister for Post a and Telecommunications advise the percentage increase in costs of operating the Australian Postal Commission and the Australian Telecommunications Commission by comparison with keting the cost of operating the Postmaster-General's Department? If he cannot do so, when will operating costs of these commissions become available? Are the Postal and Telecommuniconscious cations Commissions required to keep as close possible to a balanced budget in their operbers ations? If so, has this resulted in a restriction mail services, particularly in rural areas? Is there any indication that this policy may require a further increase in postal charges?",28
40,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,SERVICES,"Comparative ngures were provided by the Australian Postal Compossibly mission and the Austrahan Telecommunications discussions. Commission during the 1975-76 Budget discussions. Expenditure by the Postal Commission increased from $423m to $512.5m, an increase of 21.2 per cent. Revenue of the Postal Comnoted mission increased from $360m to $512.8m, an increase of 42.4 per cent. That is not a bad achievement. The honourable member for years Maranoa, who has had a long association with this problem, will know, of course, that in the Postmaster-General's Department days those commissions were treated as one large cal enterprise. In 1974-75 the deficit in the postal area was $63m. The expenditure of the Telecomthe munications Commission was $980m, and has increased to $ 1,331m, an increase of 35.8 per cent. Revenue has gone from $ 1,080m to operation $l,484m, an increase of 37.4 percent. In the telepart communications area the surplus for 1974-75 was $ 100m. That is the answer to thefirstpart of the honourable member's question. I turn now to the second part of the question. As I have already indicated, under the Act the Commissions are to meet all operating costs to provide 50 per cent of capital from internal sources. In the case of the Postal Commission, which is highly labour intensive, this will not large but in the case of the Telecommunications Commission, as the honourable member well knows, the requirement will be substantial. In answer to some of the detail in the question let me say that the movement of mail in many areas is dependent upon carriage by private mail tractors. The decline in rural activity and the greater use of private vehicles have affected at which mail contractors in some areas have tendered for the service of carriage of mails. Where the Commission believes that tenders were excessive it has reluctantly reduced the service in some areas from 5 times a week to 3 times week. A blanket approach cannot be taken because in some rural areas there has been an improvement in the service provided. As I indicated earlier, a number of new marinitiatives will be announced very shortly. I am certain that they will please the honourable the member, as they will please all honourable members. I want to say this: We have been very of the probing questions and the as interest shown particularly by honourable memwho represent rural seats. In response to of that and in response to the Commission's work and my own interest I believe that we will make decisions shortly which will be pleasing to everyone. As to the last part of the question, the honourable member will know that I cannot react to it until after the Budget NA",28
41,Mr CONNOR,REVIEW OF MEDICAL PRACTICE,"Has the Minister for Health the decision yesterday of the Federal Assembly of the Australian Medical Association to set up a peer group committee within 3 to 4 to check Medibank fee abuses? Has he considered the alternative of the powers under secold tions 34, 35 and 36 of the New South Wales Medical Practitioners Act under which the MediPractitioners Charges Committee can review patients' accounts promptly at their request on basis of such criteria as the type of service and the requisite professional standard of competence? If not, will he do so and request the coof other States in introducing counterlegislation in substitution for the delays inherent in a non statutory peer group?",28
42,Mr HUNT,REVIEW OF MEDICAL PRACTICE,"At the conference which I had yesterday with the federal body of the Australian Medical Association I found that the Assembly was agreeable to entering into discussions with and me and my Department to establish guidelines for a peer review of good medical practice and procedure in Austraha. I am not aware of the secbe tions of the Act to which the honourable member has referred. I think they would apply principally to the manner in which doctors charge for their services. The peer review committee needs to be understood in the context in which it is talked about. I notice that the honourable member for conMaribyrnong nods in agreement. He understands what a peer review is. Under the Health the Insurance Act any doctor whoflagrantlyabuses the system can be brought to trial. A number of inquiries are being conducted at the present time and in the very near future prosecutions will be launched against a small number of doctors as a consequence of investigations that have taken place which indicate tlte possibility of abuse under the Health Insurance Act. I am sure that the peer review will have a much longer-term benefit for standards of health care in Australia. Mr Connor- A long-delayed result, too.",28
43,Mr HUNT,REVIEW OF MEDICAL PRACTICE,It cannot be done quickly. Those who understand the problem know that it cannot be done quickly. The fact is that the AMA agreeing to enter into discussions on this matter and is prepared to sit down and look at the guidelines to ensure that the standards of professional medical practice in Australia reach a much higher level than they have probably reached in the past. We are hopeful that the medical profession will achieve this within 3-year period to obviate any necessity to first introduce legislation laying down guidelines medical practice in Australia. The other matter of the sheerflagrantabuse the charging of patients or the abuse of Medibank falls into a different category. There is provision under the Health Insurance Act to take action against doctors where sufficient evidence indicates that there should be a prosecution. NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY:JAPAN,29
44,Mr CADMAN,REVIEW OF MEDICAL PRACTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the recent decision by the Japanese Government to ratify the Nuclear Trip Non-prohferation Treaty? If so, has the decision of a recent implications for Australia and the Pacific area? Will he take this opportunity to applaud the decision?  fact, applauded the decision by the Japanese Diet to ratify the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty under the terms of which non-nuclear weapon states undertake not to receive, manucision facture or acquire by any means nuclear pure weapons or other nuclear explosive devices and agree to place all civil nuclear facilities under ternational atomic energy agency safeguards. I recall, this brings the number of countries which have ratified the Treaty to ninety-eight and Japan's inclusion in this number is a most significant step. The Japanese Government, Uke the Australian Government, has been actively participating in international efforts to bring clear proliferation under effective control. We believe that the decision by Japan to ratify the Treaty will in itself help to strengthen the international non-proliferation regime. We strongly urge all countries not yet parties to the Treaty to follow Japan's example. As I said at the outset of the answer, we warmly applaud the decision taken by the Diet. NA NA",29

49,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The lead story in the Sunday Mail of 30 May 1976 headed 'Kerr Row' is pure invention. It claims there is a row in the Australian Labor Party over the cost trip overseas by the Governor General and implies that I am promoting the criticism. I am quoted to the effect that Mr Whitlam made a deal with the Governoron overseas trips before his appointment and also I am said to be claiming to know this. I am also said to claim that Sir John Kerr had agreed to rubber-stamp Mr Whitlam's dein exchange for overseas trips. All of this is invention by the writer so far as it touches me. The writer phoned me, it is true. I told him in that I had no knowledge of the matter except As what I had read in one of the books about the events of 11 November. I could confirm only one thing-that there had been no decision in the Cabinet about overseas trips or the Governor General's attitude to his office. There is no row that I know of in the Labor Pany over the nuGovernor-General's trip. What is more, I said nothing at all to the writer suggesting that there was. As a matter of fact, I did not even know that Senator MCLaren had raised the matter until I was questioned by the writer. I have no knowledge whatsoever of any transaction or agreement between the Governor General and the Leader of the Opposition. The journalist concerned intruded upon my privacy by telephoning me at the weekend.

52,Mr HAYDEN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Yes . On Friday 28 May a number of newspapers printed an article attributing certain comments to me generally as a direct quote. In all cases the attribution was inaccurate. My attention was first drawn to this incident from an article in the Brisbane Telegraph of the night of that date which referred to incidents in the House the evening before. The article has a photograph of me and other members of the Parliament, yourself included, Mr Speaker, and I shall talk to you about that later. Attributed to me in a heading above the photograph are the words: 'Liar'says Hayden. The article goes on to claim that I had made such a statement in the Parliament. The Sun News Pictorial, the Mercury, the Townsville Daily Bulletin, the Newcastle Morning Herald and the Adelaide Advertiser of that date carry the same story and I believe other newspapers also carried it, but this is the full range which the ParUamentary Library resources can provide for me. I understand that the Queensland Times at Ipswich also reported something similar. The articles report me stating in quote marks, referring to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser): Your have been lying ever since you took office.

That is vastly different from the way in which the newspapers reported the comments, especially as the newspapers attributed as a direct quote, in quotation marks, the comments I quoted from them a few seconds ago. I checked with the Hansard staff and they advised me that they ran back the tape to check and found that I did not use the words which have been attributed to me by the newspapers. I must make two quick observations. I contacted the Brisbane Telegraph. I was rather surprised at the almost sententious response that I experienced from that newspaper-a n attitude that because other newspapers had reported similarly there did not seem to be any justification for that newspaper to seek to make any correction in the statement it had attributed to me. Secondly, I must also place on record, Mr Speaker, a fair deal of experience I have noted over the past couple of years, and more especially in the past several months, for some newspapers to ignore completely accuracy in reporting what honourable members have said and to attribute comments which are literally incorrect in every conceivable detail. I can only leave it to the sense of professionaUsm on the part of the journaUsts to try to rectify that.

60,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",31
61,Mr CONNOLLY,PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE,"Honourable members will recall that on 20 May 1976 I tabled the 158th report relating to expenditure from the Advance to the Treasurer for the nnancial year 1974-75 and the 159th report which contained Treasury minutes on two previous reports of the Committee. The 160th report which I am tabling today relates to expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for 1974-75 and covers the remaining items included in the previous Committee's annual examination of the expenditure results of departments in that year. In examining expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund the Committee seeks to ascertain whether or not the principles relating to the formulation of estimates have been adopted by the departments under examination. These principles, which are included in Treasury Direcrelate tion 16/9, have also been set out in chapter the 160th report. In recent years the Committee has paid particular attention to the estimates related expenditure of departments. As a poor standard of estimating has wide ramifications, the Committee has concerned itself not only with excess expenditure charged to the Advance to the Treasurer but also with the over provision funds. The Committee has made it clear that such over provisions are undesirable, misleading and could be unfair to other departments whose financial needs might not have been satisfied. the same time, the Committee has emphasised that it does not regard the total expenditure available funds under a particular appropriation item as an objective to be sought without regard to other important considerations. Indeed undue this emphasis on the need to match expenditure and available funds can give rise to unnecessary and uneconomic expenditure and can result in the distortion of administrative practices. In this regard the Committee has, on previous occasions, criticised departments that have accelerated payments in order to prevent an appropriation from lapsing. As this and previous reports relating to expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund show, frequently there are explanations for expenditure variations from the estimates which are acceptable to the Committee. These variations usually arise from unforeseeable circumstances and certain other factors which are beyond the control of the departments concerned. In this report, however, the committee has also found it necessary to refer to 10 cases of unsatisfactory estimating and administrative performances that have resulted in shortfalls in expenditure. Attention has been drawn to these inadequacies where they have arisen. The Committee again found it necessary to comment adversely on the quality of written submissions and the inadequacy of briefing of some witnesses. As the Pubhc Accounts Committee is a committee of the Parliament, it is essential that all departments present evidence of a high quality. In this context the Committee notes that the Treasury recently issued a circular directing the attention of all departments to the Committee's requirements. I commend the report to honourable members. NA",31
62,Mr HOWARD,TARIFF PROPOSALS, I move: Customs TariffProposals No. 13 (1976). The Customs TariffProposals I have just tabled to proposed alterations to the Customs 1 of Tariff 1966-1974. Customs TariffProposals No. 13 (1976) give effect to the Government's deand cisions on recommendations made by the Industries Assistance Commission in its reports on Other Electronic Equipment; and Superphosphate Production. The Proposals also contain a change in the rates of duty applying to viscose of high tenacity yarn and viscose tyre cord fabric. This change is consistent with the suggestion made by the Industries Assistance Commission in its report of 25 June 1974 on Tyre Cord and At Tyre Cord Fabric that the duties on viscose yarn and fabric be reduced to the same level as that of applying to other competitive yarns and fabric should production of viscose in Australia cease. The new duties operate from tomorrow. A comprehensive summary of the changes is now being circulated to honourable members. I commend the Proposals to the House.,31
63,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TARIFF PROPOSALS, The quesuon is: 'That the motion be agreed to'.,32
64,Mr YOUNG,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"I move: That the debate be now adjourned. In moving the adjournment of the debate I point out that I will be speaking on the validation of the proposed changes later in the week when the Bill comes before the House for debate. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1976 Debate resumed from 28 May, on motion by MrStreet: That the Bill be now read a second time.",32
65,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I would Uke to begin by thanking the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) for providing copies of the consolidated Conciliation and Arbitration Act for the benefit of honourable members in a debate such as this. It is absolutely essential that an Act such as the ConciUation and Arbitration Act be consoUdated, because otherwise it is virtually impossible for a person to understand what is provided in the existing law. I make the comment that the Minister would be well advised to consider arranging for the Act to be consoUdated, if possible, by feeding the provisions of the Act into a data bank for computerised printing of consolidations to include aU future amendments. That can be done technically quite easily. The ConciUation and Arbitration Act is among the 5 Acts of this Parliament which are most used in the community and which ought to be the easiest of all to follow. The ConcUiation and Arbitration Amendment Bill 1976 does 3 main things: It introduces the principle that union elections shall be held by secret postal voting; that legal representation shall be given to the Minister byrightin all proceedings in which the Minister is involved; and that the Minister shall have the right of reference and the right of appeal against all matters coming before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, even matters in which the Minister or the Government is not a party. Mr Street-Bu the has to seek reference.",32
66,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I reaUse that. The reason the Government has inserted that provision, if I may say so, is that it was well aware the High Court decision in the case of Whybrow and Co. in 1910 when it was held that persons or organisations not parties to a particular dispute have norightof audience at all. The Government seeks to overcome that finding of the High Court by wording the Act in such a way that there is no right inherent in the Act but there is a right of appUcation in the Act. The Government has tried to overcome the decision in the Whybrow case by giving the Commission power to grant leave to a person who is not a party in a dispute to be heard in proceedings relating to that dispute. I believe that the very first time the Commission grants the Minister leave to intervene the Australian Council of Trade Unions might very well lodge an action in the High Second Reading Court to challenge the validity of the Commission so acting. So the Government is escaping a legal challenge on the grounds that the Parliament will be doing something invalid, and it is seeking to obtain the same invalid act by allowing the Commission to do that which the High Court will not allow the Parliament to do by legislation. It is no use wasting any further time on this because I can see that the Minister is going to interject again; only the High Court will determine it in the final analysis. I agree that the Minister ought to be given the right of appeal in the FUght Crew Officers Industrial Tribunal, but that is an entirely different matter from having arightto intervene in proceedings in which the Minister is not a party, because the Australian Government is almost invariably a party to proceedings before the Flight Officers Tribunal. That is the Tribunal that deals with Qantas Airways Ltd and Trans-Australia Airlines. So the Minister's right to appeal the decisions of the Tribunal should be the same as in every other case that comes before the Commission in which the Government is a party. But the Minister'srightto appeal against consent awards and industrial agreements is something that our side of the Parliament will strongly oppose and will always oppose. I invite the Minister to consider the consequences of the Government's proposal. Remembering that the ConciUation and Arbitration Act is an Act designed to carry out that placitum of the Constitution that gives Parliament the power to make laws in respect of the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the borders of one State-that the prime objective of the Act is the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes-the Government is now writing into the Act a provision that is actually going to cause industrial disputation. What of happens when there is a consent award or industrial agreement is this. The parties to the dispute meet and confer, sometimes at the instigation of the Commission. They then reach an agreement and the strike is settled or is prevented if it is a pending dispute. An agreement is sometimes made in the terms of the settlement arrangements. Sometimes, if the matter is covered by an award and it may be thought more appropriate to proceed by way of an award variation, the award is varied by consent as a means of settling the dispute. That dispute would not have been settled except for the agreement or the consent award. Yet, the Government thinks it will achieve something by giving the Minister the right to seek leave to intervene or to appeal decisions that were taken in order to prevent or settle a dispute. It is obvious, surely, that if the Government does that the dispute that was originally settled by the agreement or the consent award will flare up again and it will force the employers to suffer another long drawn out strike or it will force unions to stay away from the Commission. There is no obligation upon unions to go to the Commission to get their industrial agreements certified. There is no obUgation for unions to go to the Commission for a variation of the award by consent. They will simply demand, and get, overaward payments by way of unregistered agreements. Most of the unions have enough industrial muscle to enforce their agreements without the benefits of certification or ratification by the Commission. All that the Government will succeed in doing is to force the unions outside the ambit of the Arbitration Commission's purview and weaken the status of the Commission. We do not want that. We ought to be thinking of ways to strengthen the position, standing, status and prestige of the Commission, not doing things that will have the effect of reducing its status and authority. Last week we had handed down to us the decision of the Arbitration Commission in favour of plateau indexation. It would seem to me that the logical thing for the Arbitration Commission to do-it is something which the Government ought to be asking it to do-is to provide that the plateau indexation that has been adopted by the Commission be now applied quarterly and automatically in accordance with the full effects of the consumer price index including its reflection of indirect taxauon. Whether there is an increase or a reduction in indirect taxation, it will be reflected in the consumer price index. I fear that the Government is contemplating a very big increase in indirect taxation in the next Budget, otherwise it would not be so hell bent on preparappear ing the ground now for removing the effect indirect taxation from the CPI. The Government ought to be supporting what we are now putting forward if it is proposing to reduce indirect taxes. The Government will remember that on the occasion of Medibank being introduced as a non-contributing benefit, there was a very sharp reduction in the CPI for that particular quarter.",32
67,Dr KLUGMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Thre e per cent.,33
68,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Nearl y 3 per cent. The 0.8 per cent left over was insufficient to justify, according to the Commission, an increase in wage indexation for that quarter. Let me add in passing that I think that was a wrong decision. It does not matter by what amount the CPI increases; the increase, whether large or small, should be reflected in the increased wage flowing from the application of wage indexation. Unless indexation is made automatic on a quarterly basis we will not get the full benefits of wage indexation. The full potential of wage indexation as a means of preventing and settling industrial disputes is going to be castrated, if I can use an odd term, by the effects of not having automatic adjustment. I believe that the portion of the total wage which is subjected to indexation-that is, the amount that represents the average award rate for adult males-ough t not to be affected again as a result of price movements. There ought not to be double counting in respect of that portion of the total wage that has already benefited by quarterly adjustments as a result of wage indexation. The Australian Council of Trade Unions has never asked that the portion of the total wage that is affected by wage indexation should be increased as a consequence of any price movement. Indeed, it has made its position perfectly clear-that it would do everything within its power to prevent double counting in respect of that portion of the wage that is affected by wage indexation. But the portion of the total wage that is not affected by wage indexationthat is, the portion above average award rates, ought to be open to negotiation according to work value, changed circumstances or any other factors that are relevant in the settlement of an industrial dispute. I believe for that reason that the guideUnes ought to be relaxed so that unions can negotiate settlements over and above the average award rates where there is a case for the correction of an anomaly based upon any such grounds, and the Minister ought to face up to the fact that this is something that has to be done. I have never disputed the fact that the Government and the Minister should have the right to before national wage cases in the public of interest on matters like the minimum wage for females, standard hours, annual leave, the amount of productivity increase that ought to be awarded in national wage cases and wage indexation, to mention the main items of interest because in all of these cases the Government can claim that as the biggest employer in Austraha, employing more than 300 000 people, the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations as the portfolio is now called, does have a direct interest in the same way as any other employer. He ought to be heard and the Arbitration Commission ought not lightly to pass away from submissions made by the government of the day. But at the same time the Commission ought to reject utterly and out of hand any attempt by the Minister of the day, speaking on behalf of the government, to ask the Commission to act as the arm of economic management. How on earth can an organisation or a body that relies upon a constitution that places the emphasis on its role of prevention and settlement of industrial disputes be expected to manage the economy when it has control over only one single factor that goes to the control of inflation and the other things that economists seek to control? How could we expect the Arbitration Commission, with no power to control profits, no power to control interest rates, no power over fiscal policy, no power over monetary pohcy, to be able to act as the manager of the economy? It cannot be done. In every case in which I appeared in 1973, 1974 and 1975,1 instructed counsel representing me to make the position abundantly clear, to the Commission, that the Government did not expect the Commission to act as the manager of the country's economy. We, as a government, told the Commission that its job was to settle and to prevent industrial disputes and it was the job of the Government to manage the economy. I am well aware of the fact that whatever decision is taken by the Commission does have some effect on the economy. But no one has yet been able to point to a single instance where the Arbitration Commission has taken a decision that could be said to be the prime cause of any economic problems for the government of the day. It has never happened. The Commission acts with a great deal of responsibility. I think one of the most sensible things that has ever been done by a government occurred when I was Minister for Labour and decided to appoint Professor Isaacs to the Arbitration Commission. It is true that as well as the settling of industrial disputes, the economic factor of the decisions of the Arbitration Commission has some relevance. It is no use expecting people who are learned only in the law to be able to understand all of the economic factors. It was for this reason that I appointed Professor Isaacs as a deputy president of the Commission. Before any other appointments are made. I suggest to the Minister that he look around for somebody else like Professor Isaacs, who has a very good working knowledge of industrial relations as well as of economics. Better still, the Minister should try to get a person who is quaUfied as a labour economist. There are not many labour economists in Australia, but we ought to have a labour economist on the Commission because things are moving so rapidly now that if we stick to outmoded principles we shall never be able to get answers to the sensitive and very complex questions that have to be resolved in' the industrial relations field. The Government has not got the power to enforce that part of the amending Bill which seeks to require the Commission to have regard not only to the general economic consequences of its decisions, but also to the effect of its decisions on employment and inflation. How can the Government enforce this? It cannot get an order for mandamus against the Commission from the High Court to do so that section of the Act, because to carry it out the court would need to be able to exercise arbitral powers. The Boilermakers case has made it clear that any body exercising purely judicial powers has no authority to exercise arbitral powers as well. Yet the question of whether a decision is adversely affecting the economy or is Ukely to affect inflation or unemployment is essentially one for arbitral decision; it is not a judicial matter. People trained or even learned in the law are not able to make decisions on matters affecting unemployment and inflation. These are economic questions. All that the Commission has to do in order to comply with the section of the Act that is now proposed, is simply to begin each decision with the preamble: 'We have had full regard to the economic consequences of the decision that we are about to announce. We have taken into account the effects of the decision on unemployment and inflation and accordingly we have decided to increase aU wages by $500 a week and to reduce the standard hours to 20 hours a week'. If the Commission were to do that, there is nothing at all that anybody could do about it. To whom could the Government appeal? It could not appeal to the High Court, because the High Court is not competent and, by its own decision in the boilermakers case the High Court would not be permitted to adjudicate on whether the decision to increase wages by $500 a week and to reduce the standard hours to 20 hours a week was in fact, and in law, a matter that contravened Groom, the Act. I believe that there is a lot to be said for the Hodges, case put forward by my colleague the honourHoward, J.W. able member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), the OpHunt, R. position spokesman on industrial relations. He Hyde, said that we should not be asking the Arbitration Commission to stop employers from negotiating awards outside the guidelines; we should allow Armitage, J. L employers to give whatever they like providing Bowen, Lionel they are not permitted to pass on the increases to Cairns, the general public by way of price increases. Cameron, Clyde Therefore the answer to this problem is not in Cohen, B.H. placing these obligations upon the Commission Connor, R.F.X. but in strengthening the power of the Prices JusCrean, tification Tribunal so that it can say to employers Garrick, who flout the guidelines: 'Look, you have flouted Hayden, W.G. the guidelines. You carry the burden of the Jacobi, R. increase yourself.",33

Section 4 of the Principal Act is amended(a) by inserting in sub-section (1), after the definition of 'Deputy President', the following definition: ' ""Direct voting system"", in relation to an election for an office in an organization, means a method of elecuon of the kind referred to in paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) of section 133;'; and (b) by adding at the end thereof the following subsection: '(4) A reference in this Act to an office in, or an office within, an association or organization shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be read as including a reference to an office in a branch of the associauon or organization.'.",35
70,Mr STREET,PAIRS,"Corangamite-Minister for OKeefe,F.L. Peacock, A. S. Employment and Industrial Relations) (3.50)- I move: At end of paragraph (a) omit 'and' and insen the following paragrapn: '(aa) by inserting in sub-section (1), after the definition of ""Organization"", the following definition: ' ""Postal ballot"" means a ballot for the purposes of which a ballot paper is to be sent by prepaid post to each person enutled to vote and facilities are to be provided for the return of the completed ballot paper by post by the voter without expense to him;'; ana'. The proposed definition in the amendment defines what is meant by postal ballot in clauses 12 (a) and 13 of the Bill. Clause 12 (a) proposes that a new paragraph be inserted in section 133(1) to require an association applying for registration to provide by its rules that every election for an office of a kind referred to in paragraphs (a), (aa), (b) and (c) of the definition of office in section 4(1) shall be by postal ballot. The specified officers are those with policy or management functions. Clause 13 provides that elections for the specified offices in organisations, that is employer or employee associations registered under the Acts, shall be by secret postal ballot. In relation to associations applying for registration, the effect of the amendment, taken in conjunction with section 133 (1) (d) (i) is that after the amendment becomes operative the association will not be registered unless its rules provide for postal ballots which comply with the definition and which will ensure the secrecy of the ballot. In relation to registered organisations, every election for an office specified in sub-section (1) of proposed section 133 AA must be by postal ballot which complies with the definition. If an organisation's rules do not provide for postal ballot or provide for a postal ballot which does not comply with the definition, regulations may be made under proposed section 133 AA (2) which will prescribe conditions which must be complied with to ensure both the secrecy of the ballot and that the postal ballot accords with the definition.",35
71,Mr WILLIS,PAIRS,"The amendment moved by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) to clause 3 is quite important. It opens up a rather remarkable factor in this whole debate. It is an incredible irony that this Bill could have come before the House in the way that it did because without the amendment just moved by the Minister it contained a massive loophole. The Bill would have totally failed to bring about that which this Government has been telling the country since the last election campaign that it was going to introduce. All honourable members will recall that during the last election campaign the Government said time and time again that it proposed to legislate, upon regaining the Government benches, to provide that all union members would have a postal vote, or the ability to have a postal vote, in union elections. It said that union members would get a ballot paper sent to them. In fact that proposition was not covered by the Bill put before the House. It now has been covered by the amendment. I make the point that in the original Bill clause 3 defined 'direct voting system' as an election of a kind referred to in section 133 (1) (a) of the Act. In summary section 133(1) (a) provides that the rules of the association or organisation shall provide for the election of the holder of each office within the association or organisation at an election at which allfinancialmembers are ehgible to vote. That means that it is not a collegiate system. It has to be a vote of all members eligible to vote. Clause 13 of the Bill provides that there will be a new section 133 (AA). Subsection (1) of this proposed new section is in these terms: Every elecuon by a direct voting system . . . shall be by secret postal ballot. The Bill says that for the election of officeholders the rules must provide that all financial members are eligible to vote and that the vote shall be by secret postal ballot. Nowhere does it say what a secret postal ballot will be. For instance, it leaves open the possibility that there could be a secret postal ballot in the way absentee voting is now required in the rules of all registered organisations. As the Bill reads without the amendment put up by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, a union could have rules which provide that members may simply write to the returning officer, requesting a vote. That would be a secret postal ballot but it would not mean that all the members eligible to vote would receive a ballot paper. When the Government put this Bill before the House it left out an item which was crucial to what it had been teUing the country six or eight months ago it would do. This is a remarkable fact, given the tremendous fanfare of pubhcity that this particular item has been given. It was a key part of the policy speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). When he delivered his policy speech it was a key item of this Government's proposals. When it put this Bill before the House the Government left out that key item. This has now been corrected by the Minister's amendment.",36
72,Mr CHIPP,PAIRS," I will speak briefly on this clause. I will be mildly critical of the Government, which I do not like to be publicly, but I think this matter is so important that the words have to be said. I do not know that there is any more complex or complicated piece of legislation on the statute book than the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. To understand the ramifications of it, or any amendments to it, one has to get among the trade union movement, trade union members, members of employer organisations to see the implications of every amendment to this Act. Although one might have the greatest legal mind in Australia, although one might be an experienced poUtician, although one might think he knows all about industrial relations, it is not until one gets to the trade unionists, to whom this Act is a Bible under which they operate from day to day, that one understands the impUcations of any amendments to it.",36
73,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PAIRS,They are the practitioners.,37
74,Mr CHIPP,PAIRS,"I am indebted to the honourable member for Hindmarsh. They are practitioners. These are men who owe their positions in the trade union movement to their knowledge of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I find it incredible that an omission such as that which the amendment rectifies should have occurred in a Bill like this. As I understand it- I am sure I will part company with my friend the honourable member for Hindmarsh now-that trade union which the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) rightly points to as running rather peculiar elections, the Australian Metal Workers Union, would have been laughing to eternity at the Bill before this amendment was proposed. That union already had postal baUots and this Bill would not have affected it at all. It puzzles me how a Minister who is probably the busiest and the hardest-working Minister in the Cabinet couldreceivean amending Bill from his Department with this obvious omission. To err is human. I am not saying that the Department, which is extremely efficient, is infalUble or should be infallible. All I am doing at this stage is making a plea to the Minister to organise a panel of trusted trade unionists-ther e are many-and trusted members of employer organisations with whom he can consult on a confidential basis on future amendments to the ConciUation and Arbitration Act, so that omissions Uke this wiU not be repeated. I believe that this is done in other areas of endeavour by the Government. I am not persuaded that it cannot be done in this field.",37
75,Mr HODGMAN,PAIRS,"In supporting the amendment I just say that it is indeed a pity that honourable members who would have liked to have spoken in the second reading debate on this Bui were not afforded the opportunity. Regrettably, therefore, instead of a short speech covering the whole of the Bill there will probably be a number of brief speeches covering individual clauses. That is a matter which I should take up in another place and I will do so. I query 2 matters of drafting. I draw attention to the fact that the words 'prepaid post' are used in relation to sending out the ballot paper, and in relation to sending back the ballot paper the words are 'faculties are to be provided for the return of the completed ballot paper by post'. If those two sets of words mean the same, I ask the Minister to indicate why the difference occurs. Secondly, I ask for some general information in relation to the cost of the proposed secret postal baUots. I support, and have supported consistently, the Government's policy in relation to court controlled ballots but I accept as a via media, as a reasonable compromise for a 2-year period, that we should defer the objective of court controlled baUots in all cases and that we should give this very workable compromise a trial period. I draw attention to this fact because it is impossible to discuss this amendment without having some consideration to clause 13 of the Bill. The power under clause 13(3) to exempt will undoubtedly apply to such unions as the Waterside Workers Federation. It would be totally ridiculous to expect that union to undergo a secret postal ballot when it is able, by the present process, without fear and intimidation to conduct elections at which it gets a polhng rate in excess of 95 per cent. It seems to me that the cost of the secret postal baUots will eventually become piombitive on the trade unions and that, in essence, we will reach the situation where the unions themselves will ask for the Commonwealth to take over the cost by providing a court controlled ballot system in practically every case.",37
76,Mr WILLIS,PAIRS,It is already happening.,37
77,Mr HODGMAN,PAIRS,"Yes. The honourable member for GelUbrand says it is already happening. I hope he will accept as a fact of life that it is desirable, if possible, that unions be permitted to make a decision in respect to their form of balloting rather than be coerced. I compliment the Minister- I adopt what the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) said about the Minister's work, and in fact I respectfully suggest that he is considerably over-worked-that instead of taking a stock whip to the unions he has said that we will have a trial period of 2 years. This is to the disappointment of some of the more extreme supporters of the Government Parties. I shudder to think what the honourable member for Diamond Valley (Mr Brown) might say if he rises to his feet but I know he will say it well. I am not so far to therightof Genghis Khan that I regard this as a bad move. On the contrary, I think it is a good move because it shows a spirit of compromise. From this compromise and others I believe may well emerge a social compact, if I may use that phrase whi:h is not viewed very favourably in this country, of co-operation at a tripartite level between government, employers and unions. If that element of compromise produces that result I believe we have done a good day's work. The cost of postage is one of the most contentious issues in the community at the moment. I beheve that the cost of secret ballot by post in some of the larger unions would be probably $150,000 to $200,000 per election. I think the point should be made, and made with force, at this time, so that nobody can come along later and say: 'You did not tell us this was Ukely to happen'. I believe that the cost of secret postal ballots will become prohibitive for unions and that eventually, rather than by coercion, by cooperation we will have reached a position in which the unions will have asked the Court to take control of their elections. Another comment I make in respect of the amendment- I hope I am not straying too far from it-is this: On the face ofit, the provisions this amendment, read in conjunction with clause 13, have the legal effect, unless some other lation is introduced, of abolishing the collegiate system of voting. I say quite frankly and openly that whUst this matter has caused me considercollegiate able trouble, I believe that unions which possess at present the collegiate system of voting should be given the right and the protection of this Government to continue their system of contrary collegiate voting. I put as a natural extension the federalist philosophy which I adopt the ment that, in my opinion at any rate, if the collegislation legiate system is taken away the smaller States can say goodbye to any chance of having effective role to play in the election of federal office bearers of their unions. I contend, with respect, that where the collegiate system has been utilised by many unions in this countrywhether honourable members opposite agree would with it or not-it would be wrong for this that Government to legislate in any way, shape or form, to take it away. I know the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) is far more experienced in trade union matters than I am. I know the dedication with which he purwho sued a course which would lead eventually to abolition of the collegiate system of voting. merely remind the Committee that the lation introduced by the honourable member will become effective and the collegiate system voting will go out unless the Government in, in the meantime, some form of legislation which will permit a continuation of the collegiate system. We should not be left under any misapprehensions that unless legislation is introduced in the Budget Session, with the passing of this Bill we will in essence be ensuring the demise of the collegiate system of voting. Mr Chairman, I hope you will accept that these remarks are made in conjunction with the matter of secret postal ballots because they relate very keenly to that matter. I take heart from the fact that the Minister dealt with this matter in his second reading speech. I would have dealt with the matter if the second reading debate continued. The Minister said: The Government accepts in principle a form of collegiate voting, but the system adopted must be consistent with its policy of fullest participation by members. As I have indicated, the issue is a very complex one, and the Government believes that funher detailed consideration is necessary, so that it can properly examine the large numbers of representations which it has received. I point out with respect that that is all very well, but if the Government genuinely wishes to preserve therightof the collegiate system of voting for many hundreds of thousands of trade unionof ists in this country we must introduce the legislation into this Parliament in the Budget Session. legisUnless we do so, the effect of the legislation introduced by the honourable member for Hindmarsh will be that as of 1 October this year the system will be illegal in this country. The honourable member believes that that is in the interests of the industrial structure of Australia. With the greatest of respect, I take a view. I am sure he will not object to my of saying that unless we bring in legislation-unles s argueverybody in this chamber is quite clear that must be introduced to keep alive the collegiate system of voting-it will die. I believe an Australia would be poorer in that event. I support the amendment. I congratulate the Minister on the way in which he is conducting his portfolio. I do not believe anybody in Australia like to be in his shoes at present. I suggest if we can debate in a calm and rational manner these issues upon which we are divided in conscience, but upon which I believe from a spirit of co-operation we could achieve the best result, the Minister will be remembered by those serve in the industrial field with the same the affection and admiration as some of his predeI cessors, including the late Harold Holt and the legishonourable member for Hindmarsh.",37
78,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PAIRS," I begin by referring to something which brings the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) said in his concluding remarks. He said that nobody in Australia would like to be in the shoes of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street). Well, let me inform the honourable gentleman that there is nothing I would Uke more than to be in the Minister's shoes. It took a lot of getting me out of them. I would Uke to get back into them again, and if I were there I would not be doing some of the things that are now proposed. I was impressed by some of the remarks of the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp). He is correct when he says that the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is the most sensitive piece of legislation on the statute book. It is the most complex Act with which we in this Parliament ever have to deal. When one touches a small subsection or alters a word in that complex, sensitive Act, one never knows what the chain reaction might be, what the side effects in some other part of the Act might be, or what effect it will have upon industrial relations. The honourable member for Hotham did not put the following proposal to the Minister, but I will. There is enormous merit in supporting the setting up of a select committee of members from both sides of this Parliament, from both Houses of the Parliament, to prepare a Green Paper on questions such as the coUegiate system. I know I am departing from the clause, but I must add this example. One other matter that ought to be dealt with in the Green Paper is the power of the Australian ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission to deregister. That power should reside in a full bench of at least 3 Presidential members of the Commission and not left, as is now the case, to the Australian Industrial Court. There are certain circumstances in which the Commission can deregister now, but all appUcations for deregistration of unions ought to be a matter for the Commission. But it is a power which should be exercised only by a full bench of 3 Presidential members of the Commission. It knows the facts of the case better than the Coun knows them. That is one thing with which a Green Paper could deal. There is a whole range of matters relating to concilliation and arbitration which have never really been studied in depth or in a bipartisan way. We ought to do it, and do it quickly, and not always be calling in thefirebrigade after the fire has broken out. We should take the action needed to see that nofirebreaks out. I know my friend from Hotham would not did ever want to be unfair about this matter, thought he was a bit unfair when he blamed the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations for the sloppy drafting of the legisgerheads lation. He did not describe it as such, but interpreted his remarks as such. It is. not the Department's job to draft the legislation. The drafting of legislation is a matter for the Parliamentary Counsel. When I sought to have some outside person draft a piece of legislation on one occasion, my experience was that the Parliamentary Counsel took very strong exception. He said: 'We are the ones who know most about drafting things. We do not want some other style of drafting grafted on to the kind of statutes with which we deal in this Parliament.' Even if it were the Department's responsibiUty to draft this Bill, which it is not, I think one would have to take into account the way in which the Government has shilly-shallied over what it intends to put to the Parliament. I can assure the Minister- I would say this with my hand on the dispatch box, in fact-that this is not something which Mr MCMahon, the legal adviser sitting in the ministerial advisers' benches, told me when I spoke to him a moment ago. We were talking about the cold weather and how nasty the weather in Melbourne always is, rather than about this Bill. We have not discussed it. The Government has shilly-shallied, put things in and taken things out in a way that is rather unbecoming even for a government. We cannot blame the Department, for the fact that the Government has acted in this way. But having done so, it is inevitable that someone will overlook an ordinary interpretation amendment such as this one. The collegiate system of voting was talked about. It is ironic that the Government which now sits on the Treasury benches was elected to government because it told the Australian people, and in particular the 5 250 000 employees in the work force: 'If you vote for us we will hand control of the unions back to the members. We will give you participatory democracy'. The veryfirstspeeches that we heard in the Parliament about the question of participatory democracy within the trade union movement from the Government were a condemnation of the Australian Labor Party's federal policy of 'participatory democracy'. The Labor Party's platform goes on to outlaw the collegiate system on the basis that it conflicts with and violates the principle of participatory democracy. The Labor Party's federal platform does not outlaw the collegiate system entirely. It says that unions that not already have the collegiate system in any but I form as of 1973 would never be allowed to introduce it. That was fair enough. I do not think the Government and the Opposition are at logover that. I have never heard the I Government say that those unions which do not have the collegiate system will, by the legislation it proposes, be permitted to have it. Where we differ is that under the Labor Party's platform and under the Labor Party's legislation those unions which had the collegiate system as at that date were to be given 3 years which to bring their rules into line with the lation. The legislation did not require unions which had the collegiate system as at that abolish the collegiate system in respect of all itions. The legislation makes it clear that umons that had the coUegiate system then had the right to continue the collegiate system ad infinitum except that those federal positions within the union that were full time jobs and the holder of which was a member of the management comonly mittee of the organisation, had to go to the rank and file for elecuon. But the election of all other federal positions which were elected by the collegiate system as at that time-th Federal President, Federal Vice-President, Federal Trustees and Federal Returning Officer- electorate and which were not full time positions could conits small segments. tinue to befilledby the collegiate system of electhe Senate, where the tion. That is still in the legislation and that wiU State, is so big that nothing continue. The unions do not have to alter their known and only the party affiliations rules in respect of the part-time positions. It is through. In a sense my honourable friends only the full time positions of the Executive within a union that are subject to the alteration that has to be made by November. There is no doubt that the only unions of which I know that are pressing for the aboUtion ofrightof the rank and file to have a direct voice in the election of their full time federal positions are the Federated we, Clerks Unions of Australia, the Shop and file. AssistantsMr Kevin Cairns-The Miscellaneous position Workers Union.",38
79,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PAIRS,"No. The Miscelwhole laneous Workers Union has altered its rules. the office holders, including the federal secreelectorate taryship, of the Miscellaneous Workers Union really are subject to the will of the rank and file.It a collegiate system but Mr Gietzelt altered his union's rules to comply with the provisions of the Labor Party's Act. So it is not true to say that union is not controlled by its members. It is funny thing that the extremes in the trade union movement-the extreme Right and the extreme Left-ar e the ones who are doing most about takunions ing from the rank and file the right to elect their fulltimeofficers. I find it very hard to reconcile the conflicting views of anybody who is elected to Parliament, as honourable members opposite have been elected, on the promise of introducing or strengthening the principle of participatory democracy to give the rank and control their own union officials, and who then defends the coUegiate system.",40
80,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"I was most interested a moment ago to hear the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde in Cameron) compare the position in the trade legisunions with the election of members of Parliament. He wiU be famUiar with the fact that there date to are 2 Houses of Parliament. The House of posRepresentatives, our House, is elected from relatively smaU areas. Therefore in those areas the individual can be known. We consider ourselves in a way closer'to the people than are members of the Senate, which is elected on the electorate of the whole State and which therefore can really be a party House. We have the position where the rank and file, as it were, can express the themselves only in what my honourable friends on the other side are in the habit of describing as e positions of the House of the people. Here we have the position where the whole is divided into segments and votes in The system as we have it in electorate votes as a whole personal can be can come on the kind other side of the chamber are quite right when they refer to us, rather than the Senate, as the House of the people. The Senate, of course, is elected by the same electors exactly but does not represent the rank and file in the same sense as the House of the people, represent the rank This can be true also not simply for a State but also for a very big union. We have come to the now where many of the unions have become monstrously big. They are spread over the of Austraha. They have tens or even hunAU dreds of thousands of members. In that kind of which is so disseminated one cannot have a rank andfileelection. It is very nice was to talk about the rank and file, grass roots democracy and things like that but we have the same kind of situation as we have in the election that of the Senate, something which my honourable a friends on the other side are so keen on condemning as not really being the House of the people at all. Yet they want to say that, whether want it or not, wUly-nilly they should not, in their view, have the opportunity of dividing up their electorate as we divide up the electorates of Austraha into separate electorates when we elect members of this, the House of the people. So I am very much attracted by the simile which my friend the honourable member for Hindmarsh file the right to introduced. I think the position is this: Unless the Governnever ment allows at least the possibihty of the ate system, it may be removing from the and file the real power to express themselves. What the Opposition is calling grass roots democracy is really a kind of phony, mass hysteria or mass organisation. My honourable will know that there has been in Australia a quite illegitimate link between the trade unions and support the political party of the Australian Labor Party in this Parliament. That is something which I think is really offensive to every sense of poltiical freedom. Why should a man's job in a union be tied up at all with the support of one side another in this Parliament? The whole thing is really rather offensive. Yet if the collegiate tem is barred altogether what will happen in point of fact is that the massive machine-the the MrnewCLYDE steamroller-wU l roll out the grass roots all right. are debating in Committee The roller does go over the grass roots and tial to stick strictly to the subject perhaps Uke the cloves under the harrow the clause under discussion. A Committee grass roots know about it sometimes. I think we not the same as a second reading debate. have to be a little bit flexible and reasonable about this. If a union wants to have its elections in another form-if that really be members of the union and if they really want to express themselves in being able to have their elections in smaller packets like we have the tions to this House of Representatives as opposed to Senate elections-surel y we should give them the opportunity. - Mr CLYDE CAMERON (Hindmarsh) pre-paid (4.26)- I want to say only a few words. First all, I believe that the whole question of the colsent legiate system has been mainly overlooked. It cannot possibly be said that there is a democratic system of control of unions when there is a circle of friends- a cosy Uttle club-whic h meet together as a councU, which for the. purposes modern day industrial jargon we call a college, and who under the rules of a union are permitted to elect from among their own number someone to be the president, the secretary and the vicethe president. It could mean that only those memthe bers of a union who are members of the college have the right to nominate for the position federal president, secretary, vice-president, etc. This Bill has nothing to do with the coUegiate system. I am pleased that the honourable memmake ber for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), who led for the Opposition in this debate, nods in agreement with me. I am told there is to be a Bill introduced later on- I hope it never comes on-deaUn the collegiate system. I suggest now that I explained the collegiate system that you, Mr Chairman, rule all further references to the ter completely out of order otherwise we will finish the discussion on this Bill at all. That collegicuts out the honourable member for Denison rank from saying what he intended to say.",40
81,Mr HODGMAN,PAIRS,"You are wrong, you know.",41
82,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PAIRS,There is just one friend small matter that I want to mentionMr Chipp-It cuts me out too. I was going to you.,41
83,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"I suggest that some of the speeches in the Committee have been a Uttle irrelevant. I suggest at this moment the interjecor tions and the replies are even more irrelevant. Perhaps it might be a good idea if we proceed in sysCommittee with one speaker at a time. members CAMERON-For the benefit of might I explain that when they it is absolutely essenmatter of the debate is A member is entitled to speak twice in Committee the desire of if no one else rises. I want to allude to a matter that is relevant. It relates to the amendment that has been cirelecculated. The honourable member for Denison, who I understand is the best lawyer Tasmania has-whateve r that might mean-ha s said that he is not sure whether the amendment guarantees that the return of the ballot paper is covered by post. He drew attention to the fact that of the amendment provides that the ballot paper is out as pre-paid post but according to his capacity to interpret the English language it is not clear that the return envelope is pre-paid. If the little honourable member for Denison looks at the provisions he will see that this is covered. They of provide for the return of the completed ballot paper by post by the voter 'without expense to him'. I would like the Minister to confirm that as a ministerial directive to the administrators of proposal just in case there are some who have same loose and rather weird way of interpreting the statute as displayed by the honourable of member for Denison and who may think that they are carrying out the requirements of the law by compelling the voter to return the ballot paper at his own expense. The Minister might it clear that that is not the intention of the legislation and that in fact the ballot paper is returned at the expense of the Electoral Office. g with The CHAIRMAN. I thank the honourable have member for Hindmarsh for his comments and for his assistance to the newer members who are matin the chamber at the moment.. I would also remind the Committee that it is some of the older members, not perhaps by years but by experience in this place, such as the honourable member for Hindmarsh, who transgress the Standing Orders on many occasions. I would suggest that members of the Committee Usten to the words of advice given by the honourable member for Hindmarsh but perhaps not the speeches that he makes in Committee.",41
84,Mr CHIPP,PAIRS,"After those few words from you, Mr Lucock, I rise with some diffidence because when the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr WUUs) and I first spoke on this I thought we were impeccable in keeping within the Standing Orders. It was only those good friends of mine-bot h are good friendswho followed me who transgressed. The fact that you have shown tolerance in respect of this, Mr Chairman, is wise because the Bill which we are debating today is unreal insofar as parts ofit will come into operation following royal assent but they are only relatively smaUer parts of the Bill. The gutsy parts of the Bill, if I may use that expression, are not going to come into operation until after proclamation which we understand might be 2 years away. That is why this is an unreal Bill. The important tiling about this Bill is not what is in it, but what is not in it. That I think you have displayed wisdom, Mr Chairman, in allowing the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) and the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) to talk about the collegiate system, which I did not do. I ask for your indulgence for about 2 minutes, Mr Chairman, to allow me to make my comacceded ments about this system, and I will courtesy. I think it is a great pity that we are not appointing a joint select committee of the Houses to inquire into the implications of the collegiate system. As Chairman of the Government MemFirstly, bers Industrial Relations Committee and in conlegiate junction with the members of the Committee have heard evidence over the last 8 weeks or more on the pros and cons of this question. have saturated ourselves with information the good things a collegiate system can do the evU things it can do. I rate myself as having only a modicum of intelligence but I confess to you, Mr Chairman, that I am utterly confusedexplain more confused than when I began to look into this matter-and I think I can speak for the members of my Committee. What makes me sending worried about this is the pressure coming from extremists to aboUsh the legislation that the honourable member for Hindmarsh brought in during his term of office-pressur e from both ends. Extremists always bother me, and that why I am very suspicious about why pressure and lobbying is going on. If I had to make a decision at this moment I would say that I could be persuaded that a collegiate system up to State branch level- a onetier collegiate system-woul d be acceptable, but I would leave myself open to be persuaded that even that would be wrong. I am totally persuaded that the severaltieredcollegiate system, which some unions of the extreme right and also of the extreme left are operating and manipulating for the purposes of particular individuals, is very bad and'it has to go. I do not know whether the proper course of action is to leave untouched the amending legislation introduced by the honourable member for Hindmarsh when - he was Minister and which will become law, I think, about mid-November. If that proposal is not going to be allowed to operate I think the legislation has to be amended. I am sorry that the Government has not acceded to the request that a joint select committee of both Houses should be appointed forthwith to report to this House by the end of August, to make sure it does its work, on all the implications of, I think, section 133 that the honourable member for Hindmarsh is why introduced. If such a committee were set up I would be better informed; the House would be better informed. I conclude as I began my first speech on this clause: The ConcUiation and Arbitration Act is the most complicated, complex and sensitive on the statute book. God knows what we will do if we simply aboUsh the amendment that the former Minister brought in. I express my disappointment that the Government has not to the request for the establishment of a respect your joint select committee.",42
85,Mr HODGMAN,PAIRS," I wish to raise 2 matters before this clause is disposed of. I made a mistake when I said that the colsystem would expire on 1 October. That is I not correct. The date is mid-November, as I understand it. Secondly, while I am flattered by We the glowing tributes paid to me by the honourabout able member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde and Cameron) I never at any stage suggested that any unionist would have to pay the cost of sending back his ballot paper. I invited the Minister to why the word 'prepaid' is used in relation to sending the ballot paper out but, instead other of using exactly the same word in respect of it back, the draftsman has chosen to use different words, namely, that 'facUities are to be provided for the return of the completed ballot aper by post by the voter without expense to E im'. I am sure the honourable member did not is want to convey that I was suggesting that the unionists of Australia, under this proposed amendment, would have to pay to send their ballot papers back. I have never suggested that. I just asked why, if one word or set of words was used in relation to one process, a different set of words was used in relation to another. I take the view, with respect to the honourable member for Hindmarsh, that it is not irrelevant in this debate on this clause, and in particular on this amendment, to express a view in relation to the continuation or otherwise of the collegiate system. I pointed out-the honourable member for Hindmarsh has not contradicted me-that if this Bill goes through and no further legislation on this subject is introduced into this Parliament, as of the middle of November this year the collegiate system of voting for the elecuon of full time union office bearers in Australia will expire. That is the very reason why this may be the only opportunity for those of us who are concerned about the continuation of the collegiate system to speak on the matter. I certainly hope that it is not. I shall certainly have something to say about it if it turns out at a later date that this was our last chance because the Minister has clearly indicated that discussions are continuing and that representations from all concerned parties are being received. I think it is appropriate to quote again verbatim what the Minister said because these words, I think, are vital. He said: The Government accepts in principle a form of collegiate voting, but the system adopted must be consistent with its policy of fullest participation by members. The honourable member for Hindmarsh had the, with respect, audacity to say that it was Austrahan Labor Party policy to impose certain conditions in respect to the collegiate system of voting which the Labor Party in fact quite willingly lives with itself. The honourable member for Hindmarsh was elected a Minister of the Crown by the collegiate system of voting. Regrettably he was removed from that position not by an exercise of the collegiate system of voting. In my opinion, the collegiate system of voting is not negatory of participatory democracy. The two largest political parties in the world at this veiy moment are preparing for a collegiate system of voting at the Democratic Convention and at the Republican Convention. Even after the people of America cast their votes, the formal election of the President of the United States, the highest tion, elected position in the world, will be decided by a college.",42
86,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Order! I of remind the honourable member for Dension that I have said that this clause covers the voting tem and certain matters related to it. I think a passing reference to the collegiate system has been justified. I think perhaps that not only the honourable member for Denison but also other honourable members have gone rather wider than that. I think if we take a trip round the world in discussing many other systems of voting we will interrupt the Prime Minister and his statement at 8 o'clock. I suggest that the Committee might come back to the point and the clause that are under discussion at this moment.,43
87,Mr HODGMAN,PAIRS,"I did not intend to go round the world. I did not intend to refer to the election of the Pope or anything else where colleges are involved. I shall conclude on these remarks: If for any reason- I say this conscious of the impUcations of the words I am about to utter- a Bill does not come into this Parliament in the Budget session to retain therightofthe use of the collegiate system of election of full time office bearers of those unions which desire to continue to use this system to elect their full time office bearers, I believe the Government would be breaking faith with the vast majority of Australians who put it into power on 13 December.",43
88,Mr STREET,PAIRS," A number of interesting comments have been made by various honourable members in debating this clause, some rather closer to the clause than others, perhaps. Mr Kelly-Even .",43
89,Mr STREET,PAIRS,"Eve n closer to the clause, as my friend suggests. The honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) made a suggestion that it might be appropriate to have a panel of unionists and employers experienced in industrial relations to look at draft legislation. I see a couple of practical difficulties in this suggestion which has a lot of attraction in it, of course, as a means of trying to get the bugs out of legislation before it reaches the Parliament. One difficulty is deciding on the method of selection of whom should be asked to give advice on such things. The second, of course, is the propriety in certain circumstances of people outside the Parliament having access to draft legislation. Those are 2 practical problems that I see. The honourable member also made a suggesas did the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron), that a select committee be estabUshed to look into various aspects the ConciUation and Arbitration Act. The Government will not act on that suggestion at syspresent, but as in all things our minds remain that open in that area. The honourable member for Hotham also referred to the fact that the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union has provision for a postal ballot. I know that he is well aware what sort of postal ballot it is but it might propriate to explain that the postal ballot which the honourable member was refening is fact an absent vote for which a member can make apphcation to vote postal, which is different from the proposition we are putting ward in this legislation because, firstly, ber bears the cost himself, and secondly, he has to apply for the ballot paper. In his last contribution to this debate honourable member also made the remark that the proclamation of this legislation could be Denison years away. I can assure the honourable member that that is not intended. We have said that weclear do not propose to proclaim the legislation in case valid points relating to it are brought up by therespect employers or union members at forthcomingsideration talks we will be starting next week upon various aspects of the economy, wages pohcy and so on.able They having been the legislation, we will remain willing to take on board suggestions at that time. There is certainly no intention not to proclaimtions the legislation ad infinitum. The honourable member for Denison (Mr organisations Hodgman) brought up the question different wording in relation to prepaid post for have enacted before that sending out ballot papers and the completed ballot paper being sent back by post by the voter effect without expense to him. The reason for the of difference is to give somewhat wider discretion to the union officers in handling the return papers. In fact they will be able to on envelopes and send them out with the ballot be necessary to have thefor papers, but if they believe it suits their purpose course, before any legislation is introduced better they will be able to make anangements with the postal authorities to have a prepaid form of reply. That option is open to them. purpose was purely to give them a choice. The honourable member for GelUbrand (Mr Willis) referred to the fact that ballots were already being conducted by the Commonwealth Electoral Office under section 170 of the Act. That, of course, is true, but last year only 29 unions out of a total of some 150 registered under the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act clauses availed themselves of that opportunity to have their elections conducted at no cost to them. We hope that that number and percentage improves as time goes by. The honourable member for Hindmarsh raised a number of interesting points, including the technicalities of machinery for the deregistering of organisations. I will interested to have a look in some detaU at what he said in that respect. All speakers, I think, devoted some time in the debate on this clause to the question of the colof legiate system of voting. I would ask your indulbe apgence, Mr Chairman, because this particular to issue was dealt with at some length and in some in detail by the honourable member who spoke, to be permitted to reply to them now. As several very speakers mentioned- I think the honourable formember for Denison did so particularly- I said the memin my second reading speech to this Bill: The Government accepts in principle a form of collegiate voting, but the system adopted must be consistent with its the policy of fullest participation by members. It is clear that the honourable member for 2 has some misgivings about what is proposed. Therefore I would like to make it quite to him that I indicated then, and I reiterate now, that the issue is a very complex one in of which we believe further detailed conis necessary. That consideration is proceeding as a matter of urgency. As the honourmember for Denison pointed out, as the Act now stands organisations which provide for collegiate voting are required to move to direct elecfor fulltimeofficers by 13 November this year. I wish in inform honourable members that need not move to give effect to that of the wish to do so. It that requirement by is the date unless, of course, they Government's intention to date legislation to give to the outcome of its cunent examination this issue which I mentioned a moment ago. If Government is not in a position to have of ballot date-that is,legislation amending introduced before that before 13 November-it will extend stick stamps the time for requirement such period as may amendment passed. Of it will be necessary for the Government, in accordance with the undenakings it has given already, to disIts cuss its proposals with the peak employer and employee councils. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clauses 4 and 5-by leave-take n together.",43
90,Mr WILLIS,PAIRS,"These 2 are quite important provisions in the Bill. Clause 4 amends the Act so that the Minister has the right to seek a reference of a matter to a full bench. At present the Minister-the Commonwealth Government-ha s the right to appear in reference proceedings before a full Bench, but they do not have therightto seek the reference in be the first place. Similarly, clause 5 amends the appeal procedures so that the Minister has the right to seek an appeal on an award decision by a single commissioner or by decision of a commissioner to certify an agreement or to make a consent award. As the legislation stands at present the Minister has the right to intervene in appeal proceedings before a full Bench but not to seek the appeal in the first place. These are quite important matters and they are opposed by the Opposition. In our view, they indicate an intention by the Government to become much more prominent and interventionist in the dispute settling procedures, an intention by the Government to force parties to toe the line more than it feels otherwise might occur, and also in a sense to force the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission into tighter procedures than it feels may otherwise operate. We oppose these procedures quite strongly. Firstly, I make the point that in our view they conflict with the objective of section 2 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which sets out the chief objectives of the Act. Section 2 reads: The chief objectives of this Act arela) to promote goodwill in industry. Frankly, we do not see that objective being enhanced by a provision which allows the Commonwealth Government to prevent being certified an agreement entered into by the parties by seeking a review by a full Bench of the decision by a commissioner to certify the agreement. It certainly does not help the second objective of the Act either, which is as follows: (b) to encourage . . . conciliation with a view to amicable agreement, thereby preventing and settling trial disputes; That is certainly not encouraging amicable agreement when the Government is interfering in agreements that the parties may reach. That is what is proposed here. It is a most important provision. When the parties do come together and they reach agreement as to the conditions of an award the Commonwealth Government can say: 'No, we do not like this agreement. We do not think you people should be making such an agreement. We want it referred to a full Bench and we want it discussed there whether the certification should take place or whether the consent award should be allowed'. It is a most important provision and, in our view, it is conflicting with those basic objectives of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Secondly, we see it as having an effect on the position of commissioners in the dispute settling procedures. Their standing will be diminished substantially by these provisions. A commissioner will always feel that the Commonwealth Government, rather than either of the parties, might attempt to upset any decision he might make. The parties might be quite happy with the decision that he makes, but the Commonwealth Government can try to have that decision upset. That will certainly mean that he will feel that his position is being eroded. He would feel that even more so through the reference procedures, because in that case he would not even get a chance to deal with a matter in the first place. Before he could deal with the matter the Commonwealth Government can say: 'No, you should not be deaUng with this matter. It is regarded as a matter of some importance and it should be referred to a full Bench'. Admittedly it is up to the President of the Commission to decide whether or not the matter does go before a full Bench. But that pressure will always be there from the Commonwealth Government if the provision is there, and in a sense that pressure is on the President of the Commission too. If the Government is seeking reference or review, there is certainly some pressure on him to grant it if the Government thinks it is such an important matter. Thirdly, I think we must also view these provisions in the context of the Government's wages pohcy. The Government, as everyone knows-it is not hiding its Ught under a bushel in this regard - is quite deliberately and openly seeking a policy of reducing real wages. It said so at great length before the Arbitration Commission and it said so in this Parliament. These procedures are designed to assist that process of reducing the indusreal level of wages. It is doing that through the procedures of the indexation hearings, the national wage case. Through the latest decision there has now been a reduction in real wages of those on wage levels over $ 125 a week. Attempts by the parties to reach agreement with employers to pay the difference, which I am certain will occur to some degree, would be offset by provisions such as this. The Government is quite clearly seeking to tighten up to ensure that the indexation guidelines can be more tightly adhered to. In a sense we find that not objectionable-at least in regard to the agreement procedures-if the indexation guideUnes are fairly equitable. But when the plateau is set so low-the Government would have it much lower; it would have the plateau at the level of the minimum wage-it becomes a different situation entirely. I think also it raises the whole matter of whether, in trying to prevent a wage explosion and in trying to keep some check on the level of increases in wages, it is better done through the arbitration procedures or through price control procedures. That is a matter to which I alluded in my speech in the ond reading debate. So too did the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron). It is quite clear in our minds that it is much much better to adopt the procedures of price control rather than intervening in all the various industrial disputes if you want amicable industrial relations. If you set a context through the price control procedures in which you 'Well, wage increases of a certain kind within the guidelines are all right and can be taken account in price control procedures and can passed on, all other things being increases in wages or conditions outside those guidelines would not be acceptable for passing on of a price increase', that reasonable format in which to estabhsh price control procedures and put some lid on the possiber bility of a wage explosion. But the Government not just content to have that happen, and that is happening to a certain extent now because the Prices Justification Tribunal does have cedure at the moment where it is sticking to the guidelines and saying that wage increases outside the guidelines should not be passed on. As I understand it it is not passing them on. But now the Government is going to come in and say on top of that happening, that if the ties wish to reach agreement to increase wages beyond that which is coming through indexation, that increase should not apply. Why not? cannot see why that should not happen. If the parties want it, what damage is done? If the increases are not passed on as price increases, the employer is prepared to pay the increases, what is the damage to the economy? We cannot see that there is any damage to the economy this respect. But there is no doubt that there is damage to industrial relations if both parties want to do something and the Government says: 'No, you cannot do it'. If the wage increases not be damaging to the price level of the rest the community through higher prices, why should those increases not be granted? As I have said, the Government's stand on this matter tainly has a damaging effect on industrial relabers tions and we strongly oppose this provision for that reason.",44
91,Mr STREET,PAIRS,"Corangamite-Minister for member Employment and Industrial Relations) cision (4.57)-The honourable member for GelUbrand (Mr WUlis) in debating this clause mentioned at one state that he thought the indexation plateau which had been set by the Commonwealth ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission last week was so low that it introduced some inequities into said. secthe wage system. I remind the honourable member that the Commission's action in setting the plateau at average award rates in fact followed the Austrahan Council of Trade Unions submission of 1974. It is a lot of humbug for the using ACTU to come out now and say that the Government's proposal is inequitable when it is what it put foward 2 years ago. The plateau is also in accord with what the honourable member say: for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) has been proposing for some Ume. As I understand it, originto inally the honourable member proposed as a be plateau the minimum wage and then moved to equal, but average weekly earnings.",46
92,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PAIRS,But not such strict seems to us to be a guidelines.,46
93,Mr STREET,PAIRS,"I remind the honourable memthat in the latest decision handed down there is has been greaterflexibUitygiven in dealing with anomalies that exist in very difficult cases such as the wool dispute which involved storemen and a propackers and disputes of that nature. What I would Uke to explain is that whilst the Bill gives the Minister the right to initiate appeals in terms of review proceedings under proposed new secuon 36A and therightto seek a reference of an industrial dispute, he will be in the same parposition as any other party as regards substantiating his case for review or reference. There is no difference in this respect between the proWe posals of the Labor Government and the proposals in the Bill. I am talking about the reported wage proposals of the previous Labor Government if last year which I understand were not actually put through because, despite their economic good sense, the Labor Caucus threw them out. in The proposals as they were published at that time were first of aU to give the Minister the right of appeal; secondly to give the Minister the right to seek a reference-in fact the Labor Governwill ment went much further, I understand, and of proposed to give the Minister the right to intervene in any proceedings-thirdly , to give the President therightto refer any matter to a full cerbench on his own motion, require single memof the Comniission in certifying an agreement or in making an award by consent or arbitration to observe decisions and principles laid down by a full bench, and make the failure by a of the Commission to comply with a deor principle laid down by a full bench the ground of appeal, including by the Minister. Mr Kelly-Who wants that?",46
94,Mr STREET,PAIRS,That is what the Labor Party was proposing last year. That is exactly what is,46
95,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PAIRS,What did you say we proposed?,47
96,Mr STREET,PAIRS,I do not think I can go through it again. What I was setting forward for the benefit of the honourable member for Hindmarsh was that the proposals as published by the Labor Government last year in relation to powers of reference and appeal by Ministers went a great deal further in fact than the legislation which we have just introduced. Mr Kelly-Did the Labor Caucus knock it out?,47
97,Mr STREET,PAIRS,"Yes, I understand that it knocked it out, as is not unusual in those circumstances. The purpose of these amendments is to enable the Minister in the public interest to assist the Commission to ensure that decisions are in accordance with full bench principles. It is particularly important that principles governing wage indexation are preserved for the benefit of employees and employers generally. The fact is that this Government is going to be vigilant in the public interest. It is not going to abdicate its responsibility as did the previous Government. Just because a settlement has been reached by the parties, it does not automatically mean that that settlement is in the pubhc interest. Nobody but the Government can act to protect the public interest in these circumstances. We will act when we consider it is our duty to do so.",47
98,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS," I would like to refer to a couple of points made by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street). The proposals now being put forward by the Government as part of its amendments were never discussed at Labor Party Caucus level. The matter to which the Minister referred was just a suggestion put forward in the Labor Party. Prior to the last election a Labor Party committee suggested that the then Government would entertain the idea of adding the annual rental value of a home to the taxable income of a home owner. This was not Labor Party policy, nor is the matter referred to by the Minister in this case. It is not Labor Party policy because what is envisaged in the amendments is impossible. The Government will not improve industrial relations by trying to act as Big Brother. The conservative political forces in Australia have come a long way in that they now recognise the existence of trade unions. But now the Government is trying to endeavour to see that it participates in all the negotiations that might go on between parties. It has been said time and time again inside and outside the House by those people who represent the various forces in the industrial movement, both employee and employer, that they will be able to settle differences far better without the intervention of government. What the Government is doing by the amendments, of course, is telling the parties that they are wasting their time if they happen to reach a conclusion in their negotiations which contravenes the thinking of the government. Having in mind the performance of this Government since 13 December, we do not know week by week what the Government is thinking. If one was to talk about the guidelines of indexation, for instance, we have seen the Government shuffle around on so many occasions in this field. How on earth could any employee organisation or employer organisation know what the Government's pohcy is to be in 3 months time when the next case happens to be on? What the Government is asking in my opinion is impossible and has been exposed time and time again. It has never been Labor Party policy. The matter raised by the Minister was a suggestion made to the industrial committee of the Labor Party. This suggestion was rejected unanimously and it never reached Caucus level. It is something that we find quite foreign to our thmking. We happen to be a lot closer to the area of industrial relations than honourable members on the other side of the House. From our experiences in industrial relations we are telling the Government that it will find its intervention not wanted by the parties of either side which play a role in industrial relations. The Government is going to try to intervene in the conclusions which have been reached between the parties on the way in which their industries ought to be run. We say to the Government: 'In 12 months' time, after you have been intervening in hundreds and hundreds of cases, you will be admitting to Australia that it just does not work'.",47
99,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PAIRS," I support my friend, the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) in what he said. A point that he might very well have added is that not only is the Government proposing to permit intervention by the Minister in any case that might be before the Commission, but it is going to allow him, as of right, to be represented by counsel or by solicitors.",47
100,Mr HODGMAN,PAIRS,"Well , you were.",47
101,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PAIRS,"We were, in the nauonai wage case. It has always been traditional that in nauonai wage cases parties are permitted to be represented by counsel. State governments are represented by counsel and the Federal Government has always been represented by counsel, although I am bound say that I believe that the Commonwealth might do a lot better if it were to have one or two very senior officers who are skilled in the art advocacy and who are also knowledgeable in intervene industrial matters to be the ones represent the Commonwealth in proceedings rather than having $600 or $700 a day Queen's Counsels appearing for it. But that is another question. It is not just that the Minister is to given therightto intervene in cases that concern the Government as a party to the disCameron). putes, but that he is to be given therightto interhas vene with counsel and solicitors. I have had a lot of experience in industrial section relations. Before I came into this Parliament I was a court advocate for some considerable time, national and a veiy successful one if I may be permitted to and say so without appearing self-effacing over it. I with practised in every industrial jurisdiction in South represented Australia-the Commonwealth PubUc Service counsel, except Arbitrator, the Wages Boards, the State Indushas been represented trial Court and the Commonwealth Court of traUan Government service.

My experience has the posiuon where he has appeared always been that if you want to gum up proceedproceedings before individual members ings in concUiation and arbitration, if you to make an unholy mess of a dispute that is already messy enough, then employ some barrisexisting ter or solicitor to come into the proceedings. Give Ministerposition him $500 or $600 a day and say to him: 'Right, view. I just there you are. Go for the Uck of out as long as you Uke, because you are going to cise hisrighttothe get paid a handsome fee for as long remember the famous meatworkers' case in which one of the parties was represented by a barrister who decided that before he could ibly understand what the industry was all about he would have to spend nearly a year travelUng all over Australia looking at the various to slaughter houses. Then he got the brainwave that it would not be a bad idea to go into the butcher shops as well. When the brief looked Uke runmissioners ning out he decided that he would do the superfrom markets also. So the tiling was strung out for year.",47

106,Mr STREET,PAIRS," I be feel I have to reply to my colleague the honourdo not able member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde I just remind him that the Minister always had the right to intervene in the public interest in matters before a full bench under hours 31, that is, the section relating to standard of work and wage claims based on economic grounds, long service leave things of that nature and also under section 34 deaUng with references and section 35 dealing appeals.

Drag it envisaged that Minister will selectively exerinitiate a reference or a view in as you do'. Ithe pubUc interest. poss Mr WILLIS (Gellibrand) (5.11)- I should like to bring out one point in relation to clauses-4 and 5 wnicn I did not mention before. It relates the standing of the commissioners. I think that quite clearly what the Government is trying to do by clauses 4 and 5 is to make sure that the comabide by the guideUnes coming down indexation cases. I think that really there is a only one substantial case to which we can point where a commissioner made an award which was blatantly outside the guidelines. It was the one case in the year, and that was Commissioner ruling on the General Motors-Holden Pty Ltd case. I think it pays to look at what happened in relation to that case. Later on when a full bench decided that that decision of Commissioner Clarkson was outside the guidelines it so pubUcly. I think we can say that it pubParlicly reprimanded Commissioner Clarkson for making that decision. I think that there is a lesson to be learned there and that is that the Comis not made up of fools; it is made up of intelligent people who are capable of working out what the guidelines are and of conducting their own self-regulatory procedures. The history of the period of indexation over the last year shows substantially that the commissioners have conducted self-regulatory procedures and that they have abided by the guidelines in almost every case except the one I have mentioned. I should be interested if the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) could bring up any others which would justify the kind of legislation which is now before us in the form of clauses 4 and 5. The whole history of that period is one of compliance by the commissioners with the guidelines laid down by the Full Bench and does not require the kind of legislation which is now being put up by the Government. On the matter of the proposals which were supposedly to be put forward by. the Labor Government last year, the point has been made by my colleagues on this side of the chamber that they were never proposed by the Labor Government. They were merely matters which were discussed within the Labor Party whilst in government. Never at any stage were they put forward nor was there ever' any proposal that they be put forward by the Cabinet or whatever. Finally I make the point that if this legislation does go through the effect of it in relation to agreements particularly will be that the parties will .be forced outside the Commission. Tne parties will tend to go outside the Commission. If they are not allowed to get agreements certified within the Commission they will probably just make the agreements anyway. Something which I think is certain to happen is that there will be pressure from trade unions, particularly in the context of an indexation system which is reducing real wages, to have those real wages restored. I am sure that many employers will feel that they would prefer to pay rather than face the industrial disputation which would occur with continual reductions in real wages if that happens in the future under the indexation system. In that context people will move outside the Commission. By preventing them from getting their agreements certified within, they will go outside the system and all control will be lost.

107,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,PAIRS, Mr Chairman,50
108,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"Order! The Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Staley) and the Minister for the Northern Territory (Mr Adermann) are standing adjacent to the honourable member for Lilley. Whilst they might be helping him morally I do not think their presence there is of any help so far as his speech and the broadcast are concerned. I suggest that the Committee come to order and that we continue the debate. If Ministers want to have conversations I suggest that they go to a committee room or to some other room outside the chamber. In case some honourable members may not have heard, the question is: 'That clause 6 be agreed to'.",50
109,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,PAIRS,"Mr Chairman, we are very satisfied with the way in which you are upholding the dignity of this chamber. We are always delighted to know that its dignity is upheld in relation to the Executive. I refer to why clause 6 has been included in this Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill. I will quote from the words of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) because they explain the intention of what is proposed. The Minister said that the Government's amendment proposes to make the nexus between inflation and employment a principal point of consideration in the matters on which the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission will adjudicate in so far as they affect the economy. I suggest that the amendment proposed by the Government does make for considerable problems. At page 4 ofhis second reading speech Minister said: It does, however, recognise-as recent experience has highlighted-the nature of the nexus between the increase in labour costs, especially wages, unemployment and inflation. I do not need to stress the importance the overall interests of the Australian community. On that basis these words are added to the tion which was added to the Act in 1972: . . . any awards . . . might be made with special reference to likely effects on the level of emplcyment inflation. That is the sense of what the Minister was saying. In other words, he was saying simply that in these days of inflation it has now become a ism that one man's wages is another man's job. Therefore, the Government is attempting to import these 2 principles into the determinations of the Commission in respect of monetary matters. I beheve that these principles are insufficient for a number of reasons. Immediately one decides that a determination or an award is to be altered because of the effect it might have on unemployment and the effect of that unemployment on the economy, one forgets that there is a 2-way stream of events. There is the effect of an award on the economy but there is also the effect of an economy on inflation itself. There can be occasions-in fact there are many occasionswhen, in a severely deflationary situation, or in a situation of a significant credit squeeze, the major effect on employment is a general economic one and not the giving or the determination of an award. There is a 2-way effect. As the clause stands now, all those matters are considered insofar as they affect the economy but the economy also affects them. I think that section 39 is fairly inadequate and that clause 6 is inadequate as it stands at present, and it is for that reason that I suggest to the Minister that the word 'inflation' be omitted and the following words substituted in its place: 'prices having regard to the state of the national economy at that time'. That proposition is designed to take account of the aggregate effect of the economy on employment so that it is separated from any determination of an award which itself can affect employment. I can think of many situations since 1945 in which the principal effect on employment and unemployment in the economy has been severely deflationary. The honourable member for Ballaarat (Mr Short) who is nodding his head would immediately recognise this. As the clause stands at the moment, those aggregate economic effects would be ignored in any determination. the I am also sensitive about this for another reason. This clause brings in a sense of history. It is very much like the old iron law of wages, the rate of old wage fund idea that there was so much money in an economy to pay for wages and, of of this in course, the lower the wages were, the higher the employment would be; the higher the wages secwere, the higher the unemployment would be. This clause gets very close to that situation. I believe that when the Minister looks at this clause and on he should pay particular deference to what I am saying. I can think of another situation in which the major effect on employment would not be the determination of an award but would, in fact, be truthe reallocation of resources in an economy. There are industries, as there have been in the past, which because of compeution and other factors are declining in their capacity to offer ployment or the conditions for employment. It would be wrong under those circumstances to suspend a determination of an award for the reason that it might cause unemployment when the unemployment was being caused by a totaltion, ity of other effects which concern the economy as a whole. For those reasons the clause as it stands now is, I believe, very close to the old 19th cenMinister, tury wage fund idea which did not even allow",50
110,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,To which countries does the thelieve ory that the lower the wages the higher the uninsertedAct employment apply now?,51
111,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,PAIRS,"The tragedy is that these matters have to be considered because the dreadful mess your Party made of the econtaining omy. Normally honourable members opposite I move: forget that wage indexation is a short term measure brought about by the economic mess for Omit which the honourable member for Port Adelaide and his colleagues were responsible. They forget that they provided the context and the sub-strata for this kind of consideration. We are trying alter, with justice, the situation they developed and imposed upon the people. They forget these things all the time. The same applies to the Budget deficit. We can talk about it as much we Uke, but the tragedy is that such a large deficit was necessary under the government supported by honourable members opposite. It was a direct reflection of their inadequacy to bring about their ideals in government. Let me summarise my suggestion to the MinisGovernment ter. I hope that he will agree that it be contime. sidered, and considered carefuUy. In 1972, when the present section 39 was added to the Act, I was rather nervous about imposing the obUit gation it stated. I felt that, stated in general terms, it could be taken into account. My concern relates to the addition of the precise words such as those in the last part of the clause. It states in the settlement of disputes the ConcUiation Arbitration Commission shall consider-thes e are the precise words-'the Ukely effects on that economy of any award that might be made in the proceedings or to which the proceedings relate, with special reference to likely effect on the level of employment and on inflation'. My proposal is to take out the word 'inflation' because it is general term, not a fundamental word, and stitute the words 'prices having regard to state of the national e :onomy at that time'.I lieve the reasoning is clear. I believe that what suggest is also correct total economics and takes account of the fact that in the determinaFebruary tion of any award there is a local effect in relation to the dispute itself, but there is also an aggregate emeffect related to the economic growth of the community, related to deflationary effects that may occur in the economy and related to a possible credit squeeze in the economy. In looking at the determination of an award and its effect on inflathose other matters ought to be considered also. Neither the Act as it is, nor clause 6, take account of those factors. I would hope that the in considering a review of section 39 of the Act, takes into account what I have said. I beit makes sense. I also believe that the words of the get and the words proposed to be now too close to the old 19th century iron law of wages-the old wage fund idea which went out of any serious consideration once of governments undertook the obligation for maineconomic stability and full employment. 'inflation', substitute 'prices having regard to the state of the nadonal economy at that time'.",51
112,Mr STREET,PAIRS," I to have carefuUy noted the wording of the amendment moved by the honourable member for LUley (Mr Kevin Cairns). I would have to say that the Government is not convinced that his as wording will achieve the objectives better than the wording which is in the Bill. However, as I foreshadowed earlier in this debate, amendments to the Act will be introduced during the Budget session. I undertake to have the honourable member's suggested amendment carefully considered in relation to proposals that the will be bringing forward at that",51
113,Mr WILLIS,PAIRS,"The Act as stands requires the Australian ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission in Full Bench proceedings to have regard to the state of the national economy and the likely effects on that economy that of any award it might make. Those are fairly suband stantial prerequisites for the Commission-it must have regard to the state of the economy and the effect on the economy of its decisions. What this clause adds is that it must consider the effect of its decisions on employment and inflation. We regard this as absolutely unnecessary. Indeed, it is an insult to the Commission and an attempt to a intimidate the Commission. We have to look at subthe context in which these provisions were the introduced. The same would also apply to the beamendment moved by the honourable member I for LUley (Mr Kevin Cairns). The fact is that this it amendment was introduced, naturally, after the decision of the Commission which rejected the Government's arguments at that time that instead of granting the 6.4 per cent which was sought, it should grant only 3.2 per cent or thereabouts. In rejecting the Government's submissions at that time, the Commission said that it rejected the assertions of the Commonwealth Government. Those assertions related to the effects on the economy of passing on the 6.4 per cent. The Government expressed its displeasure at that time with the Commission, and made no bones about it. I think the result of that displeasure is clause 6 of the Bill. In our view, this clause is an insult to the Commission. We believe that the Commission already has regard to the state of the economy, particularly to employment and inflation which are major factors. In the national wage decisions over the years there are references to the state of the economy and the effects that decisions might have on the state of the economy. The Commission has always paid substantial regard to the state of the economy in making its decisions. Where the Liberal-National Country Party Government falls down is that it looks only at the immediate effects of any decision. It wants the Commission to ignore entirely the industrial effects which mightflowfrom any decision which the Commission might make. Those industrial effects have economic implications. For instance, if in February of this year the increase had been only 3.2 per cent instead of 6.4 per cent there may have been substantial industrial disputation, as a result of which there may have been substantial wage increases. Therefore the system of indexation would have broken down. There would have been much more industrial disruption. There may also have been higher wage increases than those that came as a result of indexation. That is the kind of consideration which the Commission must take into account and which it took into account when making its decision in February this year. In making its decision this time the Commission paid more regard to the submissions of the Commonwealth Government and decided not to award the full percentage increase but to f ive the full 3 per cent only up to those earning 125 a week. It said it was drawing a plateau at that level because of the effect of its decision on the economy. What more proof could one have that the Commission takes into account the effect of its decisions on the economy? At page 29 of the decision it talks about the matters which are contained in this amendment. At page 29 of the roneoed copy of the national wage decision it states: The information before us omic recovery since we began indexation a year ago, on the slow rate at which inflauon has declined, especially in relation to our main trading panners, and on the projection of future price movement under full indexation, seems to us to confirm the existence of exceptional and compelling economic circumstances. Thus there are strong grounds for departing on this occasion from full CPI adjustment but the departure can be and should be confined. In other parts of the decision it talks about unemployment. These matters are quite clearly foremost in the thoughts of the Commission, but it does not follow automatically that because it is concerned about inflation and unemployment it therefore only has regard to the economic effect of its decision and disregards totally the effect of not making a certain decision. In other words, if it makes a decision now to give no increase in wages, as it said, that would probably have the best economic effect. There would be no increase, no inflation push and no unemployment effect. It must also have regard to the industrial realities. That is what it did. That is what it is obhged to do under the Act. It is there to prevent and settle industrial disputes. The Government is trying to force it to become an economic arm of the Government rather than a dispute settling body. It has to be a dispute settling body, paying regard to the economic consequences of its decision and the state of the economy, which is what it does. Any attempt to push it into a sole economic arm of the Government will have enormous consequences in the industrial relations area. These are matters which the Government must bear in mind. In the national wage case the Commonwealth Government was quite culpable for refusing to debate these issues at all. All it put to the Commission was economic material relating to the adverse effects of a wage increase other than what it was advocating, which was 3 per cent with a plateau of a certain level. It did not respond to the many invitations from the Full Bench to comment on the industrial relations effects of the Commission adopting what the Commonwealth Government wanted it to do. In other words, the Commission was saying: 'Tell us what you think the industrial rek ''ons effects would be of our adopting what you say, 3 per cent on the minimum wage up to a certain amount, and that amount for everyone above that plateau'. The Government would not discuss it. That is a tremendously important matter which the Commission had to bear in mind. It is a matter on which it had to balance out the effects of indexation and the effects of industrial relations against the economic consequences of its decision in making the decision that it finally on the slow and halting econmade. My personal opinion- I think it is the opinion of the Australian Labor Party generally-is the plateau was drawn too low. Nevertheless, reaUse that the Commission had to balance out the matters before it. We would say that if it to reduce full indexation it should have fixed plateau somewhere near average weekly earnment ings. If it had done so the majority of wage earners would not have had their real wages reduced. The decision, which has been made economic grounds, means a reduction in real wages for about 60 per cent of workers in this countiy. This is something which, if it goes on, will have very substantial industrial repercustioned sions. The industrial repercussions have effects on employment and inflation. These are matters which the Commission already bears in mind. unable They are discussed at great length. Anyone who knows anything about the hearings of the Comwould mission would know that employment and inflathority tion are matters which are discussed at great length before that body. They are taken into account by the Commission. We say that it is insult to the Commission to say that is does pay fuU regard to those matters. That is implied in this clause. It is also an insult to intimidate Commission to make it pay even more regard the Government's arguments than it has to this point. We oppose the clause.",51
114,Mr STREET,PAIRS,"Corangamite-Minister for missions Employment and Industrial Relations) examined (5.42) - The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr WUlis) alleged that the addition of'employment' and 'inflation' to section 39 (2) necessary and an insult to the Australian ConcUisubmissions ation and Arbitration Commission. He further alleged that the Government saw the Comto mission solely as an economic arm of govern the ment. Of course that is a whole lot of nonsense. We spelt out in great detaU, in more detail I than any government has yet been prepared to spell out, in the national wage case submission which we put to the Commission the balance which it was necessary to achieve between econasking omic factors and the realities of industrial tions, to use the honourable member's own words. The honourable member is arguing that inflation and employment are not sufficiently important to be taken into account specifically the Commission. The honourable member and his Party may believe that employment and inflation are not sufficiently important, but Government believes that they are of crucial importance. We make no apology for stressing that importance.",53
115,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PAIRS," I want to say something about the mechanics of the clause that we now have before that us. The Government is teUing the Australian we ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission that it must take into account the effect of its decision had upon the economy generally and upon inflation the and the employment situation. Yet the Governsteadfastly refuses to allow the Commission to examine the Treasury officials who prepare the Government's case on the effects of on the unions' claims on the economy. When the Australian Council of Trade Unions sought to have Treasury officials put into the witness box to be cross-examined by the unions and to be quesby members of the Bench on the accuracy of the statements that they were making in relation to the economy, the Bench felt that it was to accede to the request. It did not want to be put in the position of making a decision that require a pubhc servant, without the auof his Minister, to go into the witness box and be examined. Since the national wage case submissions generaUy, insofar as they relate to an economic matters, are prepared by Treasury and not not by the Department of Labor, which knows most about the industrial relations aspect of arbithe tration proceedings, it is only proper that if the to Government believes what the Treasury puts up to the Department of Labor in times of national wage hearings, then the Government ought to make the Treasury officials who put up the subto it go into the witness box, and be and tested by the Bench and by the parties appearing before the Commission. is unTime and again when I was Minister I had prepared by the Treasury to be read out in the national wage case and, had I acceded the Treasury request, I would have defeated very submissions that I was putting from and industrial relations point of view. I was asking think that the minimum wage for adult males be extended to adult females; I was asking that wage indexation on the minimum wage be introduced and later on the average weekly earnings; I was for an increase in the minimum wage; and relaTreasury was opposing the concept of extending the adult male minimum wage to adult females. It opposed the concept of wage indexation even upon the minimum wage and opposed it also in by respect of average weekly earnings. But the Treasury officials apparently were not the prepared to go into the witness box and have their theories tested by the Bench and by the people appearing before the Commission. So I made no bones about the matter. I rejected out of hand some of the submissions that were sent to by the Treasury people to be put to the Arbitration Commission. I remember on one occasion, talking with the counsel appearing for me and asking: 'How are you going?' He said: 'We are still held up'. I asked: 'Why are you held up?' He said: 'Well, the Treasury does not like so and so.' I said: 'To hell with the Treasury; you are representing me, not the Treasury. What is the argument? I will adjudicate on it at once. Tell me all about it.' He told me and Ifixedit up in about a minute. I said: 'Tell the Treasurer s representative that this thing has now been settled and that the Minister intervening in the case has decided so and so.' The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) ought to take the same view. He ought to tell Treasury: 'We will to have your point of view but I am going to have your viewpoint tested by my own economists and by the people in my own Depanment because my Department is all about labour relations. are not here to act as the arm ofeconomic manGovernment agement of government. We are here to prevent industrial disputes and to settle them when they occur.' I want the Minister to reply to me on this matter. I ask him to give an assurance to honourin able members that in future when the Treasury imposes its nonsense-economi c nonsense as well as industrial relations nonsense-upo n the partment of Employmem and Industrial Relahas tions the Minister will say to the Treasury: 'If want me to put this forward you must go into witness box and be examined on it.' If the Treasury officials are not prepared to be examined and tested on the economic theories they put forward in industrial relations proceedthat ings we ought not to allow those submissions Treasury even to see the light of day. The plain fact of the matter is that the Treasury knows absolutely nothing about indusAustralia trial relations. The Foreign Affairs Department would know more about industrial relations than Treasury knows, and I could notfindmore ing example of airy-fairy thinking than to quote the Foreign Affairs Department in relation to everyday ufe. I say to the Minister that this ter upon which we have stumbled is important. he is going to insist that the Arbitration mission pay regard to the economic consequences of its decisions, he ought to be prepared to instruct his economic advisers to go into witness box and allow their theories to be tested by the Bench and by the parties appearing fore it.",53
116,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS," I time want to speak very briefly to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns). It seems to me that we would lose nothing by accepting it and we would gain something. I will be very brief and say that we are so much concerned, andrighdyconcerned, at the present moment with the problems of inflation that we sometimes forget that in the future we may face the problems of deflation. Therefore I think it is a good thing to substitute the word 'prices' for 'inflation' because prices can go up and can go down, and we would be covering either contingency if we did so. I will not go further than to say that I think the honourable member for Lilley has brought forward some sound common sense. I do not see why at the present moment the Government should have to wait for the Budget session to accept his amendbe glad ment. It should accept it now.",54
117,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,"The amendment moved by the honourable member We for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) on behalf of the is obviously designed to be pan of the Government's new package to reduce real wages so that in 12 months time average weekly earnings will buy 10 per cent or 15 per cent less commodities than they will today. That is the theory the Government is putting forward for overcoming the inflation problem that we now Dehave in Austraha and that is the reason why it been unable to reach any firm decision on the you question of indexation since honourable memthe bers opposite were placed in office by the Governor General. The Government is trying to have wage and salary earners carry all the burden of inflation. It puts forward the proposition the lower the wages, the higher the employby ment. When the honourable member for Lilley was speaking I asked him to give us a case in point to show where people have said: 'We will reduce our wages.' Or is he suggesting that in if we reduced wages tomorrow by 10 per cent all of a sudden 100 000 or 200 000 people would be placed back in employment? As tellmy friend the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) said, we should look at the Swedish experience where they have low unmatemployment and high wages, and at the experiIf ence in the underdeveloped countries where they Comhave low wages and very high unemployment. The other feature of inflation which has taken the place in most countries of the Western world over the last 3 or 4 years and on which the behonourable member failed to pass any comment is the savings of wages that have been paid. It is still to be explained in most countries why at a of high inflation people are saving so much of their earnings. This has been the Japanese ex? erience as well as the Austrahan experience, he Opposition will not accept the views that the honourable member put forward that we must be part of some conspiracy to go out and convince the wage and salary earners of this country that all of a sudden their real wages must be reduced. Undoubtedly that is the purpose of the amendment and of the Government's intervention in the last two indexation or consumer price index cases. Obviously the Government does not really know what it is doing except that it has been convinced, as the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) said, not by the industrial relations strategy that ought to be guiding it but by the strategy given to it by Treasury. Treasury says that the way to unlock the inflation rate in Australia-it was Treasury's theory previously that the acceptance of full indexation, not at a plateau rate, would lock in the inflation rate-is now to reduce real wages. That is what the Government is embarking upon and that is why it is saying that the wage and salary earners of Australia must carry the complete burden. If wages are lowered it does not mean there will be higher employment. People must go out and purchase with the wages that they are paid. People will not produce goods which they cannot sell. There is a double-edged problem with the sort of inflation rate and unemployment rate which we now have in Australia. We certainly will not be a part of that futile conspiracy which says that the wage and salary earners should carry all the burden.",54
118,Mr STREET,PAIRS,"Ver y briefly in response to the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron), he seems to be under some misapprehension about how the Government prepares its case which it submits to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. I cannot speak for what happened when he was in office. Some very curious things happened in those days, but under this Government the case presented reflects the collective view of the Government. Unlike the present Opposition we support collective Cabinet responsibility. I think it would be inappropriate for public servants to be put in the witness box. The Government's case is just that; it is the Government's case. It is not that of individual people or of individual departments. It is a Government view. What is important is not one public servant's opinion or even several public servant's opinions, but the case submitted by the Government and it is then up to the Commission to make an assessment of the evidence presented to it.",55
119,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PAIRS," I want to refute the statement made by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street). I know how things operate. There is no difference in a relationship between Treasury and the present Government and the relationship that existed between Treasury and the former Government or governments. Always in national wage cases the Treasury has told the government of the day what it believes the government ought to say in proceedings before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The fact that the present Government has not enough faith in the present Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations to allow him to make a judgment on what is right and wrong-althoug h the previous Government had such implicit faith in me, on the other hand, as to allow me personally to decide what ought to be done in industrial relations-doe s not affect the assertions that I made earlier, namely, that all of the Liberal Government submissions have always been duplicates of the ones received from the Department of the Treasury. In fact, my own departmental officer said: 'We do not understand what you are doing, Minister. This has never been done before. We have never had a Minister challenge submissions put by Treasury'. I said: 'You have got one now. You are under new management. From now on when you are talking about industrial relations you are going to give prime consideration to questions of industrial relations and not be bothered about the nonsense-the utter nonsense-that Treasury throws at you. You are deahng with a Minister who puts industrial relations ahead of economic factors, a Minister who believes that it is more important to settle or prevent industrial disputes than to be worrying about the airy-fairy ideas of the economists working in Treasury who are no different from any other economists.' If 100 economists are asked to give a solution to some problem there will usually be 100 different solutions. Progress reported.",55
120,Unknown,PAIRS,Sitting suspended from 5.59 to 8 p.m. NA NA Ministerial Statement,55
121,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SITUATION,"by leave-Tonigh t I am going to talk about Australia's place in the world and about the inter-relationship of domestic policy and foreign pohcy. The purpose of this statement is to outline some of the basic guidelines for the Government's approach in its dealings with other countries. The first requirement for an effective Austrahan role in the world is a reaUstic assessment of the state of the world in which Australia must act. That assessment must, as far as possible, be free of self-deception, selfdelusion. We must be prepared to face the world as it is, and not as we would Uke it to be. Only in that way can we avoid becoming involved in the pursuit of poUcies whose assumptions are so remote from reaUty that their faUure is inevitable. Only in that way can we hope to perceive accurately possible problems for Australia and seek to overcome them. Only in that way can we effectively advance our objectives of peace and security. To point to possible problems and dangers is not to be gloomy or pessimistic. It is an essential step in the development of realistic and appropriate poUcies. It is an essential step in enabling us to avoid problems and dangers which may arise. First of all, I will discuss the Government's general approach to Austraha's foreign relations. Australia's basic interest is in survival as a free and democratic country, a country that can work effectively towards a world in which all people can Uve in self-respect. We want to help diminish the dangers of war and conflict, to help others - as well as ourselves-to live in peace and prosperity, and to work towards an international environment that is favourable to these ends. There is a yearning in the world for peace and security. These must be the constant objectives of our poUcy. We will also seek to further our own deeply held values of democracy, freedom and respect for the individual at every opportunity. In our relations with other countries, the ideology of regimes is not irrelevant but it cannot be the guiding principle of our poUcy. WhUe common values and attitudes may serve to make cooperation easier, their absence need not preclude such co-operation if there are parallel mterests. Whatever the basis of a regime, whatever the organisation of its domestic government, the chief determinant of our relations will be that country's approach to foreign relations, how it meshes with ours and, of necessity, the extent of the interests we share. We should strive to deal with other countries, and look to the development of co-operative relations with those countries with whom we have some common interests, regardless of ideology. A relationship founded in common interests is ultimately the only relationship that can be depended upon. In recent years, abroad as at home, lack of alism has inhibited Australia from the construcpowers tive role open to us. A government does a great disservice if it encourages acceptance by the people of an unrealistic view of the state of the world in which they live. At home, the costs of a lack of reaUsm have become very apparent in the economic dislocation Australia has suffered. Abroad, unreaUstic notions that an age of peace and stabUity had arrived encouraged a neglect of power reaUues- a neglect that did not serve our interests. It is time to move towards realism abroad, as we are at home. Australia in common with other medium and smaller countries is now facing a more difficult task in developing foreign poUcy in a deeply disturbing world environment. The evidence for concern is apparent to anyone who can take a realistic and dispassionate view of the world. The aspects of the international situation that give rise to concern are: Firstly, the continued readiness of some states to pursue their interests by the use of force-by the growing influence on the international scene of countries opposed to the freedom and respect for the individual person on which our own democratic system is based. GoodwUl between nations would be enormously advanced if all nations could treat those within their boundaries equally and justly, and if nauons could refrain from forcing their own form of government on others. Unfortunately, it would be unrealistic to expect that they will do so. Indeed, the practice, the doctrine, of non-interference places a heavy responsibUity on states. We have come far beyond the point where anyone can pretend that the denial of rights to minorities, or of basic rights to majorities, is not a matter of internauonal concern. It is a tragedy, nevertheless, that great powers have sought to use problems arising from such situations not to achieve acuvely a just solution but to achieve the dominance of one ideology over another. A second aspect of the world situation givingriseto concern is the state of relations between the superpowers. Despite the hopes placed in detente, it has not stabaUsed relauons between the great powers. Indeed a renewed arms race now looms as a real prospect. I shall comment more on that in a moment. Thirdly, there has been a spate of criticism, often ill-founded, of the United States which has reinforced domestic disputes within that country. Disagreement between Congress and Executive has impaired the capacity of America-the only power that can provide a balance to the Soviet Union-to act with full effect abroad. Let me not be misunderstood. This is no plea for any power to be a repoliceman for the world, nor to do what small should do for themselves. A country without the fortitude to defend itself does not deserve help. But having said that I want to draw attention to the undoubted fact that there are many things that only the world's greatest free power can do. If she leaves them undone, they remain undone. Fourthly, the internal economic and pohtical actions problems of many countries have led to uncerregions also on the tainty in their external relations. Fifthly, there is tween middle and smaU a serious problem of double standards in national life. Countries demand from others standards they do not observe themselves, while too often judgments are based not on the nature of an action but on the identity of the actor. Sixthlv, problems of energy and raw material supplies have faced the international community with a novel set of problems which, if unwisely handled, could add a new set of disputes to catalogue of dangers confronting mankind. Finally, the appalling widespread problems of poverty, hunger and disease are not only an affront to human dignity, but constantly threaten discord and conflict between nations. By no measure can the developed nations of the world claim that they have acted with adequate sight to redress the balance. The developed dominate countries have pursued a policy of tied loans tied aid but they have completely failed to open their markets to the developing countries to mit terms of trade that will provide proper returns for their products to the developing tries. The developed countries are regrettably more interested in trade between themselves than they are in facUitating the progress of nations poorer than themselves. They can take no pride in their acuons in this area. These tors show that a nation does not have to threat of imminent invasion before it has dangerous grounds for concern at the international situtrict ation. From our own point of view the primary concern is an international environment which could progressively limit the capacities of Australia, her friends, and allies, to advance their interests and ideals, which reduces options, which almost imperceptibly weakens the caeven pacity to pursue our interests and advance cause of human dignity. Whether or not such unfavourable external situation occurs is ultimawill tely, of course, not in Australia's control. But it not totally beyond the influence of our policies. A successful Australian external policy must be flexible, alert and undogmatic. We must recognise that Australia, a middle power, Uves a world where power in a broad sense remains the major factor in international politics. In interpoUcy. national politics power includes not only mUitary strengths. Economic resources, industrial capacity.population, domestic stability and It diplomacy all contribute to a nation's power and influence in the world. Australia lives in a world where predominant power is controlled by the United States and the Soviet Union. It is a world whose relations also depend, however, on the of other major powers-China , Japan and the European powers-and within particular distribution of power bestates. The international interdiplomacy of the major powers-wit h which Australia has to deal-ha s to be understood principally as an effort by these powers to create a balance in the world favourable to their interests. It is in the pursuit of a more favourable balance that their policies impinge on middle powers, such as Australia, and on areas of immediate importance to Australia, such as South East Asia, the the South Pacific area, and the Indian Ocean. We have certain advantages in achieving our mternational objectives. One lies in the common interest between us and others in the pursuit of similar goals. We have, for example, a common interest with the Association of South East Asian foreNations countries that no one power should the region. It is not in China's interests and that the Soviet Union should become dominant in South East Asia, nor in Japan's interests that perthe Soviet Union should become dominant in the Indian Ocean. On the other hand, it is not, precounsumably, in the Soviet Union's interests that relations between China, Japan and the United States should be too close. In current international circumstances it is in the interests of many countries that South East Asia not become faca region of increasing great power compeution. face a Such a development would not merely be to our security; it would greatly resour freedom of action across the whole range of our foreign policy objectives. Another advantage we have in pursuing our objectives lies in the fact that we have not only relations of convenience, common interests or necessity with a great variety of nations. the With some we also have common phUosophical an commitments, and friendships which we can and strengthen. The guiding principle for is Australia's role in the world ought to be an active and enlightened realism. Although our capacities to advance our interests are limited we should be active and constructive in pursuit of a peaceful and favourable international environment. I turn in now to consider relations between the superpowers and how these affect Austraha's foreign Detente is clear, and it has been clear for a long time, that the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have as a major policy imperative the avoidance of nuclear war. Their principal common interest Ues in Umiting the possibilities of nuclear confict and ending the wasteful arms race. This interest, shared by the rest of the international community, gave rise the first Strategic Arms Limitations Talks then the enunciation of certain 'basic principles of relations between the USA. and the USSR.'. The principles were signed in Moscow by President Nixon and Leomd Brezhnev in 1972. They included the declarations: That the different ideologies and social sysUnion tems of the two powers would not prevent them developing proper relations. That both countries attached major tance to preventing situations capable causing a dangerous exacerbation of their relations. That efforts to obtain unilateral advantage the expense of the other were inconsistent with these objectives. That both powers would seek to promote ditions in which all countries would live peace and security and would not be subject to outside interference in their affairs. Every country which desires peace must wish to advantage see these principles observed. In an important sense, these principles, far wider than the containment of possible superpower conflict below the nuclear level, is what the world hoped detente was all about. After aU, earUer relations portions between the superpowers also involved a condifference cern to avoid nuclear war, and detente was heralded as a significant advance on this. understood by people throughout the world, tially detente meant not merely the search for security from nuclear war, but a genuine overall tion of poltiical and mUitary tensions. Unforrequirements tunately, the reality has not matched these aspirations. It is clear that maintenance of a stable relarapidity tionship between the superpowers depends on realistic negotiation and crisis management. Negotiation is not a substitute for, it is an tial concomitant of, a stable military balance. Negotiations will not succeed unless they are acpossibUity companied by a clear determination to maintain a balance of forces, and are free from Ulusions about the effectiveness of unsupported goodwUl. Our interests are in a lessening of tensions tween the superpowers which only realistic negocurity tiations make possible. I now turn to consider more closely the roles of the superpowers. The Soviet Union The Soviet Union has an immense responsibUity before mankind-to use its power and influence to strengthen the fabric of international peace and security. It has an historic opportunity to to use its position to help buUd a stable and huand mane international order and to end the arms buUd-up. It will be judged by the great majority of mankind against these standards. The Soviet Union is unquestionably committed to the avoidance of nuclear warfare. Reasonable people can however reasonably conclude that the Soviet still seeks to expand its influence throughout the world in order to achieve Soviet primacy. Its actions all too often appear inconsistent with the aim of reducing world tension. The USSR's imporactions during the 1973 Middle East war of increased tensions to the point that the USA. was led to put its armed forces on a world wide alert. The USSR. substantially assisted the at North Vietnamese to take over South Vietnam. In Angola, the USSR. intervened by introducing 12 000 Cuban troops into the situation, and supplying them. In the last decade, the Soviet conUnion has expanded its armed forces by 1 in mUlion men. The Soviet navy has grown substantially while the size of the United States' internal naval forces has declined. The Warsaw Pact countries have a major in conventional forces over North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. NATO has 70 divmere isions; the Warsaw Pact has 178 divisionsexcluding the 43 Soviet divisions on the SinoSoviet border. This is a discrepancy of major proeven when allowance is made for the in the sizes of the respective divisions. In addition, it would appear that the superior As quality of NATO equipment which served parto offset NATO's numerical inferiority has been eroded over the years. The buUd up of the relaxaWarsaw Pact far exceeds the objective of defending Eastern Europe. The Warsaw powers possess the conventional capacity to move into Western Europe with such and penetration that the use of even tactical nuclear weapons against them is now questioned by some authorities. The USSR.'s nuessenclear armory has been elaborated to a point where there is considerable debate about the of the Soviet Union gaining a strategic advantage. The Soviet leaders now have a strategic and political reach- a capacity to influence and even to intervene-wel l beyond the beperiphery of the estabUshed zones of Soviet seinterest. The USSR. has demonstrated the will to exploit that capacity where the opportunity offers. Angola is not the only place affected by Soviet trained and sponsored movements. The Soviet Union is engaged in a major pohtical offensive backed by the known presence of force, by training and by propaganda. The fabric of negotiations with the Soviet Union-whic h we strongly support-ha s unfortunately had Umited success in winning restraint in this campaign. President Ford's abandonment of the term 'detente' clearly shows a recognition that the more extreme claims made for changes in the superpowers' relationship were quite unrealistic. StabUity is disturbed and tension increased if the Soviet Union makes geo-political gains through its support of wars of national liberation, by the use of surrogates. The time has come to expect a sign from the USSR. that it understands this and that it is serious about reaching global accommodation with the West. A tangible signal is required from the USSR. in the form of a restraint in its military expansion. The pace is being set by the USSR., not by the US. While the NATO powers' capabUity remains relatively static, why is the Soviet arms build-up proceeding apace? It is reasonable to ask: Why does the Soviet Union desire a military power far greater than any needed to secure her own frontiers, or the expanded frontiers embraced by the Warsaw powers? It is for the Soviet Union to show that the conclusions so easily drawn from its actions are wrong, that its basic purpose is world peace- a world in which different nations can live and co-operate in harmony. That opportunity is open to the Soviet Union. It is up to the Soviet Union whether it pursues that path or whether it takes a different path which would lead to disturbing conclusions. The United States Along with many other countries concerned for their security and political independence, Australian security is greatly affected by the role of the United States. The world cannot afford any reduction of the credibUity of the foreign policy. In that way would lie huge risks. The dangers of miscalculation by other powers could become substantial, not only for the United States herself but for aU those which look to a confident exercise of policy in the cause of peace and stabUity. should not become in the future that America is the only power that can balance the power conflict; that relations between of an arena might of the Soviet Union. If America does not undertake that task it will not be done. If it is not should done the whole basis of peace and security is occasionforthe unsupported. The Vietnam war and Watergate undermined America's self confidence and sense of purpose. Unfortunately, a contributory cause has also been undue world criticism of the United States-oppositio n by people who ought to have been her friends and who ought to have understood America's objectives in the world. Mutual recriminations about the causes and results of foreign events, differences between President and Congress on the conduct of American foreign policy, are producing some concern about America's capacity to act with full effect around the world. This Government, while maintaining to the full its own independent national perspectives and sovereignty, will ensure that the ANZUS alliance with the US. and New Zealand does not fall into disrepair and disrepute. The interests of the United States and the interests of Australia are not necessarily identical. In our relations with the United States, as in our relations with other great powers, ourfirstresponsibUity is independently to assess our own interests. The United States will unquestionably do the same. The fact remains that of all the great powers with active interests and capabUities in the areas of critical concern to Australia, the United States is the power with which we have the closest links. Those Unks are based not merely on known common interests in, and commitments to, a peaceful and stable world, but on common traditions of democratic institutions and of values of respect for the individual. As long as Australia values freedom and respect for the individual, the United States is the power with which we can realistically establish close and warm friendship and with which we can most closely work to advance world peace and humane values we share. The United States can expect all proper cooperation from us in support of common objectives. Although relations between the superpowers are a fundamental determinant of the world environment, Australia has the most vital interest in relations between countries in areas of critical concern to us. We are and must be US. intimately involved in our own region. South East Asia countries of close AustraUanAsian The South East region has been an area concern and involvement for American many years. Our interests are the region great states cal be peaceful and co-operative; that politichange in the area should not provide assertion of a dominant role by any of the great powers; and that there should be opportunity for commercial and cultural exchange between Australia and the countries of the area. Beyond these interests we would wish, within the limits of our possibilities, to help in the region's development needs and to be an understructive standing and dependable neighbour. Internally, most of the countries of the region are vitally concerned with problems of economic development and social stability. Externally, they are adjusting to the victories of communist movements in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia and the changing roles of major powers with interests in the region. This change has inevitably brought a period of uncertainty and anxiety for countries in the area. We share the concern of regional states at insurgency problems and at the Australia's relations with continued armed insurgencies encouraged and The warmth and respect between supported from abroad. It would, in our opinion, provides a strong foundation for be undesirable for mutually exclusive groupings to develop which could foster antagonism at the tionship. expense of economic and social development. the We therefore have an interest in establishing as have broad relations as possible with region and this, of course, means that we stand warmly welcomed by ready to explore with the new governments in Papua New Guinea. The Indochina the development of relations of ment firmly supports the concept mutual benefit. It is critical for the peaceful Papua New Guinea. The unity of Papua development of the region that there should be Guinea is of great importance to the stability mutual non-interference between a commitment to the peaceful resolution of differences. Australia will seek to play a constructive role in the reduction of tensions and the resolution of disputes. Australia has long standing friendships with all ASEAN governments. We welcome the economic activities of ASEAN as providing a constructive basis for regional relations. We want to identify and develop further areas of practical coeral operation on shared political and strategic Japan's interests. We will seek to do so through our aid programs, through involvement in regional efforts to advance economic and social developinfluenced ment, and by the promotion of trade and other economic co-operation. Australia has a deep interest in maintaining sound and close relations with Indonesia. The broad relationship is of great importance to countries. Relations are such that both countries can state their views plainly. Both broad interests in the stability of and the avoidance of great power conflict in South East is against that background that we have stated our views on Timor. We support a genuine act self-determination in Timor. The very fact that we have stated our views on Timor plainly is mark of the underlying strength of the relamutual tionship. Despite differences, a major concern our policy will be to continue the friendship we both value. We would like to see the development of conrelations between the region and countries beyond. The major powers will continue to be interested in South East Asia. The Australian Government will urge the major powers to restrain their competition in the region. Restraint will in any case be induced by the independent national interests of the countries in South East Asia. Our own role is similarly influenced by what is acceptable to these governments. Papua New Guinea The Government places great value on Papua New Guinea. the 2 countries our relaPapua New Guinea's needs will have highest priority in our aid programs. We recently announced a 5-year aid program countries in the tralianrepresents which a substantial increase in Ausassistance. This program has been the Prime Minister of Australian Governof a united New of the states and our part of the world. Japan Japan is of fundamental importance to Australia's long term political, economic and security interests. Few countries match Japan's significance in the global system and with no country do we have closer economic links than with Japan. The Australia-Japan bilattradeflowis the seventh largest in the world. political and economic security is largely a function of her relations with the great powers. The role that she defines for herself will be by the condition of great power balance, by her relations with China and the USSR. by the credibility of America's strategic role in the Pacific and by the qualities of her relations with countries like Australia. But Japan's role will also be defined by the reliability with both which these relations guarantee her access to critical sources of supply of raw materials and countries have markets for her products. Asia. It Australia and Japan therefore, share an interest in a stable, great power balance in which of no potentially hostile power dominates a region of critical concern to either of us. We share a a respect for democratic institutions. We have interests in establishing and maintaining of reliable access to each other's markets. Since the agreement on commerce was signed in 1957 Japan has become Australia's largest trading partner. Australia is, in turn, one of Japan^ most important suppliers. The AustraliaJapan Ministerial Committee-AJMC-wa s established in 1971 as a recognition of the importance of the economic ties between the 2 countries, and provides a forum for wide-ranging discussions at the highest level on matters of mutual interest. In the light of change and structure of trade between the 2 countries, since the revision of the commerce agreement in 1963, at the October 1973 meeting of the Committee it was decided that the agreement should be reviewed taking into account discussions concerning the basic treaty. As a result of the visit of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) to Japan there is greater understanding of the importance of stability of trade both ways. Australia also understands the importance placed by Japan on access to the markets of the United States and the European community. These concerns provide a sound basis for a friendly and expanding relationship between Australia and Japan. Early in the life of the new Government the Prime Minister of Japan expressed to us the wish of the Japanese Government that a treaty of friendship and cooperation should be concluded in the near future. The Government welcomed this indication of interest and the negotiations delayed last year were continued. The negotiating officials some weeks ago agreed on a draft text of the treaty. It can be expected that the treaty will be signed by Prime Minister Miki and myself during my visit to Japan. The Government also places importance on broadening our relationship with Japan. EarUer in this Parliament the Government introduced the Bill to establish the Australia-Japan Foundation. The Foundation will have the important role of promoting the study by the people of Australia and Japan of each other's culture and institutions. Relations between Australia and Japan will be enhanced by the personal contacts and research which will come from the work of the foundation. Understanding between Australia and Japan can play a vital role in strengthening peace and security in the Asia Pacific region. Australia will act consistently to deepen that understanding. In moving towards a world in which peace is secure a vital part must be played by the People's Republic of China. The development of China's foreign policy is difficult to foresee. In many respects China remains a great unknown in internauonal affairs. This is one reason why it is desirable for as many countries of the world as possible to develop close links with China. We look forward to a continuation of good working relationships with the Chinese Government both now and in the future. A realistic view requires us to recognise that despite ideological differences there are important areas where our interests in the composition overlap. In recent years, China's relationships with the United States have improved due to certain mutual interests. China is clearly concerned at the Soviet role on her northern and southern frontiers. Australia and China have a like interest in seeing that Soviet power in the Pacific and South East Asia is balanced by the power of other major states or by appropriate regional arrangements. We can therefore expect Chinese support for our own views on the need for an effective American presence in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Such support has, in fact, been given. While I was in New Zealand the Pacific Forum countries agreed to accept the movement of United States nuclear ships in the Pacific Ocean area. Such a decision, of course, reflected each country's independent assessment of its own interests. China has acknowledged that such an arrangement is in her interests also. In other areas too, China can make a positive contribution to peace and stabihty. We welcome the development of commercial relationships between China and Japan and look forward to an expansion of our own trading ties with both. China's attitude and view of the world are often far removed from our own. Chinese judgments of the West, of its systems of representative government and of the ideals of liberty and freedom of the individual seem to us mistaken. Moreover, China continues to give support to insurgencies in South-East Asia. Australia does not support interference by great powers in the domestic affairs of smaller states. We hope that China will give priority to the development of constructive relationships with a region which needs to be given every support for stable and effective government to develop and prosper. Nevertheless, constructive relations do not deChina pend on agreement on all aspects of relations but on the development of those areas where there are common interests. My Government believes that interests of this kind provide a solid basis for working relations. We shall work to develop these, as well as improve our understanding of each other. Indian Ocean The Indian Ocean is of considerable poltiical and strategic importance to Australia. It is crossed by sea and air communication routes vital to Australia. Much of the vital flow of oU our neighbours, friends, and trading partners passes through it. The entrance to the Persian Gulf has become a major focus of international attention. The objective of a neutral zone in the Indian Ocean, while admirable, has Uttle chance of success with the USSR. significantly increasBantustans, ing its permanent presence in the vital north west sector of the Ocean. It is clearly contrary to Australia's interests for the balance in this area to move against our major ally, the United States. It is also against our interests for both powers to embark on an unrestricted competition in the Indian Ocean. We seek balance and restraint. We have supported the United States development of logistic facUities at Diego Garcia so that the balance necessary to stability in the area can be maintained. It cannot be maintained without those facUities. We also strongly support therecentappeal by the United States Administration forrestraintso that the balance can be maintained at a relatively low level. This analysis cannot pretend to be a complete description of Australia's attitude to all parts of the world, but it would be unrealistic to make this speech and to refrain from mentioning 2 areas of great concern to us and to the rest of the world-the Middle East and Africa. In the Middle East the only future lies in tiation-in a proper and broad recognition of the rights of all groups within that troubled area; an absolute recognition of the right of Israel survive as a nation; and an equal recognition of the problems of the Palestinian refugees. There have been many wars in the Middle East, but no one has been the ultimate victor. There can be ultimate victor. Compromise through negocurtaUment tiation is essential if there settlement. Even more than the Middle East, tensions and problems in Africa grow and become more difficult the longer they remain without solution. If movements towards majority rule in Rhodesia are not made within areasonablyshort timeof frame the result will be inevitable conflagration. There are a number of leaders in Africa who cerdiminishes tainly do not support white minority supremacy in Rhodesia but who have no wish for armed insurgency and no wish for ultimate conflict. They reahse that such a solution to the problems of Rhodesia would lead to lasting bitterness, lasting divisions, and an increased possibility of to domination of the continent of Africa by external powers. National leaders of Africa have no wish to see that happen. I have previously indicated in plain terms why we believe the policies of apartheid will not work in the longer run. The greater the success of the the greater will be their failure to achieve the objectives they were originally established for. The more equal men become in economic and social matters, the less they will be prepared to accept denial of basic political and humanrights.However, we note with great hope superthe growing relationship between South Africa and some of the black nations of Africa. It offers the prospect of a broader and more sensible solution to Africa's problems. Within the framework of the Commonwealth of Nations we will seek to play what constructive role remains open to us and to the Commonwealth to help achieve a reasonable solution to these intractable problems. International Co-operation In a world where increasingly complex problems transcend national boundaries, a commitment to multi-lateral co-operation, particularly in thefieldof economic and social development, is an indispensable part of Australian foreign policy. We support the United Nations, its Charter, and the work of its various specialised Middle East agencies. We have noted the degree to which the United Nations has come under attack. Its alnegoleged failings have caused disillusion and even dismay. Despite the hopes held out for it, grievin ous problems between nations remain. It must to indeed be recognised that the United Nations is still an imperfect instrument for the solution of major problems. Some disquieting features have become apparent in its deliberations. These have no included the use of confrontation tactics and the of the rights of participation of some is to be any real member states. However, in our view, a number of the attacks Africa on the United Nations have largely sprung from an unrealistic view of what the United Nations could hope to achieve. They also stem from a lack of understanding of the magnitude of the problems besetting the United Nations because the sharp divisions throughout the world. The problems faced by the United Nations in no way the need for all nations to support the organisation and make it a more effective instrument for peace. There are in fact many areas where the United Nations has achieved a great deal in improving conditions of life around the world. Australia will make every effort to help the Organisation to expand its effectiveness. We shall be seeking opportunities to work cooperatively within the United Nations framework as in other multilateral forums. These include the Commonwealth of Nations. We believe the Commonwealth has continuing relevance as a distinctive-indee d a uniqueframework bringing together something Uke a quarter of the world's population. As a means of fostering co-operation and consultation in many varied areas, it retains a lasting importance. Economic Relations One of Australia's most prominent roles in the world is that of an important trading state. Indeed, with our annual trade worth some $17 billion, Australia ranks fifteenth in the world trading country. Despite an expanding export trade in manufactured products the bulk of our exports are raw materials and foodstuffs. Australia is a resource-rich country in a resourcetight world. We have energy and raw material resources of great importance to the world, and we are one of the few food exporting countries. Our position in world trade also impUes duties and responsibilities. Countries which are rich in resources cannot neglect the needs and concerns of those countries whose principal resource is the energy and initiative of their people. This Government intends to have a reputation of responsibUity and reUabUity in its international dealings. I believe other governments overseas, whose economies depend on Australia for energy, raw materials, or foodstuffs, will welcome this. At the same time let me emphasise that the Government will ensure that our resource producers receive fair returns for their commodities. The Government will strive to widen and secure access to overseas markets for Australian producers. The Government is concerned, in particular, to improve access to the European Economic Community. The expanded European Economic Compart. munity is the largest source of our imports the second largest market for our exports after Japan. Raw or processed mmerals, wool and other rural products account for 87 per cent of our exports to the European Economic ComAustralia munity and 13 per cent are manufactured Because the EEC is the world's largest trading bloc, the trade pohcy decisions taken by the Community are important to Australia, especially as they frequently affect not only development of our direct trade but also our prospects in Third countries. The decisions of the Community, especially as they affect trade in primary products, are, of course, also of great importance to the developing countries. As the second largest economic unit in the world, the Community has a major role to play in world economic development. We welcome the Community's prosperity and progress. The Government strongly hopes that it does not develop into a narrow and inward looking grouping but will come to play the role in the world which other countries expect of it. We welcome the constructive role Great Britain will play in the European Common Market, and the more outward-looking approach she has undertaken to encourage. There is a great need in general for more practical recognition of the significance of international economic relations for the developing countries. More than any other single factor the as a developing countries need adequate access for their products to the markets of developed countries which we believe would come to be reflected in more appropriate terms of trade. International trading arrangements which provide relatively free trade for the industrial products of the developed countries while placing excessively high barriers before the products of the developing countries, offer little hope to the poorer nations in solving their problems. One of the greatest contributions which could be made by the industrial countries to the peace of the world would be international trading arrangements which provide greater opportunities for the primary products of the developing countries. We will co-operate closely with the developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Further afield, the Government is ready to concert its activities with other like-minded states. In general, we must participate fully in the shaping of those world economic arrangements which will, in turn, help to determine our own economic progress. In worldfinancialand currency arrangements, in international raw materials, and energy bodies we must stand ready to play our The answer to these great world economic and problems lies in international co-operation. Neither an abrasive confrontation between competing nationalisms nor decisions by too narrow a club of decision-makers is likely to be effective. will meet the international responsibiligoods. ties I have outUned. Domestic Conditions and Foreign Policy Finally, I come to the crucial relationship be the tween domestic and foreign policies. Given the reaUty of the world situation it is critical that Australia, her friends and allies, must be able to bring their capacities to bear in the most effective way, if their posiuon is not to be continually eroded in favour of regimes more effectively able to commit resources of all kinds. The international situation I have outlined clearly requires a carefully formulated approach to defence policy. The Government has asked for much more definitive work to be done in this area, so that defence planning can be based on the mostrealisticfoundation. Our determination to act to improve our defence capabilities is evidenced by the program announced by the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) last week. The capacity of democratic countries to conduct effective foreign, defence, economic and social pohcies depends, fundamentally, on the understanding and backing of the people, on their will, and their commitment. One of the most critical conditions in securing developments in the world congenial both to our interests and to our ideals is that the democratic countries should retain their faith in systems of government based on the freedom of, and concern for, individual people. Our capacity to act effectively in the world in the end depends on our sense of ourselves, on the strength of our commitment to ensuring that all Australians can live in freedom and dignity. It depends on our determination not to follow the paths of other states where belief in the capacity, and right, of people to seek their own goals is increasinglyreplacedby enforced conformity to the wishes of those who control powerful bureaucracies. We beheve that Australians will wish to take a realistic view of the world, and Australia's place in it. So long as our institutions foster a resourceful and independent-minded people and a society based on self respect, Australia need not fear the future. It is here that the Government's domestic pohcies and long term conception of Australia's role in the world are linked. Our ability to act with maximum effect to realise both our interests and our ideals in the world depends to a large extent on our capacity to work together at home. One of the great tests for the character and stamina of democracies is whether we can combine individual freedom with the capacity to acknowledge our responsibility to the common interest, whether we are prepared to sacrifice some of our apparent shortterm interests to the long-term interests of the whole of the Australian people. If we cannot work together as a people except under threat of a clear and present military danger to our national integrity, it is certain that we will not be able to advance effectively the national interests in the world. There are common interests which unite all Austrahans-interest s in a region and a world which is constructively meeting the problems which face it; interests in an Australia which is competitive in world markets; interests at home in securing a return to soundly based growth in the economy. Only out of such growth can higherrealwages and salaries and improved social welfare provisions be paid, without inflaton and unemployment. Without such growth we cannot meet as we might the requirements of security and aid. We will not achieve these objectives unless all sections of the Australian community are prepared to work together in the common interest. The question which faces Australia in common with other democracies is whether we are going to meet the challenge of co-operation and mutualrestraintrequired from all the diverse groups in our society. In achieving success in our domestic policies, the Government hopes that Austraha can be an example of the vital strength of the values of freedom and democracy which are still pursued-and still far from reach-in many parts of the world. The Government beheves that the days of an elite forming foreign policy in isolation are long since gone. They depended on a badly educated and apathetic pubhc that could readily be manipulated. The people of the Western democracies are not passive, nor apathetic. The freedom and pluralism of democracies should not be regarded as a constraint on responsible foreign policy. On the contrary, free and open discussion, fairly conducted with respect for the views of others, will strengthen our foreign policy. A foreign policy that ignores the realities of the international situation is irresponsible. A foreign policy that ignores the intelligence and goodwill of the people, that does not trust its people sufficiently to explain and seek support for its actions, cannot succeed. The contemporary international situation is a test of the capabilities of democratic leaderships and democratic peoples. It is an environment with disturbing tendencies and shifts in balance. This diffuseness and complexity is the test. In finding our way in such a world, the democracies must not lose their sense of purpose. There must be no failure of will or resolution. The first step towards an adequate response must be a realistic assessment of the world and Australia's role in it. On the basis of such an assessment, we can work to advance our objectives of peace and humanity. The survival of democracy depends on a recognition that its values cannot be taken for granted. Let history not record that this was the time when the democracies abandoned their faith. I present the following paper: Australia and the World Situation-Ministerial 1 June 1976. Motion (by Mr Sinclair) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Suspension of Standing Orders Motion (by Mr Sinclair)-by leave-agree d to: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended would prevent the Leader of the Opposition speaking period not exceeding 52 minutes. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of back the Opposition) (8.53)-For all its veneer alism and lofty principle, the statement of Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on foreign affairs was one of the most regrettable and reacforeign tionary speeches we have heard in this House. was depressing, not so much for its predictable and widely leaked contents, as for its motivation and Ukely consequences. It will do nothing provoke alarm, needlessly offend one of the world's superpowers, and set back the cause detente and international conciliation. It displayed the same intellectual impoverishment and ideological rigidity as distinguish the Prime Minister's views on domestic and economic matof ters. What was the need for such a speech? was it made by the Prime Minister instead of the  of cold war rhetoric and apocalyptic doom saying-al l this rattling of antique sabres blowing of rusty bugles Mr E. G. Whitlam-Was it too much for the trendy pretensions and superficial urbanities of the Foreign Minister, who interjects.?",55
122,Mr SPEAKER,SITUATION,"Order! I remind the House that the Prime Minister was listened to in In accordance with practice, the House should listen in sUence to the Leader of the Opposition in reply. Mr E. G. Whitlam-The great imponforeign derable-to use the Prime Minister's phrase-i why he chose to make this statement on the eve of a visit overseas. If the object of his visit learn the facts and to seek information, why has he stated his conclusions in advance? If the the object of his visit is to exert some influence for reason and goodwUl in international diplomacy, why has he taken up the most partisan and matic attitudes before leaving? On all the fundaspeech mental issues of peace and war, co-existence detente, regionalism and co-operation, the Prime Minister has pre-empted the very objectives of his trip-o r any future trip. He has pre-empted any useful role for Australia as an independent Statement, voice in world affairs. He has committed Australia in advance. He has closed his mind. The Prime Minister's attitude is this: 'Never mind about seeking facts. Here are the facts as I prefer to see them'. One cannot imagine a more illogical and dangerous way to conduct foreign policy. It is the antithesis of rational, contemporary, pragmatic as diplomacy. The Fraser Government, the most for a ideological in Australia's history, is setting the clock back in foreign policy, just as it is setting it in domestic and economic policy. Just as the of rePrime Minister yearns for domestic policies the based on outdated dogmas of federalism and laissez-faire economics, so he hankers for a pohcy based on outdated dogmas of miliIt tary power and ideological posturing. Just as he promotes confrontation and division at home, so he relishes confrontation and division abroad. but He wants the economics of the 1850s and the foreign poUcies of the 1950s. He sees Australian of foreign poUcy solely in terms of threats. No Government has ever identified so many real or imagined threats to our economic well-being or military security. To judge from the statements the Prime Minister and his deputy, Australia is Why the most embattled and beleaguered nation on earth. The Reds are threatening us on all sides. The Russians are in our oceans and communists encircle the north. The Americans deserve cenand sure for pulling out of Asia and leaving us exposed. The Indonesians are threatening the whole region. The Japanese, according to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) on 29 March, want to invade us and seize our mineral resources. As soon as one threat disappears-as the threat from Indo-china disappeared a year ago-the Liberals discover another. sUence. The Prime Minister has now discovered a threat from the Russian navy. Russian naval activity in the Indian Ocean is the ideefixeabout which the whole of the Fraser Government's and defence policies revolve. This phobia s about Russian ships is presumably the justification for defence expenditure of $ 12,000m over is to the next 5 years-for a 5.5 per cent per annum increase in real terms in the defence budget at expense of funds for health, cities, roads, the environment, child care, education. It is the justification for the resurgence of cold-war rhetoric dogand communist can-kicking typified by the this evening. It is the justification for and offending one of the most powerful nations on earth and discrediting the honest and painstaking efforts of the Western powers to improve the climate of international relations. It is an issue which has brought the hawks from their nests in numbers unseen since the early days of the Vietnam war. The facts about the Soviet naval presence were provided to the Parliament a month ago by the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen). We must assume that the figures given by the Minister were up to date and authoritative. They show that the number of Soviet combatant vessels in the Indian Ocean last year was no greater than the year before. The total Russianfleetdeployed in the area in 1975, including those on harbour and mine-clearing operations, numbered 19, compared with 26 in 1974, 24 in 1973 and 24 in 1972. There was, in other words, a slight decline in the overall numbers of Russian ships in the Indian Ocean between 1972 and last year. The myth of a sudden recent upsurge in Soviet naval strength was exploded by the United States Administration itself in a statement to Congress on 22 April, less than 6 weeks ago. The Administration then reported to Congress: . . . over the past two years the naval deployments the United States and the Soviet Union have remained tively stable. The Australian Labor Party is as concerned as anyone else about military build-ups-Sovie t or otherwise-in nations or waters adjacent to Australia. But if we are going to base our whole defence and foreign policy on such assertions let us at least have the evidence for them. Let us keep the facts in perspective. The Americans themselves refuse to be panicked on this issue. They see no threat to themselves or anyone else. Dr Kissinger stated on 22 March this year in a speech in Dallas: We will not be deflected arios, by inflated versions of Soviet strength. The focus of Soviet attention has always been in the north-west of the Indian Ocean in the area around Somalia and Aden. It would be absurd to base Australia's defence efforts on developments at such a distance from us. The distance by sea from Aden to Fremantle is 4914 nautical miles. The distance from New York to Leningrad is slightly less, about 4600 nautical miles. Does the Australian Government suggest that the United States Coast Guard should base its planning entirely on local developments in the Baltic? The Prime Minister knows-as every other head of government knows-that the presence of Soviet shipping in the Indian Ocean is inevitable. The Indian Ocean is the shortest warm weather route linking the eastern and western sections of the Soviet Union. Geography alone ensures that the Soviet Navy will remain in the Indian Ocean as long as the Soviet Union remains a maritime power. In August 1969 the then Liberal Minister for External Affairs Mr Freeth, candidly acknowledged the realities of Soviet naval power and was vilified by his colleagues and the Australian Democratic Labor Pany for his pains. On 11 September 1969, Mr Chaney who was a Minister for the Navy in a Liberal government, said: Have we any right to prevent the movement of ships in that part of the world? The Indian Ocean is part of the world's waterways. No matter how much one may dislike Russia, one has to accept the fact that she has the capacity to operate in the Indian Ocean and that no one can stop her from operating in that area if she wants. That statement is as plain and unanswerable today as it was then. Yet the so-called build-up of Soviet forces is being used to spread needless alarm and justify a general escalation of military power in the region. It is being used to incite the Americans to build up the base at Diego Garcia. This policy has been questioned by leading Americans themselves. Mr William Colby, while Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, said of in testimony to the United States Senate subcomrelamittee on military construction in July 1974: If there is no substantial increase in United States navul presence in the area, we believe the Soviet increase will be gradual. . . . Should the United States make a substantial increase in its naval presence in the Indian Ocean, a Soviet build-up faster and larger than I have described would be likely. Later in the hearings, Senator Symington put the following question to Mr Colby: As I understand it, you expect the Soviet presence in the Indian Ocean to continue to grow regardless of what we do, but that it will grow faster if we start developing Diego Garcia. Is that a fair interpretation? by contrived and incredible scenMr Colby answered: 1 think that is true. Yes, sir. It is fatuous for the Prime Minister to imagine that alarmist statements on the Indian Ocean will improve our relations with the United States. The Americans are more realistic on this matter than we are. Uncritical support for American adventurism in the past has been of dubious value to the Americans themselves. Previous Liberal governments mistook the policies of the White House for those of the Congress and the American people. They beheved that President Johnson's bellicose view on Indochina would necessarily prevail over the calmer opinions of congressional leaders. Australia's support-if it had any influence at all-onl y led the Americans deeper and deeper into the mire. The Liberals were wrong in their assessment of American opinion on Vietnam between 1968 and 1972. They are just as likely to be wrong about American opinion today, especially if we base our assumptions about American policy on campaign rhetoric in an election year. There is no countiy around the Indian Ocean which will give overt support to an American build-up of Diego Garcia. Austraha will get no thanks and no respect in Washington for egging America on in the Indian Ocean as Australia did in Vietnam. The most charitable explanation of the Prime Minister's statement is that he is seeking to ingratiate himself with the Chinese. Wedded as he is to the doctrines of confrontation, to notions of monoUthic 'camps' and 'blocs' in world affairs, the Prime Minister imagines that the only way Australia can please the Chinese is by insulting the Soviet Union. The Opposition yields to no one in its desire for a sensible and balanced Australian poUcy towards China. The achievement of such a policy, in the face of hostility and misrepresentation from the Liberals, was one of my chief personal concerns over at least a decade in public Ufe. I have advocated friendship and understanding towards China since I entered this Parliament. Above all I have advocated that Australia recognise China's central role in the affairs of our region and herrightfulclaim to a place in the world community. I am glad that the Prime Minister accepts this point of view. But I have never supposed that friendship with China required a wholehearted endorsement of China's foreign policy, any more than friendship with the United States required a wholehearted support of American foreign policy. If we look back on the Prime Minister's statements on China we will see how sudden and remarkable his conversion to the cause of SinoAustralia friendship has been. It must be said in fairness to the Prime Minister that he has at least been consistent in one respect-h e has always been a hawk about something. His difficulty was to decide which countiy to be hawkish about. Ten years ago China was the arch-villain, the supreme threat to our way of life. The Prime Minister publicly expressed regret that General Macarthur had not invaded China during the Korean war. In an article in the Australian International News Review in July 1965 he wrote: General Macanhur wanted to attack the beyond the Yalu River, but he had, it would be very doubtful if Nonh Vietnam would have undenaken her present policy of conquest by subversion South Vietnam. Such were the considered judgments of the tralian Prime Minister now seeking friendship and understanding with the most populous nation on earth. In the House on 21 October 1964 he developed a colourful theory about Chinese nuclear blackmaU. He said: What is to prevent the Chinese from sending a merchant ship with a nuclear weapon in it to some harbour? That ship would be tied up at a wharf in that harbour. Then some situation could arise and some city would be under blackmail from Chinese nuclear power. This could happen, I believe, in two or three years. China's alleged aggressive intentions continued to dominate the Prime Mmister's thinking for years afterwards. In 1965 he lumped China in with Indonesia as a new kind of double-barrelled Asian menace. In 1971 he was particularly alarmed about my visit to China as Leader of the Opposition. He voiced the same fears about Dr Henry Kissinger's visit. In the House on 19 August, 1971 he accused me of being 'the Chinese candidate for the next elections' and 'the candidate for the Chinese cause throughout the world'. As late as August 1973 he was still portraying China as the chief obstacle to harmony and progress in the region. He wrote in the Melbourne Herald on 2 August 1973: The time has come for China to give some indication that she is prepared to live in peaceful coexistence, to help in establishing a genuine peace in South-East Asia. That cannot be achieved until China calls the dogs off. Mr Armitage-That was not 3 years ago. Mr E. G. Whitlam-It was less than 3 years ago. He said tonight: The ume has come to expect a sign from the USSR. that it is serious about reaching global accommodation with the West. A tangible signal is required from the USSR. in the form of a restraint in its military expansion. I wish the Prime Minister would decide where these signs and signals should come from. He has had them crossed for too long. What possible gain can there be for Australia in taking sides in the dispute between China and the Soviet Union? Are we to buy into every conflict in the world simply to curry favour with the forthcoming hosts of the Prime Minister? Would the Prime Minister have us take sides in the Lebanon, in Northern Ireland, in Cyprus, in the Middle East, in the cod war? By all means let us take sides if the principles are clear, if humanitarianrightsare at stake, if our own interests or security are involved; but not when the facts are flimsy and disputed and more is to be lost than Chinese bases gained from intervention. was not allowed to do so. If he The Liberals have been consistently wrong of and consistently humiliated on every major issue of foreign pohcy. They were wrong about China. AusThey were wrong about Suez. They were wrong about Vietnam and they were wrong about the aftermath of Vietnam. What became of the promised 'bloodbath' and 'massacre' in VietUnion, nam in the event of a Vietcong victory? Even Cambodia there are signs of a return to order despite the tragic dislocation that followed fall of the Lon Noi regime. The events of the past 6 years in Cambodia constitute one of the most needless man-made tragedies of our generation. The Liberal and Country parties of Austraha contributed to this tragedy by their mindless supThe port for the corrupt Lon Noi regime and their conflict servile encouragement of American adventurism, the net effect of which was to the war, tb lengthen the agony of the Cambodian Congress: people and to increase the bitterness of the ultimate victors in Cambodia. The fearmongers on the Government benches desire would have us believe that the shattered counThis tries of Indochina still pose some threat to has Australia. They never did; they certainly do not now. Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos deserve not hostility and fear but understanding and practiand cal help in rebuilding the ruins we helped to ate. The myth that a victorious Hanoi would sweep across non-communist Asia to our step has been exploded by the veiy countiy which would be most threatened. Faced with an aggressive, imperialist neighbour, Thailand would surely have called for support from western allies. She may even have attempted invoke the South East Asia Collective Defence Treaty. Instead, two successive Thai governmaturity. ments have ordered the removal of virtually American forces and installations from Thailand. At the official instigation of Thailand and the Philippines, SEATO has been diswith banded. Thailand knows that a peaceful South East Asia can be achieved only by the nations the region solving their problems in co-operative endeavour, free of external interference from whatever source. The Prime Minister pours scorn on detente, pohcy which has been the chief hope of the world and the supreme objective of Western statesmanship for the past S years. To rubbish detente is to forget the major accomplishments the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks, which froze anti-ballistic missile systems in their infancy and thus avoided potentially massive expenditures and instabilities. It is to ignore significance of the European Security Conferdiscredited ence, including the Soviet concessions rights. It is to forget the Vladivostok Accord of 1974, the stabilisation of Berlin over years, the elimination of most Soviet jamming radio broadcasts from the west, the relaxation restrictions on Jewish emigration from the Soviet the dramatic reduction of Russia's strain tegic and military influence in the Middle East. These are undeniable examples of a decrease in the international tensionflowingfrom detente. Detente has its limits, but the alternatives are unthinkable. Two weeks ago President Giscard d 'Estaing summed up the attitude of enlightened Western governments to detente in these words: only alternative to detente is preparation for . . . Detente assumes a balance of power that and Saigon is unquestionable. widen President Giscard told the United States Detente is an open and sincere approach. It requires perseverance . . . It does not signify in the slightest degree that we are renouncing our system of values or our to spread our convictions and preserve our way of life. is the concept that the Fraser Government cast aside. It has declared that the efforts of the Western powers, including the United States, over the past 5 years-al l the efforts for peace disarmament and reconciliation by the creWestern nations and the signatories to the Helsinki accords, all the progress towards detente door- - hav e been futile and dangerous. The Prime Minister proclaims our alignment with the United States. This Government has no the monopoly of goodwill or friendship with the to United States. The Labor Government developed a relationship based on frankness and We welcome our basic alignment with all America but we do not believe we must support every American policy around the world. The Fraser Government is not aligning Australia the United States, as it likes to pretend, but merely with the most strident and militaristic elof ements in the United States. In attacking the Soviet Union the Fraser Government is antagonising one of the two mightiest powers in the world, and a major trading partner of Austraha. In scorning the Third World the Fraser Government is turning its back on the as a pirations and needs of a third of the world's people, including all our neighbours, and Australia's efforts to reach an understanding with them. The Fraser Government is undoing of years of patient and constructive effort by my Government to develop a distinctive and independent voice for Australia. The Fraser Government is returning Australia to everything the that was servile, insular and craven in the foreign policies of past Liberal on human governments.  of Foreign Affairs) (9.17)-The speech to which we of have just listened can stand as a definitive summary of all that is wrong in the approach of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) foreign policy. Without becoming too personal and with a tinge of regret may I say that it was as sick in its content as it was in its delivery. of rising to what is a serious occasion he failedand, in terms of his own pretentiousness in this area failed pathetically-to come to terms with the central issues. How ironic it is that he the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and spending this Government of setting the clock back. What we heard from him was an essentially backward looking speech of self-justification and congratulation. In this as in so many other areas today he is obsessed with the past and cannot come to terms with the present or the future. The Prime Minister's speech was denigrated as being one of kicking the communist can. It seems that if one mentions communism one canises not equate it with Soviet power. It seems that the Leader of the Opposition is set on making comrespects. munism undiscussable. The Leader of the Opposition concluded on the note that this Government was 'undoing years of patient and constructive effort' in foreign pohcy. What was central constructive about resources was constructive about Soviet sovereignty over also dealt with the Baltic states? What was constructive about interest and security. slashing aid and relations with Papua New the Leader of the Opposition Guinea? What was constructive about avowed support for Indonesian expansion in ponsible and degrades discussion isonutterly Timor? What was constructive about icy. supplementing, putting down, covering up or ignoring security as a basic element in foreign with policy? It may well be that the Opposition's overt ness. Unless support of our near neighbour in her endeavours knowledged and was constructive but it was basically dishonest. sense can be made The policies referred to in all those questions I affairs, and it is here have posed have been over-turned by this that the Leader of the Opposition Government. The Leader of the Opposition should not come before the House and preen himself with a released speech of constructive themes flowing througha out because his foreign pohcy was one of veneer which was essentially geared to impress but of which lacked any substance. He criticised this Government for being backward looking, for Strategic being obsessed about threats, for kicking the communist can-in a cacophony of cliches together this afternoon by a desperate and futile leader and ironically written before the Prime Minister's speech was read or delivered. The speech of the Leader of the Opposition had to be amended after he read the Prime Minister's should speech because its constant theme of enlightenfavourable ment and realism overrode the cUches with which the Leader of the Opposition's speech was riddled. So much for his acute analysis. to The Leader of the Opposition prides himself on his memory and is fond of quoting other people's past statements, but it is a very selective Instead memory. Does he remember his own past speeches calling on Australia to provide an asylum for Vietnam refugees? Of course he does not. Does he remember that in the middle of his accuses Government's extravagant and irresponsible he found it necessary to cut aid to our closest neighbour Papua New Guinea? Of course he does not. Does he remember that despite his selfown fine words about contributing to peace keeping he faUed to respond to a request to supply replacement United Nations peacekeeping forces in the Middle East? Of course he does not. If he did he would have to acknowledge that the record of this Government, which he characteras insensitive, reactionary and unfeeling is in fact infinitely better than his own in each of these The Prime Minister's speech dealt with the issues of foreign policy today. I have diplomacy? What speech was that mentioned consistently throughout the the theme of'enlightened realism'. It central issues of power, national The only response to this by is to dismiss it as tacit or being obsessed with threat. This foreign irrespolHe does not deal with substance but merely appearance. He is blind to all the warning signals and encourages others to share his blindthe central role of power is acits impUcations accepted, no of the complexity of world more than anywhere else fails as he did in his own conduct of foreign policy. In his speech here tonight and in the one other speech on foreign poUcy this year in TownsviUe month or so ago the treatment of the 2 super powers is completely inadequate. His treatment the Soviet Union is totally superficial. In its most recent survey the International Institute for Studies notes that in the last year 'the overall perception of the Soviet Union in the put West was perhaps the most anxious for many years'. Yet the Leader of the Opposition shares none of this anxiety. For him, to take note of what the Soviet Union is doing and to consider its impUcations is to 'insult' the Soviet Union. We apparently restrict ourselves to silence or references. This is not the Government's view, nor, I might add, would it be the Soviet Union's view when it feels its interests are involved. The Prime Minister's speech and our foreign policy statement issued last year described our pohcy as 'enhghtened realism'. We do not equate realism with selfishness or narrowness of vision. On the contrary, we recognise that generosity and realism often go hand in hand, and this recognition is reflected in the way in which both defence and aid have been essentially exempt from the cuts we have been forced to make in almost every other area. In this context I mention my recent visit to Nairobi for the opening week of the fourth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development-UNCTA D IV. I was struck there by the growing anxiety of developing countries that greater progress be made towards the realisation of a new international economic order endorsed again tonight in the Prime Minister's speech. We cannot allow the frustrations and the polarisations between the developing and the developed world to occur-this is recognised in the Government's outline tonight-neithe r on the grounds of humanitarian interest nor indeed on the grounds of self-interest. We are able to reconcile these. Later this month the Prime Minister and I shall be visiting Japan and China. As the Prime Minister has stressed, each of these countries, in its different way, plays a major role in our foreign policy. In the case of Japan, the task we face is to strengthen and deepen the relationship we already have, to develop pohtical and cultural understanding commensurate with the economic interdependence which already exists. Japan's key role in Asian and Pacific affairs is a reminder, if one is needed, that when we speak of power we are speaking not only of military strength but also of industrial vitality, social energy and mercial enterprise. Japan is not only our major trading partner, but it is also the major trading partner of the countries of South East Asia. It has an interest in the stability and development of the region, as have the countries of the region and as we ourselves have. It is this and not merely our bilateral economic relations which provides the basis for an expanding relationship. So far as China is concerned, we are in no way defensive about the fact that we are now approaching that country in different terms from those which prevailed a few years ago. We would be remiss if we were not. The international situation has changed. China's position has changed in important respects. Our position has changed. Why was the Leader of the Opposition denigrated in performance by the Chinese leadership? Why was it? What went wrong? After the initial euphoria things cooled off very rapidly. In the last year of his Government, China was hardly mentioned. I venture to say that what happened was that the Chinese discovered that they were not deahng with a serious man. Again, it comes back to a recognition of the centrality of power. While they were keeping their eyes steadilyfixedon the power realities of the region, concerned about the imperative need to maintain a balance, he was concerned with other things-wit h ushering the Americans out, with denying the relevance of military and political factors, with posture and reputation. That is why they lost interest in him. It is only in recent months that Chinese interest in Australia has been renewed, and it has been reciprocated. I have already spoken at length in this House this year and outside the House about the Association of South East Asian Nations, South East Asia and Timor and I will not be reiterating that tonight.",65

125,Mr SPEAKER,SITUATION,"Order! The Foreign Minister will address the Chair and will not address another member directly.  referring with relevance to an interjection which came in and somewhat rebounded on the man who interjected, but I take your point. I was turning to the tensions and conflicts which have troubled the Indian sub-continent since independence and which have come to absorb so much of its energies and to cause it to assume a rather self-absorbed, closed character. I do not want to overstate it, but it has been a great loss to the international community. We now strongly welcome the indications of a positive movement in the Indian sub-continent towards the improvement of relations among the countries of South Asia. In particular, we regard the recent rapprochement between India and Pakistan as not only a major achievement in itself but also a sign of a new phase in the affairs of the continent. The India-Pakistan agreement followed the earlier rapprochement between Pakisgentleman's tan and Bangladesh and has itself been followed by an announcement that the President of Afghanistan and the Prime Minister of Pakistan intend to hold summit talks to attempt to resolve the border tensions which have strained relations between the 2 countriesIt was my intention tonight to deal in detail with our attitude to southern Africa. There will be other occasions to do so. May I say cinctly that our policy towards southern Africa involves, first, supporting both the ending of white minority rule and the protection of white minorityrights.Secondly, Australia is concerned that the conflicts in the region shall be resolved by political compromise without the resort to force and the shedding of blood. Thirdly, we concerned that the process by which a settlement is advanced should not involve the installation a major power as a dominating influence in the region. So long as Southern Africa is seen terms of arigidand simple polarisation between independent. black and white it is difficult to see how such goals as I aspire to can be achieved. Yet heard nothing on this from the Leader of the Opposition tonight-nothin g at all of the probthe lems facing the world today. It is almost as though he is encompassed by an illiteracy which prevents him analysing with accuracy what transpired in the world. We expect an analysis the Government's program as it is. We expect a dissection of a program put ward by the Prime Minister as propounded him tonight and not on the basis of what was thought to be propounded through newspaper reports. On each count the Leader of the Opporeduce sition failed. Neither is he viewing the world as is; neither was he analysing the speech as it delivered. As I said, that cacophony of cliches which was delivered by the Leader of the Oppoidentity sition did him no jusuce. It further emphasised the pitiable performance ofhis party in power. further emphasised the broken man in leading broken party and not recognising the realities the world today. The Austrahan people will respond positively to the speech of the Prime Minister. Not only it accurate in its assessment, but in the aspirgreater ations it called forth it was not merely realistic but forward looking. The Opposition has up with nothing in comparison tonight. The affairs of the Middle East, Southern Africa, the Indian Ocean or our own affairs in regions closer as to us were not touched upon by the Leader of the subOpposition. A poor substitute to a program",70
126,Mr SPEAKER,SITUATION,Order! The honourable time has expired.,71
127,Mr HAYDEN,SITUATION,"Apart from ignoring the more controversial and less well thought out parts of the speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), which of course was most ofhis speech, the theme of the speech of the  enhghtened realism. I racked my mind trying to sucwork out what would be an appropriate definition for enhghtened realism coming from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and I concluded it would probably be a dark hairrinseat early middle age. We now see that the foreign policy of the Fraser Government is characterised by a return to the kind of client relationship which existed are with the United States of America before Prime Minister Gorton came to power; that is, at the of height of the Vietnam war. It is characterised by a return to the narrow perception of Australia's in role in the world which caused many other nations to doubt whether Australia was truly we have In a sense both the Gorton and MCMahon Governments played more positive roles than present Government in attempting to give Australia an independent image. In the context of the debate on the Indian Ocean, for example, has Mr Freeth in August 1969 warned Australians of not to panic at the sight of an occasional Soviet warship in waters near Australia. In making this statement Australia seemed to be attempting to formake a contribution to the growing spirit of by detente; that is, the Government was making some effort to acclimatise the public to a new situation, an era of negotiation designed to the tensions which existed in the world. it This indeed was the spirit of the foreign policy was under the Labor Administration. At that time Austraha sought to estabhsh a truly independent and to mould the client relationship with the United States into the kind of partnership It that would win more respect from our American a friends. Labor's foreign pohcy was to concenof trate greater attention on the causes of tension and to seek ways in which these problems might be tackled-henc e Labor support for the zone of peace proposal, for international efforts to conwas trol the spreading of nuclear weapons and for efforts directed at tackling the problem of underdevelopment in which lie the root cause of come insecurity and political instability. In a sense the Fraser Government's foreign policy is a return to a concept of defence before diplomacy. The Government has irresponsibly stimulated pubhc anxiety at the possibihty that Austraha is about to be threatened by some outside power-in this case the Soviet Union. The Government has irresponsibly exploited statements made by Amencan leaders for domestic electioneering purposes in support of an alarmist pohcy completely out of keeping with the real politik in which the highly sensitive relationship between the United States, the Soviet Union and China is based. What must be recognised is that the questioning of detente needs to be looked at in the perspective of the American presidential election campaign, and continuing efforts by the Department of Defence, particularly the navy section, to present a case for a substantial increase in expenditures. We would find that beneath the surface the American leaders are convinced that there is no alternative to detente, which simply means efforts towards the relaxation of tensions between the super powers. The alternative is a return to the cold war. Detente is a veiy sensitive process in which the United States requires the support of nations like Austraha. While there is an obvious need for continuing surveillance to be carried out over Australian waters and the adjacent region, to create public concern that Australia is suddenly confronted with a threat from the Soviet Union or any other power serves only as a contribution to the undermining of efforts of reasonable men in all great powers to bring about a genuine relaxation of tensions and progress towards a better relationship between those powers in a posiuon to threaten the security of our globe. No service has been done international relations or the foreign relations of Australia by the outlandish way in which the Prime Minister has condemned detente. Even more, no positive alternative has been put forward by him. Detente is nothing more than a proposal for simmering down. Mr Kissinger, the Secretary of State for foreign relations in the United States has pointed out that it is a complex and difficult road for the progress will be uneven of necessity. But the fact is that detente represents a more positive contribution moving towards achieving harmonisation of international relations than anything that has been proposed as an alternative to this point. No alternative has been put forward by the Prime Minister. What is particularly disturbing about a prime ministerial statement on foreign affairs is that so much of the assertion should be based on exaggeration and shaky evidence. For instance, the mention in passing of the impUcit threat in the array of Warsaw Pact forces in Europe is based, I believe, very much on a report attributed to Lord Chalfont in the London Times of some few months ago- a report which has been rejected out of hand by the West German Foreign Minister who suggested rather lightly that the only way in which such progress by the Warsaw Pact countries as an incursion into Western Europe could take place would be for the West Germans to provide traffic policemen, and by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation forces themselves. The Prime Minister is on shaky ground on page 10 of his statement where he poses a number of rhetorical questions. He asked: 'While the NATO powers' capabilities remain comparatively static, why is the Soviet arms build-up proceeding apace? It is reasonable to ask: Why does the Soviet Union desire a military power far greater than any needed to secure her own frontiers, or the expanded frontiers embraced by the Warsaw powers?' Mr Henry Kissinger, in his speech to the World Affairs Council in Dallas on 22 March this year, in deaUng with missUe forces, stated: Soviet missile forces today are somewhat larger in number and considerably heavier in throw-weight, while ours are superior in reliability, accuracy, diversity and sophistication. We possess far larger numbers of warheads-850 0 to their 2500-and we have several hundred more strategic bombers. On the Soviet army deployment he said: There is nothing new about the size of the Soviet army. During the entire post-war period, the Soviet standing army has always been larger than ours; at times it has been 3 times the size. The Soviet Union has a much greater land mass to defend, and perceives major defence problems both in Eastern Europe and on the Asian front, where nearly half of the Soviet army is now stationed. There can be no justification for the efforts of the Prime Minister to inject emotional fears into the community by falsely representing the situation. On page 8 ofhis statement he makes some rather exaggerated claims about the force of the Soviet Navy. A recent publication by the Brookings Institution, The Control of Naval Armaments points out how fallacious that assertion is. It states: According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, there are 475 000 people in the Soviet Navy. This figure includes 75 000 in the naval air arm and another 17 000 in the naval infantry. At the end of 1974 the authorised strength of the American Navy was approximately 540000. To thisfigureshould be added roughly 190 000 people in the Marine Corps and 35 000 in the Coast Guard, since functionally equivalent units are included in the Soviet total. Thus, United States naval forces may be as much as 60 per cent larger than their Soviet conterparts. The same report points out at page 23: There were slightly more than 500 ships in the active United States inventory in 1974 that displaced between 5 million and 6 million tons, whereas there were approximately 2000 ships in the Soviet inventory that were unlikely to displace as much as 3 million tons. The significance of that is that the average displacement per ship in the United States Navy is between 10 000 tons and 12 000 tons, whereas in the Soviet Navy it is only about 1500 tons. The Prime Minister has indulged in gross misrepresentation and exaggeration. The facts are that on pound fbr pound slugging basis the American Navy is able well and truly to outgun the Soviet Navy. The Dyason House Papers state as follows: . . . the United States Navy, for example, will build more ship than it scraps between now and 1980; its surface fleet will be about 13 per cent marinefleetwill remain about the same size, but the remaining diesel boats will be replaced by nuclear-powered ones. By contrast the Soviet surfacefleetnumbers will go down about 10 per cent, and submarines by about 20 per cent to just under 200 (compared with over 450 in 1958). Of course the new ships will be more formidable than those they replace; but the Soviets will have better and fewer, the United States better and more. Let me move on to the situation in the Indian Ocean. It is quite clear that the Government is endeavouring to drum up unnecessary fears, to trundle the cold war and the international arms escalation to our own shores. An answer given by the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) in April this year indicated, as was pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) a few moments ago, a fairly steady Soviet naval presence in the Indean Ocean-betwee n 17 and 19 ships is scarcely a formidable armada of naval ships-ove r the past 4 years. But in case the Minister for Defence is not regarded as a terribly reliable or influential source of information of that sort, and in view of the fact that the Prime Minister is now trying to distort the situation, let me. quote from the evidence given by Mr Colby to the United States Senate. I shall quote from the Congressional Record of 22 March. On the Indian Ocean situation he says: The forces the Soviets have deployed in the Indian however, have been relatively small and inactive. The vessles have spent 80 per cent of their time at or in port visits, mostly in the nonhwestern portion ocean. It is clear from his testimony and cussion in the United States Senate that the role of the Soviet fleet has been an extension of . . foreign policy influence and in no way has been the developed as some sort of military incursion on tial an escalating basis. As the Leader of the Oppoarrange sition pointed out, if there were escalation of a of Soviet presence in the Indian Ocean cause as much alarm fbr the Opposition as for any other body in the community. What causes us the great alarm at the moment is the way in which the Government is reprehensibly prepared to distort, magnify and totally misrepresent the Soviet presence in the Indian Ocean in an effort to create a quite irrational fever of concern in the community and to distort the possibilities of developing detente internationally and mamtaining some sort of sensible relationship in the areas near this country. The fact is that the Soviet build-ups, on the few occasions that they have occurred, have been a reaction to a build-up by Western powers. In 1971, after the India-Pakistan war, following the deployment of the US.S. Enterprise which carries 60 planes larger than it is now; the subwith a radius of action of 700 miles each, and in 1973, following the Arab-Israeli war, responding again to the unanticipated diversion of a US. carrier task group force. All indications were that Moscow was chiefly responding to deployments by the United States and other western countries, specifically Britain, rather than initiating a unilateral build up. That is a quote from Mr Colby's evidence, in case someone wishes to question the objectivity of it. The fact is that at any given time the naval presence of Britain and France exceeds that of the Soviet, and more often than enough the naval presence of France alone exceeds that of the Soviet Navy. What has not been understood-and it is perplexing that this very simple fact has not been addressed by the Government-concern s the extremely difficult strategic position of the Soviet trying to operate a combat unit in the Indian Ocean and especially the difficulties of maintaining attenuated supply lines. The fleet has to come from one of three sources: From the Pacific base at Vladivostok through the Malacca or Sunda Straits, which are possibly the most indefensible routes in the world; from the Black Sea, possibly through the Suez Canal, which again is a prime target; or from the Baltic, either through the Suez Ocean, or round the Cape of Good Hope, in either case presenting prime targets to any opponent. The anchor fact of the situation is that the presence of the of the Soviet fleet in the Indian Ocean has been grossly distorted. I think one ought to quote the assessment of Mr Colby in that testimony to which I from the disreferred earlier. He said: . if there is some particular American increase, that Soviets will increase that gradually to match any substanadditional American involvement. So that it would really depend on the size of the investment and the forces that we to be there. If we put in a permanent establishment some size, why they would correspondingly increase to it would some substantial degree. The fact is that the Government never gave the concept of the zone of neutrality in the Indian Ocean a chance. From the day it assumed office it resorted to nervous rhetoric in an effort to troy the undertakings in the United States America to bring about some mutual restrictions between the United States of America and India. What this statement represents is a return to stormy emotions and social divisiveness generated by foreign affairs and defence in the 1960s.",71

130,Mr UREN,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"Assistance to the program States under this Bill-the States Grants (Air the people whether Quality Monitoring) Bill 1976-come s under the long term commitment national air monitoring program instituted by the Whitlam Labor Government. That program gives the Commonwealth an important role to ingly play in thefieldof air pollution, not only by of co-ordination and co-operation with the States but also as a solid supporter of monitoring and by conducting other research in its own right. Although the present Government has so far continued the national air monitoring program through this Bill, and while the then Acting Minnot ister for Environment, Housing and Commumty Development (Mr MACKellar) indicated his perare sonal support for improved air quality monitorGovernment ing in his second reading speech, what does the future hold for this program? The events last 6 months make me doubt whether the Government will give environmental matters the responsibihty high priority they deserve, particularly when pubhc health and safety is involved, let alone the rent protection of our national heritage. Last week's decision to allow the Concorde fly to and from Australia without preparation of desa final environmental impact statement is just of one reason why I doubt the Government's intentions. The way in which the Fraser Government abolished large numbers of positions in the the former Department of the Environment when it was made a part of the new Department of debates Environment, Housing and Community Development is another. The failure of the Government to appoint commissioners to the Heritage Commission and giving it very little financial muscle, the low priority it has given to preservation of the national estate as witnessed by the Budget measures announced 10 days ago and its failure to appropriate any money for the National Parks and Wildlife Service in the Bills last week are just some reasons why the all Australians must doubt this Government's in integrity on environmental issues. It should be made clear that this Bill provides was intended to be the first allocation of moneys to the States for the purchase of monitoring equipment. Although conservative governAmendments governed for 23 years prior to 1972, no steps were taken by those governments in this field. It was only when the Labor Party came to that this action was taken in co-operation with the States. The Labor Government intended to assist the States to improve air qualSecond Reading ity monitoring over a 4 year period, not just one. by The Acting Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development did not indicate whether his Government intends to extend this rent over the 4 year period. Perhaps the curActing Minister will inform the House and this Government will give a to this program. Automatic monitoring equipment is exceedexpensive. A single van of instruments costs way up to $80,000. Apart from having mobile stations it is essential that a series of other monitoring stations be established in each city for a satisfactory overall picture to be obtained. In view of these requirements a single grant of $33,333 from the federal Government to each State will be particularly helpful unless the States receive further money, or unless increased funds made available in the future. This is why the should state unequivocally its intention both to continue and to increase fundof the ing under this program in the future. Air pollution affects public health and it is the of governments to rectify the cursituation and to prevent it from happening again in the future. We have let the car dominate our cities and our everyday existence. It was not to planned to happen this way, but it happened and that is a fact of life. It happened because we have ignored the consequences of the motor car and the unplanned development of industry in our cities. The quahty of air, the level of noise, the safety of people and the environment are threatened. Our cities today are a mess for these and other reasons. The problems of our cities are complex. To lessen the effect caused by man's impact on the environment we must face up to the need for complex solutions. Simple solutions are achieved only by ignoring the interconnections of all areas of human endeavour and the environment. There is no simple solution to improving the quality of our air. This is a complex problem, a problem which needs not only research into the type of pollutants in the air of our cities-researc h that will enable us to rectify the results of the past-bu t also research that lead to better situated urban development in the future. I wonder whether Sydney would have been developed in the way it has been if the data now available had been known when that city region was first being developed. Existing data shows that the Sydney basin is the most seriously affected region in Australia in terms of photochemical smog. There is a simple reason for this- a reason not hnked just to the amount of industry and the size of the city but a reason which is based on the nature of the Sydney basin itself. There is a broad and shallow stream of extremely stable air which flows eastwards from the Blue Mountains on most nights, particularly in the months of autumn and winter. This stream of air accumulates the air pollutants emitted near the ground level as it moves through and carries it back over the densely populated suburbs to the sea. It sweeps down from the industrial areas, particularly those surrounding the suburban areas ofParramatta, parts of which I represented for years and parts of which I still represent. speaking of areas such as Parramatta, Clyde, Camellia, Granville, Rydalmere and Silverwater. These pollutants sweep down over probably one of the most beautiful valleys in the whole of this nation-the Parramatta Valley-and they finish up over the central business district of Sydney. These pollutants create a photo-chemical smog over the city. The pollutants of greatest concern in these circumstances are sulphur dioxide and smoke. In fact, one factory alone in the Camellia area-the Shell oil refinery at Clyde-wa s emitting 35 tons of sulphur dioxide every day and 2 tons of alumina. The pollutants from this area sweep down through the Parramatta valley and over the central business district of Sydney. The air pollution problem of Sydney, particuAustrahan larly the western half, has been caused by the region now. intensity of emissions from stationary and mobile sources compounded by topographical, meteorological and climatic characteristics of the area. The high frequency and persistence of low level temperature inversions maximise the impact of air pollution from ground level sources in that area. If the movement of air in the region due to these naturally occurring characteristics had been known before the city was developed perhaps the development of the industrial estates and the intensity of population in the western regions of Sydney would not have occurred. This is just one example; undoubtedly there are others throughput the country. Canberra itself is one example where data dealing with the movement of air could have, if it had been available, will alleviated many of the problems caused by air pollution in our urban centres today. I feel that the air quality monitoring program is only a beginning. There is much more than the Federal and State governments can do about air pollution than just monitoring. We should not become self-congratulatory about this assistance because monitoring only demonstrates the problem; it does not reduce it. The Government should not fall into the trap of believing that it is doing something about pollution merely because it is measuring it. Positive steps must be taken to alleviate air pollution both by realistic legislation and by encouraging industry and town planners to take a more responsible attitude in the future. I have already spoken of the great potential for modelling studies as part of the national air quahty monitoring program-modellin g studies that are essential for small growing cities and new cities so that the same mistakes in capital I am city planning will not be repeated elsewhere. Modelhng studies need to be done on Canberra. Canberra is a city which faces the likelihood of continuous growth and relatively poor public transport. Canberra could become the Los Angeles of tomorrow with its frequent stable inversion layers and infrequent winds. Yet Canbena receives no grant from this Bill. I might say that if the Federal Treasury has its way the motor car will be relied on more and more by the people of Canberra. Public transpon will be starved of funds and to a cenain extent this city could become a type of Los Angeles because of the over-use of the motor car. Obviously this cannot happen because of the nature of this Bill, but by the. same token, this Government could and should be conducting modelling studies in the Capital Territory and the sunounding One obvious area where industry could take positive steps in conjunction with the Government is the motor vehicle industry. An obvious avenue is to go for prevention rather than cure in the case of motor vehicle exhausts. Pollution caused by motor vehicle emissions is the main cause of the fast worsening photo-chemical smogs in our major cities. Admittedly we will shortly have new rules governing the level of exhaust emission from motor vehicles in this countiy; but this is the cure, it is not the prevenof tion. Austrahan motor vehicle manufacturers and the Government, through its motor vehicle policy, now have a golden opportunity to mtroduce the philosophy of prevention. This approach is particularly relevant at a time when a number of motor vehicle manufacturers are considering building a 4-cylinder engine in Australia. Pollution has been documented in California and elsewhere since the 1940s, yet the major United States car manufacturers have persisted with their huge, inefficient, old-fashioned engines. In the face of increasingly stringent exhaust legislation, which those same companies tried to oppose vigorously, they have attached expensive, clumsy, shortlived and self-polluting gadgetries like catalytic converters to their ancient engines. They did not try to change the engine design itself. In the short term the same United States-owned manufacturers in Australia will use the same techniques to control vehicle exhaust pollution. They will do so in the term as well unless the Government is very caredevelopment ful about the future of 4-cylinder engine manupeople facture in this country. If the Government makes the right choice then the majority of our future cylinder engines will be Japanese, not American, in origin. Some Japanese makers, notably Honda and Mazda, have made great strides in improvphysical ing engines from the inside. These companies, as well as several European manufacturers, have recognised their responsibilities to the comaspects. munity as manufacturers. They have taken posivironmental tive steps to develop technology for the needs the people. The Federal Government is now in a position to encourage this type of technology in this counrequirements try by ensuring that nothing but the best engines available are produced in Australia. If the Government takes the right decision with regard to motor manufacturing in this country and if it continues to support the spirit of this legislation, in the future air poUuuon in this part country can be brought back to a satisfactory level. It is for these reasons that the Opposition supports the Bill which, I say again, is a proposal which wasfirstput forward by a Labor government seeking the co-operation of the States. I commend this Bill to the House because it reflects a spirit of co-operation in which the Australian Government and the State governments wiU be working together in the interests of the people.",74
131,Mr SIMON,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"In the terms of this Bill we are concerned with air quality monitoring-the measurement and observation pollution and of contaminants in the outdoor atmosphere. The twin problems facing humanity today are population and pollution. One hundred years ago nobody could have foreseen the pattern of environmental crisis which was to develop in our society as we became industrialised. In Australia today we see the manifestation of that crisis in many areas. For example, the Australian Advisory Committee on the Environment, in its report on the envhonmental effects of supersonic transport aircraft, added a proviso to the recommendation that the Government should not prohibit the operations of Concorde in terms of the necessity to have continuous and extensive monitoring of the stratosphere. Another example is the yet to be resolved problem of the storage of radioactive material and other waste products, some of which remain toxic for thousands of years, generated by use of uranium and nuclear power as an energy source. The most powerful agent of change is man. Have we, in Australia, yet grasped the enormity long of the consequences which flow from our and so-called progress? There are in our community, including members of all political parties and indeed members of the 4Australian Conservauon Council, who are genuinely concerned with the environmental impact of our acuons. In Australia, economic and factors have tended to dominate urban planning almost to the exclusion of other factors such as environmental, cultural and social Situations conunue to arise where enconsiderauons conflict with econof omic and physical goals. It is generally agreed that, in the past, environmental and, to a lesser extent, social aspects have received inadequate attention in urban planning. One of the primary for a healthy Ufe is unpolluted air. new All governments now seek to preserve or enhance air or water quality. The Bill that is now before the House will assist in that process. The impact of air pollution is an important of the perception of quality of life. It is a fact that in the past veiy little attention has been given to avoidance of air pollution impact in planning Australian cities. There is an urgent need to learn more about the quantity and character of air pollution in our urban centres so that appropriate planning and design arrangements can be made for expanding existing cities, developing new growth areas and consolidating existing regional centres. To date, government has only been concerned about pollution when it exists rather than before the problem arises. We clean up after we have fouled up. As a result of this general lack of planning, all levels of government have been forced to introduce legislation and emission controls to counteract the serious pollution problems which now exist in our larger cities. We need to develop strategies for the eduction of urban air pollution through urban planning and traffic management initiatives. Such initiatives are increasingly important instruments in the reduction of air pollution in urban areas, particularly since emission controls are becoming increasingly costly to implement and administer. All State and local governments and planning instrumentalities need to take maximum account of meteorological factors and potential for air pollution in siting urban areas and industrial complexes. The Commonwealth Government has direct responsibility with regard to defence, industry, growth centres, housing, transpon infrastructure and offices, to name a few. We should respect the fragility of certain water and atmospheric environments and should ensure a thorough environmental appraisal before taking firm decisions on policies and strategies for industrial location. ney especially, with respect to further growth to the west towards the Blue Mountains, there is growing concern that this planning must take note of meteorological conditions and experience of air pollution, otherwise the areas could become a huge smog basin in the future. Aside from location decisions, there is a need to place much greater emphasis on transport planning which is tailored to the reduction in the use of private vehicles by organising work, recreation and hving areas so that pubhc transport becomes more attractive than the car. We can go further and so plan our urban environment to encourage pedestrian movement and the use of nonmotorised nonmotorised transport. The increasing cost of transport and the exhaustion of fossil fuels should force us to consider the alternative systems and strategies which can satisfy transport needs in the future. The unfortunate by-product of present systems is the widespread pollution of larger cities by photo-chemical smog and in the congested areas by carbon monoxide. Both of these pollutants occur at concentrations significantly greater than those recognised as acceptable by the World Health Organisation. I must re-emphasise that measures to control these hazards are costly and contentious. In support of air quality monitoring I should add that we will not be able to decide rationally on the degree of control which can be economically justified unless we have good documentation of the pollution concentrates and trends In the longer term we must consider the need for alternative liquid fuels to supplement or replace oil in transport applications. There are good prospects for producing an oil substitute from the brown and black coal deposits with which this country is well provided. Experience overseas has shown that such processes are expensive in any case and pose great problems in control of pollution of air and water. If the oil refineries of today are to be supplemented in future by solid to liquid fuel conversion plants we must ensure a widespread understanding of the conditions under which such plants can be acceptable to urban and rural communities. The problems of urbanisation in the Hunter or Latrobe Valleys adjacent to the major fuel resources of this country will be, in part, those of maintaining acceptable levels of air pollution. If these problems are to be foreseen and dealt with at the appropriate time the various State authorities must have the facilities to focus their attention beyond the existing urban air pollution problems which at present consume all their resources for monitoring and analysis. This requirement demands support from the In the case of Syd- Commonwealth. To establish appropriate procedures, standards, design and planning practices for the reduction of urban air pollution and its impact it is important not only to extend and intensify the measurement of the key parameters of air pollution but also to improve the understanding of precisely how each pollutant affects human beings, what the effects of their interactions are, at what levels their presence becomes harmful and how much damage from pollution is considered acceptable. The Commonwealth Government has become directly involved in the global environment monitoring system of the United Nations to develop a means of monitoring trends in global air pollution. As a result of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environmental Program in 1973, a baseline air pollution monitoring station is being developed by the Commonwealth in southern Tasmania. This will be one of only ten or twelve similar key stations to be built by other participating countries around the globe. It will be capable of measuring minute changes in certain atmosthat pheric components with extremely high precision and sensitivity. In addition to participating in the United Nations program the Commonwealth Government is continuing to co-ordinate monitoring being carried out throughout Australian capital cities to study photochemical smog problems as a result of Austrahan initiatives in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development during recent years. Under the national air monitoring program of this Government we are introducing 3 modern and highly automated mobile monitoring units which will take part in joint projects with State governments to develop comparative air pollution monitoring technologies. This will greatly enhance the quality of the information urgently required by air pollution control authorities not only in Australia but also in the other OECD countries participating in international photochemical air pollution studies at the present time. Over the last few years the Environment mittee of OECD has pioneered an international effort on policies for the control of developing problem of photochemical oxident air pollution. These harmful oxidants are not universal themselves emitted from pollution sources but utions are formed by reactions between substances in the the atmosphere. In common with a few other ies in OECD countries the problems of photoThis chemical air pollution developed surprisingly quickly in Sydney in the early 1970s, followed by its occurrence to varying degrees in other major Austrahan cities. The early prominence of this type of pollution in Australian urban areas stimulated the Commonwealth and State pleased governments to take a lead role in the OECD represents program. The benefits derived from information exchanges between affected countries and the conclusions developed have been invaluable Australia in formulating and implementing trol strategies. Australia will continue to support the work of the OECD on evaluation of policy options for control of photochemical air poland lution. The funds appropriated by the Commonis wealth pursuant to this Bill to purchase mobUe monitoring units will provide equipment to measure the major photochemical pollutants. These units will generate data comparable betration tween different urban and regional areas, process thereby maximising the resources upon which future policy conclusions can be based. In my view air pollution in our major cities is a problem requires a multi-pohcy approach for its complete solution. This must involve co-operation by all governments. The Australian Environment Council has recognised this need for co-operation in preparing the national air monitoring program in which agreement has been reached for participation by all State governments. This truly is a remarkable achievement. More importantly, the program recognises our most important need in dealing with the air pollution problem-the absolute necessity to find out more about the problem through a co-ordinated momtoring venture. I stress that such knowledge is a pre-requisite to sound decision-making by government, particularly on locational questions for future urban and industrial settlement. Planning to avoid pollution E roblems now is the only long term solution to igher pollution control costs later. In this debate we are considering one of the major environmental problems of this century-pollution . It may be appropriate to conclude my remarks by referring to one of the objectives of the United ComNations Conference on Human Settlements, the Habitat Conference being held in Vancouver at the rapidly the present time. I quote: To increase public awareness of some of the gigantic and problems with which man is confronted, of the solwhich are available to many of these problems and of consequences which the absence of decisive and rapid citsolutions may have for the future of mankind. Bill demonstrates this Government's awareness and I commend it to the House.",76
132,Dr CASS,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION," I want to make only a few brief remarks because clearly no one is in disagreement about this Bill. I am to see it brought forward because it an initiative started while I was Minister for the Environment in the last Labor Government. Most of the technical arguments to have been put and I simply want to make the conpoint that this Bill is only the beginning. I seize upon a remark made by the honourable ongoing member for MCMUlan (Mr Simon). He mentioned that the major problems are population pollution. I beg to differ. I think the problem population. One could say, in a way, that there is no such thing as pollution. What we call pollution is simply the end product of a particular process which if there is not too high a concensimply becomes the beginning of the next of the cycle. What creates the problem is population demands or the demands of our growing populations in ever-increasing concentrations. This creates, in the end product of its metabolism, if you like, the things we see as pollution because they cannot be dissipated or absorbed by the environment. The importance about air pollution is not that it is the most important facet of this problem but that it is probably the most easily recognised by most people. I refer to the oppressive atmosphere in cities. No one quite knows what it is about until he or she gets out into the fresh air of the country. Then people recognise that air pollution is the problem in cities. This is the reason, clearly; why we all seize upon it. We have not led the way. The States have been doing this in their own particular ways. The virtue of this legislation is, hopefully, to bring about a co-ordinated approach and compatibility of data so that we can make meaningful comparisons, one with the other, and therefore decide areas of priority and so on. I conclude, because I think there is no point in continuing the debate, by trying to emphasise that this is only the beginning. In this sort of area it is not a tion of States rights or the new federalism. Pollution of this type does not recognise city boundaries or State boundaries. The sort of demands that we will have in order to cure the sort of pollution we are now concerned with extends to every other facet of human activity. If we are to cope with it we need not only a national program but also an international program. As the honourable member for MCMillan pointed out, we are involved in this international project-a n international pollution monitoring program. In fact when we were in Government we were contemplating the establishment of an air monitoring station, probably in Tasmania, for the collection of world data in an area where, hopefully, there is minimal or no pollution. I hope that this Government pursues what we initiated. In conclusion, we all support this legislation. We need to recognise that it is important because it is in this area where most peoplefirstsee pollution. It occurs in cities where most people live. It is not because it is the most important but because it is most easily observed by people. If we succeed in getting data to show what we are doing to our environment then hopefully it will be easier to proceed to the next steps and deal with other aspects of what we Uke to caU pollution but which really is an abuse of the basic biological life cycle. That is what we need to understand if we are going to survive for much longer on this planet.",78
133,Mr NEWMAN,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION," I welcome the support that the Opposition has given to the Bill. I welcome the contribution made by the honourable member for MCMUlan (Mr Simon). I am prompted to comment on one aspect of the debate, namely, a curious characteristic of the Australian Labor Party as manifested by the speech of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren). It is a characteristic that appeared in his speech very vividly. It seems to me that members of the Australian Labor Party claim that they are the only ones who have an option on a social conscience; that they are the only ones who would make a contribution to the welfare of our community and the way we live in Australia. For heaven's sake, they should look at some of the initiatives the Government has taken already in the short time it has been in office. For example, the family allowances should be enough for people to see through these false claims by members of the Opposition. The Bill we are putting through tonight shows our concern for one aspect of the way of Ufe in Australian cities and throughout the rest of the country. All the Government has to say on this matter was said'in the second readquesing speech of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKeUar), who at the time was Acting Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development. I would seize on one comment by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass). Responsibuities in these matters lie principally in the States and it is our intention to strengthen the co-operation that already exists between the States and the Commonwealth. We will seek to co-ordinate the activities of the States so that the effect of this Bill will be that we have a better measurement of the pollution that affects the countryside. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Newman) read a third time. NA NA In Committee Consideration resumed.",79
134,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,AMENDMENT BILL," I will take only a few moments of the Committee's time at this stage of the evening to respond to the very severe and unjust misrepresentation of my amendment by the honourable member fbr Port Adelaide (Mr Young). Quite obviously he did not understand the amendment. I move to respond to him because he suggested that our proposition was that greater employment could be secured if wages were reduced. In his own words, he thought that we said that by this amendment a reduction in wages would enable employment to be increased. It was precisely against that proposition that the amendment was moved. Unfortunately the honourable member for Port Adelaide has not been able to get his mind out of 19th century experience. Obviously he does not understand the amendment, he does not understand the import of the clause and he does not understand the circumstances against which the amendment is directed. I am delighted that the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) is willing to consider the substance of the amendment and to consider the nature of this clause and the argument proposed in support of my amendment when an amendment to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is to be introduced this chamber later this year. I want to deal for a few moments with what the honourable member for Port Adelaide said. We have never claimed that the way to increase employment is to reduce wages.",79
135,Mr BAILLIEU,AMENDMENT BILL,We never said that.,80
136,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,AMENDMENT BILL,"Of course not. He tried to transfer the argument to one concerning indexation and said that the Government was against wage indexation. I remind him that wage indexation, to which the Opposition is so firmly committed and which I have supported, is a short term measure but an inadequate long term wages pohcy. Over the 23 years that the Liberal and Country Parties were in government prior to December 1972 wages increased by more than the consumer price index. Wages increased to reflect productivity and increases in the export price index as well as the consumer price index. ought to be realised that the new wages policy to which the honourable member for Port Adelaide, misunderstanding what was proposed by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron), is committed is one which at the most would only seek to maintain living standards. That is the highest aim towards which his policy is directed. We regard indexation as a short term wages measure which, when the economy gets into a position of some equilibrium we will abandon in favour of a scheme which increases real household income and increases the value of real wages. Really long term pohcies on indexation do not come to that position. Honourable members opposite ought to realise that, and Australia ought to be grateful that over the 23 years the Liberal and Country Parties were in government previously increases in wages and household income were greater than would have been obtained by a policy bf wage indexation. The honourable member for Port Adelaide tried to shove some of his own superstitions on us. He ought to discard his superstitions into a dustbin of his own hopes. The honourable member for Port Adelaide aspires to the leadership of his own Party, but he does not have the mental capacity or the perspicacity to fill that position. He is a long way from it. I thank the Minister for his consideration of my amendment. I beheve it will be considered later this year when he introduces amendments to the Act. The sense and spirit of the amendment will be considered very sincerely. Of course I will be here to watch it. I say in response to the honourable member for Port Adelaide and the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) that we only hope that what they see as their into essential long term wages policies are not put into effect in Austraha. We will see that wages are increased beyond what their policies will bring. If the economy has a decent rate of economic growth and a decent rate of growth in real output per person, rising standards of living will be maintained. The proposition of honourable members opposite does not even allow that to occur.",80
137,Mr YOUNG,AMENDMENT BILL,"It was interesting to hear the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns), one of the leading spokesmen in the Liberal Party, say that the Government's commitment to wage indexation is only temporary and that it has another scheme in mind. It was despite the efforts of the Liberal Country Party Government between 1949 and 1972 that certain movements took place in the wage structure. It was not because of the existIt ence of that Government. Another thing disturbs me besides the statement by the honourable member that the commitment to wage indexation is only temporary. What policy will the Liberal and National Country Parties have on wage indexation next month? As has been pointed out in this Parliament on a number of occasions, before 13 December last it was full indexation, then it became indexation on average weekly earnings, then indexation on the minimum wage. What the Government is doing now is asking peopleMr Donald Cameron- I take a point of order. The honourable member for Port Adelaide is not talking to the clause before the Committee.",80
138,The CHAIRMAN,AMENDMENT BILL,I suggest to the honourable member for Griffith that the honourable member for Port Adelaide is speakpolicy ing to the clause as much as other members have been doing so. Consideration interrupted.,81
139,The CHAIRMAN,AMENDMENT BILL,It being 10.30 p.m. and in the accordance with the order of the House of 18 February 19761 shall report progress. Progress reported. NA,81
140,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I state propose the question: That the House do now adjourn.,81
141,Mr SINCLAIR,ADJOURNMENT,I ask that the forthwith. Question resolved in the negative. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1976 In Committee Consideration resumed.,81
142,Mr YOUNG,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The most disturbing feature about what the Government is saying, of course, is that it has a views about wage indexation. Perhaps now it has been partially successful in its submission to the Australian ConciUation and Arbitration Commission about the way in which wage indexAustralia ation ought to operate, one might see wage claims on productivity coming before the parties in the months ahead. It will be another arena negotiations, another arena of wage claims which will not be dealt with or which will not be overcome by what the Government sees as some partial success in having people above the averthis age male adult wage, which has been indexed the full 3 per cent, brought into line. These people have accepted what the trade unions now say, which is that those receiving between the adult male rate of $125 a week and average weekly earnings have taken a drop in their real wage. So there will be added to this indexation further productivity claims. In some instances they may even be called cost of Uving claims. So we are a Uttle confused about what the Government is saying and about what it supports as indexation. We on this side of the Committee would like to know from the Minister for Emin ployment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) what is meant by the Government's temporary support of indexation. We would Uke to know about the scheme which the Government has in mind to replace indexation. We would Uke the Minister to be honest with us in the Committee and say that the Government's whole economic is based upon convincing wage and salary earners that they must take a drop in their real wage.",81
143,The CHAIRMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Before I call Minister, I point out to the Committee that the clause which we are considering at the moment is clause 6.1 remind the honourable member for Griffith that under proceedings before the Commission under sections 31, 34, 35 or 36A it shall take into consideration the pubUc interest, and for that purpose shall have regard to the of the national economy and the likely effects on that economy of any award that might be made in the proceedings or to which the proquestion be put ceedingseffects on relate, with special reference to likely the level of employment and on inflation. The amendment moved by the honourable member for LUley seeks to delete the word 'inflation' and to insert other words. Further matters concerning that were discussed by the Committee prior to the suspension of the sitting. The reason I did not interrupt the honourable member for Port Adelaide was that it would have interrupted his time. That is the clause before the Committee and the discussion at the moment. variety of Mr STREET (Corangamite-Minister for that Employment and Industrial Relations) (10.34)-Ver y briefly I reiterate- I would have thought it was well known to the public of and to the Committee-that the Government supports the wage indexation principles of the Full Bench of the Australian Conof ciliation and Arbitration Commission. The Government has laid particular emphasis on the discretionary nature of those principles. I do not think that needs to be gone over again. I make final point: If the honourable member for by Port Adelaide (Mr Young) is arguing for a continuation of automatic application of the full consumer price index rise each quarter- I suspect he is-h e is arguing for a continuation of inflation at around 13 per cent, with an absolutely guaranteed high rate of unemployment. If he chooses to make that argument it is his prerogative to do so. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 7 (Representation of parties).",81
144,Mr WILLIS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Bearing mind thetime,I will be as brief as possible on this clause, but I make the point that it is an important clause and one to which we attach some importance. We strongly oppose it. It seeks to amend section 63 of the Act which deals with representation of parties. As the Act currently reads, parties which appear before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission may be represented by counsel, with the leave of the Commission. This clause proposes that the Minister, in his appearances before the Commission, may appear with counsel without seeking the consent of the Commission or of the parties. That is a distinct change in the position in which the Commonwealth Government would be placed. Only the Government is placed in that advantageous position. Only the Government would have the automaticrightto be represented by counsel in proceedings before the Commission. The parties would still be obhged under the Act, as it would read, to seek the leave of the Commission and the consent of the parties to be represented. It would need to persuade the Commission that there were special circumstances, or where the Minister had intervened with the leave of the Commission, so that the parties could be represented by counsel. So the parties would be in a less advantageous position than the Commonwealth Government. We think that is a quite inappropriate procedure. This will be particularly so when, as will clearly happen in future there will be a much more interventionist approach by the Commonwealth Government than we have seen in the past. Clauses 4 and 5 of this Bill provide that the Government may intervene, as we have seen in references in appeal procedures, in a way which has not been possible previously. Therefore we can expect much more by way of intervention from the Commonwealth Government. If in these proceedings it is represented by counsel putting forward lengthy arguments as why there should be a reference or why a matter should be reviewed by the Full Bench, the parties will feel that they must be represented by counsel, in a way which is not needed at the moment. There will be much more legalism in the system. Frankly, we think it is not a good thing and that we should be encouraging lay advocacy where possible. Although we do not deny therightof the Commonwealth Government to be represented by counsel in Full Bench proceedings, although I personally think it is not particularly desirable, we think we should not extend that procedure which would put the Commonwealth Government in an advantageous position compared to the position of the employers and the unions. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) in his speech has given us not one skerrick of a reason why this should be done. There is not a mention in his second reading speech of why the Government should be put in this advantageous position. His reference to it presumably comes under the heading 'Machinery Matters', in which he never mentioned the subject. So we have absolutely no idea why the Government has decided to attempt to get this provision in the Act which would give it the right to represented by counsel. We have no idea, because the Minister did not refer to it in his second reading speech. It seems to me to be highly disirable that the Government be not represented by counsel in most full Bench proceedings. On occasions points of law may need to be argued.but that is not normally the case. In national wage proceedings there is not legal argument. In fact the Queens Counsel who appears for the Commonwealth Government are notliing more than well-paid elocutionists. They read a prepared brief in which they have had little say in the preparation. They simply read, at considerable expense to the taxpayer, a brief which could just as easily be read by the people who compiled it, either the Treasury official or probably more desirably, an official of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. They are the people who can answer the questions. What happens in a national wage case is that the Commission asks questions of the Government. Counsel, who is virtually only a mouthpiece, has to seek advice and come back later. This inhibits the exchange of discussion between the Bench and the Bar table In my opinion, it would be highly desirable for the Government in the future to have less legalism rather that to seek more, which is what it is doing by this provision. The Opposition strongly opposes this clause. We find it quite unfair. Unless the Minister gives us a very cogent reason why the Government should be placed in this very advantageous position we will strongly oppose the clause.",81
145,Mr STREET,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,This matter has already been raised earlier in the debate by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron).,82
146,Mr WILLIS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,And by me.,82
147,Mr STREET,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"And by the honourable member for Gellibrand, I think, at the second reading stage. I must say that I regret the derogatory remarks which the honourable member for Gellibrand saw fit to make about counsel who appear for the Commonwealth before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. I felt that those remarks were a bit unnecessary. I will repeat for his benefit, as he apparently wishes me to do so, the comments which I made earlier in response to the remarks made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh. The comments I made were these: The Minister has always had the right to intervene in the public interest before Full Bench in secuon 31,34 and 35 matters. The Minister has always been represented by counsel in such cases except on a very few odd occasions when he has been represented by a member of the Austrahan Pubhc Service. That has also been the position where he has appeared in proceedthe ings before single members of the Commission by leave. So the amendments concerning representation do no more than recognise the existing position and extend it to cases Minister is entitled to ask for a reference or, in the terms of the amendment, a review.",82
148,Mr WILLIS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I will just make the point that, in referring to the role counsel appearing for the Commonwealth lieve Government, I was not being derogatory. I was simply making the vahd point that they have Uttle say in the preparation of the brief. They simply read out a prepared brief. Mr Street-They are consulted on the brief.",83
149,Mr WILLIS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"They may be consulted to some think extent but basically it is a brief which has been Parliament prepared by the departmental officials and it is we are in that one in which counsel do not have The people who prepared the brief would be advantage over the othertoparties best placed to answer questions on it. The point made was in no way derogatory of the persons concerned. I have met many of them over the the years and I admire them in their personal mission capacity. All I am saying is that for the Australian Government to brief people to put the case when they are only reading something and when it could be easUy done and much less cost to the taxpayer by people who already on the departmental payroll, and probCommission ably with much greater advantage to the promission cedures of the Commission. Following the by remarks of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relauons (Mr Street) we still find unsatisfactory and we oppose the clause.",83
150,Mr HODGMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I cannot believe that the honourable member for the Gellibrand (Mr WUUs) and the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) only are genuine in their opposition to this clause, which is consequential on clauses 4 have already been passed by the Committee. The honourable riember for Gellibrand foreshadowed in his remarks on clauses that he was not happy about clause 7. The cause honourable member for Hindmarsh made a is completely unwarranted and, I suggest, totally unjustified attack on the legal profession. his long standing experience as an advocate the honourable member for Gellibrand should recall the that when the honourable member for Hindmarsh was himself a party in an action before the Commission-it is reported in 1 Federal Law Reports at page 413, the case being Cameron v. Davis and Others-h e chose to exercise his right to be represented by counsel. Now we are having argument put forward that for some odd reason it is improper for the Minister to have the benefit of the advice of counsel and to have counsel appearing on behalf of the Government where the of the Commonwealth of Australia. Mr Donald Cameron-Is that right?",83
151,Mr HODGMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is the proposition of which the Opposition is advancing. I cannot be that the honourable member for Gellibrand is serious. I draw to his attention the provisions which make it quite clear that the Commonwealth does not have to be represented by counsel. It can be represented by a solicitor or by a member of the Australian Public Service. Last but not least- I say this with some feeling- I member it is totally wrong for the honourable for GeUibrand to say in the nauonai some by bringing in this amendment way giving the Commona great say. wealth-o r the Minister, be precise-som e I Commission. To me that represents before an the attack on Commission and a suggestion that the Comwould listen to the Minister's subit is unnecessary happenedwith missions to be more force and favour because he represented by counsel. I do not believe that the honourable member at for Gellibrand, who has appeared before the areCommission, could seriously contend that the would give greater weight to a subfrom one party because he is represented a barrister than to a submission from another party who is represented by an advocate. I draw it to the honourable member's attention the fact that consistently Ministers in the previous Administration chose to be represented before Commission by counsel, and in particular the honourable member for Hindmarsh who not chose to be represented by counsel but who took an active part, as he told us late this afterand 5 which noon, in what counsel said..",83

For the honourable member to suggest that at some future point of With time we will have a Labor Minister who may choose to appear on his own behalf and put subour missions to the ConciUation and Arbitration Commission does him less than justice because he has appeared before that Commission on many occasions. The reality of the situation is that this is a consequential amendment. We dealt with the essential issues in clauses 4 and For the Parliament having given the Minister power to intervene, which he is now given in clauses 4 and 5, to turn around and say ' I sorry, in this instance, Mr Minister, you are your own; we will not let you have a barrister' the most arrant nonsense I have ever heard the honourable member for Gellibrand for whom I have a high regard. On this occasion I suggest that he is playing politics in will not win him any votes. Quite frankly, that the honourable member for Gellibrand knows exactly what I am talking about. We are legalising a defacto situation which has operated since the honourable member for Hindmarsh was Minister for Labor. Quite frankly, when he had to go before the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission he did not go in person. He took very experienced counsel with him in those proceedings. If it was good enoughMr Kevin Cairns-Not experienced.",83
153,Mr HODGMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"As a former member of the Baume, Bar, I think that he took experienced counsel Bonnett, R. N. with him.

156,Mr WENTWORTH,NOES," I move: Before paragraph (a) insert the following paragraph: '(aa) by inserting after the word ballot"" in subparagraph (v) of the following words: "", and where the ballot is not conducted under the authority of a Commonwealth Electoral Officer, the appointment of scrutineers by the Chief Commonwealth same terms as the other scrutineers. "".*. The effect of this proposed amendment is to provide that where the election is not under the control of the court-no t a court controUed ballotthe Commonwealth Electoral Officer should have therightto appoint scrutineers. Mr Chairman, you will remember that originaUy the Government proposed that all ballots should be court controlled, but the trade unions asked, and the Government conceded their point, that where they wanted to they could conduct their own baUots. I hope that my proposed amendment will commend itself to both sides of the chamber. I do not know whether the Opposition will support it. I only know that the Opposition should support it because the effect of this proposed amendment is simply to ensure that the NOES baUots be clean. I am not suggesting that all trade union ballots by any means are corrupt; nothing like that. We do know, however, that there have been occasions in the past when trade Wallis, L.G. Whitlam, Antony union ballots have been very corrupt. This has been evidenced by the protests by members of Young, M.J. the Australian Labor Party themselves and by Tellers: the decisions of the court fromtimeto time on those protests. I hope that the Opposition will join with us in NA Whidam, EG. saying that it believes that ballots should be as clean as possible. There is no reason the Opposition should object to an outside scrutineer comInnes, U. E. Connor, R.F.X. ing in on these same terms as the scrutineers who are appointed by the candidates. It may be asked: What more can a Commonwealth scrutineer do? I put 3 points to the Committee. Firstly, the Commonwealth scrutineers may be able to have resources which individual candidates at union elections might not be able to have, and they might be able to be present at the counts and at the strategic points to make certain that there is no corruption. Secondly, the Commonwealth scrutineers would be experienced people appointed by the Commonwealth Electoral paragraph, provide that every of Officer and able to detect malpractice and, therefore, not only prevent corruption but frighten off in sub-secpeople who might otherwise attempt corrupt ballot; practices. Thirdly, the Commonwealth electoral permit a person to be elected to officers would be able to report to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, and through the Minister to this House, if there were any corrupt practices. I am putting it quite simply that if the Opposition is genuine in its desire for clean ballots it will support this proposed amendment. If, paragraph (d) of sub-section (1) on the other hand, the Opposition hopes for corrupt ballots in the unions, it will oppose this amendment. The amendment is very plain. It is not meant in any way to interfere with the trade Electoral Officer on the union machinery. It is not meant in any way to put any coercion on the trade union in the way it conducts a ballot. Let it do so in accordance with its rules. This amendment is designed to see that when the union acts in accordance with its rules it acts cleanly and that there is no corruption. I could well understand that the Government might not want to push an amendment of this character if the trade unions refused to agree to it. After aU, the Government is in a conciliatory frame of mind. It is trying to work in cooperation with the trade unions. So I think that, if the trade unions at the present moment were to say through the Opposition that they were opposed to this amendment, perhaps the Government would not want to press it. But I put this clearly and plainly to my friends opposite: If they oppose this amendment, they are showing themselves to be in favour of corrupt ballots. There is no other reason why they should oppose it. If they support it, they will be in the position having clean hands and clean consciences and of being able to say: 'Not only do we want the trade unions to conduct their own ballots but also we want the trade unions to conduct them in a clean way'. It is perfectly true, as when a union conducts its own baUots it by no means follows that it is corrupt. The position is very much to the contraiy. But there have been cases of corruption, and these have been particuaspect-indeed larly bad in the very large unions. For example, long time ago- I will grant that it was many ago-the Federated Iron workers Union fell under the control of a corrupt clique headed the communist Thornton. The clique the monopolised union power and was thrown out only by a court controlled ballot. There was the slightest doubt that large scale corruption existed in that union. We do not want that to recur. We do not want the suspicion of it to recur. After all, we have an interest in seeing not only that trade union ballots are clean but also that everybody admits them to be clean and concedes that they are clean. I put this proposition to my friends opposite: they have any real support for the principle of clean union ballots, they will indicate their supthat port of this amendment; but if they have some kind of hankering or underground desire to have corrupt ballots, they will indicate their oppolegislation. sition to this amendment. The Government has taken honourable members opposite at their word when they said that they wanted to control trade union ballots by their own machinery. The Government took them at their word when they said that there would be clean baUots. Was word to be trusted or was it not to be trusted? They will show this by their attitude to this amendment. If they support it, they will be seen to be honest men. If they oppose it, they are under suspicion of trying to play a double game and asking for trade union control of baUots order that corruption can be practised in them.",85
157,Mr STREET,PAIRS,"The amendment moved by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) raises a number of questions involving practical problems. Leaving aside the question of corrupfor tion for a moment, one practical problem is whether the Australian Electoral Office would have the staff to provide the necessary number scrutineers. Of course, under the rules each candidate is entitled to a scrutineer. In one election for one particular office the number of candiof dates could run into doublefigures.I presume that the honourable member for Mackellar is considering that one Australian Electoral Office representative could act for aU candidates. But, of course, an election can be conducted anywhere in Australia and, indeed, in very many widely dispersed areas of Austraha for the one I have said, that even election. There are 2 other elements that I think should be mentioned. Thefirstis that on this particular , the honourable member mena tioned this himself-n o discussions have taken years place, as the Government is committed to an undertaking with the peak employer and union by councUs in respect of this matter. We have made point that the unions should be eligible to conduct their own postal ballots. I remind the not Committee that under section 140 and 141 of the Act members have recourse to the registrar and eventually to the Industrial Court if they believe there has been any irregularity in the ballot. Finally, I make the point that the Government has said that this legislation will be given a 2-year trial. The Government will be examining all aspects and the consequences of the legislation during that period. I thank the honourable If member for his suggestion. I hope he will understand that because of the practical difficulties I have outlined we do not intend to pursue it at the presenttime.However, I remind him again of the 2-year trial period for this piece of",86
158,Mr WILLIS,PAIRS,"The Opposition, Uke the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street), does not find itself enamoured of the amendment moved their by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth). I would say that the honourable member for Mackellar is completely overstating the extent of corruption or fraud in trade union elections. If he looks at the record of the last 25 years he will find in fact very little evidence of in fraud or corruption in trade union elections. Indeed, that is one of the main reasons why we regard as quite unnecessary this legislation in for relation to secret ballots.",86
159,Mr JAMES,PAIRS,There would be more on the stock exchange.,86
160,Mr WILLIS,PAIRS,"What the honourable member Hunter says is certainly true. The fact is that if one looks back at cases which have been taken under section 141 or section 159 of the Conciliof ation and Arbitration Act, both of which sections give a single member who feels that there has been any untoward activity-frau d or corruption-in a union election a chance to take it to Industrial Court, one will find that it works'out about 2 cases a year, and not all ofthose were by any means cases which were the result of fraud or corruption. Often they were brought on mere technicalities and so on. So this is one of the over-played aspects of the legislation. The Government has tried to create an atmosphere in which the whole of the Australian population was made to fear that there was some fraud or widescale corruption in trade union elections. That is not the case. The history of the last 25 years, as shown in the records of the Industrial Court, would not bear that out. The corruption cases are very isolated indeed. So we do not see any need to adopt this amendment. In the case of elections which are conducted by the union itself, the law as it stands at the moment provides for the appointment of scrutineers, and where there are competing groups trying to wrest power in the union both sides would appoint scrutineers. I am sure that either side would soon draw attention to any malpractice which they saw. Indeed, that is the role of a scrutineer in union elections as it is in parliamentary elections. So we see no need for public servants to be acting as scrutineers. In fact, I would say that people from interested parties would probably make better scrutineers than would disinterested people who probably would be bored to death by the whole procedure.",86
161,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"I have quite understand the view of the Minister Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr not Street) and the fact that he does not want to stir up a hornet's nest over this matter. The amendcan ment should not, he thinks, be pressed unless trade unions accept it. However, I do not go along with the other arguments that have been put forward, either by the Minister or by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis). It may be that the scrutineers will look to the didates' interests. I know that they will. But they may not always be experienced men. There may not always be the resources in the candidates' hands to have sufficient scrutineers. It may be that the addition of a Commonwealth scrutineer would add nothing. It could add something that in some cases. But it could not do any harm, in wantifthis any case at all. There is nothing to lose. The Minister asks: 'Well, what about the resources of the Commonwealth Electoral says: Office?' I do not think that that is a very good gument at all. Even though the resources may not be sufficient to cover every case, they would be sufficient to cover some cases. No harm could be done. The fact that there was an experienced the man present able to advise the scrutineers of the to candidates would prevent any corruption or any suspicion of corruption. Finally, let me come to the point made by the honourable member for Gellibrand when he most said that there has not been very much corruption in the immediate past. What he means is that there has not been very much corruption found out and proved in the immediate past, which is a different matter altogether. If he will go around, as I have no doubt he does go around from time to time, among people who take pan as members in elections of trade unions, he will discover that in the rank and file there is very often a suspicion of corruption. Rank and file members say: 'We cannot prove this. There is no way of our taking action. We do not know about them, but we know that the game is crook. We know that some people who are elected should not be elected and have got in there by corrupt practices. We cannot convict them of it.' The suspicion may be unfounded. But I can assure my friend from GelUbrand-and I am certain that he needs no assurance from me on this matter-that this suspicion is most prevalent. It would be a good thing from his point of view really, if he wants clean ballots, and from the position of the Government or of the people of Australia, if the prevalent suspicions were sUenced. These suspicions are prevalent. Perhaps they are justified. But the candidates do not always the resources or the skill to do this work. for Even when they find out something, they may have it in sufficient form to go to the court. I think that this is a matter in respect of which we say that nothing can be lost by adopting this the course and something could be gained. I am surprised that my friends in the Opposition do not accept this amendment with alacrity. By the refusal of it, they have covered themselves in suspicion in this matter. I can understand the canpoint of view of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. The Minister said: ' I have made a compact with the trade unions for 2 years. I am not going to do anything without the well consent of the trade unions in this regard'. My friends in the Opposition should surely see the trade unions are honest and if they proposal accepted-if they are honest, they would want it-it should be supported. I quite understand the posiuon of the Minister. He ' I have perhaps unthinkingly made a comarpact with the trade unions without asking for scrutineers. Unless the trade unions and their representatives in this Parliament will help me I cannot go beyond that. I do not want to provoke any strife on this matter because I want to be operative with the unions'. I put it to Opposition members that if they are honest they will at least support this amendment in principle. If they not support it, they make it incumbent upon Minister, I suppose, to take the view that he taken. But they also bring suspicion on themnumber selves that they are acting corruptly when they try to keep the Commonwealth Electoral Office out of every trade union ballot. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Remainder of Bill-by leave-take n as a cases whole.",87
162,Mr WILLIS,PAIRS," I will be very brief. I just want to raise a couple of on clause 13. Firstly, this is the provision which says that the elections shall be by ballot. I want to point out- I think this should be on the record of the Parliament-that this proposal for postal baUots, if unions generaUy accept the provision that elections be by the Commonwealth Electoral Officer, will cost the Commonwealth government something like $1.5m a year on the estimates that the Mmister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) has put forward in a submission to Cabinet. This is a cost of $ 1.5m a year at when the Government is supposed to be shaving costs. This shows what happens comes into the matter. When this happens it seems that costs are irrelevant. According Minister's submission another 20 permanent pubhc servants above the ceUing which currently operates will be needed to man the Australian Electoral Office. Again we have the same point about ideology bending the practice. I would also like to mention the point I made in my second reading speech in relation to secret ballot legislation. In the last few years there been an increasing tendency for trade unions to adopt court controlled ballots for reasons which think have much to do with the increasing conducting elections themselves. This was a trend that was quite noticeable in the 1970s. Over half of the court controlled ballots which have been conducted in the last 25 years were conducted in the 1970s. So there is an increasing trend for court controlled ballots. Yet the Government has seen fit to force everyone to conduct this kind of ballot under which a baUot paper is sent to every eligible member of a union. The unions can please themselves whether they have the election conducted by the Australian Electoral Office or do it themselves. The point is that this kind of elecuon was coincreasingly the kind of election which unions were adopting anyway. In fact, in the last year or so unions which intended to conduct elections in do this way decided not to do so because they did the not want to look as though they were being has forced into doing so by the Government. So the of court controUed baUots would have been much higher than they in fact were if the Government had not been beating the air so much about the need for secret postal ballots. As I have pointed out, the unions were moving rapidly in this direction anyway. Their main argument has been that they did not want to be forced into conducting such ballots and in some they did not want this kind of ballot at all. Generally speaking the trend for court controlled ballots was developing and the Government is points simply doing no more than forcing some few unions which did not want to conduct ballots in secret postal this manner into doing so.",88
163,Mr STREET,PAIRS,Corangamite-Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations) conducted (11.23)-The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr WUlis) quoted a figure of cost and a number of extra officers who might be required in the Australian Electoral Office to conduct union baUots. I make the point that the number of extra staff quoted by the honourable a time member and the cost are estimates of what would be required if all union elections were conwhen ideology ducted in this way. to the Mr WILLIS - I said that.,88
164,Mr STREET,PAIRS,"Yes. Because of the nature of the legislation we have introduced, some unions wUlbe catered for under section 170. Some unions presumably will elect to conduct their own baUots. It is quite true, as the honourable member for Gellibrand has said, that there has been an increasing tendency for unions to use the has provisions of section 170. I think inherent in what he said was that he regarded this as quite a I desirable trend. Certainly the Government concost of siders that is a desirable trend. The point I want to make strongly is that no one is being forced into a position by this legislation. That is the whole object of what the Government has done in recognition of the arguments that were put to it. The legislation as now drafted gives unions a clear choice as to how they want their elections conducted-whethe r by the Electoral Office at pubhc expense or by themselves at their own expense. So the unions have a clear choice and it is up to them which system they choose to use.",88
165,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PAIRS,"Now that the Committee is debating this clause of the Bill, I think it is proper that I should refer briefly to something that was said earlier in the debate in relation to a clause that had nothing whatever to do with the remarks made by the speaker in question. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman), talking of the unions, asked: 'Why should they not have the right to determine whether they want the collegiate system?' I ask the honourable gentleman: What does he mean by 'they'? Is he saying that the union ofncials should have the right to have a collegiate system if they-the union officials-wan t it or does he mean that the members of the union should have the right if they-the members-wan t to have the collegiate system? If it is the latter, I have no quarrel with him. If he is going to support a proposal in relation to which the real union that is, the members of the union, the people, the bodies that make up the union itself-ar e to be given the right to determine whether they want it then that is fair enough. But I suspect that the honourable gentleman means, when he says 'They should be able to determine what they want', Mr Maynes and the other people of the National Civic Council who have been so actively campaigning to have wiped out therightof the rank and file to determine what they want? The honourable member for Denison is really meaning Mr John Maynes, Mr Maher and their ilk; that is what he really means. Mr Chipp- Mr Chairman I am very reluctant to do this to my friend, but it is 25 minutes past 11 and, while you and I might have been tolerant earlier in the evening, I direct your attention to clause 13, which is quite specific and very Umited. It gives the Industrial Registrar power to exempt an organisation from conducting a secret postal ballot if 2 circumstances are met. Those circumstances are set out in sub-clause 3 (a) and sub-clause 3 (b). I would suggest with great respect and with apologies to the honourable member for Hindmarsh that the collegiate system of voting has nothing whatever to do with this clause, and I would like you to ask him to confine himself to the contents of the clause at this stage of the day.",89
166,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"I think that there is merit in the suggestion made by the honourable member for Hotham. In discussing this Bill we have ranged rather widely over all the points. As suggested by the honourable member for Hotham, it might be advantageous to us aU at this hour if we were to stick, in relation to clause 13 and the remainder of the Bill, strictly to a narrow interpretation of what the Bill implies.",89
167,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PAIRS,"I accept your ruling, Mr Chairman. I shall not mention the collegiate system any more. May I take this opportunity of compUmenting you, Mr Chairman, on the way in which you have handled this debate. I say in all seriousness that this has been the best debate that I can remember in this Parliament for a fairly long time, particularly in the Committee stage. The Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) did not give us much of a chance to participate in the second reading stage of the debate, as you will recall. Only 2 speakers from this side of the chamber were allowed to participate. But since you have been in charge of the debate it has been very fruitful. Honourable members on both sides of the chamber are talking about how sensible you have been in your conduct of the proceedings. You have given latitude. I think that it is all to the good that you have done so because as a result of the sensible latitude that you have given, everyone has had his say and it has become a very interesting, enlightening and, I believe, fruitful debate. I want to add only one more comment, Sir. At one stage of his remarks the Minister said that there had been, I think, only 29 applications for postal ballots out of 150 unions. Mr Street-Twenty-nin e unions.",89
168,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PAIRS,"Last year there were 29 unions out of one hundred andfifty.But the Minister ought to remember that all unions do not have an election every year. If one assumes that most of the unions have a triennial election system, roughly one-third of the unions have an election each year. Thus at the end of 3 years they all manage to have an election. So really about 29 out of 50 unions last year rather than 29 out of 150 had postal ballots. We have to remember that in some unions there is an election only once every 3 years, so if we pick out a single year in isolation and analyse what happened in that particular year we find that maybe 100 unions out of the 150 did not have an election at aU. The Government has really run into an arithmetical problem here and the Minister might have that matter examined in greater detaU. I think it has been an excellent debate. I compliment the Minister on the calm, cool and collected manner in which he has parried the blows that have been levelled in his direction. I repeat with even more sincerity that you, Mr Chairman, have contributed greatly by the sensible latitude you have aUowed everyone.",89
169,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,PAIRS," I shall keep the Committee for only 2 or 3 minutes, but they will be minutes spent discussing clause 13. Clause 13 proposes 2 things: It indicates that the elecuon shall be by secret postal ballot and that where certain other conditions are specified, exceptions will apply in respect of those ballots. That is what we are talking about. I should have thought that the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) was one that at least deserved serious consideration, even though the Government does not accept it in these circumstances. Mr Bourchier- Mr Chairman, I rise on a point of order. The amendment of the honourable member for Mackellar was to clause 12, not to clause 13.",90
170,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"Regarding the point of order, I was reading clause 13 and I felt that the honourable member for Lilley had not proceeded with it to this point.",90
171,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,PAIRS,"I see the point made by the honourable member for Bendigo but without referring to the amendment I suggest that its substance would have application in respect of clause 13 had it been accepted. I hope that the spirit of that amendment will be looked at. There is one other point that I suggest the Minister examine during the course of the operation of this legislation. It is something I have mentioned to him before and I will repeat it quickly. There will be cases in which some confusion can arise in the minds of voters in union elections in those States where there are significant arbitration and industrial jurisdictions. There will be a duplicity of votes and of voting procedures that could give rise to some doubt and confusion in the minds of voters. I am referring particularly to where there are significant State jurisdictions, such as in Queensland, Western Austraha and New South Wales. The classic Moore v Doyle case shows that voters registered in a State union can be preeveiything sented with a dual set of ballot papers under two quite differing sets of circumstances. I hope that the Minister will look carefully at the confusion that may arise in those cases. Connever fusion will also arise where unions registered under State jurisidictions cover generally the same occupations as do Federal unions which have a much wider franchise than the voting cedures of the State union. There may be what porting were previously the same officials working out the same office, one dealing with State awards and having a similarity to the State branch of Federal union covering generally the same area. Difficulties may be found where officials were filling 2 positions in the past, elected to both positions at the same time, because of the very different and wider franchise under this Bill than is provided in the State jurisdiction. I am referring to cases where members go to a meeting and elect State ofncials. There may be confusion in the minds of the voters as to the officials elected by the 2 procedures, and that confusion will grow because of the difference in voting procedures. I merely say to the Minister that I hope he will carefully consider suggesting some complementary legislation covering the area between that covered by this legislation and the State jurisdictions where there are significant State arbitration or industrial commissions. The case is worth looking at, and I hope that the confusion does not become wider. I know that the Minister will keep the matter in mind and will treat it very diplomatically, but I suggest that it is a situation which should not be ignored.",90
172,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS," I am one of the people on this side of the House who would like to have spoken during the second reading debate. Unfortunately, that debate was cut short. There are a couple of points I should Uke to make as thisfiascoreaches its conclusion. In relation to what the Government sees as a exercise in taming the unions, it is my view, having been a participant in union ballots conducted both by returning officers of the union and by the Australian Electoral Office, that what the Government has set out to do will not be achieved. The Government ought to look at the history of union baUots and learn a few lessons from it because the exercise we are going through at the moment is quite stupid. As to the suggestion that there should be scrutineers from the Electoral Office in the union office, such people could hardly be called scrutineers. Scrutineers are appointed on behalf of candidates. If the police were present to observe whether was being done correctly they would developed not be called scrutineers. Another point I should make is that I have been a participant in a corrupt union ballot, which the honourable member for Mackellar has suggested would be the case if we do not support the views he puts forward. He himself is a proparty to an act which we can prove is the supof a corrupt ballot, that is, when he sits in of the Liberal and Country Party rooms and puts up his hand in favour of a 20 per cent discrepa ancy between the value of the vote in the metropolitan area and the vote in a rural area. The honourable member for Mackellar supports a corrupt ballot.",90
173,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Order! I diink the honourable member for Port Adelaide is going back to a clause that has already been agreed to by the Committee.,91
174,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,"When Government members talk about every union member having a vote, the position is quite ridiculous. The returns by the Electoral Office of the ballots which they conduct show a very minimal response to the ballots. Union officials such as the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) and I-and most union officials who come into this Parhament sit on this side of the House-happe n to know a few things about it. If this provision will mean greater activity in trade unions by more people, then we will welcome it. I suspect that even the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) could go and have a look at the ballots conducted by the Waterside Workers Federation or by the miners or the seamen. Who is going to challenge those ballots? The ballots of the most mihtant unions in this land are unchallenged; so what honourable members opposite talk about is a lot of nonsense. In conclusion, the other thing I want to say that this is a great day for the Australian Parliarepresentative ment. I have been through the policy speech delivered by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm give Fraser). Of all the promises made during the election campaign, this is the third promise the Government has kept. It has reinstated the superphosphate bounty and it has provided for the 40 per cent investment allowance. Mr Street- Mr Chairman, I rise on a point of order.",91
175,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Order! I think the honourand able member for Port Adelaide is also aware the fact that there was no relevance to this Bill his last remarks.,91
176,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,"The point I am making is that lation so much of what the Government said it was going to do has not been done. It is anxious to this legislation enacted, although it will not proclaimed, just to give it a negotiating weapon when it meets the Australian Unions next week. The whole exercise nonsense.",91
177,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS," I was amused to hear the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) say a moment ago elections that ballots in the Liberal Party were corrupt cause some members represent 20 per cent more electors than do other members. I understand that he has been a member of the ALP Executive, some members of which represent 1000 per cent more electors than do others. Does he call the ballots that elected him to his paid position corrupt? I put that to him.",91
178,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Order! I think the honourable member for Mackellar is as much out of order as was the honourable member for Port Adelaide.,91
179,Dr KLUGMAN,PAIRS," I would like to make one short point, that is, that the Government's hypocrisy in regard to this legislation is shown quite clearly in these clauses dealing with trade union ballots. The Government claims it is concerned about having trade unions represented by the people who really represent the unionists. That is farr enough. If the Government believes this legislation will bring this about it should introduce it, but the Government is not going to do that. It is going to pass this legislation and suspend it. It is going to do a deal with the very trade union leaders that it claims are not representative of the rank and file. It is going to say to them: 'Provided you do the sort of thing we want you to do, we do not care whether you represent the rank and file or not. You can stay in office. We are not really concerned about is getting into these positions people who are really of trade unionists. All we want in these positions are people who are prepared to in on the basis that they might lose their jobs if a different method of ballot is introduced.' I hope that the leadership of trade unions will look beyond any short term personal benefits that might arise by caving into the Government at the presenttimebecause the Government does not intend to have this legislation proclaimed. I hope the leadership has confidence in the rank file, and if there is a worthwhile case after of meeting with the Government, I hope they will in stand up against the sort of propositions that the Government is putting to them. I hope they will be prepared to stand for election under legisincluding secret ballots. I criticise the Government very strongly for the utter and comsee plete hypocrisy of threatening trade unions with be having clean ballots, but saying at the same time that if the leadership caves in it will not insist on Council of Trade clean ballots. is a lot of Mr CLYDE CAMERON (Hindmarsh) (11.44)- I want to reply to the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns). He talked about the confusion that can be caused by having for federal officers at a different time beand in a different way from that which might be used by the State organisation. I think what he was talking about was what purports to be, and no more than purports to be in many cases, the State branch of a federal union which has State registration in a particular State of the four States in which registration is possible. He spoke as though there was no problem now and that this legislation would create a problem where there was now no problem. He is veiy, very wrong in that belief. It will be surprising to me if the Minister is able to solve this problem. Until there is complementary legislation by the State governments-the New South Wales Government has now decided that it will pass the necessary complementary legislation to the Bill we passed in 1974 to give effect to the Moore and Doyle case-the Government will not ever solve the problem that the honourable member for Lilley talked about. Let me take the case of the Australian Workers Union which I know so well. In the case of Queensland the State from which the honourable gentleman comes, the State union known as the Australian Workers Union Industrial Union of Employees (Queensland), or by a name similar to that, is registered as a State organisation and, except for about 4 or 5 awards, all its awards are State awards. The horse training award and a couple of other odd awards are Federal awards; but all the other awards are State awards including the pastoral award, the cane cutters' and the road construction award which are capable of being covered by the Australian Workers Union Federal registration but which, in point of fact, have never moved into the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The true position is this: If the State awards that now operate in Queensland are properly based it is only because the members of the Queensland State registered union are properly members of the State union and not members of the Federal union; because Moore v. Doyle showed it is not possible legally by joining one union automatically to acquire membership in another separate legal entity with its own legal personality. That case showed that once a union registers in a State it has to acquire its own legal personality and separate entity-it has to have its own membership, its own offices, its own set of books and its own set of rules. Nothing that is done here beyond what we did in 1974 will cure the situation that I am now talking about. There are literally tens of thousands of members of the State union in Queensland who are now participating in Federal union elections and who have no right to vote at all. The fact that those union members are in occupations which are capable of being covered by the Federal unionMr Chipp- I raise a point of order, Mr Chairman. About half an hour ago I drew your attention to the provisions of clause 13 of the Bill. The clause is exquisitely simple. It gives the industrial registrar power on 2 criteria to exempt an organisation from conducting a secret ballot. What the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) is now saying is absolutely irrelevant to clause 13. I plead with you, Mr Chairman, at this time of night, please, to hold the honourable member to the clause under discussion.",91
180,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"In answer to the point of order raised by the honourable member for Hotham, I accept the fact that the point that he has raised has some merit. The only reason that I did not rise and call the honourable member for Hindmarsh to order was that the comment had originally been made by the honourable member for Lilley in relation to confusion caused in this aspect of this clause. Perhaps the honourable member for Hotham might bear with me. Part of clause 13 states: The regulations may make provision for and in relation to the conduct of an election in accordance with the requirements of this secuon in the case of an election in respect of which the rules of the organization do not provide for a secret postal ballot. The point that I query is the honourable member for Hindmarsh's comments in relation to State and Federal unions and members being members either of one union or of another. I must confess that I was giving consideration as to whether the honourable member for Hindmarsh was in order in speaking on this way in this particular clause. But I should hesitate to be dogmatic on the question of whether the membership of either a State or Federal organisation might not have some effect on the rules of an organisation which do or which do not provide for a secret postal ballot. I was in the process of coming to a conclusion and a decision on that matter when the honourable member for Hotham raised his point of order. The remarks of the honourable member for Hindmarsh earlier reminded me of the song sung by Mary Poppins entitled A Spoonful of Sugar Makes The Medicine Go Down. I only hope that the honourable member for Hindmarsh maintains his high opinion of me when at this stage I make the comment that perhaps he has stretched the bow a little bit in relation to this part of the Committee 's consideration.",92
181,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PAIRS,"Mr Chairman, you have taken so long to tell me that I am possibly stretching the bow a httle that you have put me right off what I was thinking about. I was on a very good wavelength. You have put me right off it. I am afraid that the gems of wisdom that were about to fall from me at the time. I was so rudely interrupted will now have to wait another day. Thank you very much, nonetheless, for your tolerence. I repeat that this debate is really a class example of Parliament at its very best.",92
182,Mr STREET,PAIRS,"The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) referred to the fact that last year 29 unions applied for ballots to be conducted under section 170. He made the point that, as 3 years is not an unusual term of office, therefore approximately 50 unions a year are involved in elections. I merely make the point that not all unions fill all their offices in the one year. So, even though the term of office may be 3 years, certain offices of a union can come up for election each year. Nevertheless, I will make inquiries to find out what percentage of unions holding elections in that year asked for them to be conducted under section 170. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) raised the question of confusion that could arise within Federal and State jurisdictions, as did the honourable member for Hindmarsh. I merely want it on record that I have written to my State colleagues suggesting that this legislation and the possibility of complementary State legislation to minimise any confusion could be a possible matter for discussion at a conference ofLabor Ministers. The honourable member for Port Adelaide referred to the firstpercentage of votes cast in union elections. He implied that the percentage of votes cast in union elections conducted under the auspices of the Industrial Registrar or the Australian Electoral Office was not high. As a matter of fact, for the 29 unions referred to earlier the average return of ballot papers was just under 40 per cent. That might not be as high as we would like. Certainly we hope that over a period greater interest in union elections will result in greater participation. But it is a reasonable percentage and a good deal higher than the percentage for ballots where attendance is requested. Remainder ofBill agreed to. Bill reported with an amendment; report-by leave-adopted . Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Street)-by leave-rea d a third time. House adjourned at 11.55 p.m. The following answers to questions Public Service: Senior Quarantine Inspector It Mr Bungey asked the Minister for Health, outlined upon notice: (1) What is the text of the from the Director of Health, Western Australia, to Mr W. Toomer, Senior Quarantine Inspector, headed 'Your duties as Senior Quarantine Inspector'. (2) Did the former Minister for Health, Dr Everingham, advise Mr Toomer by letter, dated 8 March 1974, that Mr Toomer had been restored to full duty as Senior Quarantine Inspector; if so, was this statement accurate; if the statement was not accurate, can he say on what basis of advice the statement was made.

(5) What is the text of the from the Director of Health, Western Australia, to Mr W. F. Toomer headed 'Your duties as Senior Quarantine the(5) Inspector'. (6) Did the committee inquiring ern Australia in March 1974, consisting of Dr Gee, Dr Bull and Mr Finlay request the Director of Health, Western Australia, to withdraw the minute dated 15 March 1974; if so, why. (7) Did DrJ. B. Mathieson state before the Public Service Appeal Board on 21 October 1974 that the committee immediately inquiring into quarantine in Western Australia informed him that they could not get on with their job unless the minute was withdrawn; if so, was Dr Mathieson's evidence correct. (8) If the evidence was correct, inquiring into quarantine in Western Australia prevented from getting on with their job was not withdrawn and substituted by the minute of 18 March 1974.",93
183,Mr HUNT,PAIRS,"My Department has provided me with the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) It is not the normal practice to make the texts of such documents available. However, in essence, the minute outlined to Mr Toomer that the Director-General of Health had instructed the Director to return Mr Toomer to his full dudes as Senior Quarantine Inspector as from 19 February 1974 subject to a number of conditions concerning: method of communication with other staff issue of technical instructions control of subordinate officers movements from the Perth Office overtime procedure regarding submissions, and need to carry out instructions. (2) 1 understand the letter to Mr Toomer, dated 8 March 1974, stated it was Dr Everingham's understanding that Mr Toomer had been restored to full duty on 19 February 1974. NA upon notice were circulated: was also understood by the Director-General of Health that this was the case. (Question No. 48) (3) See (1) above. However, in general, this minute that the Director-General had directed that Mr Toomer be informed that the Director-General's instructions were: minute, dated 18 February 1974 F. as Mr Toomer's appeal had been disallowed, that incident had now been closed Mr Toomer should therefore be returned to the full duties ofhis position that Mr Toomer be counselled on his past shortcomings and have fully explained what was expected of him in the future including method of communication of orders or authorisations on technical quarantine matters, functional control for administrative and non-technical matters and penalties under the Public Service Act for not carrying out legitimate orders. F. The minute also included a reiteration of the Director's which were the remaining aspects covered in (1) above. (4) Director of Health, Western Australia, was directed by and the Director-General of Health to make clear to Mr Toomer those instructions which emanated from the Directorminute, dated 18 March 1974, General. See (1) above. However, this minute merely cancelled minute outlined in (3 ) above and returned Mr Toomer to the full duties of his designated position without into quarantine in Westqualification. (6) No. However, Mr Gee, speaking as First Assistant Director-General, Quarantine Division, Depanment of Health and not as a member of the Committee, did repeat to the Director of Health, Western Australia, the Director General's instructions that Mr Toomer was to be restored to full duty if this had not already been done. (7) Dr Mathieson did make such a statement before the Committee. I am informed, however, that the Committee's activities were not dependent on the withdrawal of the minhow was the committee ute referred to. (8) See (6) and (7) above. if the minute of 15 March 1974 Fruitgrowing Industry: Tree Pull Scheme (Question No. 286) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: (1) Is there confusion amongst fruit growers in respect of the re-introduction of a tree pull scheme, which has been compounded by the announcement of an alternative meanstest free proposal in the report of the Australian Industry Development Corporation. (2) Istimerunning out both seasonally andfinanciallyfor fruit growers if a tree pull scheme is to be of maximum value; if so, when will an announcement be made.",94
184,Mr SINCLAIR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The Government is fully aware of the uncertainty prevailing, in many sections of the fruit growing industry, particularly in the Goulburn Valley, and is concerned at the difficult situation facing individual growers. Accordingly, as indicated in my Press release of 20 May, the Government decided to extend the Fruitgrowing Reconstruction Scheme established by the State Grants (Fruitgrowing Reconstruction) Act 1972 on the basis that applications received by 31 December 1976 will be eligible for consideration for the payment of compensation, and trees will have to be removed by 30 June 1977. There will be a liberalisation of the eligibility conditions, so that the net assets a grower can have after clear fell tree pull will be doubled. Proceedings Under Matrimonial Causes Act Mr Innes asked the Attorney-General, upon notice: Before he made his personal 24 March 1976, did any Judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales contact him regarding his answer to my tions the previous day. Mr Ellicott-The answer to the honourable of member's question is as follows: On Wednesday morning, 24 March, I was contacted by the Chief Justice of New South Wales, Sir Laurence Street, who indicated that he thought my answer of the previous day (which in fact was in answer to the Leader of the sition), as reported in the Press, was not completely accurate. I informed him that I had since become aware of this and proposed to make a statement correcting it later that day. The Chief Jusuce gave me certain information which was consistent with the information contained in statement. Medibank: Drug Dispensing Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon on notice: (1) Funher to Question No. 18 concerning the dispensing of drugs under Medibank in hospital outpatient depanis, ments, and the reply that the Commonwealth has no inforRules mation on this subject, why does the Commonwealth not require the information when it has to pay SO per cent of the cost of the drugs and their dispensing. (2) If the information is not available, how can the Medibank Review Committee do its work. (3) If it is available from other sources, why was it not provided.",94
185,Mr HUNT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Under the Medibank hospital agreements the net operating costs of recognised hospitals are shared between the Commonwealth and the States. As a consequence, there is an incentive on the States to contain costs. In view of this situation the Commonwealth does not see a particular need for detailed information on drug and dispensing costs in recognised hospitals which, when viewed against total expenditure under the hospital agreements, are relatively minor components. (2) The Medibank Review Committee was primarily concerned with Medibank in a broad policy context. As such, the absence of detailed data on drug costs in recognised hospitals did not in any way handicap the Committee s work. (3) Informadon has recently come to hand from State hospital authorities which reveals that, three StatesQueensland, Western Australia and Tasmania-have experienced no significant change in the percentage of Nauonai Health Scheme drugs dispensed in respect of outpatient depanments of recognised hospitals since Medibank commenced. Two States-New South Wales and South Australia report that the information is not available. The remaining State-Victoria-report s that no detailed statistics are available on changes in the number of hospital prescriptions written in the outpatient depanment of every Victonan hospital since the introduction of Medibank. Preliminary information from some Victorian hospitals indicates that a moderate increase has taken place in these institutions, but the extent is variable. 1959-1973 (Question No. 300) Divorce (Question No. 340) Mr Young asked the Attorney-General, upon explanation on Wednesday, notice: (1) What discussions have taken place between officials of queshis Depanment and ofncials of the Department of the Attorney-General of New South Wales regarding the powers the registries of courts in New South Wales to withhold certificates that a decree nui of divorce has become absolute. (2) What powers do State Governments have to refuse such certificates to citizens making application for them. (3) How many applications for such certificates were Oppomade during the period 1 January 1975 to 31 December 1975 in the State of New South Wales. (4) How many of these applications were refused. Mr Ellicott-The answer to the honourable my subsequent member's question is as follows: (1) The only discussion of which I am aware is the conversation between the officer of my Department and the Registrar of the Family Law Division of the Supreme Court of (Question No. 337) New South Wales referred to in my supplementary answer 6 April 1976 to a question from the Leader of the Opposition (Hansard, page 1343). (2) This question calls for an interpretation of the law and can only be decided by the courts. The honourable member however, referred to rule 299 of the Matrimonial Causes and regulation 162 of the Family Law Regulations. (3) I am informed that there were approximately 13 000. (4) I am informed that there were approximately 6 (where insufficient information was available to indentify the suit). Oriental Fruit Fly (Question No. 375) Mr Bungey asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: What action is being taken by his Department to contain the spread and to destroy Oriental Fruit Fly recently discovered in the Northern Territory, and what funds have been provided for this purpose.",95
186,Mr SINCLAIR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Agricultural Council at its meeting in January 1976 received a repon submitted by the Standing Committee on Agriculture on the outbreak of Oriental Fruit Fly in the Nonhern Territory. Council noted the extremely serious possible consequences for Australia's horticultural industries and agreed that an intensive biological study of the parasite by experts should be initiated without delay to determine the Ukely extent ofit spreading beyond the Northern Territory, the feasibility of eradication, the best methods for suppression, control and commodity disinfestation procedures. The honourable member can see from the answers to his questions by the Ministers for Health, the Nonhern Territory and Science (Nos 387, 388 and that measures have been initiated in the control of this fly. Investigations recently made both overseas and in Austraha support the opinion that Oriental Fruit Fly has been established in the Northern Territory for a considerable period of time. Considerable biological data on the pest is being assembled and efforts are being made to elucidate the pest status of the fly. Funds amounting to S1.803m have been allocated by the Minister for Health for all aspects of the Oriental Fruit Fly campaign. Mr Les MCMahon asked the Minister for Post reason and Telecommunications, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that residents in the Electoral Division of Sydney are undergoing delays inrespectof their telephone service; if so, what steps are being taken to rectify the situation. (2) Are there staff cut-backs in this area. (3) Will the apprentice intake 1975; if so, what are the details. (4) Will he ensure that the Australian telephone service remains one of the best in the world. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Telecom Australia advises that new telephone services in the electoral division of Sydney vided within one to two weeks. The standard of service on the clearance of faults is would like to provide in this area. Wet weather conditions have been an inhibiting factor in achieving an improvement in performance. There is some particular location due to wastage and efforts are to overcome the problem by transfers. (3) It is expected that fewer apprentices in Sydney at the end of 1976. (4) The Government's policy is that the telephone work should continue to be developed able needs of the Australian community. Every action possible will continue to be taken to provide the Telecommunications Commission with the resources to implement that policy.

Telephones (2) I am not aware of any, and certainly no such manufacturer of any significant size has closed. However Polarizers (Question No. 393) (Australia) Pty Ltd. ceased production in July 1975, prior to which it was a major manufacturer of sunglass frames. The for the closure is understood to have been lack of profitability. (3) Total employment in the manufacture of ophthalmic frames in Australia is approximately 370 persons.

Fremantle is the only nated by the World Health Organisation to issue deratting Broome certificates. Ships arriving at Nonh West Pons would only Yampi Sound be fumigated if the vessel proceeded on to Fremantle or a Derby pon in another State where fumigation is carried out, and the Exmouth infestation was heavy enough to warrant the procedure. For Port Hedland Mrs R. Goulston, other ships arriving at North West Ports, trapping and Hospitals and poison baiting would be undenaken. Health Services (4) Yes.

In",101
197,Mr HUNT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Close consultation between the Commonwealth and the (Question No. 403) States on the control of pest eradication has been promoted over a long period by the Australian Agricultural Council. These consultations are on a continuing basis. There is a substantially uniform approach over virtually the wholefieldof pesticide control, including such matters as the registration of pesticides, direction for pesticides usage, labelling, etc. Legislative measures are the responsibility of the individual States and Territories, under the legislation in the particular State or Territory. The work performed under the auspices of the Australian Agricultural Council has been integrated with the activities of the National Health and Medical Research Council. This has brought about a close co-ordination of approach between the States and the Commonwealth on these matters. The National Health and Medical Research Council at its sixty-sixth session in May 1968 approved Draft Uniform Pesticide Regulations are recommended that they be distributed to States and Commonwealth Territories as a guide for the statutory control of the hazards from the commercial use of pesticides. The question of the control of pest eradicators was raised in committees of the Council in 1970 and again in 1972 and it was agreed that the NH & MRC Draft Regulations of 1968 provided a basis of control. I have arranged for the matter to be raised at the relevant committee of the NH & MRC with a view to bringing about more uniform adoption of the draft regulations, than has been so far achieved.

198,Mr HUNT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable State member's question is as follows: (1) No evidence is available to the Department of Health or the Health Insurance Commission to indicate that some medical practitioners are adopting that practice referred the question. (2) I am advised that doctors whether they will see a patient or not, just as patients have the right to choose their doctor. However, as mentioned, there is no evidence available to me that any such action the basis of whether individuals contribute to private mediNH cal insurance schemes.

(6) Will he take appropriate steps to ensure that manufacturers be compelled, by law, to mark flavourings, colouring and preserving products.",102
199,Mr HUNT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes, I am aware of recent ABC Television and Radio programs concerning the theories of Dr on the association between food additives and hyperactivity in children. I would stress that the relationship postulated Feingold is at present unconfirmed. Research is underway in Australia into this theory (see (5)). (2) Yes. Some research is being carried out however, the bulk of the work being done on these substances is carried out overseas. Results of all these research studies, both in this country and overseas, are carefully examined by the appropriate committees of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH & MRC). As a result of this consideration, recommendations are made by Council as to which additives may be approved for use in foods. (3) Rather than use a symbol to distinguish foods which are free from particular substances, it is considered more ful and informative to require all added substances to listed on the label. The NH & MRC is currently considering the whole range of of matters to be included on food labels. In the listing of substances, the proposals include a requirement that foods containing added colouring andflavouringwould be labelled 'colouring added' or 'flavouring added'. (Current legislation already requires food to which a preservative has been added to be labelled accordingly). (4) The list of approved food additives in Australia is very shon compared with those of most western countries. It conto in tains approximately 230 approved food additives. In the United States of America,forexample, the list of approved additives contains approximately ten umes the number do have the right to decide permitted in Australia.

(6) As mentioned in (3) above, the whole matter of labelof foodstuffs is currently under consideration. The final and recommendations should be available shortly. The power to require food to be labelled rests with the States and Territories under their own individual legislation. Recommendations made by the NH & MRC are generally on all foods adopted into such legislation.

Council considered safety precautions followed should provide adequate protection to all persons exposed to 2,4,5-T in its manufacture and use. Council recommend that 2,4,5-T 0.1 ppm of TCDD should not be permitted for use as a herbicide in Australia and that there should be a maximum residue limit of 0.02 ppm of 2,4,5-T permitted in water.' As part of the process of registration for sale and use of 2,4,5-T action is taken in the States to ucts available to the public contain no more than 0.1 TCDD.

205,Mr HUNT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable high member's question is as follows: (1) In order to qualify for the payment of the domiciliary nursing care benefit, a patient must have for nursing care and must receive that care in the home by, under the supervision of a registered nurse. In most the instances, the attending nurse would be a District Nursing Service or of an equivalent Service. However, it is not essential that the attending nurse be a member of a nursing service to be eligible to fulfil the nursing requirement. Under the provisions of the National Health Act, any qualified nurse who is currently registered under law of a State or Territory may provide nursing care to approved patient. (2) I am not aware of any mass meeting of domiciliary nurses to complain about the excessive workload which they bear. However, I would point out the provision of nurses within the States is primarily the responsibility of each State Government. The Commonwealth assists,financially,nonupon profit nursing organisations by way of subsidies for their nursing staff under the provisions of the Home Nursing sidy Act. the beneficiary or a member of the family is a nurse and the person provides some skilled nursing care to the patient, it is not necessary to engage the services of another person to provide skilled nursing care to the member to the answer patient The requirement for visits by a registered nurse has been partly relaxed in relation to patients living in remote rural areas where it is not possible, because of the area's to arrange for a nurse to visit regularly.

(6) Will there be any downgrading of the high quality meethard wheats grown in Queensland and nonhern New South Wales following the release of any new wheats based on Mexican dwarf varieties.",104
206,Mr SINCLAIR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable to care for member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) to (6) I understand that with the introduction of the yielding, semi-dwarf Mexican wheats into the Australian wheat breeding programme, the relationship between the protein content of the grain and yield has become a continuing need an important consideration. or This balance between yield and protein content has been subject of a thorough and extensive study by Australian member of the plant breeders and geneticists. I am informed that the subject was discussed at the Auscare tralian Wheat Industry Review Conference held in Sydney in March 1976.
