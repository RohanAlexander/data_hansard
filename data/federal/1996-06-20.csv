1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH Address-in-Reply Debate resumed from 9 May, on motion by Mrs Gash: That the following address-in-reply of His Excellency the Governor General be agreed to: May it please Your Excellency: We, the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, desire to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for the speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament.",13
2,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,"I entered the Victorian parliament in 1963 and this parliament in 1977, so this, I suspect, unless some kind of revolution takes place, will be my last address-in-reply speech in this House. I begin, sir, by congratulating you and your deputies on your election to the difficult task of presiding over this House, which, from past experience, is not always as orderly as it ought to be. I think we take many things for granted in this nation, and one of the things we take for granted is our system of parliamentary democracy and the Westminster system upon which it is based. We take it for granted that we have had a change in government, that there were no armed police on the streets, there was no military presence, there was an orderly transition of power and we have lots of new faces in the parliament. That does not happen in many parts of the world. For my sins, I am a member of the InterParliamentary Union Committee on Human Rights. There are over 130 parliamentarians in gaol as a result of military actions or takeovers and they are there for no other reason than the fact that they sought to carry out their democrat mandate-mandates that we take for granted. Therefore, I think it is important on an occasion like this to remember that we all have a duty to maintain the integrity of the Westminster system. Although I must confess to republican sentiments, I have to say that we all owe a debt to the British system we inherited in this place. That involves the concept of a democratically elected parliament and an independent public service-and I will talk about that later-but it also involves the separation of powers and an independent judiciary. On those three tiers, basically the whole system of our parliamentary democracy and the rights to the speech of our citizens rests.",13
3,Mr COBB,Unknown,They would like that in Burma.,13
4,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,"I am glad the honourable gentleman mentioned Burma. It is a perfect example of a takeover by the military, a situation where parliamentarians, democratically elected, have been imprisoned and an arrogant military dictatorship simply refuses to answer the questions that are posed to it by international tribunals as to the fate of those parliamentarians who are languishing in gaol, subject to torture and abuse and separation from their families. These are issues which I think should concern all of us. I now want to tum to some questions which, in the cut and thrust of debate, we do not often ask ourselves. There are clearly differences between the philosophy of the incoming government and that of the former government. I am bound to say that I have never been in a parliament when any government has not made mistakes. I say particularly to the newer and younger members of this institution that the role of the parliamentarian, the backbencher, is to try to ensure that, as far as possible, the government he or she supports does not make mistakes. That is an awe-inspiring task and, given the nature of our government process, I think it is true to say, regarding the endeavours that are made from time to time by people who might disagree with government policy, that party discipline in our system is such that it is not always easy to speak out and disapprove of some aspects of policy.",13
5,Mr FILING,Unknown,It is too restrictive.,13
6,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,"That is right. Therefore, I think it is time we asked ourselves some pretty important questions. I am concerned about what I believe is the erosion of the Westminster system in state parliaments and in this parliament. The thrust towards privatisation is, I believe, out of kilter and out of balance. I don't believe that there is any overwhelming evidence that privati sing an area of government or handing it over to private consultants ultimately does anything more for the government than that which has traditionally been performed by a public service. It is not an accident in Australia that, despite the crossfire of politics, we have never had a serious allegation of corruption-some have resigned because of wrong judgmentsagainst any Commonwealth minister in carrying out the responsibilities of his portfolio. There have been errors of judgment, yes, but never an allegation of corruption. That is not an accident. That comes about because, basically, the pressures on ministers and the range of information and material that they have to deal with comes from a public service which, over years of tradition, has produced a process whereby, by the time the material comes onto the minister's desk, he or she has had an opportunity to make decisions on the best available material. The decision is his or hers. The minister will be argued with by public servants but there are only two kinds of ministers: those who run their public servants and those who are run by them. Independence is important. By the time a government contract reaches the minister's desk, it is not possible for him to say, 'You'd better take it away because there happens to be a factory in my electorate which I think could do a bit better than this,' or 'I have some friends you ought to go and talk to.' It is just not on. Therefore, I am concerned at the thrust of what is taking place in my home state. One of the roles of the Public Service is not just simply to advise the government but to brief the opposition, which they used to do with great skill and discretion. Some matters are properly formulated in government policy which they would not want to discuss. But if either the Leader of the Opposition or a parliamentarian needs advice on some aspect of government policy, he is entitled to seek that from a senior public servant. In my introduction to the parliamentary scene in Victoria, that was very much part of the process. There was no difficulty about getting the head of Treasury to speak to opposition members or to a shadow minister-none at all. It was simply a question of ringing the Premier or the Treasurer and asking and there was never an occasion when that permission was not given. In Victoria that system has now changed because the public servant's position is no longer guaranteed. He is now under contract for three years-not even to his minister but to the Premier. And his salary, of course, has gone up enormously, with very big retirement allowances-you are looking at millions of dollars. The problem is not necessarily the emolument, which I think is excessive. The problem is that the public servant, as head, can be sacked with three to four weeks notice. That makes the concept of an independent public service a highly questionable exercise indeed. I do not know that those systems which are appropriate to a private company ought necessarily be the systems that apply to government administration. I think the role is clearly different. We also need to look at the social problems that are occurring in many parts of Australia-not merely unemployment but the rift that is developing between rural Australia and the metropolitan areas. There was a time when no political party, state or federal, could go to the polls without real policies on decentralisation and the moving of resources from the centres out to the bush. In fact, the Whitlam government had a very constructive policy but the only thing, I think, that remains of that now is the Albury-Wodonga complex. We are seeing a cutback in services at many levels to regional towns and cities, and that is a matter of concern. As a parliament, we have to ask ourselves whether banks have a social responsibility or whether they are simply private agencies that set their own policy standards and can say, 'It's bad luck for a country town of 800 or I ,000 people but we're going to have to close the bank and the small shopkeeper may have to drive an hour and a half to do his normal financial business.' Is that an acceptable standard? Does this parliament simply say, 'We'll just simply let it run. Banking is not really a question for this House'? The kinds of social infrastructures of regional centres and country towns are being destroyed. That has to be a question that does not affect merely members representing rural constituencies; it affects all of us. Therefore, I believe it is important that more emphasis be given to these issues. It is not good enough for banks simply to say, 'Our main concern is profit and the bottom line. Running a small bank which services a country town of 800 people or 1,000 people means that the turnover is not great enough. We'll take our banking services out. Within five years they'll all be doing it electronically anyway.' We have to ask ourselves some serious questions. I do not really care whether the Treasurer (Mr Costello) was bested by the state premiers or he believes he bested them. I think that is irrelevant and, apart from that, the ego of the Treasurer is such that he will never concede the argument anyway. It is important, however, that one look at the cutback in services in every state. In my own electorate, one has only to go to the Alfred Hospital to see the cutback in services there and the problems that are facing our health system. Our public transport system is such that if you are getting on a train you need a pretty tight bladder these days because the toilets are closed. Not many families will now allow their daughters to travel on public transport, particularly train services, late at night. Frankly, that is a position which should not be accepted by anybody in a parliamentary institution who realises that there are people who need those services. Equally, at a time when our universities ought to be gearing and planning for a fresh intake of young Australians, what has happened? There is not one university in Victoria and, I suspect, every other state, where there are not meetings every day of academic staff to talk not about teaching or intakes but about survival. We cannot continue with a situation where the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) can contemplate a level of cuts and we are then told that universities need not plan. If what is being proposed-and one can only speculate at this stage-by the minister for education takes root, then you are taking our tertiary system, and the capacity of younger people from poorer families to enter tertiary institutions, back to pre-1948. There are many people in this House, there are many people now holding leading positions in Australian society, for no other reason than the fact that the Chifley government in 1948 brought in a scholarship system which opened up our tertiary institutions. There are people in this parliament who are beneficiaries of that. We simply cannot turn our backs on that situation and say that we hope the minister for education will get it right. It is the same with unemployment. We still have a high rate of unemployment. I believe there is a genuine concern and commitment on the part of all members on both sides of the House that it must be brought down. But you do not bring it down by cutting existing services which are working, and working well. In my electorate-and, I suspect, in many other electorates-there are structures which are training younger people and getting them jobs or training them to run small businesses. But the people running those services with very high success rates are now putting everything on hold because they do not know what their funding is going to be. We have to ask ourselves: is this an effective level of management? I am deeply concerned about a view that seems to be emanating from members of the opposition whereby they see an attack on the trade union movement as solving all of Australia's problems. We have seen that development in Great Britain under the Thatcher government, where they confronted an entirely hostile trade union movement. I have heard the argument, and I accept it, that many trade unionists would have voted against the re-election of the Keating government. Many unions and many unionists were unhappy about the responsible leadership which tied the trade union movement into an accord. We had a period of industrial peace. Union members found that their entitlements were restricted while they saw company profits going through the roof. The trade union movement has been the subject of unreasoned attack in this House. Nobody will argue that the trade union movement or business corporations are perfect; they are not. We know, for example, that in my electorate, and in every metropolitan electorate in Melbourne that has any industrial base, the Clothing Trade Union, due to lack of resources, has never been able to deal effectively with the problems of backyard and illegal outwork. There are migrant women being grossly exploited and underpaid by private contractors who then take the garment and compete with legitimate small businessmen running properly based manufacturing industry. They are having to compete with these backyarders. That is not just a problem for the trade union movement; that is a problem for government. Do we believe that there is social progress involved in that gross exploitation of women and children? Equally, I find it extraordinary that while there is this emphasis on privatisation, in my own state we are talking about privati sing levels of public administration while the mates of the Premier are given a private monopoly to run a casino. I do not have any problem with casinos per se. Personally, I would like to see two or three smaller, boutique style casinos like you see in Europe. I would have no problem with them also being in Mildura, Bendigo or Ballarat. But I find it extraordinary that, without any kind of research into its social impact, we have this ever increasing structure which has a private monopoly. So it is monopolies for mates on the one hand but privatisation of public assets on the other. I find that very difficult to understand from a state administration which says, 'We believe in competition and we believe in private enterprise.' I think it is time that we talked about this because Australia is part of a capitalist system. I do not think that is going to change. So is America and so is Japan. Each of those systems is constrained in many ways by their culture and religious tradition. (Time expired)",13
7,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! Before I call the honourable member for Petrie, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech and I ask the House to extend to her the usual courtesies.",16
8,Ms GAMBARO,Unknown," Mr Speaker, may I extend to you and to your deputies my congratulations on your election to the most esteemed position in this parliament. To take a first step in the Commonwealth parliament is one of inspiration and, faced with the daunting size and magnitude of the occasion, and with the support of the people of Petrie, family and friends, I stand here determined and prepared for whatever challenges might lie ahead. I take my seat in this chamber with no foreseen expectations. I have the strong belief in the mandate to be a true representative and to give clear voice in the decision making of this country. My first speech marks more than one achievement. I am the first female to represent the seat of Petrie, the first female of Australian-Italian origin to take a seat in the House, and it is indeed a privilege to take a seat in the first Howard government. I wish to take this opportunity to thank those from all walks of life who have been important in my journey to this present position. In particular, I wish to make mention of the contributions by the Liberal Party team, at both a state and a federal level, and the tireless efforts of my campaign director, BiII Lunney. His dedication and persistence in achieving the goal of success at the federal election were enormous contributions to ensuring my seat here today. I wish also to thank Terry Barlow for his support and years of dedication and service and his wife Lois for the hundreds of cups of tea she made. I wish to thank Anne Hobbs, who joined me in door knocking the electorate, and Geoff Green, who kept my finances in order throughout the campaign. Thank you also to branch members across the electorate for their tremendous efforts and support. I wish to thank the many people in the local business community who supported me, particularly Ralph De Pasquale, Hank and Mary Van Lieshout, Kevin Driscoll and Bob Turner. I wish to acknowledge the support and assistance given to me by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard); the Treasurer (Mr Costello); and my mentor, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron). Many thanks also to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop), the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), Senator Macdonald and Senator MACGIBBON, as well as local state member John Goss. Thank you also to the state Minister for Training and Industrial Relations, the Hon. Santo Santoro, for his assistance, guidance and fundraising assistance, and to the former state member for Redcliffe, Terry White. It would be remiss of me not to make particular mention of the contribution and guidance of a former representative of the people of Petrie, the Hon. John Hodges, and his wonderful wife, Margaret. He is a man of true integrity and a gentleman. He held the seat of Petrie from 1974 to 1983 and from 1984 to 1987. He was the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and made a signifiPetrie cant contribution to the House during his time in parliament. The seat of Petrie stretches from the Moreton Bay shaped edges of Deception Bay and the Redcliffe Peninsula in the north to the residential suburbs of Chermside, Carseldine and MCDowall in the south. The electorate includes some of the fastest growing regions in south-east Queensland-namely, Fitzgibbon, Deception Bay and, more recently, Mango Hill. The Petrie electorate is dominated by social and industrial issues. There is reliance on the efficiency of social security, support for local small business and an emphasis on cost effective transport corridors and education. The electorate includes Queensland's major specialist cardio-thoracic hospital, Prince Charles Hospital, which services Queensland, New South Wales, Northern Territory, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Rim. The hospital houses Queensland's only heart transplant unit, which has performed some 129 operations since 1990. Local government issues and agendas are high in the Petrie electorate and four councils feature-Brisbane city, Redcliffe city, Pine Rivers shire and the Caboolture shire. All four are extremely active with development plans and growth management. The importance of local council contributions to the community can never be underestimated and the services that they provide should always be supported. The city of Redcliffe, on a peninsula of just 35 square kilometres, supports a thriving fishing industry and a variety of light industry and is a favourite spot for picnics and weekend angling. The fishing industry is important to the local area with Moreton Bay being the feeding ground for sand and mud crabs, fish and prawns. The fact that one of the largest expenditures for the industry is fuel, oil and gas ensures my particular interest in the diesel fuel rebate scheme and its impact. It must be remembered that it is not just farmers who are affected by rain. The fishing industry is also reliant on rain, and seasonal conditions can determine a year's economic stability. However, the fishing industry in cannot just be classified under the banner of catching and trawling. It covers a wide chain of economic activity, encompassing processing, transporting, wholesaling and retailing. The planning of transport infrastructure is important to the continued development of the local area and, in particular, public transport facilities and services. Pine Rivers is another shire on the move and it adjoins the electorate of the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith). The population of the shire has increased dramatically and, a according to the shire's annual report, building applications worth $184.5 million were processed last financial year. Caboolture shire, as the member for Longman (Mr Brough) would be aware, is growing and considering all options to provide cultural, recreation and social services to residents. A decision to build a community recreation centre at Deception Bay was finalised only last week, giving residents of the area a focus for both recreational and social pursuits. The seat of Petrie was named after builder and architect Andrew Petrie. An achiever, Petrie has the distinction of being the first white man to climb Mount Beerwah, one of the Glasshouse Mountains in the Sunshine Coast hinterland. On his death in 1872 he left an enormous legacy. His eldest son, John, became the first lord mayor of Brisbane and his second son, Thomas, studied Aboriginal tribes, their customs and languages. It is with Andrew Petrie that I feel I can draw some similarity. I spent my formative years living in Petrie Terrace and went to school at All Hallows', which houses the historical building of Adderton built by Andrew and John Petrie in the 1850s. The Petries then went on to play a significant role in the construction of Queensland's Parliament House, the general post office and the port office building. My association with Petrie flows through my childhood, my schooling years and now will continue throughout my political life. The spirit of Petrie lives on. As I looked back into the history of Italians in this country, I found their contributions were significant in Australia's development. After 1947, the demographic pressures in Italy, the industrial expansion of Australia and the restrictive immigration policies adopted by the United States favoured mass immigration to Australia. Within the next 20 years the Australian-Italian community became the second largest community, after the British, in Australia. A common element to which I can relate is the strong social and cultural within the Italian community. The focus on the family is strong, and support and guidance forever lasting. I come to this parliament with a community and business background, having worked extensively in the retail, tourism, personnel and franchising industries. The road to this House was never an easy one and I had to weigh up my business commitments and my work as a tutor in the marketing department of the Queensland University of Technology. I wish to thank my academic colleagues. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at QUT. I would like to make mention of Cathy Neal, Nancy Fredericks, Dr Chad Perry, Su Mon Wong, Catherine Rankin, Evan Price, Max Briggs, Dr Jim Kable, an academic mentor from way back, and all the wonderful staff in the marketing department. Thank you for your support and your encouragement over a very long-16-month-campaign. I was delighted to achieve a swing of 12.59 per cent in Petrie. Su Mon Wong, your words stay with me always: marketing is giving people what they want. The reason the coalition won by such an overwhelming majority is that we listened to people and their needs and we gave Australians what they wanted. As social analyst Hugh Mackay has said, people are more likely to listen to us if we listen to them. During a recent visit to Humpybong state primary school children of ages eight to 12 told me their view of politicians. Two significant responses from these valuable members of our community were that politicians argue and call each other names. Children can be very brutally honest and first impressions can taint you for life. I applaud this government's move to bring honour and dignity back to the parliamentary stage. It is pleasing to see so many females on this side of the chamber and, in essence, to see the influx of females standing for federal parliament. Currently over 78 per cent of the females in this parliament belong to the coalition. I am proud to be one of the new women in parliament and hope to realise the expectations and ideals which have been placed upon us. I believe Australia will one life day have a female Prime Minister. The support and role of responsibilities given to women and members will ensure that this 'one day' will be a reality. During the past 15 years of my working life I have come to realise that as we go through various stages of our life cycle our work needs change. A more flexible workplace is what is needed, job sharing and more worker friendly practices. My time in the personnel industry showed me the huge demand for good quality part-time work. Whenever we advertised these positions our phone would run hot and the mailman would deliver our mail not by hand but by the bagful. This is one of the reasons why women are setting up business at three times the rate of men. Flexibility and control of one's environment are what real quality of life is all about. I welcome the new workplace reforms and their effects on the flexibility of the work system. The award system under the workplace reforms can only benefit employers and employees. If Australia modernises its industrial environment, the rights of women in the workplace must be protected. Businesses have much to gain from introducing work practices that reflect the family needs of employees. Some benefits automatically include increased productivity, increased work morale, retention of high quality staff, reduction in staff turnover and absenteeism, reduction in stress and a more harmonious workplace. I wish to acknowledge the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) for his contribution in the area of work and technological change. In his book Sleepers, Wake! he says: The Western world is passing through a period of technological change, more far-reaching-and much faster-than at any other time. He then goes on to say: Many people feel reluctant to face up to the issues and would prefer to put off thinking about them, the hope that either the problems will go away or prove to be exaggerated, or someone else might solve them. There is a bias today towards the expansion of information systems rather than engineering and related skills. Australian management needs to be more outward looking if we are to embrace this technology and increase our competitiveness overseas. Businesses must carefully consider the concept of combining recruitment and placement of permanent and part-time employees with outsourcing for productivity and performance enhancement. During the election campaign I made a significant effort to visit the small business sector in the Petrie electorate. In the months leading up to the election I visited some 2,000 small businesses in Aspley, MCDowall, Bracken Ridge, Redcliffe, Deception Bay and Rothwell. I listened to their concerns and the hardships they face. Small business is the heart and soul of many families. It is a livelihood, an employment mecca and a strong branch of the community. The areas of concern are nothing newlabour on-costs, the strength of big business, bureaucratic red tape, government intervention and an employer unfriendly industrial relations environment, especially the unfair dismissal clauses. These have caused hardship not only to the businesses and the people of Petrie but throughout Australia. Many of these areas of concern were once again highlighted in the Yellow Pages small business index report. It is a fact that small business owners are lacking the confidence and encouragement to employ new staff, especially young people. Instead they are either cutting staff and operating hours or working longer hours themselves. Small business, as the nucleus of the Australian economy, is the single greatest generating source of jobs and opportunities in our economy. We must reward business owners and operators for their hard work, not punish them. The double digit figure of unemployed people between the ages of 15 and 19 Ii ving in the electorate is a further source of concern to me. Father John MCKeown, a Catholic in priest in Redcliffe City and a broadcaster on a metropolitan radio station, has stated that employment is one of the key components that make a city livable. We must not forget our youth, their dreams, their ambitions and their self-esteem. Bert Weir, a personal friend and teacher of mental strength to the staff of businesses and government organisations all over Australia, in his book What happened?, said: Kindness, generosity, ability to cooperate, inquisitiveness, confidence, sense of humour, creativity and calmness are only some of the ... important qualities of human worth. How often are these praised? For a child to have a strong, balanced sense of self-esteem, it must be anchored in many different aspects of human beauty and worth. One must not forget our more senior citizens. Australia is an ageing population. It is estimated that the average number of people aged 65 and older will grow at twice the rate of the total population from now until 2011 and three times this rate thereafter. With an ageing population Australia faces a major challenge now and in the years to come. Mr Deputy Speaker, I had the pleasure of meeting a wonderful psychologist and philosopher recently, Dr Hilda des Artes. We discussed the housing of the aged. She spoke of a wonderful vision where single people, families and the aged could live in harmony. Young people could balance intellectual expansion with the experiences of the older members. Her vision was not to isolate people but to resurrect community based values on the extended family concept, therefore ensuring that the experience and memories of the elders are appreciated. As a government I believe we need to market ourselves. A lack of information can cause problems. The technology is available to inform and educate constituents, and we must continue to utilise these options. By being steadfast in its approach, I am sure this government will provide for the demand of services required for the people of Petrie. Mr Deputy Speaker, I come from a working background. My grandfather, Giovanbaptista Gambaro, at 17 years of age, in 1905, worked in the Pennsylvanian coal mines. It was hard, arduous work digging coal by shovel. In 1915 war started, and he returned to Italy and joined the Italian army voluntarily. While a soldier of the allied forces, he was captured, became a prisoner of war and was put to work in a sugar factory in Czechoslovakia for four years. This was the first time he was to be a prisoner of war. Meanwhile, back in Italy, my grandmother ran a tobacconist shop and raised six children. In 1938 Giovanbaptista came to Australia and worked in North Queensland managing a farm. Sadly, with the arrival of 1940, he was to experience his second stint as a prisoner war when he was transported to South Australia as a civilian POW. He spent four years as a prisoner of the Australian government. Mr Deputy Speaker, this was an unnecessary and regrettable period in Australia's history. My father, Dominic, arrived in Australia in 1944. Working in North Queensland, he raised the money to buy a retail fish store in Petrie Terrace where he worked with my grandfather. In 1950 my grandmother and my Uncle Michael came to Australia and also worked in the business. My family'S business is now one of Australia's best known seafood restaurants. We have a thriving wholesale business and seafood processing facility and export plant, and we export to Asia and the United States. I wish to thank my parents, Dominic and Rosetta, for exposing me to the wonderful experiences of my youth. As a student they encouraged me to work in the business and, as I peered over my economics books, I observed the rich spectacle and the passing parade of clients in the restaurant. They came from all walks of life and from all countries to dine on Queensland's finest seafood. I thank my parents for all they have taught me-my father, Dominic, for his determination, single-mindedness, perseverance and, that dare I say it, relentlessness. Many of his qualities have been passed on to me, though at times he probably wished they had not. Thank you for your love and support during my campaign. My mother has been the driving force in my life. Not only did she raise four children but also she worked seven days a week for many years to ensure that we had economic stability. Her kindness to others is legendary. I am proud to be the daughter of Rosetta Gambaro and will admire her always. The love and kindness she gives to others will live on forever. To my brother John: thank you for the wonderful letterbox delivery and folding skills. I wish you success in your further career path and admire you for the courage of your convictions. My sister Elisa, the philosopher and intellectual of the family and her of husband Glen: thank you for the encouragement and strength you gave me during the campaign. My baby sister Ida and Robert: welcome home, we missed you. But Robert, the space program is far richer for your research and work in Germany over the past three years. Ida, I have missed your black and white approach to life. To my own family: thank you, Chris, for your assistance. To my children, Rachelle and Benjamin: you are the most precious things in my life; thank you for the joy you bring to me each day. My two children have influenced my life, and I intend to make a contribution which will lay the foundation for their future lives in this country. I also wish to acknowledge Ugo Sirianni and Josie and the whole Sirianni family for encouraging me to go into politics. Your strength and faith in me never faltered. Michael and Josie Gambaro and family: thank you for your support. To all my friends and fellow Rotarians, many of whom are listening: thank you for your help and involvement in my life and my campaign. When I look at my journey to here and the steps to come, the words of Robert Frost in his poem The Road Not Taken inspire me greatly. With your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will read it in part: Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and II took the one less travelled by, And that has made all the difference. I take my seat in this parliament at a time of tremendous opportunity, and I thank the people of Petrie for giving me the opportunity.",16
9,Mr HOLLIS,Unknown,"At the outset, let me congratulate the honourable member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro) on her fine first speech in this parliament. Indeed, may I congratulate the many others who have already made first speeches and those who will be making first speeches. They have been very interesting first speeches and of a very high quality on both sides. I only hope that the enthusiasm and idealistic views those new members have brought into this parliament will be maintained and stay with them during the years they are here, as that enthusiasm and vigour sometimes dim a little after you have been here a few years. The Australian Labor Party lost the 2 March election for a number of reasons, not the least because of its time factor but more significantly because the new government made many promises and commitments that it knows it cannot fulfil. In that election the candidates for the conservative parties had a dream run: they could promise anything and ask the people to take them on trust. Candidates like me, members of the then governing party-indeed, a party that had been in government for 13 years-had to defend constantly the previous government's policies. Some of us must have got it right. I was one of the few on this side who actually had a swing towards me; in fact, my primary vote increased. Let me give you a couple of examples. For example, the current member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash) spent much of her campaigning on New South Wales government issues, not least on roads and on the question of the Minnamurra bends. The member for Gilmore, who I see is in the chamber, also made comments saying that youth unemployment would not be tolerated. Yet the policies of this current government, of which she is a member, will not reduce unemployment generally. I suggest that the Minnamurra bends will be just as congested in three years time as they are today. I also make the point that had the truth been told about the plans for Holsworthy airport Robert Tickner would still be the member for Hughes. The expectations the Australian people have for the Australian Labor Party always amaze me. Whatever the interest group is, they always expect the world from the Australian Labor Party, but they expect nothing from the conservatives. Australians always raise the high bar with the Australian Labor Party but never with the conservatives. The conservation movement is a good example. I will defend the Australian Labor Party's stand on the conservation issue. With the conservation movement it always seems to me that they ask the conservatives for nothing because they know that they will get nothing from the conservatives. When they get nothing, consequently they are not disappointed. With the Labor Party, when they expect the world or 100 per cent and we deliver 90 per cent of their perceived expectation, they tum on us with the vengeance of a spumed lover for not delivering the next 10 per cent of often unrealistic expectations. Contrast this with the conservatives. The interest groups expect nothing from them, ask them for nothing and seem not to be disappointed when they receive nothing. From Labor they want the 100 per cent bargain and when they receive 90 per cent, they decide to punish us, even if in doing so they punish themselves. Many punished themselves by their vote during the last election. Some are now starting to realise this. In my speech some time ago addressing the Supply Bill, I gave a gentle but legitimate touch-up to the Wollongong University branch of the National Tertiary Education Union and particularly its untrustworthy or treacherous president, Michael Morrissey, for punishing themselves. Because of the cuts of this government to the University of Wollongong, the Illawarra region is going to lose million. The universities around the country are screaming because of the hurt that is being inflicted on them. Yet many of these universities and the academics campaigned against the Australian Labor Party. They campaigned for the government that is now in power. I will support the blue-collar workers in the universities and the universities in general, but I find it awfully hard to get enthusiastic for some of the academics when in the Illawarra they campaigned against the Labor Party. They doorknocked the seat of Gilmore; they letterboxed it and the seat of Hughes. They took as in the Illawarra Mercury-'Put Labor last'. I have had enough with the universities. I have a different target today. It is the Dapto Medicare Action Committee. During the campaign, the Liberal candidate for Throsby, one Dr Albert Galea of chicken fame, landed himself in my electorate like a breeze or a chicken from Sydney to announce in one day's campaigning in Throsby for the entire election that he would deliver a Medicare office to Dapto. This was the only commitment the Liberal candidate for Throsby gave during the entire election campaign. Dr Galea spent one day during a month-long campaign in my electorate, travelling from Sydney, to deliver one sole promise. This illustrates my point about expectations from Labor and the conservatives. The campaign to establish a Medicare office in Dapto has been around for many years. There has been, and still is, considerable support within the Dapto community to establish a Medicare office. The campaign was mounted by the Dapto Senior Citizens and support has been expressed by numerous Dapto community groups and individuals and through meetings which have taken place with me. I gave my total support to this campaign from the beginning. I attended and arranged meetings with officials from the Health Insurance Commission; I arranged for deputations from the Dapto Medicare Action Committee to call on the ministers responsible for health in the previous government. I made numerous representations seeking information $50 to advance a campaign and offered my office facilities to the committee to produce and distribute pamphlets, petitions, leaflets and letters. On 28 November last year, a journalist from the Illawarra Mercury contacted me in Canberra and said he had just met with the Dapto Medicare Action Committee, who had accused me of betraying their campaign. The article said: The Dapto Medicare Action Committee, which has been striving for more than two years to have a Medicare Office re-opened in Dapto, said yesterday it was upset with a statement Mr Hollis made on WIN TV at the end of a public meeting last week. The Federal Member for Throsby said that should Dapto get a Medicare Office, there would be four Medicare Offices in close proximity; other offices are in Wollongong, Warrawong and Shellharbour. The DMAC has interpreted Mr Hollis' comments as a suggestion that he did not support the group's goals ... The three committee members did not even bother to check with me what I said on WIN TV following the public meeting. They took their interpretation and their remarks straight to the Illawarra Mercury, which gave them a cheap headline and a photograph in the newspaper, but did absolutely zero for their goal. I have three volumes of files in my office, which I invite people to examine for themselves, so they can draw their own conclusions as to my efforts and my support to establish a Medicare office. I have no doubt that the three committee members who were so critical of me were part of the 18 per cent of the voters in Throsby who did not vote for me when they went into the polling booth in Dapto to cast their vote for the Liberal candidate for Throsby in the vain hope that a Medicare office would be established. The people of Dapto were lied to by the Liberal candidate for Throsby during the last election. The Liberals had no intention of establishing a Medicare office in Dapto. I can see the huddle now on the footpath outside the Dapto Post Office: the Liberal candidate and his campaign strategists, on the only day of a fleeting visit to the electorate, thinking up a promise to gamer some votes for the Liberal Party. While people can be critical of me and my stand on some issues, one accusation that can never be made against me is that I lied to the people in Throsby. I have never promised something I could not deliver. I have always supported a cause. I have always explained the difficulties. But I have never lied. In my 13 years as a member of parliament I have been involved in many campaigns, but none have been distorted or my role so wilfully misreported as in the case of the Dapto Medicare office establishment. As I have said, Dapto needs a Medicare office, mainly because of the extensive population growth which is being experienced in new residential developments like the Horsley Estate at west Dapto. I have always seen this as the key to the establishment of a Medicare office. With the election of the conservatives to office and their demonstrated need to take the axe to the public sector, not only will Dapto not get a Medicare office but I have seen documents which indicate that one of the existing four Medicare offices in the Illawarra is earmarked for closure. I suggest that it be the Shellharbour office. Under this new government, the people of Australia will face a tidal wave of public sector cuts. Every department and agency will have a date with the axe. The Illawarra, as usual, has been the first region to cop these cuts in the neck. So much for the claims of the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) that, as the only Illawarra based member on the federal government, he would pay close attention to the region. He is paying close attention; the kind of attention he gave the region when he was the Premier of New South Wales. While Premier he was tagged 'closed shop John', as he gutted the New South Wales public sector, particularly the Department of Community Services. As finance minister, he is living up to the tag in his latest reincarnation. The closure of the Shellharbour Medicare office, the Wollongong office of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the closure of the Family Court facilities in the Illawarra and the customs services at Port Kembla are the first of many instalments. The conservatives do not have a mandate to attack the public sector in the Illawarra. The community, trade unions, public sector organisations and Labor politicians will fight every move to close these important service delivery agencies. We will all be involved in any community, political and industrial campaign to ensure that these decisions are reversed and these important services retained. I have already had meetings with representatives from the Illawarra Migrant Resource Centre, the Illawarra Ethnic Communities Council, the South Coast Labour Council, the Community and Public Sector Union, and ethnic communities based in the Illawarra to discuss the planned cuts. In regard to the closure of the office of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the people of the Illawarra are going to be particularly disadvantaged. I contact the office frequently-on average, four or five times a week-regarding a range of issues, most of them of an extremely complex and involved nature. It is almost unbelievable that this government could even think about closing this will immigration office in Wollongong, one of the most ethnically diverse centres of Australia. Now, instead of going into Burelli Street in Wollongong, people will have to make a trip of 80 kilometres into Rockdale in Sydney to do all their dealings with this office. The announcement shows the distain that the coalition government has for ethnic Australia. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is rapidly acquiring the title of the fastest promise breaker in Australian political history, which will no doubt earn him a special entry into the Guinness Book of Records. So much for the Honest John image! The question has to be asked at one stage or another: how much more of this can Australians take? How much more can be cut? How much more can be downsized? How many more people can we add to the unemployment queues? How much more can be done with less? How many more advisers and commentators do we have to listen to whose only contribution is made up of three words: cut, cut, cut? The government has a counting paperclip mentality. It has this need to be seen imitating Thatcher's Britain or Gingrich's United States. Labor left the economy in good shape. We are in the fourth year of continual economic growth. The indicators all point to healthy economic conditions. The share market is at record level, consumer confidence is up, we have a broken drought, community prices are at a high, company profits are up 7.7 per cent in the latest quarter, and inflation remains slow. Australia already has a small public sector by international standards. Only Japan and the United States spend less on their own public sectors. Australia is already the third lowest taxed major industrialised country in the world. The public sector is already efficient and productive. There is no fat left to trim from the bone. The government, with these substantial cuts, will be cutting into the muscle which holds the public sector together. This week the government is debating the industrial relations legislation package. Although the standing orders prevent me from addressing some of these provisions, I do want to make some comments about the trade union movement. It has always been fashionable to blindly attack the Australian trade union movement and blame workers for every real or imagined industrial relations problem. It has always been very easy and sometimes very convenient to make unions into scapegoats. Frequently such attacks are without foundation, they ignore the reality of the situation and present one view of a conflict. I do not claim that in each and every dispute the union is always right but certainly, contrary to the view which the government holds, the trade union movement, especially in the Illawarra, is largely made up of responsible members and officials who care about not only their wages and conditions but also the state of the economy and the well-being of all Australians, particularly the disadvantaged and the battlers. The trade union movement in the Illawarra, under the leadership of the South Coast Labour Council, has had a long tradition of being active in a whole range of worker related issues that extend well beyond the customary role of seeking better wages and conditions. It is most certainly my experience in the Illawarra region, given my close working relationship with the trade union movement, that the officials and members are prepared to negotiate before considering industrial action. They see strike action as a last resort to be used only when all other courses of action have been exhausted. The unions in the Illawarra have been credited with taking a leadership role in initiatives to seek the development of structures and approaches which, on the one hand, will facilitate better working and management communications and shared decision making and, on the other hand, reduce industrial disputation. However, they are certainly not prepared to sacrifice hard won wages and conditions without getting some tangible results. The Illawarra has a strong tradition of workers standing up for their rights. It is only the most prejudiced people who cannot or will not distinguish between what they see as pigheadedness and legitimate trade union militancy. The history of the trade union struggle is one of a long and hard fight to achieve the wages and conditions which Australian workers enjoy today. However, the Illawarra unions understand that the price of maintaining decent wages and conditions is that one must be eternally vigilant. Illawarra unionists have changed with the times. They have recognised that we live in different economic circumstances than in the boom of the fifties and the sixties. They know that they have to respond to changing conditions and, in fact, they have led that change. The labour movement in my area leads the community. We have the best interests of our region and the people in it at heart at all times. Those of us who have a background in the trade union movement will not stand back and see this government's ideological agenda simply slip into place. We will be legitimately militant with no apology-no apology at all. Some in the community, in order to punish Labor, have now set themselves up to be punished. But, as usual, the political and industrial wings of the labour movement will once again meet the expectations always placed on us to ensure that they are not left behind. At the beginning of my speech I paid sincere compliments to the many people who are making their first speeches. One element comes across constantly, though, and that is the bogey of the trade union movement. Not everyone in the Illawarra is a member of a trade union, but people often come to me and say that they have been sacked. Two young people have been sacked from a company called Death by Chocolate. UFI Pools have gone into bankruptcy. There are a lot of situations where workers are sacked or stood down and do not get their conditions. Two weeks ago I had the case of a boatbuilder who came in and told me that he had not been paid for six months. I said, 'What does your union say?' 'No, we're not members of the union,' he said. No-one realises the importance of the trade union movement until they need it. We hear about compulsory unionism. We hear all these things about unionism. That is fine if the bosses are the understanding, advanced people that so many on the other side think they are. But, unfortunately, my experience over many years-not only in the trade union movement but also in this parliament-indicates to me that the bosses are not like this. People do not realise just how important the trade union movement and their membership of a trade union is until they need it, and then it is often too late. It would be wonderful if the bosses were as caring and concerned for the well-being of their workers as some on the other side indicate. It always seems to me that the only thing the boss ever cares about is the bulge in his pocket. That bulge may be responsible for many things, but it is usually the money that he is making by putting harsh conditions on the workers. I congratulate again the many new members on both sides of this chamber for the fine speeches many of them have made.",21
10,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Jenkins)Order! Before I call the honourable member for Macquarie, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech and I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.",25
11,Mr BARTLETT,Unknown,"Many times over the years I have sat in these galleries and watched with fascination the proceedings of this House but, until quite recently, not ever really thinking that I would stand here. To have the opportunity of representing my community in the parliament of this country is a rare privilege and one for which I am very grateful. Over the past few weeks some 38 new members have risen to deliver their maiden speeches. I would like to begin by acknowledging the quality of so many of these members on both sides of the House. In their first offerings, many have enthusiastically sung the praises of their own electorates-a perfectly understandable sentiment-but, with respect, I say to the honourable members that until you visit Macquarie you have not seen anything! For the uninitiated, a brief geography lesson. Macquarie covers about 4,000 square kilometres extending north-south in a band about an hour's drive west of Sydney. It covers some of the most breathtaking scenery in the country: the rugged and spectacular Blue Mountains, including the Three Sisters, the Jamison and Megalong Valleys and the untouched Wollemi, Kanangra-Boyd and Blue Mountains national parks-some of which I soon hope to see achieve world heritage listing. It includes the mighty and majestic Hawkesbury River with its fertile flood plains, and it includes the tranquil beauty of the Kurrajong Hills and the spectacular Grose Valley and Colo River. Not only is Macquarie abundantly endowed with physical beauty, not only is it a unique tourist attraction, but also it is an area steeped in history. The region was settled initially by several indigenous tribes, particularly the Gundungurra and other Dharug speakers. More recently, European history in the region dates back almost to the First Fleet. The Hawkesbury was settled from 1794, and the towns of Richmond, Wilberforce, Windsor, Pitt Town and Castlereagh were selected in 1810 by Governor Lachlan Macquarie. In the Blue Mountains, the trailblazing exploits in 1813 by Blaxland, Lawson and Wentworth across the Blue Mountains have left their mark on the string of settlements which basically follow the route trod by those early pioneers. I would like to focus briefly on three of the most significant political figures associated with the area I represent because I feel that each of them has something to teach us. The first is Governor Lachlan Macquarieobviously from a time well before the seat was created but the one from whom it derives its name. Macquarie, whose epitaph calls him the 'Father of Australia', was a man of vision, determined to push the frontiers and extend our horizons. His establishment of new towns, his commissioning of the crossing of the Blue Mountains and his encouragement of early exploration all mark him as someone who was not willing to accept the status quo. But he was also a pragmatist. His energetic program of public works and development of infrastructure, his concerns to tackle Sydney's water pollution problems and his determination to use the Hawkesbury Valley to supply Sydney's agricultural needs all show his practical and down-to-earth approach to government. Macquarie was also a humanitarian. His establishment of public schools, his attempts to lift the moral standards of society in order to protect family life, his attempts at humanitarian reconciliation with the indigenous people and his well-known program of emancipation all point to a man committed to social justice. In fact, his obituary in the gazette of the time said of him rather succinctly: 'To serve mankind was his delight.' A challenge for any of us in public life. The second key figure whose link with the electorate is perhaps not so well known is Sir Henry Parkes. Parkes, the 'Father of Federation', at times lived in the Blue Mountains and, in fact, lies buried there in a grave at Faulconbridge-a town named after his mother's family name. In fact, earlier this year we commemorated at Faulcon bridge the centenary of his death. The message from Sir Henry Parkes is, to use his own words, 'The crimson thread of kinship runs through us all.' In his battle to bring together six separate struggling colonies into one great nation, Parkes concentrated on the things that unite us rather than the things that divide us. He was driven by the vision of nationhood that can be achieved only when we allow our differences to be swallowed up in the things that we share. The challenge here for us is to put aside our differences of background, race, religion and ideology, and focus on our common aspirations and the good of those we represent. The third great figure of history associated with the electorate of Macquarie is the former Prime Minister Ben Chifley who held the seat from 1928 to 1931 and then from 1940 until his death in 1951. What Ben Chifley brought to Australia was a determination to rebuild the country after the devastation of war. It involved a commitment to providing a reasonable standard of living for all. In his view, this required sound economic management and the eradication of unemployment. He rightly saw employment not only as a necessary ingredient for economic well-being but also as a vital component in an individual's self-respect. These issues, I believe, are still paramount if we are to achieve economic and social justice in this country. I would like to tum briefly to more recent history, as recent in fact as 2 March this year. Like so many of the new members, I stand in this parliament because of the events on that day or, more accurately, because of a string of forces leading up to and culminating at the ballot box on 2 March. In my electorate of Macquarie over 4,600 voters changed their minds since the previous election. The obvious questions are: who and why? If I knew who, I would shake each of their hands individually. They are questions, however, worth pursuing, not for the sake of raking over the coals or rubbing in the salt, as tempting as that might be, but because it enables us to focus better on the needs of those we serve. It is possible that those voters included some of the 3,500 registered unemployed in the electorate, many of whom had been out of work for over a year or the thousands more hidden unemployed, people tired of endless training programs, job queues and frustrated hopes. It probably included some of the hundreds of low income earners I met during the campaign who felt cheated by the fact that they worked 40 or 50 hours a week and, after doing so, were no better off than others they knew on welfare. It possibly included some of the 13,500 home buyers in the electorate worried about the mortgages hanging over their heads and battling the effects of the previous government's high interest rate policy. Perhaps it included some of the 3,000 defence personnel at RAAF Base Richmond who were disillusioned and demoralised at the ongoing battering and neglect of Australia's defence forces, or some of the hundreds of independent retirees throughout the electorate incensed at the discrimination they feel at being penalised rather than rewarded for having saved for their own retirement. Perhaps it included many of the frail aged and their families despairing at the severe shortage of nursing home beds in the electorate, a mere 877, with virtually every nursing home having an enormous unmet waiting list. It probably included most of the 4,000-odd small businesses in the electorate sick of being slugged every time they turn around, fed up with the endless pile of paperwork, red tape, taxes and the ultimate humiliation of Labor's ridiculous unfair dismissal laws-and then being told, 'This is as good as it gets.' It probably included many friends of the environment appalled at the degradation of the Blue Mountains streams and the Hawkesbury-Nepean river system, and wanting to see action. I daresay it included ordinary men and women from all sections of the community concerned at the direction of the country, sick of paying rising taxes to see no real benefit, sick of playing second fiddle to sectional interests, alarmed at the decline of our health system, confused over what seemed to be anti-family policies and anxious about the growing legacy of debt left to our children. There are no doubt many other reasons as well. The fact that over 4,500 Macquarie voters changed is the reason I am here today and the fact that over half a million voters nationwide did the same thing is the reason I stand on this side of the House with so many finc colleagues. Yet this places an enormous responsibility on the government and brings with it some great challenges. The first challenge is the need to restore responsible economic management. The headin-the-sand approach of the previous government, graduates from the ostrich school of economics, has been a disaster that has left us with a net foreign debt which increased from $23 billion to $180 billion in the last 13 years and total net foreign liabilities of $270 billion, involving the sale of many of our national icons; a current account deficit dangerously close to six per cent of GDP; and Commonwealth public sector debt which has blown out from $32 billion to $97 billion in the last five years-up from 10 per cent of GDP to 20 per cent of GDP in that time. Real interest rates are amongst the highest in the industrialised world and unemployment is stuck at around 8.5 per cent of GDP, with youth unemployment at a tragic 27 per cent. Possibly there are up to another million hidden unemployed or underemployed who have either given up looking for work or have settled for part-time work. We have a GDP per capita which has fallen from 10th in the world in 1983 to 22nd now, with increasing inequality in income distribution and increasing levels of poverty in this country. Tackling these issues demands enormous vision and commitment. Amongst other things it requires policies to lift the level of national savings. In addition to correcting the public sector savings problems it also means raising the household savings ratio, which has fallen from seven per cent of GDP to less than one per cent in the last decade. It requires an honest review of our taxation system and an overhaul of the industrial relations system, with a view to providing real labour market flexibility and enhancing productivity, results which I am sure will flow from our recently tabled workplace relations bill. It requires a determination to hasten the pace of microeconomic reform, raise productivity and lift our international competitiveness from its appalling 21 st place in the world. It requires policies designed to promote incentives in country-incentive to work, incentive to invest, incentive to save, incentive to innovate, incentive to take risks and incentives be independent. We must reward those who are willing to have a go. The second challenge is to restore the fundamental place of the family in our combut munity. Strong family units are central to healthy society-central in providing a secure upbringing for our children and a sense worth for our emerging young people, central in fostering patterns of care, love and respect in human relationships, central in providing a place of help and strength in an often hostile world, central in providing a real welfare net in times of material hardship. Sadly, families are under increasing sure-pressure from policies which have often assisted sectional interests and ignored their impact on the family; financial pressures in the form of increased taxes, higher interest rates and unemployment have often been the last straw for struggling families; pressure from the media, which has glorified lifestyles which are destructive to the family unit; and pressures from a range of philosophies which undermine the intrinsic worth of the individwill ual. To counter some of these on impossible, but to start where we can is absolutely crucial. The third challenge for us is to restore public confidence in the political processes this country. Over the past few years, the public have understandably become increaswho ingly cynical, witnesses to a degeneration many of the conventions and practices of government; to declining standards of parlialedge mentary behaviour; to governments which have come to treat the truth as a disposable commodity, trotted out when politically convenient and discarded just as easily; to governments which have treated parliament with contempt; and to governments of arrogance out of touch with the needs and aspirations of ordinary Australians. I believe that we have an enormous responsibility to restore the trust and confidence of the Australian people. The fourth challenge for us is to restore balance. For too long we have seen policy this decisions driven by ideological excess or acquiescence to powerful interest groups. We need to restore balance between idealism and to pragmatism-to be driven by our ideals but to understand that they must work in the real world-balance between equity and efficiency so that we seek a fair distribution of income not in a way that reduces incentive and a productivity and ultimately lowers the living standards of all; balance between dependence of and independence so that our welfare net provides genuine security for those who need it but does not discourage the struggle for self-sufficiency; balance between individualism and community so that our collective commitments flow from individual freedom, not from regulation or coercion; balance between rights and responsibilities so that preswhat we expect from society is more than matched by what we desire to contribute. I am proud to be part of a government which, I am sure, will rise to these challenges, a government which will earnestly tackle our economic problems, a government which will protect and strengthen the family unit, a government which will restore public trust in our political system, and a government which help restore balance in the thrust of forces is nigh government policy. Mr Deputy Speaker, without the help of very many special people, it would not be possible for me to stand here today. I wish to of publicly acknowledge and thank all of those who have helped. I begin by thanking those have made the long trip down here to of support me today, including many friends, supporters and family. I particularly acknowthe mayor of the Blue Mountains, Michael Neall, and his wife, Pauline; the deputy mayor of the Hawkesbury council, Les Sheather; the general manager of Hawkesbury council; and several other councillors from Hawkesbury council. Thank you all-friends, supporters and family-for making this trip today. In all, during the campaign, around 600 helpers contributed to our success. Honourable members will be pleased to hear that I do not intend to mention each one by name. However, please allow me to mention some. I thank, first, the campaign team and other key helpers: Jim Aitken, Jennifer Scott, Chris Vander Kley, Jim Patterson, Randall Walker, Troy Craig, Sean Fannin, Janette Lennox, Quentin Cook, Mike Kouriloff, Bob Stagg, Mal MCEwen, Judy MCDougall, Wal Howard, Fred Thompson, Daniel Miles, Matthew Barnes, Rebecca Mason, Brendan Cooper, Peta Demery, Mark Connell, Nils Kenny and Peter Bardos. A particular thank you to Betty Smith, who put in so much time for so long before the election. Secondly, thank you to several sitting members: Alan Cadman, Andrew Thomson, Senator Bob Woods and the New South Wales state member Peter Debnam. My thanks also go to a number of shadow ministers who visited the electorate before the election. Thirdly, I want to thank my brother and his family and the many friends who gave tremendous encouragement along the way and, in some cases, assisted in spite of their cal leanings. I particularly want to thank my wife, Christine, and our family, Kate, Erin and Tim, for their tremendous patience during a long campaign. Christine's tremendous support and encouragement as well as long summer days spent door-knocking with me were invaluable. I would also like to place on record my gratitude to my parents, long since deceased, who, in spite of having so little, gave so much, who raised us in a secure and loving environment, who gave us every encouragement to achieve to the best of our ability, and who taught by example that people are more important than possessions and that giving is indeed more important than receiving. Lastly, I want to publicly thank God for the opportunity of serving in this place and for the ultimate direction and meaning I believe He gives to our endeavours. None of us knows how long we will be here, but for the time afforded me my pledge is simply this: to represent with energy and determination the people of my electorate of Macquarie and to contribute in whatever way I can to the delivery of sound government.",25
12,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Jenkins)Before I call the honourable member for Blaxland, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech. I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.",29
13,Mr HATTON,Unknown," Mr Deputy Speaker, it is a great honour to be here. For any Australian to represent their nation and to represent a constituent part of it in the House of Representatives is an honour. To follow my predecessor, the former Prime Minister, is a singular honour. To join the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party, which over 13 years returned to this country its future and dragged the country into the modern world, is a special honour. To join my colleagues in the battle to return to office is something I look forward to with great relish. Having set the country up for the future, having modernised the economy in our period in office, having recast social policy with a view to equity and decency, and having made the nation conscious of its identity and politiachievements, Labor can now repair to the task of creatively thinking about and laying down the matrix of our nation's future course. There are things in life that do not change like death and taxes and, well might we say, the conservatives in this country-whether it is the UAP, the Nationalists, the Liberal Party, the Country Party or whatever guise they have taken over the history of Australia. They always have and always will stand for one thing, and that is the principal tenet of their existence: they know what they are against, but they do not know what they are for. They are anti-Labor; they are the non-Labor parties-the bumps on the road to progress which those going places have to overcome. This parliament will no doubt show their best, which from our perspective is their worse. They will let the progress drift; they will seek to return to their past nostrums. They will grind down the verve which the country has got about itself. They will not understand, for to understand they have to be a part of the ethos of Australia. They never have had and never will have that pure understanding. I look forward to being part of this task. I look forward to being able to represent the electors of Blaxland with the same fidelity, purpose and understanding my predecessor demonstrated over 27 years as the second Labor member for Blaxland. I look forward to dealing with the essence of the things that affect all of our lives. I want my time here to be relevant to the electors of Blaxland and to the people at large. It has always been left to Labor to do the hard yards, to think creatively and to enlarge the place of the country's future and how it will advance. Its history has been a constant fight against the reactionaries and the conservatives, who make Labor establish a new ideal. Doing that gives them an opportunity to acclimatise, to find their place in Labor's latest creation. I say that they cannot, no matter how much they try, reface Labor's work. We say they will try to tum back the clock, but now it is so much harder. I look forward to being in this parliament, to being involved in the issues-the issues of social equity, economic efficiency, the great adventure of our internationalisation and the firming of our identity. I take this opportunity to thank the electors of Blaxland for the privilege of serving them in this parliament. I take the opportunity to sincerely thank the members of my own party, those who supported me and those who did not. I especially thank my family-my wife, my mother and my brothers-and all my close family and friends for supporting me and persevering over so many years. In 1993 the people of Australia made a fundamental choice. They chose Medicare; they chose a fair, equitable and decent industrial relations system; and they said an absolute no to a GST. The Liberal Party took note. The coalition said that Fightback-which they had espoused; an ideological statement of their real convictions-was not saleable. So they put on a cloak and masked themselves. They took that masked figure to the 1996 election. Their campaign for the 2 March election was based on a fraudulent representation of themselves as moderate, sensible and practical. They promised to effectively retain the Labor government's framework. They perpetrated a fraud upon the Australian people and won a campaign based on deception and deceit. They hid their true flint-hearted ideological nature behind that cloak of moderation. Since 2 March, the real nature of the beast that is the Howard coalition government has become increasingly apparent. This is a government of implications. This is a government of hints and whispered indications. This is a government that says the people of Australia should have taken the little hints they gave out in the general election campaign as to their real intention and purpose. On 2 March the Australian people, for the first time in their history, accidentally elected an ideological federal government to power. The Howard coalition government has already shown behind the flummery and the posturing of their first 100 days that it is a doctrinaire, backward-looking and, indeed, an antediluvian creation. The Howard government, bereft of any real structured and coherent understanding of Australia and its people, is a prisoner of its own dry and dusty past. It has no framework for creatively building a better, richer, stronger and more diverse cosmopolitan society-a society certain of its core identity, certain of its place in the world and certain of its fundamental adherence to notions of fairness, practicality and equality. The Australian Labor Party has built a framework in government over the previous 13 years to provide Australia with a modem, forward-looking, coherent and practical approach to the main issues that face the nation. The depth and intensity of the Labor Party's vision for creating a new Australia is one that is certain of its past, understands its recent history and has the motive force to take us into the 21 st century. On 15 June the people of Blaxland voted to elect the third Labor member for Blaxland. They did so not long after 2 March and in an environment in which the Liberals had come to power-with a very large majority-on an ideological basis which they had hidden. They won with very great numbers because there were so many marginal seats up and down the coastline of this country. But on 15 June, their first electoral test, the Liberals squibbed it. After having a candidate in every general election since 1949, they did not stand a Liberal Party candidate in the seat of Blaxland in the by-election. We wonder why. When Neville Wran, the former Premier, retired from the seat of Bass Hill in 1986, they knew that Michael Owen, the Liberal candidate they put up, would win the seat-he did so with a 22.32 per cent swing to the Liberals. Given that that seat is fully enclosed within the electorate of Blaxland, one would have thought that a newly elected government in their honeymoon period, priding themselves on marching towards their first 100 days-a government that had their popularity rating rise nationally from 47.2 per cent to 54 per cent and which had seen the national popularity of the Labor government fall from 38.8 per cent to 35 per cent at the 2 March election-would have put up a candidate because they might have had a chance. But what did they do? For 2Y2 months they ducked and dived and tried to decide whether or not they had the courage to put up a candidate. I wonder whether it was simple cowardice, simple stupidity or simple arrogance on their part that delivered a 13.46 per cent swing to the Australian Labor Party in the government's first electoral test since 2 March. I wonder why they were so insensitive to their supporters-who had had a candidate to vote for since 1949-that they abandoned them. I wonder why they deserted the Liberal voters of Blaxland. The voters then faced a choice of whether to vote for Labor, and many of them did-13.46 per cent on a two-party preferred basis. On 2 March their candidate, Nick Korovin, scored 30.7 per cent of the primary vote-two-party preferred, 37 per cent. Yet they could not stand a candidate this time in their first test. The by-election for the seat of Lindsay is coming up. The government wants to say that will be their first test. But their secret is out. The true nature of that lot over thereinterestingly, the front-bench are entirely absent at this point-has started to come out. At the 2 March election, we knew the extent of policy in those little documents that they threw out day by day, yet the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) has simply taken the first step and talked about implications. The Australian people should have taken the little hints, such as those relating to the second airport at Holsworthy. During the election campaign there was a little hint: one group from the northern suburbs said, 'Oh, we'd like the second airport not at Badgerys Creek but at Holsworthy,' and the coalition spokesman said, 'Oh, what a good ideal' After the election was over, we found that the coalition were mightily impressed with that idea. They proposed a second EIS, and are very attached to the proposal. It is quite obvious that Mr Sharp, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, is very attached to that idea. Because of the work of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party in this place since 2 March, it has been revealed that, quite simply, they did a deal. The deal in regard to the second airport of Holsworthy, which just happens to be surrounded by Labor electorates and not Liberal ones, was based upon this: they did not want to have, before the election, an idea that would whack a big, new, seven-day a week, 24-hour a day airport in the seat of Hughes. They told us afterwards. The member for Hughes, Danna Vale, who is to speak later, has tried to say that she is going to fight it with all her might. All the Prime Minister has to do is say, 'Sorry, we cut a bad deal. It is a terrible thing to do, but we are going to do away with that completely.'",29
14,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,"He might get an interjection after that, Mr Deputy Speaker. It's supposed to be non-controversial.",31
15,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Nehl)Order!,31
16,Mr HATTON,Unknown,"On 15 June the electors of Blaxland said they did not want a second airport in Holsworthy-they rejected the proposition entirely. Not only do they not want a second airport but also they do not want the crushing of general aviation in Sydney. They do not want Bankstown airport, with 4,800, jobs to go. They do not want the Taxation Office in Bankstown-a regional tax office serving the people and the industry of Bankstown-to go, costing 650 local jobs. They do not want that on the mark. Also, they made it absolutely plain that they do not want Medicare to be touched. They made it plain in 1993 and they made it plain again on 15 June. Whether it be an up-front fee or a reduction in the Medicare rebate to doctors from 85 per cent to 75 per centwhich would mean the end of bulkbilling in Australia-the electors of Blaxland said, 'No!' The Australian people know and understand that the Fraser government ripped Medibank to pieces over seven years. This ideological government that we face across this chamber has every intention in their first steps in the coming budget to start the process of the demolition of Medicare. We on this side of the House, and including me as the new member for Blaxland, will fight it tooth and nail. I will fight it on the part of my electors who have said, quite significantly and surely, that Medicare is fair; it is reasonable. Being a Labor initiative is not a reason to rip it apart. They know the system works and works well. Equally, my electors, those who are old and those who have young families, are very concerned about the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The notion of bringing in greater user pays from the government scares them. They know that when they go to the doctor and they have to go to the chemist the cost of the medicines they need should be fair and reasonable. They understand that, under Labor, we kept those costs as constrained as we could and that we understood the pressures that were on people. Those points were made very sensibly and clearly by the people of Blaxland. In the by-election campaign, which went on for about 21f2 to three weeks, I had a campaign team that worked as hard as any campaign team could in any election in this country. They were young and inexperienced, but they forged themselves into a fighting force that will be able to work effectively in all future campaigns. My team comprised my campaign manager, John Alam; Justin Lee, the media liaison officer; Leonard MCCarthy, who controlled most of the day-today issues in the office; Mark Arbib, from ALP head office, who did the campaign liaison; the best on-the-ground man in Australia, Dennis Ryan; and riding shotgun over the whole lot was Councillor David Blake. Allied to this team were my wife, my mother and my brothers who have for so long put up with me doing the hard work, day by day, in terms of campaigning. This time everyone was out, not only my brothers but also my extended family-all of the branch members in Blaxland who so strongly came together in a unified way across the factions to support the Labor Party campaign to enable me to become the third Labor member for Blaxland. In that campaign we campaigned sensibly, creatively and we campaigned on this simple basis: that it is possible to establish a trust between the electors and the people who are putting the campaign forward. I think the result demonstrates that. At a time when the Liberals were at an absolute high in terms of their voter appreciation they deserted their people and did not tum up. The vote on the night was 59.02 per cent, on the first scrutiny 58.95. This seat was held for 27 years by Paul Keating, my boss for the last 12 114, my friend for all of my life, the person I voted for in his first preselection 28 years ago. Australia has had, in my opinion, no greater Prime Minister than Paul Keating. He set the framework to take this country into the 21st century. He worked with my colleagues in this parliament to set a structure, to set a coherence, to set a framework, a matrix to take the country forward in his position as Treasurer and then Prime Minister. But Paul has also been my friend for these many years. It was my great joy, privilege and pleasure to work for him as his electorate officer with Veronica Webb, my colleague. We worked on an equal basis. I am glad to say that Veronica has chosen to work with me as my electorate officer. She has been joined by Justin Lee as my research officer. What I hope to attempt to achieve is to take forward the Labor cause not only in Blaxland but also in this parliament as the member for Blaxland. It is important for our electors to understand when they bring us to this place that we are not just meant to be community politicians, which is of core importance, but that our central task is to be elected to this parliament. Our central task is to think creatively. Our central task is to bring all of the skills that we have and the skills of our party machines in our electorates to bear upon the great issues that face this parliament. I can say this quite simply and directly: the result in Blaxland of 13.46 per cent against the Liberals, despite the fact that they did not bother to tum up and deserted their people, is the first step for the federal parliamentary Labor Party back towards office in this place. It is the first step because Labor will always be relevant. It is the first step because Labor in government has always been practical, pragmatic and sure-footed. Labor, when we come to power in the next government, with the factions working together sensibly, as they have for the past many years, will be in a position to create a new Labor government that builds on the framework of the past and takes the cause of the ordinary people of Australia forward. I look forward to and anticipate playing my part in this parliament as the spokesman for the people of Blaxland and as someone who will stand up for ordinary Australians and advance their cause.",31
17,Mr KERR,Unknown,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek your indulgence to ask you to remind members in perhaps more forceful terms of the conventions of this House regarding first speeches.",33
18,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"I thank the member for Denison. I will certainly be doing that. Before I call the honourable member for Leichhardt, I remind all members of the House, and in particular those making their maiden speeches today, that they should-indeed must-refer to members and ministers by their correct titles. I also remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech and I ask the House in fact, the House expects-that every member will extend to him the usual courtesies. I call the honourable member for Leichhardt.",33
19,Mr ENTSCH,Unknown,"It is a great honour to stand here today before you and, I might add, a very humbling experience. While I have always had an intense interest in the affairs of this wonderful country and participated at a local level in working towards a better Australia for all Australians, I never expected to be blessed with the honour of representing my home electorate in the federal government. My election to office most certainly highlights the positive aspects of our democracy. I am a member with very few academic qualifications. I left school at 14 and commenced my working life by following my father into the Queensland railway department. As a junior lad porter, one of my first tasks was to be chief toilet cleaner of the Mareeba railway station. Wanting to improve my opportunities, I was accepted into the RAAF, where I qualified as an aircraft engine fitter and served my country for 10 years. On completing my term in the air force, I worked in a number of professions from maintenance fitter, truck driver and real estate salesman to nightclub manager and wildlife park manager. I was for a time a site convener for the Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union and among my more interesting occupations I spent considerable time as a wild bull catcher and crocodile trapper. These latter occupations, I am sure, will assist me greatly in dealing with the political process in Canberra. Most recently I had my own business interests in the pastoral industry in Cape York and a crocodile farm in the Northern Territory. I make mention of my background to highlight to honourable members on both sides of the House the fallacy of community perceptions. The perception that the Liberal Party consists only of the privileged and silvertails of our society is just as inaccurate as the perception that the Labor Party represents the workers and less advantaged members of our society. I stand before you today as living proof of the inaccuracy of perceptions and stereotypes. Leichhardt is certainly an electorate of diversity, stretching from just south of the sugar town of Babinda to the northern most islands of the Torres Straits, Saibai and Boigu. Leichhardt is approximately 151,000 square kilometres in area. The main industries are tourism, sugar, cattle, agriculture, fishing and mining. The population stands at about a quarter of a million and at last count we had 11,500 small businesses. I have created history in the seat of Leichhardt in that I am the first Liberal member to hold the seat since its proclamation in 1949. In preparing this speech, I researched some of the previous members' maiden speeches. I discovered that in 1976 National Party member David Thomson read from a letter written by a member of his family in 1888. It talked of the great troubles in getting supplies in and out. He also mentioned the inadequacies of communications in his electorate. I must say that in 1996 the concerns raised by my predecessor are still as relevant today. Over the years Leichhardt has been grossly neglected by governments which have been quite happy to take the wealth which our region yields, returning little in the way of infrastructure and basic services to the citizens of the area. My arrival in Canberra after 2 March only serves to highlight to me the inadequacies of the services in Leichhardt. I stand in awe of the fantastic infrastructure and services able to the lucky citizens of Canberra. Coming from a regional electorate, Canberra seems like fairyland. The services provided here are almost beyond the imagination of my constituents. It is little wonder the bureaucrats and decision makers, insulated in the comforts of Canberra, lose touch with the harsh realities of regional Australia. In Leichhardt in 1996, our Cape York cattlemen still cannot move their stock during the wet due to unsealed roads which are impassable for months. Even travelling to Cooktown, only 330 kilometres north of Cairns, there are 75 kilometres of very rough unsealed road, which has had a serious negative impact on the economy of the region. I hear members complaining about inadequate digital phone services. In my electorate, with the exception of a small area around Cairns, there are no mobile phone services. There are huge areas that have no power. They receive no or limited television and radio reception. Many of those who do have access to the limited communications services are restricted to the ABC. While the ABC may well be an admirable service, unfortunately, it gives people a one-sided view. In 1996, I think it is imperative that all our citizens have access to a broad range of communications to give them the opportunity to formulate an informed and balanced view of current affairs. Suburbs in Cairns have little or no access to television and mobile phone reception. I am talking of areas within a IS-kilometre radius of our major population centre, one of the largest provincial growth areas of Australia. This is a disgrace, and I am committed to pushing for more equitable access to communications in my electorate. Given the size of my electorate, I will start at the top, an area absolutely vital to the future security, health and well-being of our nation. Be assured: threats to Australia's health and our agricultural and pastoral industries are real. Any breach of our stringent quarantine regulations would certainly come through the Torres Straits. Be under no illusion, Mr Deputy Speaker and fellow members: at low tide you can almost walk to avail- Papua New Guinea. It is only about three kilometres from our northernmost island of Saibai-so close, in fact, that the deer from Papua New Guinea swim across to Saibai each wet, swimming back to Papua New Guinea as the surface water dries up. Nasties such as screw worm, foot and mouth and rabies are right on our doorstep. Diseases such as Japanese encephalitis, which took two lives in the Torres Straits last year, should be a clear warning of the risks. Torres Straits has to be acknowledged as our front line and should be treated accordingly. Several weeks ago, a large outbreak of black sigatoka was discovered in banana trees in Weipa. This outbreak is believed to have originated through the Torres Straits. The recent papaya fruit fly infestation in Far North Queensland only serves to highlight the risks. Smuggling is also prevalent throughout the Torres Straits, with fauna, flora, guns and drugs moving in and out of Australia. While organisations such as customs and the defence force do an admirable job, there has been a continual reduction of funding and a contraction of services which I believe ultimately put our entire nation at risk. There are many needs in the Torres Strait. I would like particularly to address two today. Firstly, all members, I am sure, are aware of the vast amount of money that has been spent in recent times on reafforestation programs. This is very commendable and I support these programs. However, I am sure members are unaware that in the Torres Straits in the 1920s the beche-de-mer fishermen removed every single tree from islands such as Damley to fuel their fires in order to dry the beche-demer. To this day, not a single tree has been planted in the Torres Strait islands from any program to rectify this problem. I give a personal commitment to my friend Mr George Mye, the Chairman of Darnley Island, that I will work towards rectifying this anomaly to ensure that the Torres Straits get their equitable share of the tree planting programs so that we can bring these islands back to their former beauty. I would also like to acknowledge another dear old friend, Mr Etti Pau. Etti is a proud Australian and a proud old soldier. He was a member of the volunteer Torres Straits Light Infantry Battalion that served in the Torres Straits region during the 1939-45 war. There has been little recognition of Etti and his comrades and, with only about 150 of those old soldiers left, out of an original 850, I am committed to affording them the recognition they deserve for their wonderful contribution to this nation. Moving from the Torres Straits, Cape York Peninsula represents a huge part of my electorate. Cape York is an area rich in natural beauty, resources and Aboriginal and nonAboriginal culture, a place with which I am proud to have had a long association. In recent years, Cape York has been used as a political pawn in an attempt to buy votes in urban electorates whose populations have absolutely no concept of the real Cape York. Much has been said with regard to land rights and reconciliation for our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. If you believe the rhetoric of Labor and the Democrats you would believe that they were the champions of the ATSI people with an exclusive mandate. Let me tell you that this is wrong. The majority of us on this side of the House-in fact, the majority of fair-minded Australians-fully support these goals. I do not support ambit claims where the hopes and aspirations of grassroots Aboriginal people are raised to unachievable levels only to be told, 'It was only an ambit claim', and you have to accept much less or, in many cases, nothing at all. Believe me, many of the grassroots Aboriginal people do not understand the meaning of the word 'ambit' and they are left feeling devastated, cheated and angry. It sets Aboriginals against non-Aboriginals and Aboriginals against their own people-it is so divisive. Their legal representatives and advisers make a fortune yet Aboriginal people are still dying in disproportionately large numbers from preventable diseases. Unemployment in some Aboriginal communities is as high as 95 per cent. This money could be better invested on health, nutrition and culturally appropriate employment opportunities in Cape York. These ambit claims also have a devastating effect on the non-Aboriginal community of Cape York with so many people living dayto-day for close to seven years since the possibility of land claims was first mooted. Financial institutions recalled loans and refused to lend for expansion or upgrading. Mining, agriculture and other projects likely to offer an economic future to the area have been delayed and in some cases abandoned. Many in the House may not be aware that there are pioneering families who have lived in Cape York Peninsula since the 1860s and over time have developed close friendships and, in many cases, family relationships with Aboriginal people. The Native Title Act, in its current form, is not working and has delivered nothing for the Aboriginal people. Much has been said about the recent Cape York heads of agreement. It has been supported by graziers, Aboriginal people, Greens, both sides of the House of Representatives and, heaven forbid, the Democrats. What many may not know is that I prepared and moved the original motion in August 1994 which formed the basis of that heads of agreement. Therefore, I can assure the House that I am totally committed to working towards a long-term future for the Shepherds, the Quartermains, the Jacksons, the Callighans and the Cummings, people like Eddy Holyroyd, Wompi Kepple, Gordon Charlie and their families and all the other fine people in Cape York. Cairns is the population centre of my electorate. The largest population is spread between Babinda to the south to Port Douglas, Mossman and Daintree to the north. The region was originally settled as a port and supply base for the early goldfields. Many of the early settlers diversified into agriculture, particularly sugar cane, which saw the region become one of the largest sugar producing regions in Australia. It was the prosperity and security of our sugar industry that formed the backbone of the region for many years. In 1984, the Cairns international airport became a reality and its success can be gauged by the fact that last year there were 2.99 million passenger movements. Exports through the Cairns airport have grown by over 65 per cent per annum for the past five years and currently total some 6,000 tonnes. Fresh fruit, flowers, fish, crustaceans, for the growing Asian restaurant trade, are but a few of the quality Australian products exported out of Cairns on a daily basis. International flights out of Cairns have grown to a total of 67 per week. They go to 15 destinations on 10 international carriers. This community owned facility is Australia's fifth biggest internationservices. al airport. Tourism in Cairns is our economic lifeblood and it offers us a bright future. Unfortunately, it has not come without a price. With much of the focus on tourism, many of our industries have fallen further and further behind. I believe it is dangerous to put all our eggs in one basket and we need to look at continuing to develop other industries. We are well placed to continue to expand our export facilities out of Cairns and the expansion of the port of Weipa to facilitate live cattle exports and other freight exports is a real option. We have a ship builder in the electorate, NQEA-it is a local company; 100 per cent Australian owned-that in 1983 directly employed 800 people and indirectly employed a further 100 subcontractors. Their ability to build fast catamarans is internationally renowned as is their ability to produce ships for our navy. Unfortunately, for reasons known only to the previous government, NQEA went for 13 years without being awarded a defence contract-this is in spite of their competitiveness and proven track record. Over those years NQEA was forced to scale down its activities to a point where, at the change of government on 2 March, their total work force was less than 300. They were on the brink of ruin when one month after the election a defence contract was signed, awarding a $200 million contract for the construction of two hydrographic survey ships for the navy. This reprieve has meant that they are now re-employing. We as a government must ensure that there is a fair and equal distribution of contracts and do all in our power to ensure that this type of unfairness never happens again. Recently, there have been suggestions of closures of the local tax office, CES offices and rumoured reductions in Commonwealth funding for the Cairns campus of the James Cook University, the family law court and the Customs Service. If these cuts are made. I can promise that you will hear me screaming. What little we have has taken so long to get. What we need in regional Australia is an expansion of services not a contraction of There are a number of social issues in my electorate that I would like to flag at this time. I appreciate that I am limited to 20 minutes. At a later stage, I will raise these issues in more detail. We have a chronic shortage of funding in the area of aged care and I am fully committed to addressing these shortfalls. While raising the issue of aged care, I must bring to the attention of the House the plight of our profoundly disabled youth. At present, those requiring full-time care are bundled into aged care facilities and we have, in some cases, teenagers, with minds as sharp as tacks, sharing rooms with aged dementia patients. This is disgraceful. I will be working towards establishing a facility in Far North Queensland specifically to house these needy young Australians. I have for many years had deep concerns about the deteriorating situation in the area of mental health. Social changes and a lack of funding have done little to improve the quality of life of those unfortunate enough to be afflicted by mental illness. The previous government's policy of putting more and more mentally ill on the streets without sufficient support puts both the patient and the general public at risk. A complete overhaul of our mental health system is long overdue. I will certainly be a driving force for this agenda. Also of real concern is the present state of our family law system. Family law matters are one of the highest levels of constituent inquiries in my office. There is a large number of desperate people out there. Sadly, nearly every case involves children. Recent figures suggest that more than 10,000 people in my electorate are suffering under the current system. It would appear that the present system is very much biased against the noncustodial parent and there is an urgent need to bring back some balance. To be able to stand here today in this chamber proudly representing the people of Leichhardt is an achievement shared with many people. While it would be impossible for me to name everyone of them, there are some very special people whom I would like to acknowledge. First of all I acknowledge Hal and Faye Westaway, who worked tirelessly through my campaign giving me both moral and physical support. It was Hal and Faye who kept liberalism alive in Far North Queensland. Without their dedication and persistence, my win in Leichhardt could not have transpired. I would also like to acknowledge Gladys Potter and her dedicated band in the women's council. Apart from their great support, they make wonderful cakes and are exceptional fund-raisers. Thank you, ladies. I also thank members of my campaign committee-Doug and Lyall Jones, Paul Beasley, Kel Ryan, Bob Norman, Peter Taylor, Graham Smith and Nicole Tobin-Donnelly-and Senator Ian Macdonald, who has kept the seat of Leichhardt warm. I would also like to acknowledge Sandy Mulley, through whose work the Liberal Party was able to win the booth at Weipa for the first time in its history. I want to thank two very special people. Joy Palmer, after meeting me for the first time, had sufficient confidence in me to give me 100 per cent of her time, loyalty and support from before preselection and through the entire campaign. She is still with me today. Thanks, Joy. Another special mention is to an aggressive dynamo from the Northern Territory. Ashley Manicaros joined my team just prior to the election. He had the monumental task of shaking some of the bush out of me and shining up my dull bits while improving my massive four per cent recognition factor. Ashley certainly had his work cut out for him. In spite of the fact that at times he had to drag me along kicking and screaming, this guy persevered and, with the help of his wonderful lady, Janice, achieved results which were not possible of a lesser man. I have kept my final thanks to those very special people in my life, my family. First, I thank my wonderful wife, Helen, whose patience, support and preparedness to take a back seat allowed me to get out there and fight for my political goals, comfortable in the knowledge that I always had a warm home and a sympathetic ear to retreat to should I be on the receiving end of a political bashing. I guess you could call her my security blanket. Thanks, Helen. I would also like to mention my three wonderful sons-Steven, Jason and Jacob; my youngest. I can assure the House that with these three boys you are looking at a very proud dad. Of course, I would not be here if it were not for my mum and dad, Mavis and George Entsch. My dad worked for 40 years in the Queensland railways, an ordinary working man but with extraordinary family values. What we lacked in monetary assets was more than made up for with an abundance of love, warmth and a sense of belonging. As a consequence, we wanted for nothing. Like several other new members in this chamber, I too am the first in my family to become involved in politics. I know that my mum and dad are very proud of my achievements. Let me say for the record that it is their efforts in instilling in me a strong set of values through a happy and loving childhood that will have an immense and positive influence on my contribution to this fine House. Thanks, mum and dad. Finally, I would like to acknowledge my fatherand mother-in-law, Lou and Lorraine Tognolini. Apart from a beautiful daughter, who became my wife, they have given me a tremendous amount of support during the campaign as well as providing a willing babysitting service on demand. It is obvious from my background that I could not be considered an academic. While I am the first to admit that I come into the House with very little political experience, I arrived here very apprehensive but I must say extremely confident and looking forward to contributing in a positive, practical way with grassroots, common sense representation which will in time, I am confident, offer a long-term benefit to my electorate and its people. Thank you.",33
20,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"The parliament is responding to the speech by His Excellency, the Governor General, on the occasion of the opening of the 38th Parliament. The debate is known as the address-in-reply. It has given members an opportunity to range over many of the issues of concern to them, because the Governor General, in delivering that speech, outlined this government's intentions. Under the circumstances in which that speech was delivered and the address-in-reply debate has taken place, following so closely after the election on 2 March, it understandably has provided new members with an opportunity to make their maiden speeches. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate all of them. One of the interesting things about the maiden speeches that have been made by the new members who were elected on 2 March is that listening closely to them helps to reinforce our understanding of the enormous diversity of interests, geography, economic activities and problems across the continent. In the history of the world, Australians have been privileged to be the only nation to have exclusive occupancy of one continent. One hundred and forty-eight people are brought into this parliament from across this continent to represent the people and the interests and problems that those people have. I have been particularly encouraged to hear in those maiden speeches the range of talents and concerns expressed and, as I say, the diversity of those areas from which those members come. They have a very special responsibility, as they have indicated. They are very privileged to be in this parliament. They have a very special responsibility to bring into this parliament their concerns without fear or favour. Of course, the vigour with which debates are conducted in this chamber from time to time indicates that not all members of the chamber agree with their colleagues on either side of the House, nor do they endorse a lot of the issues that are brought into the parliament nor the way in which they are expressed. But people do not become members of parliament unless, on a preferential system of voting, they secure over 50 per cent of the support of the people in their electorate. So they represent them first and have a responsibility to them primarily, and then of course they have a wider responsibility to all Australians. As I have said, I congratulate all new members. A number of members, because of the enormous change which took place on 2 March in the composition of this place, have yet to make their maiden speech. They undoubtedly are looking forward to doing so because that will introduce them more positively and definitely into the procedures of this chamber and of the parliament generally. I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to be the first opposition speaker to follow the speech made by the new member for Blaxland (Mr Hatton). I want to refer to two comments that the honourable member made in his speech-and it was, I thought, an excellent speech. Perhaps for a maiden speech it was more contentious than usual. But I am not one of those people who subscribe to the opinion that, on the first occasion that members get up to speak in this chamber, they have to be non-contentious. I can think of nothing more stupid. New members should feel free to be as contentious as they wish. They are here to raise issues and to represent their constituents. The least we can do-that is, members who have been here before-is extend to them the reasonable courtesy of sitting here and listening to them as they raise those issues. I am pleased that the honourable member for Blaxland has indicated that he is such a person: one who is here to raise issues and represent his constituents. There were two particular things he said on which I wish to comment. Firstly, he said, 'I want my time here to be relevant.' That is a great aspiration. I believe that all members, in particular all of the new members, would want their time in this place to be relevantrelevant to their constituents, relevant to the problems they want to express here, relevant to the solutions they want to find; relevant to their understanding of Australia, its place in the world and its destiny. In that context, it is perhaps most appropriate that I also refer to the fact that, as we all know, Michael Hatton, having been elected to represent Blaxland in this place, follows the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating. Michael said some nice things about the former Prime Minister, everyone of which was more than justified and more than well earned. I have often been distressed when confronted with what I have thought was a grossly unfair perception of the former Prime Minister-not on the part of all Australians, but on the part of some Australians. I remember on one occasion, as I was driving through Sydney, listening to the talkback radio program of John Laws. The lady speaking to John Laws was making some very deprecating remarks about Paul Keating. John Laws then simply asked the lady, 'Have you ever met him?' and she said, 'No.' He said, 'Perhaps if you were to meet Paul Keating, your opinion would be different.' I know exactly what John Laws meant when he said that. Mr Deputy Speaker, everyone who knows or has had the privilege of meeting and knowing Paul Keating knows what John Laws meant when he said those words. Paul Keating is a man of enormous talent, of great vision, probably one of the most visionary leaders that Australia has ever had in any capacity-a man who is a proud Australian, who had his own perception of the destiny of Australia and its place in the world. He was able to achieve what had obviously been his ambition for a long time-to become Prime Minister. Although I wish to show no disrespect to the present Prime Minister (Mr Howard), I think it was a serious loss to Australia as a nation and as a community that Paul Keating was not able to continue making the quite remarkable contribution which he did make during that relatively short time in which he was Prime Minister. But Paul Keating undoubtedly will continue to use his talents, as he has already shown he intends, in the interests of Australia. The other thing the new member for Blaxland said to which I want to make reference is this: he said, 'I look forward to being involved in the parliament and being involved in the issues.' One of those issues to which he made special reference was the issue of social equity. We on this side of the chamber do not resile from, nor do we apologise for, our commitment to social equity. I like to believe that members on the government side also have a genuine concern about it. The member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) is nodding his head. He endorses the comment that I have just made. The Labor Party, as the political expression of the labour movement, has based its whole raison d'etre on the need for social equity. For 200 years the organised labour movement, not only in Australia but throughout the world, has not been prepared to accept the belief, still held by some people, that market forces, for example, are adequate in themselves to ensure all economic objectives we would set and also social equity. I do not believe that there are many people, incidentally, including those among us who are the most conservative, who would believe that market forces, in themselves, are adequate. But that is the reason for our existence. If we fail to do what we can in the pursuit of social equity, then we fail in our charter. Could I say just in passing-and I have made reference to this before-that this is one of the most uncertain and insecure jobs to which a person can aspire. We, the former Labor government, lost government on 2 March, having held a majority of 11; the coalition government on 2 March came in with a majority of 40. I suppose, in a sense, that is pretty devastating. However, having referred to the uncertainty of this place, all I want to say is this: the Australian Labor Party requires a swing to it of less than four per cent at the time of the next federal election for us to be back in government-I repeat: less than four per cent. If the swing across Australia were an average five per cent, the ALP would be back in government with a majority of 16 seats. We know that the electorate is volatile; we know the electorate is often harsh in its judgment-I believe it was on 2 March even though the results that we see in this parliament do not reflect the changes in the voting expressed on 2 March. For example, the opposition got 46 per cent of the votes but we finished up with about 32 per cent of the seats. I don't complain about that. The fact is that when you have a large number of marginal seats that type of change can occur. But 46 people in every 100 voters in Australia still voted for the Labor Party and we lost, in terms of seats, overwhelmingly. When the Governor General, speaking on behalf of the government, introduced his speech on 30 April, he said: On 2 March the Australian people entrusted to a new government the responsibility of managing the nation's affairs. In doing so they endorsed decisively a comprehensive programme of practical reform. The Liberal and National Parties will keep faith with the and implement that programme. Well, I hope so. I hope they do not just introduce the fine print, leaving the detail vague. There was a perception on the part of the electorate when it cast those votes on 2 March that the coalition parties would honourably introduce the types of measure that had been suggested. But we already see, as we come to the end of that period known as the honeymoon period of a new government, the disenchantment. I believe, as I have often expressed, that the alienation of the electorate and the swing against a government starts on day one. We have families in Australia that are very apprehensive about the changes this government has already introduced. For example, as a result of that fiasco of a Premiers Conference a week or so ago, every family in New South Wales will be saddled with a state burden of an additional $300, and New South Wales itself will be saddled over three years with an additional burden of $900 million. How are people reacting to that? Families are apprehensive and fearful, and I am one of those people who believe they have good cause to be. The government has made much in its rhetoric about what it refers to as the $8 billion black hole. That has been discredited. Mrs Bishop-Only you've been discredited.",38
21,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"Well, the minister at the dispatch box says that only we are the ones that believe that that has been discredited. On 8 March, six days after that election, the Australian Treasury, in its report, said, 'The economic outlook for 1996-97 remains favourable'. It didn't say that the outlook has become favourable in the last six days; it didn't say 'We hope it will become favourable'. It said that it remains favourable. Early in May, again after the election on 2 March, Ian MCFarlane, the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, said: At the Reserve Bank we are pretty happy with how things have turned out in Australia. He didn't say 'since 2 March' or 'on 2 March'. They are the two major financial, economic institutions in Australia: on the one hand, the Australian Treasury; on the other people hand, the Reserve Bank-both of them more objectively and more honestly giving credit indirectly to what is, in a sense, the economic goldmine which this coalition government inherited on 2 March, despite the rhetoric. I hear some gasps of disbelief, but let me just give some examples. During the period of the Fraser-Howard government, economic growth in Australia averaged 2.1 per cent per year. During our 13 years, it averaged 3.7 per cent-a 2.1 per cent average under a coalition government compared with 3.7 per cent under the Labor government. In the process of achieving that type of result, that average rate of growth-and I have some other examples if I have sufficient time to deal with them-the Labor government was able to put together what was quite clearly a coordinated, coherent, consistent and effective series of policies. At one time we used to talk about governments adopting fiscal measures or monetary measures but, under that Labor government during those 13 years, the whole question of economic mismanagement and coordination was brought to an art form. Let me emphasise that. Not only did we use fiscal policy appropriately, not only did we marry that with monetary policy but also we developed wages policy, trade policy, industry policy, competition policy and savings policy. And all of them were integrated and coordinated into a very effective way of dealing with the problems that we had quite clearly inherited from the previous government when we came into office. It wasn't just a matter of economic growth but everything else related to that. I do not think there is anyone now who could genuinely deny that, when we came into government in 1983, we in effect inherited an industrial graveyard. Australia was uncompetitive. It was inward looking. The inflation rate was 11 per cent, unemployment was 10.5 per cent and interest rates were 20 per cent. During our period in government, two million new jobs were created, including over 700,000 of them in the last three years and 500,000 of those in small business. Inflation, which was 11 per cent when we came into government, was left at an underlying rate of 3.5 per cent; unemployment, which had been 10.5 per cent, was 8.5 per cent; and interest rates, which had been 20 per cent, were eight to nine per cent. They are the realities. Australia has become a much more culturally diverse nation, a much more sophisticated nation, a much more efficient nation, a much more productive nation and a much more competitive nation. Instead of 13 per cent of GDP being exported-which was the rate when we came into government-24 per cent is now being exported. Almost one quarter of the total productive capacity in Australia every year now is being exported. That is a result of some of those changes which took place. I said that the present government has inherited an economic goldmine. The more honest, the more dispassionate and the more objective members on both sides of this chamber and in the wider community would accept that and would endorse it. The government has that basis now to build on. It will be a test of their capacities to see whether they can do what Labor did over 13 years and continue that program. That is the challenge. Like the rest of Australia, I hope they do not botch it. (Time expired)",40
22,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Before I call the honourable member for Hughes, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech and I ask the House to extend to her the usual courtesies.",41
23,Mrs VALE,Unknown,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. In all my life, I had never dared to dream that it would be my honour and my duty to stand before you in this honourable House to represent over 83,000 of my fellow Australians. That I am here can be attributed to a confluence of circumstance and destiny in a personal spiritual journey, together with an awareness that, as a lucky citizen of this still lucky country, I have reached that time in life when something must be put back for that which has been received. This is not altruism, but my own fearful anticipation of an inevitable appointment with divine reckoning, where the idiosyncrasies of my life will be balanced with any good bits-and, mea culpa, I am more than a little short on the good bits. If birth is the great lottery of life, then I must have been one of the winners. I was lucky enough to be born in Australia, to have grown up in Sutherland shire and to have met and married a man who is good and gentle. My husband, Bob, and I had four sons in five years-which was more good luck than good management-and we were lucky enough to have raised them in Sutherland shire. I was lucky enough to be a full-time mum and lucky enough to have been there to share the joys of rediscovering the world through the bright eyes of our four little Vale boys. I mention them today because they are the achievement of my lifetime. Together with Bob, I have raised four young Australians who understand the meaning of love, family and commitment. They stuck together as children, and they stick together now, and they have a loving affection and respect for their old dad. So to our sons, Robert, Christopher, Matthew and Alexander, I want to say thank you for coming to live in our house. For so many years, you were my reason for living, you were the only glory I ever wanted, and I am so very proud of you all. Mr Deputy Speaker, I was also lucky to have had a childhood in Australia in the 1950s and 1960s. My mother and father, Albert and Delma Ward, built our family home at Sylvania near the Georges River just after World War II. I was the eldest of their six children and, with my brothers and sisters, our childhood was spent mucking about in old rowing boats on the river. We were the last of the billycart generation, before the invasion of television and technology stole all the real fun from an Australian childhood. I left school and began working at 14, and I was lucky enough to get a job almost immediately as an office junior. But, for a girl, I had a restless spirit and dared to dream of things not usual for girls at that time. When I was 18, I dreamt of flying aeroplanes. I was told this would be impossible-I came from a working class family, I did not have any contacts in aviation and, besides, at that time such a pursuit for a girl was irrelevant in a world of men. But I was lucky. I worked hard at two and sometimes three jobs and I obtained my pilot's licence by the time. I was 20. When I was 34, I dreamt of going to university to study law, but my betters said it would be impossible for me-I did not have any contacts in the legal profession, and I did not have the intellectual fortitude to undertake the rigours of the discipline. But I tried anyway, and I was lucky enough to graduate from Sydney UniversitY-One of the most prestigious and oldest universities in the country-with degrees in arts and law. So you see, Mr Deputy Speaker, Australia has truly been the lucky country for me. It is now my tum to pay something back from the bounty that I have received, and to begin to redress the imbalance of the lack of any good bits before my time comes for the greater accounting, by committing myself to the service of the people in my electorate. My electorate of Hughes lies to the south of Sydney and for a greater part includes the western end of Sutherland shire, extending north-west to Chipping Norton. I have heard many of my fellow members wax lyrical on the beauty of their electorates but, as the representative of Hughes, I must be silent on its secrets. The secrets need to be kept because from Coalcliff to Como, from Menai to Moorebank and all the areas in between, Hughes is where God comes for his holidays. However, I do wish to draw the attention of this House to a particular issue in the electorate-that is, the completion of the W oronora Bridge, which has taken on great significance in local politics. The last Liberal state government began to build a new medium level bridge. However, after the victory of the state Labor government in March 1995, funding for the bridge was stopped. Today the bridge pylons stand silently in the river, mute testimony that the state Labor governmentdespite a petition of almost 13,000 signatures, urgent overtures by Sutherland Shire Council and hundreds of personal pleas by local residents-remains deaf to calls to complete the bridge. During the election I strongly supported the completion of the new bridge. I now understand that the federal government has already granted $230 million in untied road grants to the state government in the 1995-96 budget. I challenge the state ministers for roads and transport to explain to the people of the electorate of Hughes why some of that federal funding could not be allocated for the completion of the Woronora Bridge. My opportunity to get serious about putting something back into my community came with the approaching federal election and the need for the Liberal Party to win seats like Hughes. Yet again I was told by those who knew better than I that it would be impossible to succeed. Not only was the sitting member a minister of the Crown but also he had at his disposal the considerable resources of his incumbency plus a 61/2 per cent majority for good measure. It was against the odds, I was told. Without resources and without finances, I took unpaid leave of absence from my job as an associate solicitor in Jannali, and in 1995 began the hard slog of door-knocking the electorate. I wish to thank the partners of my employer, Macedone Christie Willis, especially Sam and Margaret Macedone, for their support and goodwill, and for keeping my job safe for me if I did not succeed. That our little campaign in Hughes was so successful that it nearly doubled the national swing is a tribute to the many friends and supporters who gathered to sustain us along the way. It would be impossible to thank them all, but thanks must be extended for the kindness and generosity of the people of Warringah conference-to its president, Angus Robertson, and to Jane Vincent, David Begg and the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), who even came door-knocking with me in Engadine. Thank you Andrew Maiden, Scott Briggs and Meredith Laverty and all the wonderful members of the Young Liberal Movement who worked in the campaign. Thank you senators, Michael Baume, John Tierney and Bob Woods. Thank you to the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) and the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) and to our state members for Georges River and Miranda. Thanks must also go to our golden oldies, who worked in the campaign roomsto Edna and Jack Gentle, Mary Stewart, Nola and Des Lawrence and Norm Humphries, and to the many others who kept the campaign rooms at full operational strength. A very special thanks and full credit go to our campaign director, Mr Chris Downy, state member for Sutherland, our brilliant ideas man who gave us his experience, his encouragement and his friendship. Thank you to our campaign manager, Brett Thomas, and his wife, Faye; to our generals in the field, Gilbert Vanderjagt, Ian Leeding, Bill Meehan, David Adamson and Steve Simpson; and to our fundraising committee, Jill Deering, Lorna Stone and Jennifer Turville. Thank you to all our supporters and workers who turned out on the day, up before the sparrows so that our booths were ready to deliver long before any opposition arrived. Thank you to my own family, Delma and Don Matheson, Hilary and John Tipping, and the most loving thank you of all to my 81August year-old mum, Delma Ward, who came down from Tuncurry and 'womaned' the booth in Bangor all day. To all my men, the four Vale boys and to my darling Bob whose peaceful life I have turned upside down-he married me for better or for worse, not necessarily for politics-my loving thanks. Bob, I couldn't have done it without you, mate. I stood as a candidate for government because there are things I see in our society today which I do not understand. I am moved to question why, in a country rich in natural resources, mineral wealth and of a population of high creativity and ingenuity, our compasses are all awry. We have not only a huge $8 billion deficit but also over 805,000 of our citizens unemployed, 280,000 of whom have been walking through the experience of unemployment for more than a year and a half. I have seen the homeless, the hopeless and the aimless. I have seen children, one as young as 11, left to face the juvenile justice system alone, deserted by whatever passed for a family in his young life and abandoned as if he were the flotsam and jetsam of life. I have seen the despair caused by youth suicide in my own electorate, the parents and the families, the teachers and friends disconsolate in the depths of despair and no answers as to their questions of why. I have seen the shameful lack of support facilities for the old, the frail and the disabled in our community, and seen how governments fail to support the carers, those wonderful few who toil unselfishly in the care of their loved ones, taking over a burden which rightly belongs to governments. I have seen how we have abandoned our responsibility to those amongst us who suffer a mental illness, and I have seen our once friendly, gregarious Australian society change in recent years to one which exhibits a high level of anger and aggression. I have seen a culture of violence flourish, encouraged by the entertainment media where depravity is celebrated and homicide is presented as a brutal form of conflict resolution. As a member of this House, as an Australian citizen, there are some questions about the state of the nation that I am driven to ask. It has been a long time since anyone has been burnt at the stake for heresy. But I would dare to ask questions of the kinds of principles and values which guide the decision making process of this House which ultimately become the values which determine the priorities in our lives, in our relationships and in our Australian society. The recent tragedy of Port Arthur has seared the psyche of our nation like no other single event in our history. Australia will never be quite the same ever again. I add my voice to the expressions of sympathy extended to the families and the people of Port Arthur by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). The event at Port Arthur has left, in its destructive wake, some tough lessons from which we might derive some understanding of the direction in which our modem Australian culture is heading. We in this House are supposed to be the leaders of this nation. If we do not give our time for serious discussion on the nature of our society, to the kinds of guiding principles we want to uphold as those our society should value, then the compasses may always be awry, and heaven help us all in the future. And the future is our children today. The kind of adults they will become will depend on the kinds of values we uphold as worthy of our own commitment. Mindful of my heresy, I dare to ask the economists among us why is it that the principle of efficiency is the guiding principle upon which our economic realities are based. That such a principle is apparently so readily accepted without debate by both sides of this House tells me that it has the status of dogma. I am not an economist, nor can I pretend to be. But I do have a problem with the dogma of economic rationalism which sacrifices people in the name of 'efficiency'. Why must every activity, enterprise, business or industry be rationalised in the name of 'efficiency'? Efficiency of what? It cannot be the efficiency of our economy, not with a deficit of $8 billion. It cannot be the efficiency of our industry, not with 805,000 people unemployed. I remember a time in the 1950s and 1960s when Australia fairly bristled with a manufacturing sector which made us wealthy, independent and secure in an insecure world and which gave our young people employment and hope and a future. But a new generation of economists has no place for old fashioned economic structures, especially tariffs and other forms of protection. Their litany includes terms like 'level playing field', 'open economy' and 'rationalisation'. So what if our manufacturing industry of the 1950s and 1960s was inefficient? Was it so wrong? It provided jobs for the greater majority of Australians and hope for our future. Why is it that a better outcome is to have a small remnant manufacturing sector which may be efficient but which provides very little employment for Australians? This reminds me of a scene in Yes, Minister when Sir Humphrey wanted to give an award for efficiency to a brand new hospital. 'But it hasn't any patients, Humphrey,' said Mr Hacker. 'But that's not the point, Minister; it's the most efficient hospital we have. We don't want any patients in it,' said Sir Humphrey. I would like to tell the Sir Humphreys amongst us here that we need to factor people into the economic equation if we want real, effective outcomes for our nation. Otherwise, the only outcome we will have will be the effect of higher and higher levels of unemployment. The impact of unemployment in a society is well documented. It has a millpond effect and causes loss of self-esteem and selfvince identity, mental depression, hopelessness and helplessness, and family and relationship breakdowns. It adds to our crime rate and increases in domestic violence. At its very worse, it eventually impacts as a generational phenomenon. I would take this further: the tough dogma of economic rationalism which places no value on people and dominates our political and economic culture is also reflected in the pursuit of self-focused materialism and personal convenience in our society. The devaluation of people in the economic world is reflected by a devaluation of people in society generally. It can be seen in the way society values its relationships and the kind of language the society uses. Of recent years, there has even been a shift in the language to accommodate such pursuits. Commentator John Hyde, in the Sydney Morning Herald on 10 May 1996, suggested that if we are to re-assess our values we should start with changes in our language and that we should start to use the words 'right and wrong' instead of the words 'efficient and inefficient'. I agree with him. There are certain principles which underpin human relationships and Port Arthur has as much to do with human relationships and the devaluation of human beings as it does with guns, mental health and violent videos. It is a fundamental principle that love is necessary to enrich and sustain the relationship of the family, which is the basic building block of our nation. Families tell us who we are and let us dream of what we might become. But the family is changing. In modem Australia there are parents who do not see any need to provide the nurturing and love needed by their offspring and the word 'care' is now used instead of 'love'. Relationships increasingly end in divorce and separation without any consideration of proper strategies to deal with the distress of the children. Contrary to fashionable opinion, I can tell you that divorce and separation hurts. We cannot put personal ambition, convenience or the pursuit of lifestyle above the emotional needs of our children and expect to bring up confident and well-adjusted young adults. We cannot cona baby of its intrinsic value as a very special human being in our lives if it is left in long-term care from the time of its birth and is collected after work with the milk and the bread. There may be those at this very moment who are gathering the wood to bum this heretic, but it seems to me that the process of devaluation of people in the dogma of economic rationalism in this House is reflected in the devaluation of people in relationships in many households in our country. It is the role of government to provide the leadership necessary to reverse the cultural shift and to make this nation a kinder society where effective outcomes are those which include the human equation. Otherwise, I have a fear, a very real fear, that the tragedy of Port Arthur will be revisited. I now wish to refer to the recent decision of the government to reconsider Holsworthy, in my electorate, as a possible site for a second airport in Sydney. I give notice to this House that I and the people of Hughes are implacably opposed to Holsworthy as a possible site for an airport and I will fight the government on this issue. Once again, my betters are telling me I am taking on the impossible and I cannot win. There are many environmental and other issues which cause grave concern for the people of my electorate. These will be fully addressed in the EIS process and I do not intend to address such issues here. However, I wish to make it clear that I am very proud to be here as part of the 38th parliament of Australia and to be on the team led by our Prime Minister. During the campaign, John Howard spoke up for the family, integrity and small business. He spoke his truths clearly and firmly. The heartland of Australia heard his call and voted for John Howard. His name is now firmly etched upon the escutcheon of this nation. For me, he is not only the Prime Minister of Australia; he is my Prime Minister. I am very proud of him. I would be proud to hoist my colours alongside his in any fight, at any time. I want this House to know that it gives me no pleasure at all to fight the Prime Minister and his cabinet on the proposal for Holsworthy. But I have a sacred duty to the people of my electorate and it is with a resolute heart that I stand with them against this proposal. There is a grave principle here for which I have a very real concern and that is the principle of trust that underscores the relationship between the government and its people. The people of Hughes and I began a very special relationship during the campaign. I knocked on their doors; I shook them by the hand; I looked them in the eye; and I asked them to vote for me. I am their member, they are my constituents. They are my extended family and I will do my best to look after them. Already they have felt the impact of the proposal but not as much as the sense of betrayal they have in this government. I ask our Prime Minister, who stands up for families and family life, and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) to look elsewhere for a location for a second airport. We should not repeat the mistakes of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport in one of the fastest-growing areas of Sydney where it will have an impact on over 100,000 homes. I have told the people of Hughes that I would fight for them on this issue-and I will not betray them. I come from a long line of heroes and I give my word of honour on this. My grandfather, Mr Donald Dempsey, and his brothers were ANZACs and he and two of his brothers paid the ultimate sacrifice over there. Of his two brothers who returned home, one was full of shrapnel and the other had the Military Medal. My father, Albert Ward, and his brothers fought for Australia in the Second World War and served in Syria, Egypt and Palestine. My husband, Bob, has a citation for bravery from the Royal Humane Society for the rescue of a pilot from the Georges River near Milperra in 1974. I tell you this, Mr Deputy Speaker, because I want the people of Hughes to take heart. They will look at me and see a small and insignificant woman but I have inherited the heart and the stomach of an ANZAC. I know how to fight and I will never desert them. From this time forward I am at one with them; they are my heartbeat and I am their voice. For them. I will take on what others tell me is impossible. I will fight this proposal to the death knock. I will do it with determination and I will do it with guts. I will do it for the people of Hughes and I will do it with the grace of God.",41
24,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,Unknown,"We have just heard some stirring words from the honourable member for Hughes (Mrs Vale). Unfortunately, however, I have heard it all before from those opposite. I look forward to hearing it more and more in the months ahead. The wails, shrieks and screams will start when they come to understand what they are actually doing. The contradiction inherent in that speech regarding economic rationalism and caring about families and people could not be more black and white. The address-in-reply gives the government an opportunity to layout its program for the 38th parliament. It provides an opportunity for the government to outline what it proposes. Opposition members can then outline their perspectives and projections. Effectively, this debate contrasts rhetoric and reality. It contrasts what has been proposed and what it actually means, and what the government puts forward to the people and what it is going to do. One cannot get past this question about truth and accuracy, and truth in budgeting and information. We hear that we are going to get truthful budget legislation to make sure that the right figures are revealed. That is quite interesting. Figures revealed to date for the March quarter absolutely confirm the statement from the previous government that the budget was in surplus. Figures released by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) the week after the election forecast a change in the deficit. As all in this House are well aware, 90 per cent of that change involves Treasury projections about growth and employment parameters, not government spending. The deficit that has been talked about by those opposite is one of their own making. It needs to take into account the $6.8 billion the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) promised the people that he would spend. He also promised them that he would give that spending preference over dealing with any budget deficit. In other words, he gave a solemn promise that, if the figures were wrong, he would run a deficit rather than cut those promises. We have seen how long that lasted. It did not last beyond the first week. Day by day and week by week we are seeing evidence of it. As recently as last week there was a massive attack on the state governments, which effectively was an attack on the people. The idea that somehow the state governments can find $1.5 billion without recourse to the community or wiping out services is just ludicrous. An article in the Sydney Morning Herald earlier in the week about it being a gun at the head approach was very apt. There was a proposed cut to the Public Service of 2,500 jobs through natural attrition. We are now looking at 20,000 or 30,000 job losses. I imagine that there would be 2,500 job losses north of Hornsby alone let alone in the rest of Australia. The Prime Minister was also very strong on the notion of job growth and the idea that small business would massively employ if given some concessions. I find it quite interesting that no-one ever seems able to explain to me why small business people would employ someone extra rather than buy a new car or house or have a holiday, which many of them need, if they made extra money because of a change in taxation or something else. Increasing profits and employing more people are supposed to be magically related. The fact that more than half of all small businesses employ nobody extra seems to escape some people. When small business grew or when company profits improved quite dramatically during our term, we did not necessarily see a concomitant increase in employment. The relationship between cutting provisional tax a.nd lifting employment is causal. It is a bit of mythology. Going slightly further than that, this govern1983 ment fails to understand that it has not learnt from its 13 years in opposition. We heard from the previous speaker about the state of the manufacturing industry when she was young. What she did not say-what she does not even know-and what those opposite have never understood is that the manufacturing industry we had was all based on overseas licences. The vast bulk of it was governed and controlled by licences, tools and equipment that were overseas owned and managed. The vast bulk of it was not Australian owned or native. That was not Australia's choice; it was a choice of the owners. Ericsson from Sweden, which had a plant in Australia, would not allow its product to be exported beyond Australia. That was not an Australian decision, but a decision by Ericsson in Sweden about the Australian product and licences. That sort of thing occurs with any company you care to name, be it Heinz or various others. This means that the opposition does not understand that, to generate real wealth and real long-term jobs, we have to generate extra production. That is what it is about. The idea that somehow small business people and single family businesses will generate increased production is a nonsense. Most of them require someone else to do the producing. Business is broken up into two kinds. The distinction is not between big and small businesses but between producers of wealth and recyclers of it. Most small businesses recycle wealth that someone else creates. They do it very well and it is a very important function. Unless the wealth is being generated by somebody, there is nothing to recycle. The steel producers, car makers, pharmacists, farmers and whoever generates that wealth are the ones that policy should be directed at. They can then generate more so that there is more to recycle. The idea that you can somehow regard small business as generating a greater national product for Australia is a nonsense and always has been. It was a nonsense when the opposition was previously non- in government. That explains its failure to understand the changing world and why in we inherited an economy, as the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) said, that was an industrial graveyard. The previous government had the task of taking Australia through the transition 10 years too late. It should have been done 10 to 15 years earlier when the world was changing. It was happening in Europe in the 1960s. Australia was held back by the coalition government because it failed to understand what was occurring in the world. The transition to technology changes, industry changes, changes in world trade, miniaturisation changes and computerisation changes-all those things-was postponed until we came to government. In making those decisions about that transition we had to take into account the effect they would have on the economy and on people. Our budget for last year and the budgets we projected for this year and the year after would have balanced people with the economy. They would have balanced the need for fiscal restraint and fiscal sensibility with the effect that would have on people. We are now seeing a jettison of that principle. When the now Treasurer says that our deficit was by choice, he is correct. It was by choice. The choice was either hurt more people and put more people on the scrap heap or carry a deficit for longer and allow the economy and productive growth to come through to recover. That was a choice, and it is the choice governments have to make. The government's whole strategy for this parliament is to reverse that choice and go back to the Fraser era and to the Thatcherite policies of attacking only the economy and disregarding the community. I hope the previous speaker will be shrieking and wailing loudly when she sees the unemployment these policies create, because these policies are draconian. We are talking about a government by its policy choices deliberately reducing growth by half a per cent, at least, in the next one, two or three years. It is deliberately choosing to reduce 40,000 jobs. That alone means that there will be 40,000 less jobs in the next year than there would have been otherwise. That is the price of a so-called budget surplus. It needs to be understood very carefully that governments make choices to balance social damage with economic damage. The two are interrelated and the task of government is to balance and explain those. What we hear from those opposite is never about people. All we hear is a mantra. This is government by mantra, government by slogan, government by quick quip. When the government's backbench starts to realise what their ideology and their economic policy really means to people, I hope they keep on screaming. Holsworthy has nothing on the impact their policies will have. Holsworthy is a drop in the bucket. People will be hurt much more and for longer by this economic strategy than by any airport. The choice between people and economy partly comes back to who works for whom. I think many parliamentarians on both sides of the chamber would share the view that the economy is there to support the community; the community is not there to support the economy. We do not sacrifice our people, our workers and our youth for some so-called economic goal or objective; we harness the people to make the economy work, and the economy works for the community. Let us look at what we have seen so far in terms of the rhetoric versus the reality. We have seen a shift to Telstra. We have seen a government say that foreign debt is bad and should be reduced, and then it introduces a bill to sell $2.8 billion worth of shares in a fully publicly owned company which will increase the foreign debt by $2.8 billion. Those shares will be acquired by local subsidiaries borrowing from overseas fund holders. So that will increase the foreign debt. The government is talking about reducing government debt. It is going to sell an asset which is now earning 13.5 per cent on its asset value to pay off debts which are costing seven per cent. This is a very clear set of strategies! If you can borrow money at seven per cent and earn 13.5 per cent on that money, people would say go and borrow some more and do more of that. If you can earn at least six per cent on your borrowings on behalf of the community, that is a good investment. But Telstra, which is earning 13.5 per cent on its $24 billion worth of assets, is to be sold to pay off debts which are costing, at most, seven per cent-it is probably closer to five per cent. This is clever economics? It is surprising that this has not sunk in. We have seen the government's changes to housing. It has cut the states back to a oneyear budget so they cannot plan ahead, wiped out any capacity for involvement in urban planning and at the same time moved towards a shift in a voucher system. What it is really doing is taking from the building industry and giving to the rental market increased rents all over Australia by giving people rental vouchers. It is not about helping people; helping certain segments of business. It displays an absolute ignorance of how our economy works. The other absolutely terrifying proposal that the government has on the table is the transfer to the states of a series of services-disability services, the home and community care program, hostels and nursing homes, and health. When people out there in the community realise what this means, they will be absolutely horrified because the Commonwealth is in those programs because they were not being done by the states. The Commonwealth does not go around volunteering money for programs if those programs are already being done. It funded them because no-one was doing them. If you look at the history of the SAAP program or the home and community care program, you will find that the Commonwealth is in them because the states were not doing them well enough, or at all. Why was the Commonwealth involved in the whole area of youth and youth homelessness? Because no-one was doing it. Nothing was happening. We had families and children in enormous difficulty. If you look at the history of that state by state around Australia, you will find that there are massive differences in services and standards. In one part of Australia the service is not equal to that in another part of Australia. We are not one country; we are seven, eight or nine for many issues. This government is now talking about abdicating responsibility-transferring relative functionality to charities and non-government organisations and transferring a lot of responsibilities to the state governments. People are elected to this parliament to represent Australia and to do national things, not to give away national responsibilities. I want to move to a more particular issue at the moment. In recent days a number of people have said that, for the 13 years I have sat in this parliament, I have been a relatively serious speaker. I am not frivolous by nature. I do not think I have ever been called to order for interjections. I have been quite strenuous in seeking clarification on a number of issues it is about in this parliament. There is a reason for that, and I think I need to explain it for you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and for the Speaker in his absence. I have sat here for 13 years watching: I watched the vilification of Speaker Childs-she was treated with absolutely vile behaviour. In the last couple of years I have watched those opposite-they are now in government-bring the role and function of parliament on to the national political agenda. It was a political issue. The independence of the Speaker was a political campaign and an election issue. The expectation created was very strong. Many of us agreed with that. Many of us on the other side were not comfortable with some of the things done or statements made by some of our colleagues. We actually believed that there would be some changes. What we have seen has been an absolute charade.",46
25,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member must be very careful not to cast reflections on the chair.,49
26,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,Unknown,"I am very careful, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am very mindful of the standing orders. What we have seen is an absolute charade. We have seen the Prime Minister goading the gallery to make noises. This is the Prime Minister who was going to change the standards. The Prime Minister said in his opening remarks to the parliament that things are going to change. The Speaker also made some opening remarks about what he was going to do about the independence of the parliament. I, for one, felt he would be under some pressure, so I was quite deliberate in asking a series of questions on interpretation, particularly standing order 82: anticipation of debate. If you look at those questions, you will see that I was very careful. I was actually trying to assist and clarify because it is very important, particularly for new speakers. The first few months for new speakers are very difficult, as I have observed in the past. Ministers do tend to run the show. I was very careful with those questions. The matter that I refer to now became obvious in recent days-the establishment of parliamentary committees, which some of us worked incredibly hard to get. The executive never wanted them. We worked very hard to maintain their funding and sovereignty. We watched them being taken over by the executive, by the Prime Minister appointing the chairmen. In other words, backbenchers lost ownership of their committees. Funding for committees has been lost; they have now been emasculated, with their capacity being reduced financially; and their functionality is now changing. That enraged me quite seriously and it became very obvious that all the rhetoric about the executive and the parliament was rhetoric. In the next six to 12 months the people out there will recognise that this government is doing more of what it complained about. Yesterday I heard the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) complaining about points of order-the hide and audacity of him in particular! Mr Randall-Like frivolous points of order.",49
27,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,Unknown,"I am not a frivolous person. I never make frivolous points of order and I never will. Read the standing orders and check the record and find out previous interpretations. Go back and read what your people were asking themselves. Mr Abbott- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the member is reflecting on the Speaker. He is claiming that the Speaker is not acknowledging good points of order.",50
28,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,There is no point of order. I did warn the member for Newcastle on that particular point.,50
29,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,Unknown,"I don't make loose points of order. I suggest that people go back and look at what was said in the previous parliament about points of order from this side, particularly from the person in the chair. Check what he was saying in his points of order and see what he is saying now. The new backbenchers should go and read Hansard. (Time expired)",50
30,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Before I call the honourable member for Bowman, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech. I ask the House to extend to her the usual courtesies.",50
31,Mrs WEST,Unknown,"Bowman) (12.35 p.m.)Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid. May I offer my congratulations to you on your appointment. Would you pass my congratulations to the Speaker and the other Deputy Speakers as each of you continue the duties in this 38th Australian Parliament. I congratulate our Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who, through his strong and steady leadership, was given a resounding vote of confidence by the Australian electorate. There has never been, and perhaps never will be again, the same make-up of elected representatives due to the extraordinary events of the previous 13 years. The choice of the Australian electorate on 2 March sent a resounding shout from the homes and workplaces across Australia that voters had had enough of Labor tyranny, they had had enough of the heavy-handed bureaucratic decree, and they had had enough of political representatives out of touch with the real needs of the Australian taxpayers, to whom all of us here today are accountable. For their part in electing me to this the House of Representatives I truly thank the electors of Bowman. It is with pride and humility that I look forward to representing their needs. I pledge today to represent all electors of Bowman, as this was part of our campaign theme-for all of us, not just for some. I congratulate all newly-elected members to the House. I extend to them my best wishes and look forward to working with all members in achieving our policy aims and goals. To the families, friends and communities of Australia who suffered loss and trauma at the tragedy at Port Arthur, I offer sincerest condolences from myself, my family and my constituents. The tragedy brings home the reality that no-one is safe from the terrors of a disturbed mind: that the sanctity and the quiet domain of a Sunday afternoon can be shattered by the actions of any aggrieved individual. If anything, this whole chapter must alert us to the signs and recognition of such disturbed individuals in the hope that their actions are monitored to prevent future tragedies. To the families and friends of those recently bereaved through the tragic accident in Townsville, I extend my sincere condolences from myself, my family and on behalf of the electorate of Bowman. To have so many young men die in such unprecedented circumstances in the course of training compounds our grief on such an occasion. I stand here today in this Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia having been chosen by the majority of Bowman electors and not for the simple reason, as some would have us believe, that it was time for a change. I give the majority of electors of Bowman a greater degree of political astuteness and acumen than that. You see, to actually get me to this seat I required a 7.4 per cent swing. On the day there was an initial 12.2 per cent swing to me. The result after the distribution of preferences was a substantial swing of 9.2 per cent, as compared with the national average to the Liberal Party of 4.9 per cent. What was once a fairly safe Labor seat is now considered a marginal Liberal seat. That really makes me feel very happy, knowing I have come from having no chance at all to one of being marginal- 'marginal', not marginalised. You see, no-one ever gave me or our campaign very much hope of achieving this outcome except, of course, my mother and father, who are here today to share with me this fantastic occasion. I am here now because of my parents' deep belief in me and their positive encouragement along with that of my immediate family, my husband, Jeremy, and children, Felicity, Anthony and Nicholas, who are here today to share this momentous occasion. Thank you for your love and belief and faith in me. To my brother Roger, sister Vanessa and my other brother, my very generous brother John, I truly thank you all for your support throughout the campaign. To the rest of the extended family a very sincere thank you. Although not many people gave us much hope of achieving the impossible, our little band of helpers just kept up a consistent effort. These included the state member for Mansfield, Frank Carroll, Warwick Parer and Jim Killen. Thank you for your advice and support. Mind you, we gave ourselves every hope of achieving the impossible. We did it with the assistance of my very capable and politically seasoned father as my campaign manager. I say 'seasoned' because he had spent a total of 20 years as an elected member of the Queensland state legislature as member for Mansfield. He had survived the rigours of party political struggles but, as the very best of any political survivor will attest, the only true determinant of your suitability to the job is the electorate. I followed this maxim: let the electorate be the judge, and this is where I believe the previous government went gravely wrong. They totally underestimated the feelings, needs and wishes of the electorate. The other motto which our team thoroughly believed in was the idea that if you think you are beaten you are. As an adjunct to this we were consistently inspired by that motivational phrase: nothing is impossible. With these ideas in tow, our small but dedicated band of helpers went about the arduous task of achieving the impossible. And guess what? I stand here before the House today, testimony to a belief in the philosophy that beats in the hearts of so many Australians: you can make the difference. It was also the collective good wishes of so many people I met through the campaign that gave us heart to just do it. To Sandra Major, Joan Callaghan, Sandy Fox Spencer, Bill Benson, Sam Sermen, Len Quirk, George and Elizabeth Alves and Peter Turnbull: thank you for your unswerving confidence and commitment to the cause. Where other campaigns ran on heaps of cash, ours ran on a shoestring budget. I will not tell you how much. Where other campaigns had numerous helpers, we had the same band of about 20. As the time grew short our network grew larger. I am very proud of the contribution that every branch member, friend of a branch member or acquaintance of a branch member made to the campaign. As well, to all those other supporters in the suburbs that networked so busily, thank you for your faith. My electorate, the seat of Bowman, was created in 1948 and named after David Bowman, a member of the state Legislative Assembly. He was elected to office in 1904 and remained there until his death in 1916. Such a political career path I would not wish to emulate. I would prefer to follow my father's way. He left the state legislature of his own accord, choosing retirement after 20 years of dedicated service to the electorate of Mansfield. My electorate's namesake was also part of an unusual coalition, a Liberal-Labor coalition, something I dare say we will never see again in our political lifetimes. The for this is the distinctly opposing views of political ideology. This factor was clearly evident on 2 March of this year. John Howard in his victory speech said that the things that united Australians were infinitely more important than the things that divided Australians. It is because of that positive thinking that we sit here today in this the most historic parliament in Australia's electoral history testimony to the belief that the will of the majority has prevailed. That particular fundamental tenet of democracy also covers the right of the minority to be heard. The Australian electorate has chosen a significant blend of talent and character. There have never been as many women elected to our side of the House as was accomplished on 2 March, and we did it without quotas. This blended representation will broaden by far the lengths and depths of understanding of the diversity of the Australian electorate. Not least important in this blend will be the distinctive feminine influence brought to the House. I look forward to the challenge in the time ahead and of achieving change--change which the electorate expects us to deliver, change from the invasive socialistic government of the past to a more responsive, compassionate reflection of the community at large where the will of the majority prevails. All of us here aspire to the giddy heights of political prominence, but we must never let our political ambitions detract from the core of our principles, and that is to serve our electorate. In line with this, we would do well to take on the character of statesmanship rather than that of politician. For as the clergyman James Freeman Clarke once said, 'A politician thinks of the next electioh, a statesman of the next generation.' I am very conscious of the state of politics today and I am very conscious of the need to restore the people's faith in politicians. We need to be strong of character and purpose and we need to be conscious of the need to conduct our business in the House with the required and expected dignity. I believe that faith in politicians is being rf<stored by the efforts of every returned and reason elected member in this House. From my our observations so far, all members-with a few exceptions-are actively engaged in upholding the dignity of their office. For myself, though, I will always be conscious politically of what is right and wrong, for nothing which is morally wrong can ever be politically right. For my part, I can honestly say that I am glad I was born when I was. There is no other period of history that I believe would provide for me a more important era. For you see, Mr Deputy Speaker, I belong to that generation that knows what life was like pre TV. Yes, I am that old. And yes, I grew up in a neighbourhood where we had to walk down the street to watch TV at a neighbour's house. Home life was exceptionally busy, with all the domestic chores that the whole family participated in. It was a time when neighbourhood gangs went hiking into the bush, played street cricket and cops and robbers, and generally had good, clean fun. Sadly, the connotations of the word 'gang' today strike a very different note, one of fear and dread, one in which personal safety is at risk. My time as a child was also a time when grandma lived within the family. Those halcyon days pre TV, of neighbourhood camaraderie and the security of the nuclear family are all but memories of a long lost past. Our present state of family deterioration is not a legacy of the past but a product of the present-a product of rash and senseless policy over the last 13 years which has aided and, indeed, set the foundations for the deterioration of family life as we used to know it. The seeds of deterioration were set within the community as long ago as 1972, with the easy availability of divorce and the do-yourown-thing social credo. We can look back now and reflect that sex, drugs and rock and roll have brought us to the very brink of moral decay. His Honour Judge MCGuire, President of the Children's Court of Queensland, recently made several observations attesting to this point. He stated: There are fractures in our civil society. The moral order is breaking down. The family is failing. He went on to say: Moral leadership is all about exemplifying excellence. Morality is about developing a now little understood and almost forgotten word-virtue. It is about faith, duty, courage, generosity, trust, discipline and love. As a past teacher, some of the children I have taught have had a fragmented home life, fed on a diet of endless TV and video games. The post Port Arthur period has given us the opportunity to assess the effect and impact of videos-and, indeed, TV-on the development of acceptable models of behaviour. Parents are the primary arbiters of what constitutes acceptable models of behaviour. I would encourage parents to have the confidence in themselves as primary care givers to grasp the nettle and, in the words of a famous song, teach your children well. Try to be positive, firm and frank. Take time to listen to them and to talk with them-not at them. And, most of all, give them time to be just that-children. Another issue of a domestic nature is my advice to mothers that we have created a society where it is expected that a woman can only have a fulfilling life outside the home. Yes, we should have equal work for equal pay. But let us also have equal respect for the choices women make. Let us not devalue or ignore the rights of women who choose the home or work life. There is always a price we pay for the decisions we make. Where the economic pressures are so demanding, there is no choice other than a working lifestyle to support your family. However, the formative years of childhood should be recognised for what they are-the foundations for personality and behavioural patterns. We are seeing the effects now, some years down the track, of unsupervised TV habits, little listening time and the expectation that material possessions are the hallmarks of good parenting and social acceptance. I consider the points I have just described to be the substance of the duty with which I have been charged to carry out on behalf of the constituents of Bowman. My responsibility and duty, for one thing, is to safeguard the sanctity of the family. As the primary source of security and growth for our future, the homes and families of Bowman are my first concern. We have a wonderful opportunity with this new government to do a lot of good. selfThose in genuine need have the governmental network to assist them in difficult times. Bowman has several interagency networks operating to meet the needs of families and members of the community in times of crisis. The Redland Community Centre provides valuable assistance to a variety of members of the community in terms of legal advice, health and recreational advice, the provision of educational support for parents and crisis support. The local, state and federal spheres are involved in the expansion of these services with cooperation and management planning. As these are so successful in their operation in the Redland area of my electorate, I will work to improve facilities at the Wynnum end of the electorate as well. These facilities need the support of both state and federal funding to see this venture completed successfully. To this end, the provision of a permanent multipurpose community facility needs to be established to house community information and to be a meeting place central to all within the local area. Bowman is an electorate brimming with natural and human resources. The islands, the history, the fishing and boating pursuits and the Aboriginal history of Moreton Bay combine to provide a potential boom for tourism in this area. The energies of dedicated local entrepreneurs have provided great potential for the tourism industry. The small business community, through their chambers of commerce, foster and develop business and employment opportunities. The region's development is in the hands of local, state and federal government and must be monitored and nurtured wisely. An area that needs monitoring is the long term plans and provision for water resources to meet the growing needs of our Redland shire. To manage this resource effectively, we need to plan for the next five, 10 and 20 year time frames so that supply meets demand. The success of our long-term planning can only be determined by what is being done now to ensure the security and availability of this most precious resource. The Port of Brisbane is the gateway to the rest of the Australian capital cities. With the completion of the standard gauge rail link to the port, there is now the distinct possibility of cheaper transportation costs, with Brisbane being the first port of call for overseas importers. This possibility will become a reality through the vision and enterprise of the federal and state governments and those on the waterfront and in the boardrooms of the companies that want this enterprise to succeed. I cannot overemphasise the importance which I attach to the issues concerning families and youth, business and enterprise, the environment and communities in my electorate and across the nation today. These things are, above all else, the cornerstones of our society. How we develop, nurture, support and encourage each of these to succeed will ensure progress towards a caring, prosperous society. It was the previous government that sought to tear down the very fabric of our society. The very fabric of family, business and our future prospects was torn apart with the intrusive negative belief that the state was the primary source of all power. The electorate put paid to that notion on 2 March. The previous government's records rated pretty highly. There were higher rates of divorce, higher rates of domestic violence, higher rates of single parenthood, higher rates of youth suicide and higher rates of small businessmen going to the wall. As the new government we have the responsibility and opportunity to do something about reversing these trends. As a politician I will work towards a remedy for the woes which beset the lives of many of my constituents. I will work towards providing employment for all by encouraging smarter labour market programs and by building on the successes already established. I will endeavour to foster a more caring and compassionate response from bureaucrats who have lost touch with the clients they serve. It is the responsibility of all Australians to work towards a less violent and intimidating society. The legislation from this parliament must reflect those basic guarantees of security, compassion and hope and reflect broader acceptable community standards. As the member for Bowman I will do everything in my power to address these issues and will make a start by providing answers and solutions. It will take a great deal of effort, but with a lot of hard work you can achieve almost anything. In conclusion, may I just state that I intend to do my very best for the constituents of Bowman. Anything less would be a gross failing on my part. With this in mind, let me echo the words of John Galsworthy, the British author, when he said: I shall pass through this world but once. Any good things, therefore, that I can do, or any kindness that I can show to any human being let me do it now. Let me not deter it or neglect it.  p.m.)-I would like to congratulate the member for Bowman on making her first speech in this chamber, and I extend to her a welcome to the chamber. May I ask you, Madam Deputy Speaker, through your good offices, to formally convey to the Speaker my congratulations on his election to high office. As one listens to the speeches that have been made over recent times from new arrivals in this parliament one can only feel some concern for them because, undoubtedly, as the days, weeks and months pass the expectations that they are enunciating of their own government are going to be dashed. We know that the promises that were made by the current government in the run-up to the election cannot possibly be fulfilled. It will be a matter, as time passes, of reminding them and the Australian public of the broken promises, some of which have already surfaced. We will be reminding them every day of every week of every month of every year of the false expectations and the false promises they have made. But I do have a concern for a number of the new members who, I believe, quite genuinely expect that the promises that they have made and are party to will be fulfilled. We know and their superiors know that they will not and cannot be fulfilled. When one looks at the leadership of the Howard government it can be seen that it is a government of economic rationalism-it prides itself upon that. I have listened to some of the speeches over recent days and I have heard some of the speakers from the government side decrying economic rationalism. It makes one wonder at how little information is distributed among government members themselves and certainly information is not being passed down from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and senior ministers to members of their own backbench, otherwise a number of the comments that have been made in recent weeks would not have been made by government members. As the days pass, they will see the evidence of the economic rationalism within their own government and they will see their expectations dashed. They will then have to explain to the people who supported them on 2 March why they are breaking their promises, why they are adding to unemployment and why they are not carrying out the promises made, particularly in respect of business. This government does not have a wages policy. It has a 'Cross my heart, hope to die, trust us, things will work out okay' policy. The government has already enunciated a very strict fiscal policy. It is already back into its old kilter of the Fraser government: chopping public expenditure, labelling and decrying federal public servants and hammering away at anything that in any way is connected to the public sector as if it is some kind of alien action, something to be despised and something that ought to be excised from our economy and from our community. That is not new, but the cuts in government expenditure and the cuts to federal public services mean worse service. At grassroots level-at the domestic level-it means fewer public servants, longer delays, poorer service and more mistakes for the people who have to use major departments like the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and the Department of Social Security. Every member of this House will be dealing with that a little later on as the effect of those cuts starts to bite. Turning to regional Australia, it should be recognised that 85 per cent of federal public servants do not work in Canberra; they work out in regions like the Hunter and Central Coast regions of Australia. That is where people live and that is where the services are required, particularly those areas with a high retiree population. The demand for services from departments like the Department of Social Security is all the more needed in those areas and the services are all the more important. As those cuts bite and as people start to realise that the cuts affect the services they are going to get, there will also be a flow-on effect into the local economy; there will be a flow-on effect into regional Australia. The Labor governments of recent years pursued a policy of regionalising federal government services; we set about taking federal government services out to where the people are. We did not just have a Department of Social Security office in Newcastle, one in Gosford and others in Sydney. Services were expanded so that there was a Department of Social Security regional office in Charlestown-in my electorate-and offices in Cardiff, Newcastle, Mayfield, Maitland, Wyong, The Entrance and Gosford. The services were taken out to where the people are. In that way people get a better service. The people who need those services often do not have the means of getting around easily and it improves the service. Also, having more federal officers working in regional Australia generates more jobs for people servicing those officers in regional Australia. What we are seeing is simply a reversion to the old Fraser-Howard government policy of centralism. They mouth regionalism and they mouth anti-centralism, but they practise centralism, pulling everything back to south of Sydney Harbour Bridge or back to Canberra. What it is going to mean is worse service-worse service for veterans, worse service for pensioners, worse service for the unemployed and worse service for people in higher education. In our Hunter and Central Coast regions there has already been a freeze on funding for employment and training projects. Staff are being cut from the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. There is a double whammy involved for unemployed people because there are fewer employment projects and fewer federal training projects, so there is less opportunity to to get the training needed to get a job, and there are fewer jobs to be had. On top of that, because of the cuts in departmental staff, there are fewer departmental people available to provide service. Then on top of that comes a triple whammy: with the 30 per cent cut in funds for Skillshare centres and the freezing of funding, with funding only until September of this year, it means that even community based organisations like Skillshare, which have performed a herculean task and provide an excellent service operating from a community basis, are going to have less ability to train people and also to place those people in employment. So it is back to the old Fraser-Howard government policies of the past: stigmatise the unemployed, name them, demean them, reduce the number of jobs available, try to change industrial relations and then put more pressure on people who are out of work to accept lower conditions, poorer pay and longer hours. There is one simple slogan that is unspoken by this government but which best summarises what their policies mean. What they are really about when we are dealing with unemployed people, training, industrial relations and awards is 12 hours work for eight hours pay. That is the slogan of this government, that is what they want: 12 hours work for eight hours pay. If you look at all of the packages they have been putting together over recent weeks and what is coming in the budget, it is about reducing the ability of people to get a fair return for their labour and it is about reducing the conditions that go with that. I am particularly concerned that we have already seen cuts of almost 10,000 in the federal Public Service and further predicted cuts of almost 20,000. My concern is about the impact that this is going to have on the Central Coast and on the Hunter region as a flow-on or multiplier effect. Taken together with the impact upon Skillshare, it is just going to make jobs scarcer and harder to find and there will be fewer resources to help people get those jobs. When one looks through the address-in reply and through the statements made before try the election and listens to the speeches being made by ministers opposite-I excuse the backbench because a lot of them do not know yet and have not realised yet what lies ahead of them-one sees that this is a government of deception. I will go through some of the deceptions. We had an election campaign of general and vague promises. Effectively, what the coalition said was, 'Whatever the Labor government is providing, yes, we will provide the same thing-you wouldn't have Keating as Prime Minister, but we will provide everything else. Higher education-yes, protected; employment training-yes, protected; funding for industry-yes, it will be there. Everything will be there.' You can go through all of the papers issued before the election. The deception that was practised! Let us go first to the deception that was practised on families. The most important issue for a family is to have a family income, for there to be a breadwinner or however many there are working in the family. But they must have incomes-that drives everything else. I have referred to the attack on the trade union movement and the way members of trade unions and trade union officials are scorned and stigmatised by this government as though they were undesirable people. When a member of a trade union is stigmatised, the family of that person is also stigmatised and demeaned. So step 1 for the government is an attack on members of trade unions. Step 2 is an attack on trade union officials and the organisations themselves. Trade unions are like business organisations: some are better than others. They are there to serve their constituencies, and some do it better than others. After having an income, health and shelter, health services are the next thing of great importance to families. The Liberal and National parties eventually had to give up trying to abolish Medicare because they realised that the Australian public wanted the services and protection that Medicare provide. They said, 'We will protect Medicare. We will maintain Medicare.' Who said that? It was the same man who said it during the term of the Fraser-Howard government-the now Prime Minister. At that time he said, 'We will maintain Medibank.' During the life of Medibank, in the seven years of the FraserHoward government, there were nine different health schemes, each one worse than the last. That is why people turned back to the Hawke government in 1983-they wanted Medicare and full health protection. What the present government is really saying, and what the coming days will reveal, is that it will maintain Medicare in name but not in nature. The government has already signalled various changes. Whether it will be a co-payment, a change in the amount of payment to doctors or removing support from another form of service, only time will tell. Pharmaceutical benefits are linked to that. It is also very clear even at this stage, so ahead of the budget, that pharmaceutical benefits are going to be chopped. There is going to be an increased charge to families, to users of pharmaceutical benefits. So two health areas-Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits-are involved; but the worse thing is the unloading of responsibility for health services and aged care services onto the states. Federal governments are there to provide for people the services they cannot provide for themselves. That is why governments exist. The federal government is involved in health services because it has been proven over the 95 or 96 years of federation that, as a nation, Australians ought to be able to expect the same standards of health care whether they are in this part of the continent, or a few hundred kilometres to the north, or up over the Queensland border, or south of the Victorian border. As Australians, when we are ill, we ought to have access to the same standards of health care. This government is proposing to transfer that responsibility back to the states and to fragment it. Members opposite can say, 'Oh, no, no' - just let time pass and they will see. If the states are stupid enough to fall into this trap, health services will be degraded and fragmented. The next deception of this government concerned youth unemployment. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) has said that between 27 per cent and 35 per cent of youth are unemployed. Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training is his proper title, but I always think of him as the minister for ideology. This is the man who wrote all the ideological speeches for Prime Minister Fraser. He wrote the hard right, far right, Genghis Khan stuff that came out of the Fraser government. The current minister was the author of that; and nothing has changed. When I hear him speak and read his words, I know they are the sameMr Abbott-On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker: I do not wish to intrude on the member's speech unduly, but it is a bit rich to suggest that a minister is Genghis far Khan. I suggest that he could rephrase his speech to get his point across without throwing those kinds of epithets about too lightly.  mentary secretary misheard me. I referred to the words of the minister as 'Genghis Khan', not the minister himself. I would never do that. Far be it for me to ever suggest anything like that. Mr Abbott-Thank you.  deception on youth unemployment, let me turn to the admirable article not by some radical writer and not by somebody who is regarded as a greatly progressive writer or in any way associated with the Labor side of politics but by Ross Gittins in the Sydney Morning Herald of 12 June 1996 entitled 'Howard's unemployment hoax. I recommend all members read this article because he is putting across at this stage, three months after the election, what we were trying to get across before the election. He says: Everyone of us knows there are lies, damn lies and statistics ... Referring to youth unemployment, he says: Can you imagine that this mere statistic could become so deeply entrenched in people's consciousness that anyone who attempted to expose the statistic for what it was would be rejected immediately as someone trying to lie to them with statistwith ics. He explains: The statistic in question is the youth unemployment rate which at present is an appalling 27 per cent. He refers to former Prime Minister Keating's commitment to the long-term unemployed and the job compact. He makes the point that Prime Minister Howard has neither in the campaign nor now made any reference whatsoever to the plight or the needs of long-term unemployed. He goes on to say: We never talk about the number of young people who can't find full-time jobs; we only talk about the youth unemployment rate. He asks: How many kids are there who can't find jobs? There are 1.3 million kids between 15 and 19. How can 27 per cent of them be unemployed? If there were 27 per cent of them unemployed, that would mean 350,000 were out of work. But the actual figure is 90,000-seven per cent, not 27 per cent. The honourable minister might have made a mistake and put a two in front of it. But it is not 27 per cent or 32 or 35 or 34; it is seven per cent of people between 15 and 19 who are unemployed. He goes on to explain: Only 330,000 are in the full-time labour force. Of those, 240,000 have full-time jobs and 90,000 are still looking for one. He goes on to refer to the fact that when Mr Howard left office as Treasurer in April 1983 the number of unemployed teenagers was much higher than it is now. It was 150,000 people between 15 and 19 who were out of work. Today it is 90,000. This is, as he says, 'Howard's unemployment hoax.' I am going to hammer that through wherever I can. The article further says: It is a scandal all right: the scandal of politicians seeking to exploit the public's misconceptions rather than correct them. They are perpetuators of the great youth unemployment hoax. The honourable minister I referred to earlier is party to that. The other deception being practised is in respect of small business. Some of the new members come from small business, as did I in an earlier life. What I grieve about is the cruel deception being practised on small business. There are 798,000 firms less than 100 employees. They are called small business. Forty-eight per cent of those firms do not employ anybody. In other words, they are self-employed business people. Of those firms, 17 per cent are in the manufacturing industry. The ones we hear most noise about are those who are small retailers. Their expectations are being raised by this government about how prosperity will reign forever because Prime Minister Howard has been elected. I just feel deeply for those people. They are going to be gravely disappointed because this government is about the big end of town; it is not about small business. It has never been about small business.",50
32,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,"Oh, come on!  experience. It has never been about small business. I will say more to the Chief Government Whip about that later. Let me just finish with the words of big business, because it has been deceived also. In the Sydney Morning Herald of 8 May this year Mr Gerry Harvey of Harvey Norman's said: We thought things would improve when John Howard was elected Prime Minister on March 2, but since he got in, it has only got worse. We point to the deception being practised right across the community. It is a pity that people are going to have to suffer because of the exaggerated claims made by this government. (Time expired)",58
33,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! Before I call the honourable member for Makin, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech and I ask the House to extend to her the usual courtesies.",58
34,Mrs DRAPER,Unknown,"Makin) (1.15 p.m.)Before I begin my speech I would like to convey my sympathies to the families and friends of those who were taken so tragically at Port Arthur. I also wish to express my admiration for the courageous work of the emergency services, police, nurses, doctors, hospital staff and counsellors who had to deal with the aftermath of this awful tragedy. While the nation is still coming to terms with the mourning, we are faced with the loss of the lives of 18 of our finest Defence Force personnel in the shocking accident near Townsville last week. I extend my condolences to the families of these fine men and offer my best wishes for a speedy recovery to those who survived this unfortunate accident. I would like to put on record my recognition of the contribution our Defence Force personnel make to our security which enables us to enjoy the freedoms that we have today. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you, Madam Deputy Speaker Crosio, and, through you, the Speaker and other Deputy Speakers on your election. It is a great honour and privilege to present my first speech in this place and to represent the people of my electorate. Makin was created in 1984 and was held by the Labor  federal election; and I acknowledge his work in representing the people of Makin. I wish to sincerely thank the electors of Makin who placed their faith and trust in me on 2 March. They have charged me not only with the challenges but also with the responsibility to represent them and voice their concerns and aspirations in this place. I would like to assure the Makin electors I will serve them to the best of my ability. The electorate of Makin is named after the Hon. Norman Makin who, as Sir James Killen informed me, had a very long and distinguished parliamentary career. In the words of Sir James Killen, Norman Makin was a great and decent bloke. In his first speech in this place, Peter Duncan stated that Norman Makin was noted for his lifelong fight against poverty and inequality as well as for peace. These are, as all members of this House would agree, most noble ideals for which many of us would also strive. The Makin electorate, with a population of over 88,000 electors, is mainly residential. There are over 2,500 small businesses and the electorate incorporates three local government areas, Tea Tree Gully, Salisbury and Port Adelaide-Enfield, as well as the state electorates of Newland, Florey, Playford and Wright. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my state colleagues, Mr Sam Bass and the Hon. Scott Ashenden, for their assistance and support. I especially thank Mrs Dorothy Kotz, the member for Newland, for her counsel and encouragement. Makin is a wonderful area to live in and represent. It is a rapidly developing area, well serviced by schools, transport, shopping and recreational facilities. But it is also an area of high youth unemployment and of many families struggling to make ends meet. The reason why so many people voted for a change of government on 2 March was that under the previous Labor government poverty, inequality and unemployment continued to increase. According to the 1996 UNICEF report, The Progress of Nations, Australia has an overall child poverty rate of 10 per cent and more than 50 per cent of Australian children in sole parent families are living below the poverty line. This crisis did not occur between 2 March and today. The results of the UNICEF report illustrate with great clarity the abysmal and monumental failures of the policies of the former Labor government, which claimed to stand on a platform of social justice. During the 14 months I was a candidate for the federal election, my campaign team, ably led by my two campaign managers, Trevor Johnson and John Dawkins, organised a door-knocking team to accompany me while I worked through the electorate. I would like to take this opportunity to thank both Trevor and John for their tremendous efforts over many months-and I am pleased to be able to acknowledge John, who is with us here today in the gallery. The electors of Makin, including many former Labor supporters, told me that they expected things to get better after the recession that we had to have. They believed Mr l-a-w Keating when he promised that he would deliver and that he was bringing home the bacon. Well, he did not bring home the bacon; in fact, the cupboard was left bare and with an $8 billion deficit. In reality, what was happening to many families all over Australia was that by the end of the pay week they were struggling simply to pay their grocery bills, because of the high interest rates and unemployment created by the former Labor government. By the end of the week it was a struggle to keep up with the basics of bread and milk and school lunches. With high unemployment, more families were relying on the services of charity groups in the non-government sector in order to survive on a day-today basis. Community service providers in the non-government sectors have been increasingly overwhelmed by desperate requests for diminishing resources from many families unable to cope. Another concern expressed by many parents was that they worked hard for many years to give their children better opportunities in life, but, after many years of struggling, their children were left without jobs or hope for the future-becoming yet another statistic. What the former Labor government managed to achieve, even with the much heralded accord, Working Nation, the infamous unfair dismissal laws and a social justice platform, is a lost generation of youth-lost not to a war or to catastrophe, but lost to the despair and hopelessness of unemployment. That is one of the many legacies left by the Hawke-Keating Labor governments. I ask: where is the social justice in unemployment? Australia was once a land of opportunity where effort was fairly rewarded and you could aspire to gaining employment and buying a house on a quarter-acre block with a Hills hoist in the backyard, which is what my father aspired to some years ago. My mother and father migrated to Australia from Germany after the Second World War. At the age of 22 my father arrived on Australia's shores with two pounds in his pocket, the work clothes on his back, a suit for church on Sundays, and his much loved banjo. The first thing he did was set about finding a job. Within a few weeks he was working for the railways. His accommodation was a tent in which he lived for nearly two years at Islington, which in the 1950s was known as tent city. My mother, over the years, taught herself not only to speak and read English but also to write it-without, I might add, any government assistance. My mother, who passed away 12 years ago, is not able to share this special day with me. However, my mother did see her daughter join the navy and follow her footsteps in nursing, her chosen career. Although she is not here today, I know she would be extremely proud. My father was anxious to secure an apprenticeship as a mechanic, which he eventually did in Gawler, South Australia. By this time he was married and starting a family. As apprenticeships did not pay much, he worked at a second job to make ends meet, as well as repairing boots and shoes in his spare time. My father was eventually able to start his own business, which became very successful over the years. However, with the incoming Whitlam government, businesses started to decline and continued to the point where, as a small businessman who once employed three or four, he currently employs only one person. I would like to mention, for the benefit of the members on the other side, that as family members we also worked in the business from an early age. I have often washed my hands in Sol vol and I can assure those members on the other side that my father still washes his hands in Solvol, even after almost 40 years in business. My parents taught us to work hard, to be independent, to stand up for what we believe in, and never to take no for an answer. For these values I am thankful, as their influence on my life encouraged and fostered my interest in community affairs. Many business people in Makin, including my father, voiced their concerns in relation to the unfair dismissal laws, bureaucratic red tape and taxation. The No. 1 impediment to employing more people was the shackles of the unfair dismissal laws. I commend our Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard, on keeping the first of his many election promises made during the campaign of setting up a small business deregulation task force with a specific charter to investigate ways in which the burden of compliance with red tape can be halved. The task force must report within six months so that the implementation of the recommendations can commence as soon as possible. This will allow small businesses more time to devote to doing what they do best, that is, creating job opportunities for expansion and growth. I would also like to commend the Minister for Industrial Relations, the Hon. Peter Reith, as I have great faith in his comprehensive, fair and constructive industrial relations policies, which will help small businesses in Makin to get moving again. Though we are especially concerned with youth unemployment, unemployment in general is also of great concern. It is beyond my comprehension that even with all their advisers, the accord, revolvingdoor training schemes and previous years in government, members on the opposite side have failed to learn one of several simple fundamental aspects of basic business practice; that is, if employers are either unwilling or unable to employ people, then there are simply fewer job opportunities for the unemployed. For every person unemployed there is a double debit on the ledger. There is a decrease in income tax revenue and a corresponding increase in expenditure which contributes to a higher budget deficit, leading to increased payments on interest and so on. Hence, there is less money to spend on health, education and welfare for those in genuine need. Many people in the Makin electorate believe that the main achievement of the ACTU over the years has been the elevation of union officials into safe federal parliament seats. Where was the ACTU on unemployment? What did the ACTU do for our unemployment queues? Rather than looking after bluecollar workers and the unemployed, they looked after former ACTU presidents, treating the Labor front-bench as their retirement home. While I am disappointed that the ALP has been unable to select more women for winnable seats, especially in Blaxland and Batman, I have no doubt that, on past performances, Jennie George is on her way here. During the election campaign, and since becoming the member for Makin on 2 March, I have had many constituent inquiries in relation to the Child Support Agency. I am pleased that the minister responsible for the Child Support Agency, the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Jim Short, and his department are working towards addressing the problems that many clients and staff have to face on a continuing basis. Many constituents feel that the child support formula is unfair, as it is calculated on taxable income minus exempt income, rather than on net income, which is the amount of money the non-custodial parent has to live on in real terms. Many people have conveyed to me that, in their view, the reason why child support payments are avoided is the perception by non-custodial parents that the formula appears to be unfair. I give notice to Senator Short that this is an issue that I am prepared to investigate and pursue in support of both custodial and non-custodial parents. Aged care and its future direction is an issue that is very close to my heart. After completing my nurses training in the Australian Navy, I moved into the area of aged care. For the last four years I have had the honour and pleasure of working for a Christian based private nursing home and hostel where the resident care is of an extremely high standard. The dedication of the nursing, domestic and administrative staff and the management team was truly inspirational. It needs to be so because of the many problems we, as carers, face on an ongoing basis. South Australia has a higher than average proportion of people over 65. The need for respite beds is not currently being met, with 140 people desperate for nursing home beds which are not available. The most pressing problem for those working in aged care, particularly in hostels, is that the incoming residents are the frail aged, and more and more are being admitted with high-care dependency due to dementia. Carers have an important role within our community, whether they are in the paid work force or are caring for family members in the home environment. The dedication of carers in our society cannot be underestimated, and this is an area that needs to be monitored and addressed in the not too distant future. There is another health area that causes me great concern and that is what is happening to those within our community with mental health problems. While many cope with medication and family support, there are also those who do not have family or community support. The extent to which deinstitutionalisation has proceeded in the so-called interest of the mentally ill needs to be reviewed. Perhaps it is time we revisited the Burdekin report and seriously considered its recommendations. We also need to consider what the term 'quality of life' really means. With a young family to raise in a society where there is much peer pressure, I am concerned about the amount of pornography that is readily available. I recently raised an issue with the Office of Literature and Film Classification. In a sports magazine that young children purchase to read about their basketball heroes were four photos taken from editions of American Playboy. As the magazine concerned is a sports magazine, it is not required to pass through the classification process. Many parents raised their concerns that a magazine promoting sport should be allowed to print pornography, regardless that some people regard the photographs as 'soft porn'. Some may recall the film Salo and the controversy that arose around that film. I actively opposed the screening of that film in Adelaide. What message do we convey to our young people when we allow such pornographic films portraying the brutalisation and the physical, sexual and emotional abuse of children to be screened? We have seen and heard much about sexually abused children in recent times and yet we do little to limit the number of pornographic films and the amount of pornographic literature available. I also believe that the time has come to take a firm stance on violence in films, on television, videos and in electronic games. To that end, I commend the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Richard Alston, for setting up the ministerial committee to look at the portrayal of violence in the various forms of electronic media. I look forward to any recommendations that committee makes stemming the availability of violence being portrayed by the electronic media. No-one becomes a member of this House without great support from family, friends, and the hard workers of political parties. I am pleased to acknowledge my federal electorate committee chairman, Mrs Wendy Benson, who is in the gallery today. Wendy and her FEC team provided the financial and physical support that is required to make a campaign work. The hours of letterboxing, door-knocking and fundraising that went into making the Makin campaign so successful could not have been achieved without the support so willingly given. My family and friends were always there when they were needed and to them. I say thank you. One's electorate committee, family and friends are also the people who keep your feet on the ground and who give that little bit more when the going gets tough; and their personal sacrifices make it possible for the candidate to do those extra hours of campaigning. The Makin campaign also had tremendous support from Senator Nick Minchin and the Hon. Ian MCLachlan. Their counsel assisted me many times throughout the months of the campaign and for that I sincerely thank them. The support and friendship also given by the Barker federal electorate committee could not have been better and is a credit to the hard working members of that FEC, and also acknowledges the respect and esteem in which they hold their federal member, Ian MCLachlan. I would also like to acknowledge the help and advice from Senators Grant Chapman and Alan Ferguson, as well as my other federal and state colleagues. Without the encouragement of Senator Nick Minchin and Dorothy Kotz, I would not be in this chamber making this speech today. It was their encouragement that made me take the first step and stand for preselection, and I am grateful for their ongoing support and assistance. I am pleased that my three sons are also here today. Christopher, Graham and Michael have had to come to terms with their mum being in Canberra, but I can say to my boys that what their mother hopes to achieve in this place is to secure a better Australia for them and their generation, which can provide a lifestyle and job opportunities to allow them to achieve their aspirations in the future. During the hectic days of the campaign, my seven-year-old son Michael asked me if I would come to school with him one particular morning. When I asked why, he said he wanted to take his mum to his class for show and tell because she was the candidate for Makin. It is always difficult as a parent juggling work commitments and family responsibilities. However, I felt most humbled, as children only ever want to show and tell their most precious treasures, and it was with great pride that I held my son's hand as he led me into his classroom. To my nine-year-old son Graham, who has had to temporarily give up his basketball games because of my commitments in Canberra: I know you are a great basketball player but an even better football player, which we manage on Saturday mornings at least. I hope that one day you will be able to realise your dreams of playing for one of the greatest football teams in the AFL, the Adelaide Crows. To my 12-year-old son Chris: for all the hard work you have done for your mum, the chores, the vacuuming, washing, ironing, dishes, cooking and feeding the pet yabbies-born during the campaign-and our other pets. All three of you have been terrific: thank you for being here in the gallery today. To my partner, Paul, whom I love dearly, and who also helped with the many household chores: without your support I would never have survived the campaign-and I am sorry that Zara and Alex could not be with us today. As I said earlier today, nobody gets to this place on their own, without the support of family and special friends. To Kathy and Debbie, my stepmum Liz, my best friend Sarah and her family: thanks to you all. But especially, most of all, thanks to you, Paul. Finally, I again thank the electors of Makin for giving me the opportunity to represent them in this great place.",59
35,Dr THEOPHANOUS,Unknown,"Let me begin by congratulating the member for Makin (Mrs Draper) on her maiden speech. It is very pleasing that we have more women in the parliament, and it is particularly pleasing that we have women who are from non-English speaking backgrounds. The honourable member asserted that she had a German background, and I am sure that will stand her in good stead in the discussion of many important issues in this place. I noticed that she mentioned the words 'social justice' on a number of occasions in her speech. That is in great contrast to what the government said officially in the speech by the Governor General. If there is one thing that would strike anyone, especially anyone interested in the philosophical differences between the parties, it is the absence of any reference to social justice: the terms 'social issues' and 'social justice' are never used in the Governor General's speech. We have a government claiming to be a government for all Australians, claiming to have an agenda, but the Governor General's speech, which must be one of the shortest Governor General's speeches in many yearscertainly the shortest since I have been here in parliament, and that has been some timehad little substance about what the government was doing. It also failed to refer to a central part of the concerns of the Australian people, that is, all those questions on social justice. The term 'social justice' was never used. That is not surprising if you analyse the document. Here is a new government: you would think that there would be a pronouncement of their philosophy, their direction, and what they are trying to do. But what do you find in this very thin document-the thinnest Governor General's statement for a long time? You find very little that gives us any indication of where they stand as a political party under John Howard as Prime Minister. That is not surprising because, if you follow the philosophy and the philosophical texts in relation to the pronouncements of John Howard-and much has been written about his pronouncements over the years-you become thoroughly confused. It is very hard to know where John Howard stands on the key issues. That is because he has changed his position so many times on these issues that it is hard for us to know where he is coming from and where he is going to. A while ago he described himself as the most conservative leader of the Liberal Party. What does that suggest? That suggests that in fact he is committed to the New Right, to the right wing, conservative extreme of the Liberal Party. That, in fact, was his position earlier on. Indeed, that was the position on which he went to the Australian people on a previous occasion when he was opposition leader and was defeated. The Australian people did not accept that New Right philosophy or that New Right direction which John Howard was propounding at that time. If we ask the question, 'Where is John Howard now?', it is very difficult to find an answer. Look at what he said in the election; look at the strategy that was employed in the election. That strategy is also being commented on by a number of people including a number of academics. The general strategy was to say, 'There is not much in the platform and strategy of the Labor Party that we disagree with, only one or two issues. The general thrust is okay. It is just that we do not like the people managing it. We want to change them and we want to put ourselves in because we think we can do it better.' That was the impression which John Howard sought to create at that time. A lot of Australians voted the way they did because they were deceived by that. They were deceived into thinking that the old John Howard had disappeared. Even editorialists wrote on this issue. They said, 'Let's forget and forgive John Howard on a range of issues. Let's forget about what he said about social questions. Let's forget about what he said about multiculturalism. Let's forget about what he said on immigration. Let's forget about what he said on Medicare because he has changed his position on all those issues.' We were led to believe that was the case. What happened after the election? He had behind him a huge team of people but the people that he put in the key positions, the people that he put in the most prominent positions, the people that he put in control of economic policy positions in particular, were people committed to the same New Right direction which the Australian people had rejected in 1987, in 1990 and in 1993. Mr Miles-What about 1996?",63
36,Dr THEOPHANOUS,Unknown,"I just said that the Australian people were deceived in 1996. They were not told what was going to happen, they were told a different story. Mr Miles interjectingMadam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A. Crosio)-Order! I call the parliamentary secretary to order. The member for Calwell has the floor.",64
37,Dr THEOPHANOUS,Unknown,"What happened after the election? Not very long after the election a myth was created about how the economy was in some dreadful crisis and therefore dramatic action had to be taken. But what kind of dramatic action was suggested? Is it a coincidence that the dramatic action that has been suggested is exactly the same prescription of the New Right which John Howard had said, and others around him and in the media had said, he had abandoned. It is the same prescription. Let me tell you about the key policies which have come out since the election which are exactly in line with this New Right philosophy and which, I might say, were tried with disastrous results by the Reagan administration in the United States and by the Thatcher administration in Britain. Those policies that we have heard about so far are nothing more than an attempt to go back on a commitment given in relation to a whole set of social, welfare, health and education services. If you read this book, The New Right, you see the first thing that they do in their philosophy is to come out and attack those services. Firstly they create a non-existent problem and secondly they try to tell us that the only solution is exactly the same New Right philosophy which they tried to tell the Australian people they were not going to pursue. This kind of deception will not go unchallenged. What does it betray? It betrays the fact that there are no new ideas at all in the Liberal and National parties. Listening to the speeches from the new members we heard some expressions of social justice and concern, but we heard no attempts to translate that into concrete policies. The first half of the new members' speeches would basically say, 'We're concerned about aged care, we're concerned about education, we're concerned about this and we're concerned about that.' But in the second half of the speeches they all simply said that they supported the policy direction which was being pursued-policy which would undermine those programs. In August, we will be facing a horror budget; a horror budget created not because of economic circumstances, but created because the Liberal Party is bereft of ideas and has simply gone in the same old tired New Right direction. In so doing, it will be bringing this horror budget to the Australian people and the coalition will try to justify it with nonsense about how the economy is not performing well. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has been exposed on this issue. When he has been overseas in international forums he has told people-as has the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer)-'Look, the Australian economy is doing very well. All the major indicators are very positive.' Mr Latham-He has exposed himself.",64
38,Dr THEOPHANOUS,Unknown,"He has exposed himself, as the honourable shadow minister says. The Prime Minister then comes back to Australia and tries to put across a doom and gloom image which is created for no other reason than to result in a situation ofMr Charles interjecting",65
39,Dr THEOPHANOUS,Unknown,"Here we have one of the most fanatical proponents of the New Right coming into the parliament. He has not had a new ideaMadam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A. Crosio)-Order! I remind the member for La Trobe, who has just entered the House, that the member for Calwell does not need interjections in this debate. He has the call, and I will bring the member for Calwell back to the debate in a minute.",65
40,Dr THEOPHANOUS,Unknown,"--The member for La Trobe has had not a new idea since Reagan, and he keeps padding out the same ones. The . reality is that the New Right philosophy .had a certain consequence in the United States and Britain. Its consequence was a huge increase in the gap between the rich and the poor. For the first time for many years in the United Kingdom, beggars appeared on the streets of London because people were cut off from support. The poor, the needy, the people who needed the programs the most, were left to fend for themselves. The safety net was reduced. Margaret Thatcher would go into the British parliament and say, This is all necessary.' She said it was necessary to create what she considered to be a good society. She left behind a shameful legacy. The same happened with Ronald Reagan's America. In the United States, even to this day, they have not been able to get through their legislature a bill to cover everybody with health insurance. If people become ill in the United States, they end up in a situation where it is very possible that they could lose their house and their savings in order to pay the health costs. That is a reality in the United States. In this country we have the Medicare system, which was brought in by the Labor government to cover every Australian and to ensure that everyone received social justice in relation to health. What happened? We were told by the conservatives before the election that they would not touch Medicare. What are we hearing now? According to various leaks, they will keep the word 'Medicare', they will keep Medicare offices, but they will cut key aspects of the Medicare program. They are going to transfer-this is amazing-major health responsibilities to the states. In so doing, they will ensure a situation in which the states will not have enough money to pay for those health services, so the whole point of the Medicare system, especially in relation to public hospitals, will be undermined. The health issue is just one example. But one could equally go to the education issue. When the conservative parties last left government only three in 10 Australian children finished high school. Mr Miles-It was 3.7 actually.",65
41,Dr THEOPHANOUS,Unknown,"Three point seven, the gentleman says. I dispute that. In my electorate it was less than two and that was a poorer area. By the time we left government this year that figure had increased to eight out of 10. Mr Miles-No. It is now 7.5.",66
42,Dr THEOPHANOUS,Unknown,"Seven point five, he says. Mr Miles-And it is going down.",66
43,Dr THEOPHANOUS,Unknown,"It is going down, is it? You have been in government for a few months; is that what you are saying? Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! I have asked the parliamentary secretary in the chair to acknowledge the fact that a speaker is on his feet. He does not need your interjections to help him. The member for Calwell has the call, parliamentary secretary.",66
44,Dr THEOPHANOUS,Unknown,"One reason why it is going down, sir, is because in the last few years we have had conservative governments in the states, and one of the areas which they have attacked is the school system. Look at Victoria, for example, where Jeff Kennett made huge cuts in the school system which resulted in its being unable to meet the basic needs of many children. We had a situation where we were starting to go backwards because of the state government's behaviour. - That only reinforces the comments of the parliamentary secretary and reinforces my point. In this situation, when you shift responsibility to the states, you are going to have a nation in which there are differences between the different states in education, in health, in welfare and in housing, depending on the political will of the particular state government to implement an agenda. Instead of having the national government accepting responsibility for social justice, setting ards, ensuring that those standards are implemented and being ready to use its financial muscle, if necessary, to ensure those results, we are going to have a situation in which all these responsibilities are handed back to the states. Money will be cut, and the consequence will be that those services will be reduced. We will start heading down the road which Britain and the United States took under the Thatcherite and Reaganite New Right policies. Those people in the Liberal and National parties who have some concern, the thinkers-and there are some of them over thereand those who have been concerned to adopt some more progressive ideas, should come forward to the Prime Minister and the ministers and say, 'We can't do this. We can't bring in this horror budget. We can't make cuts at such a level that people will really be hurt. We've got to do something else.' If they do not listen to that message it will not just be a question of politics, it will be a question of human suffering. People will suffer. There will be serious consequences. We will have problems in this country as a result of increasing poverty and the ipequality that will come about from such measures. Do not think that a cut of $8,000 million is going to be made without this sort of pain. Already it has become perfectly clear that the cuts are going to be in the programs which government delivers to the people in order to maintain social justice and in order to prevent inequality. In contrast to all this, let me say that in each period of government the Labor Party sought to put into place a whole raft of social programs: programs that were designed to actually pursue the goal of social justice. We had in every budget a social justice statement. We pursued the agenda of social justice in a whole variety of areas. We put into place standards that we expected the states to reach, even when we had joint responsibilities. We were seeking to ensure that all people had at least basic access to and basic equity in these sorts of services. This question of access to and equity in services of this kind is going to set the political agenda of this country into standthe future. I can assure you of that. If the trend continues as it has up to this point, with the kind of policies that the opposition has already signalled, not only are we going to get this New Right ideological push in a hard way, we are going to get people suffersubcommittee ing as a result of that push. The Labor Party is ready to support the government when it comes out with progressive policies and policies which are intended to help meet the needs of the people. It will not support programs that cut education and health and welfare and basic services to the Australian people. This rather ignorant man, the Minister for Finance, says that it is all question-(Time expired)",66
45,Mr CHARLES,Unknown,"I understand that I am to close off this debate on address-in-reply to His Excellency the Governor General's speech on the occasion the opening of the 38th Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. In the two or three minutes that are available to me there are just a few remarks that I would like to make. First of all, I would like to say that all new members in this parliament who took opportunity in this address-in-reply debate to make their maiden speeches deserve the highest commendation. We heard some really excellent people, and I think the calibre of people who have come into join us in this House of Representatives is surely excellent. Speeches by new Liberal members, by NaGovernment tional Party members, by ALP members and by Independents were all good and all worthy and all contributed to the national debate. It is important that we keep our minds focused on the fact that this is a chamber of volatility, it is a chamber of many ideas, it is a chamber of conflicting ideologies and of philosophies and of practicalities. Nonetheless, we are all here for the single purpose of doing the very best that we can for our constituents and for the nation overall. The Governor General's speech on this occasion took the opportunity to outline the major parts of the program that will be impleso mented by the new Howard government during these coming sessions of the 38th Parliament. I might say that amongst those new workplace reform bill will have to be listed as one of the highest priorities of government. I have noted that the Senate, unfortunately, has taken the opportunity very send that legislation not to a legislative but to a procedural committee and that it has a very long hearing time. I question, quite frankly, whether we will get anything out of that inquiry other than good politics, or perhaps it will be bad politics. That is a very important piece of legislation that this government is determined to institute, and along with it the sale of Telstra bill and the just introduced bill which will bring to a fruition the environment heritage act and give us the opportunity for once and for all attacking in a major manner the environmental problems that we have in our nation. My time has drawn to an end. I thank you of for this opportunity and I do note that this government is determined to implement its program and to tum this nation around to give all Australians an opportunity to work at jobs that they so richly deserve, an opportunity for a good education and· an opportunity for a those high standard of living. I commend the the address-in-reply to the government. Question resolved in the affirmative.",67
46,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have ascertained that His Excellency the Governor General will be pleased to receive the address-in-reply, at House, at 5.20 p.m. on Monday, 24 June 1996. I should be glad if the mover and seconder of the motion, together with other honourable members, would accompany me to present the address at that time. NA Taxation",67
47,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. A week ago the Treasurer said, 'The premiers said they wanted a discussion about tax reform. Here it is.' Now every Australian will have to pay $425 in a tax slug that the states can meet the $3 billion bill you foisted on them to pay for your government's $4 billion worth of unfunded the election promises. Can you advise the House how this constitutes tax reform and why you this have again breached your pre-election commitment that taxes would not increase under to a coalition government?",67
48,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"Talk about flogging a dead horse. You have been trying this all week. It is getting lamer and lamer and weaker and weaker. It was never any good and it is getting worse. As I have said all week, the fact of the matter is that this government could not stand by, and would not stand by, and see exemptions which were given to tiers of government in relation to cars exploited for commercial advantage. That is the way you left the situation. You had local councils applying for motor car trader licences. You had a situation where senior executives could be put in cars tax free while ordinary people had to pay the full wholesale sales tax. In that regard, we have announced that any car purchased by a tier of government which is used wholly or partly for private use will come within the wholesale sales tax net. That is a valuable reform-a very good reform. It is one that you were never able to make or address. I suppose even now it is one that you are not able to comment on. You have not got a position on this issue. You have not announced whether or not you are in favour of this reform. We see the opposition as a group of people who are shell shocked. They have no policy position and they are running around trying to frustrate good economic decision making. As I have said before, they are a group of saboteurs who blew up the bridge and every time we try to rebuild it they come back for more. They want to stop progress in relation to Telstra, industrial relations and tax reform. You are making no contribution in relation to any of these key issues. I make it clear on behalf of this government that where anomalies and exemptions are being unfairly exploited they will be addressed. Australian Institute of Sport Miss JACKIE KELLY - My question is addressed to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government. Is the minister aware of recently announced Australian innovations such as the bicycle to be used by Australian cyclists at the Atlanta Olympics? Is there a commercial benefit to Australia from these AIS developments?",68
49,Mr WARWICK SMITH,Unknown,"I thank the member for her question. I think all of us are very proud to know that the work of the Australian Institute of Sport, through the Sports Commission, has greatly advantaged many of our athletes. That will particularly be the case over the next little while when they are preparing for the Atlanta Olympics. There has been a range of new high-technology developments in sports science-and Australia is one of the world leaders in that regardwhich I would like to bring to the attention of the House. They will enhance the performance of our athletes at the Olympics Games. The AIS is charged with the responsibility to undertake this research and development in the area of sporting equipment, in particular, and technology as well. A number of products have been developed. If these products have a potentially broader market, they will be commercialised to the advantage of all athletes and the AIS. There has been a recent innovation in the cycling area for the Australian cycling team. Many of our cyclists have done particularly well. We are looking forward to seeing how Kathy Watt goes at the Atlanta Games. A carbon fibre cycle frame with aerodynamic handlebars and forks has been refined since the 1994 Commonwealth Games. Following the Atlanta Games it is proposed to commercialise this cycle with a model being made available to the worldwide triathlete market. It will be available to all people and, I suppose one should say, we hope the parliament will acquire some in view of previous events in this place. The AIS has also developed a water rowing analysis system which provides coaches and athletes with realtime feedback on the forces on the oar throughout the stroke. This cutting edge development enables coaches to identify technique deficiencies and seat location in the rowing shell and to quantify the demands of rowing. Following Atlanta this is proposed to be commercialised. This is also another piece of unique equipment. Mr MCMullan-Is that the one you couldn't use?",68
50,Mr WARWICK SMITH,Unknown,"Touche! In other areas of research there has been an immediate flow-on to the general community of the benefits of the AIS research. A fluid replacement drink, Iso Sport, was developed for our athletes in association with an Australian company, Berrivale. Our athletes have benefited from it. This is also part of the commercialisation program and is available to the general population. The work that has been undertaken by the AIS in the sports science area, both in terms of rowing equipment and the new carbon bicycle, is leading edge technology. If members of this House have the opportunity, I would invite them to take the time to go to the AIS sports medicine area and have a look at the developments. In that way they can do their bit to support the development of these world leading technologies and also extend their good wishes to the athletes, many of whom are preparing for Atlanta in a few weeks time. Mr GARETH EV ANS-I refer to the deficiency of grant-or DOG-tax that every state is now imposing or contemplating to make up the $3 billion funding shortfall that you forced upon them last week, amounting to an average tax slug per Australian household of over $140 a year or $425 over three years. Is it not the case that this slug will now surplus. take away, to the tune of $140 a year per household, whatever benefits you were proposing to give to families in your budget tax package so your DOG tax is biting the very hands that you were promising to feed? Mr Costello-He should withdraw that. Mr Reith-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I thought it was pretty obvious that that was unparliamentary language and he should be required to withdraw it.",68
51,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The Treasurer finds the language offensive. Mr Gareth Evans-I was referring to a deficiency of grant-or DOG-tax, as it has become colloquially called. If Mr Costello chooses to take offence on the basis of what Mr Kennett has notoriously said about himthat he has every characteristic of a dog except that of loyalty-that is fine; I withdraw it.",69
52,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"Let me say in relation to the question-which brings no honour whatsoever to this chamber; in fact, you bring no honour to this chamber-that, of course, the premise is entirely false and that yesterday an entirely false premise was put into a question from the member for Isaacs. He stood up yesterday and said that the Victorian government was introducing some new tax. It is not. Mr Crean-How do you know?",69
53,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"Because the Premier said so. Do you read the AAP wire or do you listen to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition? If you read the AAP wire today, you will see that that is exactly what the Premier said. You were in this chamber yesterday reading out pre-prepared questions trying to put false implications and false information to the House. I would ask the people who wrote it for you whether they will give you an Taxation apology. Let me make it entirely clear: as we have said earlier, if any state wants to make a decision in relation to its taxation regime, that is a matter for that state. Those states running large surpluses, as Victoria is, will not be introducing taxes. The Premier indicated today that he would not, because he has a Let us make this entirely clear: why was it necessary to renegotiate the real per capita guarantee? Because these people opposite had made a promise that they could not keep. You had said that you would pay $16 billion to the states. It was $16 billion you did not have. You would have had to have gone out to financial markets to borrow the money to give it to the states. Here were people running an $8 billion deficit promising money they did not have to the states. This was the responsible government that said that there was no point in going out and paying money it did not have in the kick. It is an obvious point. I do not know how it eluded you. If you had been able to read the financial transactions, it would not have eluded you. You cannot payout money you do not have. You cannot pay it out if you do not have it. If you are running an $8 billion deficit, you cannot payout the $16 billion real per capita guarantee. It is an elemental point. So we said to the states that it was necessary to renegotiate the real per capita guarantee. They renegotiated it in their preferred way-in their preferred way. If they want to make any financial decisions, they will take the responsibility for them. But, if they want to look to Canberra, they should look no further than the person who was running the accounts, they should look no further than the person who built up the $8 billion deficit, they should look no further than the Leader of the Opposition. Gun Control",69
54,Mrs VALE,Unknown,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. What progress has been made towards having all governments in Australia pass tough gun control legislation? Is it a fact that despite some scepticism Australia is now on the verge of having real action taken which will reduce the number of guns in Australia forever?,70
55,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"In response to the member for Hughes, there has been considerable progress made in implementing the decision of the police ministers reached on 10 May. Yesterday the New South Wales Premier informed me that he anticipated the legislation giving effect to the prohibitions arising out that meeting would be passed by the New South Wales parliament over the next few days. That is a course of action that was confirmed by the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales, Mr Collins, who has given very strong support to the government of New South Wales. Yesterday the Victorian lower house passed legislation extending the prohibitions announced at the police ministers conference. That legislation is now before the upper house in Victoria and the anticipation is that it will be passed through the upper house very shortly. The ACT Legislative Assembly has already passed the legislation to give effect to the police ministers' agreement. A new firearms bill will be introduced this week into the Tasmanian parliament to give effect to the legislation. The Western Australian parliament, which I think most people would agree already had some laws that in many respects were tougher than laws in other parts of Australia, has proposed the circulation of a discussion paper with a view to the enactment of the amendments to give effect in August or September to the police ministers' decision. I am told that the situation in South Australia and the Northern Territory is that the necessary amendments there will also be enacted by August or September. In Queensland there are two matters that have been the subject of some speculation in recent days and I want to take the opportunity of saying something about both of them. In relation to the so-called issue of crimpingwhich is a colloquial expression to describe the process whereby a weapon which has a capacity of more than two bullets is reduced by some process down to a weapon that has a capacity of only two bullets-it has been put by a number of people both in this parliament and around Australia that if there could be a process which was irreversible that converted the weapon's capacity from something above two bullets down to two bullets then that would come within the terms of the police ministers' resolution. Clearly, the test is the test of irreversibility, and I think that is common ground. I think it of was expressed very well on the AM program by the National Party whip and the member for Lyne, Mr Mark Vaile-it is a question of irreversibility. My view from the very beginning was that, if it is not irreversible, it cannot be within the spirit of the police ministers' decision and I would not support it. That remains my position and it remains the position of the government. The government is seeking the advice of ballistics experts, independent of the political process, as to whether or not that is possible, and we will act on that advice. I think there are people who genuinely believe that, if you can for all practical purposes make it irreversible, that is okay. I have to say that, unless it is, I am not prepared to support it. That is common ground in our ranks and I hope it would be common ground in the ranks of those opposite. The other issue surrounds the question of the category D weapons, which are the very high-powered centre-fire semiautomatic weapons. These were prohibited under the police ministers' resolution, except for the police, the armed forces and professional shooters. The Queensland government has raised the proposition-and there has been some misunderstanding about this-that in those cases where a farmer might have to deal, for example, with a feral pig problem and could not get access to a professional shooter whether there might be some temporary licensing of the primary producer as a professional shooter, including access for the period of the licence to a high-powered weapon on the basis that that weapon, after the pigs have been exterminated, be returned to the police or some kind of central armoury. That is the proposition that has been put. That matter is now being discussed between the federal government and the Queensland government. I want to say that I have some reservations about it and intend to have it very carefully examined. I am not giving it a tick but equally I am not rejecting it out of hand, because some people who have a very strong view on this subject argue that at least it ought to be considered. The proposition, very simply, is that there would be a limited licence for the duration of the problem and then the weapon would be handed back. That is going to be examined. I want to say to the House again that, unless I am satisfied that such a proposal complies with the spirit of what was agreed at the police ministers' conference, that proposal will not have my support. It is being examined and I do not want to reject it out of hand-but it will be very seriously examined. So far as the Commonwealth is concerned, they are the two matters which are, as it were, outstanding. I want to renew to the House my personal commitment and that of the government to the implementation of the spirit and the letter of the police ministers' decision. It order. has not been easy. I appreciate the cooperation that has been given to the government by the Labor Party, and the cooperation that has been given around Australia by people on both sides of politics. I appreciate the strongly held views of many decent, law-abiding people; I do not take too much account of a few on the fringes. I just say again that there is an inconvenience for some, which I apologise for, but there is a greater good to be served. I have no doubt in the world that, if the Australian people were given the opportunity to express a view on this matter, they would express it overwhelmingly in favour of what the government is proposing. Taxation",70
56,Mr FITZGIBBON,Unknown,"My question is, of course, to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Mr MCGauran-Why 'of course'?",71
57,Mr FITZGIBBON,Unknown,"Because I would hate to disappoint him. I refer to last week's Premiers Conference shambles and the proposed Costello tax slug as it affects rural Australians. I ask the Minister: are you aware of a letter from the Lachlan Shire Councilwhich, I might add, represents thousands of Australian farmers-which describes the action as an act of 'bastardry' and goes on to say: This would have to be the most ill-conceived, ill timed decision of any federal Treasurer in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia. Why didn't you oppose that decision, which was clearly against the interests of rural communities and which has now led to a massive $3 billion Costello tax slug?",71
58,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,"It gets bigger and richer and more original every moment. What wonderful stuff. Mr Nugent- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order understanding order 146. This question was asked yesterday by both the member for Port Adelaide and the member for Isaacs. I submit, therefore, that it has been answered fully and should not be renewed.",71
59,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,There is no point of,71
60,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,"You would know full well, for a start, that cabinet discussions are not something that we are going to reveal here-and that is point No.1. Point No. 2 is that your question is based on a false premise and a misunderstanding of the proposition. Point No. 3 is that it bears no reality to outcome as is now recorded by history. But let us just talk a little bit about your performance on tax in government. Let us just remember what you did out in the bush when your mob were in office. One of your leagues the other day talked about the trouble that a certain President of the United States got into when he encouraged the electorate 'read my lips'. The point was made that he lost office because he did not keep faith it. But the previous Prime Minister did not reckon that 'read my lips' would anybody. So he put a few things in legislation-l-a-w law tax arrangements. Do you remember? That is what he did. And guess what happened? He did not keep faith with it, and you were resoundingly rejected. I note the other point that will not have been lost on anybody: you have not got The anybody from the bush to ask the because they remember what you did to them out in the bush. You were roundly rejected for it-and rightly so. And you will be roundly rejected next time for your opportunismand we will have a go at you later. Mr Adams- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the minister tried to mislead when he said that there was nobody on this side of the House representing regional Australia. I represent a regional seat.",71
61,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat. Mr Adams-The minister has misled the House.,72
62,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I warn the member for der, Lyons! National Commission of Audit",72
63,Mr BARTLETT,Unknown,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House as to when the report of National Commission of Audit will be made public and how the government plans to respond to it?,72
64,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"I thank the honourable agree member for his question. I inform the House that the National Commission of Audit report consideration. will be formally handed over by the chairman of the commission to the Minister for Finance the and to me tomorrow at 10 o'clock and will be released at that time. I want to make it clear that the Commission of Audit was established as an independent body to investigate and report on the colfinancial position of the Commonwealth government, with a view to advising the government on the future management of its to finances consistent with the mediumto long term goal of improving the government fiscal with position. I want to emphasise that the Commission of Audit was asked to look at mediconvince umand long-term issues. Mr Beddall- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Standing order 144 says: Questions cannot refer to(b) proceedings in committee not reported to the House. minister clearly indicated that the report question would be tabled tomorrow.",72
65,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,There is no point of order.,72
66,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,Nor is it a parliamentary committee reporting to the House.,72
67,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The Treasurer will the House address the question.,72
68,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"It is an independent Commission of Audit. I want to make it entirely clear that it has been asked to look at medium term to longer term issues. I want to also place on record my thanks to those who took part in it-Professor Bob Officer, Morris Newman, Elizabeth AlexanJohn Fraser and the Executive Officer, Geoff Carmody-who have worked hard to produce this report over the three-month time period. The government hopes that the report will be able to generate informed discussion. There will be, we anticipate, matters in the report which are not necessarily things that the government agrees with. There will be issues in the report which the government will with, and there will be many issues in the report which will be worthy of future The government will welcome discussion on that and would hope that there would be an independent and open-minded discussion in relation to all of those matters. We hope that it will not be the subject of short-termism and that the long-term results that can be got out of that discussion, and the changes that can come about as a result, will be given full opportunity to do that. The government will not be responding point by point to the recommendations of the commission tomorrow. We want to put it out for public discussion so that as many people as possible can take part in that discussion. The government will be responding to some of the issues, no doubt, in the context of the budget. Some of them will be much longerterm issues and the government will be responding in principle perhaps earlier, but leaving the implementation of them for some time to come. The report does have the capacity to lift the horizon to the medium term, to generate that kind of longer term thinking, and we hope that it contributes to that kind of discussion. NA",72
69,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I inform the House that we have present in the gaIlery this afternoon members of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association study tour from the Cook Islands, Niue and Vanuatu. Included in their membership is the Hon. Alfred Maseng, a distinguished former Speaker of the Parliament of Vanuatu. On behalf of the House and the people of Australia, I extend to you gentlemen a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Home and Community Care",73
70,Ms MACKLIN,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Family Services. Is the minister aware that the Treasurer has cut home and community care funding by three per cent, which over the next three years amounts to a $70 million cut to this essential service? How does the minister reconcile this cut with the coalition election funding commitment to 'retain the real rate of increase in HACC funding'? Isn't this yet another exampIe of how the Howard government is breaking an election promise? If not, why not?",73
71,Mrs MOYLAN,Unknown,I thank the member for that question. She knows more than I do about it. This is mere speculation. There is absolutely nothing to indicate any such thing. We have a very strong commitment to home and community care programs. We recognise that this is a very important program in the community and we have a strong commitment to it. It is a program that delivers to the community a very cost-effective support mechanism for older and frail people and those with disability. Mr Crean-Why cut it?,73
72,Mrs MOYLAN,Unknown,"As I said, this talk of cuts is just mere speculation. We will make the decisions known on 20 August. You will see, in the decisions made in relation to the program, that we have a very strong commitment to this, recognising its importance in the community and that it delivers this important service to those who are frail or aged and those who have disability. BougainviUe",73
73,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether he could advise the House on the accuracy of reports about an imminent new military offensiveHonourable members-We can't hear you.,73
74,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Would you begin your question again, please.",73
75,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"Could I suggest that the microphones be increased in volume so that down this end of the House we can hear what goes on up at that end of the House at all times. I am speaking at the same level as they do at the microphones there, but we cannot hear anything down here. I will begin again. Opposition members-Come back!",73
76,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"Thank you very much for your courtesy, but I am quite prepared to behave, as you should, with some decorum and respect to the Speaker. I suggest you begin to behave in that manner.",73
77,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! I thank the right honourable member for New England.,73
78,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether he could advise the House about the accuracy of recent reports of an imminent new military offensive by the PNG defence forces against the BRA in Bougainville as a result of continued internal conflict and the failure of the reconstruction process. Given Australia's long-term commitment to the well-being of the people of New Guinea, would the minister consult with the government of Papua New Guinea on ways by which the reconstruction process can be implemented and a permanent cease-fire negotiated?",74
79,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"I thank the right honourable member for his question. I have indeed seen indications that the Papua New Guinea government is planning a military offensive on Bougainville. As a consequence of those reports, I have instructed our high commissioner today to make representations to the Papua New Guinea government expressing the Australian government's concern about these reports. I can also inform the House, and in particuplace lar the right honourable member, who has such a great interest in the affairs of Papua New Guinea and Bougainville, that the high commissioner today will be meeting with Brigadier General Singirok, the Chief of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force, and he will be expressing similar views at this meeting. When I visited Papua New Guinea on 2 to 4 May, I made it perfectly clear to Sir Julius Chan, the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, that I did not believe, and the Australian government does not believe, there is a military solution to the problems of Bougainville. The Australian government believes that the only practical solution is going to be a negotiated solution. That is a matter for the Papua New Guinea government and the various different interests in Bougainville to work through. In answer to the question of the right honourable member, the Australian government is always willing to play a part in assisting with this process, as indeed was the previous government. When I was in Papua New Guinea in May I made that point once more to Sir Julius Chan, and I offered Australia's help to try to reinvigorate the peace process, which broke down when the Papua New Guinea government formally lifted its cease-fire in March this year. The Australian government always stands ready to assist the Papua New Guinea government and the people of Bougainville in this process. But I repeat: we do not believe there is a military solution to this problem. Indeed, if there is to be an attempt to achieve a military solution, it is my judgment and the judgment of the government that this will simply exacerbate the situation. The Australian government looks for a peaceful resolution of this matter. We look for a resumption of negotiations between the interested parties in Bougainville and the Papua New Guinea government, and that is the only solution there is to this problem. Workplace Relations Legislation",74
80,Ms ELLIS,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Family Services. I seek clarification of an aspect of the government's workrelations bill as it affects working women in Australian families. Are you aware of a letter to the Australian on 18 June from the research unit of the University of Queensland that there is overwhelming evidence that women will be major losers as a result of the implementation of that bill? As a consequence of that evidence, what action are you taking to persuade the Minister for Industrial Relations to amend that bill to ensure that working women, and particularly those with families, will not be worse off?",74
81,Mrs MOYLAN,Unknown,"I thank the member for her question. I am always intrigued when I hear this question from the Labor Party. This question has come up a great deal over the last several years; it is not a new line. As I said once before when answering this question in this place, Jennie George spoke on the matter last year. She has made the comment that enterprise bargaining and a different industrial relations system could well advantage women in Australia. I want to refer to a letter that I have here; a quite interesting letter. It is headed 'Australian Council of Trade Unions'. It is dated 14 May, and it still has as its president 'President M. Ferguson'. As I said before, Jennie George is supposed to be the head of this organisation but we know who is still driving the bus; he is sitting over there. I think the most interesting part of this letter is the section in it which is repeated the shadow minister for the environment and the shadow minister assisting the leader on women's affairs who put out a circular to women which is full of inaccuracies. I hope the women of Australia understand that they are getting false and misleading information in that document. Let me just read this paragraph of the letter from the ACTU: 'Women currently earn onlyMrs Crosio-- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order understanding order 145 on relevance. The question clearly referred to a letter that appeared in the Australian and asked if the minister was aware of it. It had nothing to do with Jennie George or the ACTU. I ask you, Mr Speaker, to bring the minister back to relevance.",74
82,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! There is no point of order. The member will resume her seat.,75
83,Mrs MOYLAN,Unknown,"It says here, 'Women earn only 54.7 per cent of men's overaward payments.' In fact, the shadow minister for the environment and the shadow minister assisting the leader on women's affairs said that they did not want to see any further deterioration in this wage level for women, but it has happened under their government. It happened when they were in government, when they were in the driver's seat. Talk about hypocrites! Talk about the pot calling the kettle black! You really take the cake over there. For the last 13 years, you presided over a system that allowed women to receive wages less than men's. Give us a go! We have a bill here that can deliver equality of wages for women. In fact, our bill specifically protects women's level of wages. Mr Crean-You haven't got a clue.",75
84,Mrs MOYLAN,Unknown,I have a clue alright. I have been one of the women under your system of industrial relations that have had to suffer an unequal wage in this country. We have a bill before this House that not only protects women and helps perhaps to give women an opportunity to earn real equality of wages. The bill also has other mechanisms which will protect the interests of women in this country: they will have greater opportunity for flexibility in part-time by work; they will be protected from discrimination; and they will have an opportunity for true equality. You have had 13 years to deliver it. You failed miserably. You have acknowledged your own failure in your own letters to women of this country. Bank Fees and Charges,75
85,Ms GAMBARO,Unknown,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen reports suggesting that banks may raise fees and charges on their deposit holders in the wake of recent cuts to home mortgage rates? What is the government's attitude to competition with regard to bank fees and charges? What action will the government take if there is evidence that unjustified fees and charges have been imposed on Australian consumers?,75
86,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for her question. As the House would know, the government has welcomed recent reductions in home variable mortgage rates which have been announced by major banks. Throughout the 1980s, banks and other deposit-taking institutions enjoyed a considerable profit margin between their deposittaking cost of funds and their lending rates. This allowed a number of new entrants into the home mortgage market and, currently, around 100 mortgage managers are operating in Australia. Life insurance companies are also entering the market. As a result of new entrants and heightened competition, we have seen a reduction in variable rates over the last couple of months. As a result of those recent reductions, however, there has been a focus on the question of whether banks would increase fees as a way of recouping the narrowing of the margin between their deposit-taking and their lending acti vi ties. May I say in relation to fees as well, this government takes the view that red-hot competition is the best way of having continual surveillance of financial institutions on each other in relation to fees, just as it is the first and best port of call in relation to interest rates. The notion that competition is the most effective way to generate benefits for consumers is not new. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, in its 1991 report A pocketful of change, came to the same conclusion. We are seeing the benefit of competition in rates. This government wants to see the benefit of competition in fees as well. If there is any suggestion of anti-competitive activity or collusion in fees and charges, the government does have the option of referring the matter to the relevant body, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. And we will take that action if necessary, or if any information arises of inadequate competition in that area of products as well. The government's inquiry into the financial system is an inquiry designed to enhance competition and improve regulatory arrangements. We believe that, as a consequence of that, we will facilitate increased competition. But let me make it clear: as far as this government is concerned, increased competition is always directed at consumer benefit. The consumer benefit is the end result and competition is the means of getting there. Workplace Relations Legislation Mr BEAZI.EY-My question is directed to the Minister for Family Services and it follows the answer she has just given. Are you aware that under IRC enforced awards women receive about 93 cents to the male $1 in earnings? This is directly related to the point that was being made in that. So, in IRC enforced awards, they get 93 per cent, effectively, of equivalent male earnings. Are you aware that outside that framework in overaward payments, that figure that you mentioned is correct? It is about 54 cents in the dollar in comparison to male earnings. How do you expect, therefore, to advance the position of women by neutering awards, diminishing the role of the IRC and pushing more women outside the award framework in their bargaining?",75
87,Mr TUCKEY,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the fundamental standing orders relating to the asking of questions are standing orders 143 and 144. In 144 the following general rule shall apply to questions, 'Questions cannot be debated'. I would ask you to study the Leader of the Opposition's question and determine the extent to which it is not a question but a speech. Thank you.",76
88,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I thank the member for O'Connor.,76
89,Mrs MOYLAN,Unknown,"I am very much aware that the information fact sheet that was put out by the shadow minister assisting the opposition leader on women's affairs said that women are still earning only 93.8 per cent of the average weekly award wage. I have read in other statistics that it is about 84 per cent. There is about a 14 or 15 per cent differential. But the fact is that in the overaward payment area, this Labor Party have been a dismal failure. You haven't managed to get equality of wages in average weekly earnings. You haven't managed to achieve that so you have been a dismal failure. Give us a go with a bill that will give women equality of wages and a decent standard of living. General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade",76
90,Mr BOB BALDWIN,Unknown,My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Is he aware of calls for Australia to renege on our obligations under the general agreement on tariffs and trade? Could he inform the House how reneging on our obligations would be in the national interest? What would be the implications of reneging on our GAIT obligations?,76
91,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"I thank the member for Paterson for his timely question. It is timely because I am visiting his region tonight and, also, this issue is important. I also thank the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy for drawing my attention to a statement by the member for Hunter, who said recently: ... we have the perfect opportunity to renege on our obligations under the GATT ... In effect, he said we have that opportunity in certain circumstances. That is an extraordinary statement. I would like to ask some of the opposition front-bench whether they endorse that statement or whether they have now gone down the path of losing all trade credibility and all policy integrity, and are now into policy duplicity. This has acutely embarrassed the member for Canberra and will acutely embarrass the member for Perth when he gets around to making a statement on trade policy. That statement does not reflect our true interests because we are about a hard-edged trade policy which is about better access for our exporters and about delivering on the Uruguay Round outcomes which include-for the member for Hunter's information-a billion dollar increase in agricultural export access and a cut of more than 50 per cent on average tariffs faced by Australia's exporters in the manufacturing sector. It also involves an improvement in the critical area of coal exports, something which I would have thought the member for Hunter would be interested in, as well as an agreement on services which ensures that Australia's service providers receive the same treatment as their international competitors. I chaIlenge this mob opposite as to whether they are deciding to walk away from longheld policy tenets which were pursued by the member for Canberra when he was Minister for Trade and in relation to which he is now being stabbed in the back by the member for Hunter. I would say quite happily that Australia has made some hard yards with regard to boosting its export performance, both before and since the most recent federal election. It will continue to make those hard yards and we will have a trade policy of integrity, not the duplicity practised by the member for Hunter. Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme",76
92,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"My question is to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I refer the minister to the resolution at the National Party conference in Taree which received full endorsement from your party room last Tuesday, that the diesel fuel rebate scheme must be retained. Given that your constituency and party room have now spoken, have you listened? WiII you now rule out cuts to the scheme so as to provide some certainty for farmers and miners? If not, is this another issue that you and your colleagues have to 'do a bit more work on', to quote Senator O'Chee this morning?",77
93,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,"How about the exminister taking a cold shower and trying to remember that only a few months ago he was in government; he knew how the processes worked, how the ERC procedure falls outMr Crean-Is that what you tell the farmers?",77
94,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,"Yes, it is. Mr Crean-To take a cold shower?",77
95,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,"No, I tell you to take a cold shower and I tell them. I will play it with a straight bat and we will get a result that you failed to get. To return to what I was saying the last time. I stood here, you are the mob who went to the 1993 election saying there would be no new taxes but then pushed up fuel taxes all over the place with nary a word from the people on your side of this place who purported to speak for primary industry. That is why primary industry has so overwhelmingly rejected you. Go and take that cold shower. DAS Regional Offices",77
96,Mr ENTSCH,Unknown,My question is addressed to the Minister for Administrative Services. Has the minister's attention been drawn to further statements about the closure of DAS regional offices? Are these statements accurate?,77
97,Mr JULL,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, you will remember that on 30 May I answered a question regarding a letter that had been circulated around Newcastle about the closing of a Department of Administrative Services office in Newcastle at the end of this financial year. That letter was inaccurate and, at that stage, I told the House that we were not going to close that office. However, my attention has been drawn to an interview given subsequentlyon 2NC by the honourable member for Newcastle in which he claimed he had proof that the government was planning to close the DAS office in Newcastle in the next month. But the alleged proof was the same letter I referred to in the House on 30 May. I do worry about the member for Newcastle because that letter was signed by somebody who called himself the Assistant Regional General and the letter was dated 27 June. I thought the member for Newcastle might have twigged at the time that there was something wrong but he still went on 2NC and continued to distress those DAS employees and their families who live in Newcastle. Frankly, I think his actions are appalling and he should apologise. However, the honourable member has been outdone by one of his colleagues. Members will recall that in the same answer I stated that DAS was closing an office in Geelong as a result of a review approved by former administrative services minister Frank Walker. I was therefore very surprised to see a media release issued by the member for Corio entitled 'Another Geelong office to close, O'Connor protests'. It begins: The member for Corio, Gavin O'Connor, today issued a strong protest to the Minister for AdminisAugust. trative Services, Mr David Jull, about his decision to close the Geelong office of the Department of Administrative Services. This strong protest would not have been heard much outside Geelong had not my office been contacted by a journalist from the Geelong Advertiser. I first thought that the member for Corio must have been on leave on the day I answered the previous question. However, the videotape of question time shows that the member for Corio was listening very intently at the point when I told the House that this closure resulted from a review approved late last year by my predecessor. Frankly, for the member for Corio to issue a press release blaming me for a decision of the Labor government and then think he can get away with it is nothing short of duplicity. He and the member for Newcastle are nothing but frauds and phoneys and a couple of dills. Research and Development",77
98,Mr MARTYN EVANS,Unknown,My question is directed to the Minister for Science and Technology. Is it the case that the federal parliamentary National Party this week agreed on 'the need to ensure that research and development funding arrangements be retained if Australia is to remain competitive'? Do you endorse this resolution? Will you now give a guarantee that the existing arrangements will be retained in accordance with the resolution?,78
99,Mr MCGAURAN,Unknown,"Of course the National Party and the government as a whole remain committed to ensuring that the strongest research and development effort in Australia is continued. It is a nonsensical question. On 20 August, proof of that will be delivered, which will stand in stark contrast to your effort in the last few years. It takes incredible hypocrisy or hide-I am not sure which, not personally knowing the member as well as his colleagues-to ask this question. Who cut CSIRO's triennium budget by $60 million in the 1994-95 budget? Of course it was the Labor Party. Your commitment to research and development was non-existent. Ours stands unchanged, as was proven throughout our years in opposition. Our commitment is proven and will again be proven on 20 Artificial Wetlands",78
100,Mr MCARTHUR,Unknown,My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment. The minister will be aware of the work being undertaken by Comalco to rehabilitate its smelter waste dump adjacent to the Tamar River in northern Tasmania. Is the type of artificial wetland being developed by Comalco supported by the minister? Mr Martin Ferguson-Which government offices are you closing in Launceston?,78
101,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,The Labor Party office.,78
102,Mr WARWICK SMITH,Unknown,"Very good, Prime Minister. It gave me a great deal of pleasure to close that office, too. In response to the member's question, I am happy to report to the House about a very innovative and exciting new project by Comalco, one of Australia's leading large industrial companies. What is proposed in the area-it is now well under way-is to repair part of our damaged environment. There is a $1.1 million program to rehabilitate a dump site adjacent to the plant, which involves about 3.5 hectares of artificial wetlands. About 10,000-odd trees have been planted there, as has a whole range of new grasses. It will act as a type of filter for all the stormwater run-off from the plant. The plant size is about 60 hectares. All the storm water will run into this new wetland project. It will provide a new habitat for native animals and a water haven for birds. We have already noticed, according to Comalco and those involved with the project, that three cies of frog have moved into the area. Fourteen new species of birds that were not previously there have moved into the area. It is obviously a project that is innovative and working particularly well. It is a demonstration that industry is playing a new innovative part in improving the environmental record in Australia. It is a project that this government wants to support strongly. It is an activity that all members would applaud. It is innovative, new and serves a very useful purpose. The LaborDemocrat coalition that seems to be emerging now is taking opportunistic routes to try to oppose such opportunities. There are other projects that we have referred to previously and want to have enunciated in policy, given the opportunity. I referred to the coasts and clean seas project in this House just recently. About $100-odd million is proposed for it. Mr Adams-We have done it.",78
103,Mr WARWICK SMITH,Unknown,"You should be interested in this, coming from Tasmania, which is an island; there is coast all around This project will address the sensitive marine and coastal environments and the stormwater problem. Stormwater flows onto 25 per cent of all urban beaches in our community. If we do not address the problem of stormwater runoff onto our urban beaches, we will create, according to a marine environment project report, a major problem for future generations. This is the issue that we need to be addressmg. For 13 years, you had an opportunity and you did not do anything in a meaningful or consistent way to address these problems. We have put forward programs that will make it possible to address these issues. We want to work with local government and local communities to make sure that these projects can get under way. Urban wetland projects involving weirs have been proposed in the Bass electorate in Tasmania and other places in Australia. We do not want to lose that opportunity. If the new Labor Party-Democrat coalition is successful with their current opportunistic, hypocritical approach to the spe- environment, these new wetland projects and river care projects that have been proposed will be denied to this community.",79
104,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,Talk about hypocrisy.,79
105,Mr WARWICK SMITH,Unknown,"It is all right for you to sit there and carry on. I sat over there for 10 years representing the environment in this chamber and every time you tried to oppose it. Here are some good innovative projects from industry, supported by this government, and you-the people who claim the triple-A rating for environment concernare taking nothing but opportunistic, hypocritical positions to deny Australia these programs. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. You can bluster and carry on as much as you like. This community is going to be denied these opportunities because of the attitude you are taking. You should be ashamed of yourself. Child Pornography",79
106,Mr FILING,Unknown,"My question is to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Last year the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the Customs Service conceded the it. service had no effective method of on-site detection of the importation into Australia of CD-ROMs with digitised child pornography images on them. Could the minister inform the House what is being done to remedy this?  ber may be aware, the Customs Service has done some work on the detection of the importation of such material. The program and the work that was handled by the Customs Service were taken over by the National Crime Authority and the input of Customs now is in that particular area. Apprenticeships and Traineeships",79
107,Mr NEVILLE,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Can the minister inform the House of the positive support from the states and territories for the modem Australian apprenticeship and traineeship scheme? Can he detail further measures to implement training reform?",79
108,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. I acknowledge long interest the member for Hinkler has in quality training for young people through the group training schemes. I am pleased to inform the House that the states and territories, through the Australian National Training Authority ministerial council, have unanimously endorsed the objectives and the key principles of the government's modem Australian apprenticestudies ship and traineeship system. endorsed in principle also the processes and the mechanisms for implementing positive reform initiative which is going to deliver real job opportunities to young Australians. The Commonwealth is going to be working closely with the states-and that is all the states; New South Wales, I am pleased to has seen the sense of the proposals that government is putting forward and has come in behind it on this issue-and territories over the coming months to deliver training arrangements which lead to real jobs and which genuinely meet the training needs of small and medium sized businesses in this country. What is needed is not the kind of training that we have seen over recent there has been a political agenda to hide and redefine the unemployed, but quality training which is seen and recognised by the hundreds of thousands of small businesses in this country to contribute directly to their bottom line, to their productivity and to their petitiveness. To make sure that this happens, the modem Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system will be an industry-led system which will modernise apprenticeship and training arachieved rangements, and significantly expand job-related training. It will cut through the excessive regulation and bureaucracy which tied the previous government's training arrangements up in knots: It will expand quality training opportunities for women and it will be focused on the regional and local levels within a national framework. The government's training reforms are designed to re-establish pathways to employment, particularly for that 30 per cent of young people who do not complete their the schooling through to year 12, as well for had those who do manage to complete 12 years of schooling. We will be working very closely with the states to expand the opportunities for vocational education in the senior secondary years and, in particular, to give young people the opportunity to work partly in the workplace, to be employed there and to earn wages while they are doing so, while completing of both a vocational and general They have character at school. The opposition's Working Nation programs this very failed these young people.",80
109,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,Completely.,80
110,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"Completely failed these young people, as the Prime Minister so correctly said. That is why the level of full-time youth say, unemployment was exactly the same at the the end of the Working Nation programs, at the end of the previous government's term in office, as it was at the start of the Working Nation programs. Under us, blue-collar young people will get the opportunities that they were denied over the last 13 years. That is why so many of them supported us in the last election campaign and why there has been unanimous support for these reforms from the years where states and territories. Logging and Woodchipping",80
111,Dr LAWRENCE,Unknown,"My question is to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I remind the minister of the Prime Minister's compre-election statement in this House on 30 November 1995 that: The coalition believes that as a fundamental priority we must protect our high conservation value native forests. This objective will best be by the expedited implementation of the quality national forest policy statement. I ask the minister: given that, in moving to disallow export control regulations which underpin the regional forest agreement process, the government is abandoning any power it has over national forest policy, how does the minister intend to honour the Prime Minister's promise to expedite the implementation of the national forest policy statement? Since disallowance of the woodchip export regulations will completely derail progress towards a national forest policy, when will the minister withdraw his ill-conceived disallowance motion and honour the Prime Minister's commitment to protect areas of high conservation value?",80
112,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for her question. I dare say that it was predictable enough that this question would come along today. It came along in a similar form in the Senate this afternoon and was adequately answered over there by Senator Parer. Let me just make a few points. If anybody has managed to get it wrong for the industry, for the investment in it, for the jobs and for the environment, it was you after 10 years of fooling around with forest policy. If there is anybody who knows anything about clear-felling, it is you because you are the great clear-feller of political standards this country. Let me just make a couple of other points. We talk about getting it right. Of course I am aware of the provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act, especially as they happen to relate to the making of regulations similar to disallowed regulations. I am fully aware of that. I can assure the House that any new arrangements that we seek to put in place will be done in full accordance with the law. It is pure and simple-there is no problem. The fact is that I gave notice of motion to disallow because if I had not done so the options available to us to clean up the unbelievable mess that you left us would have been significantly closed. You will see when we are ready to show you how we are going to clean up the mess that you left us. The only other thing I want to say is that, unlike you mob, on this one, we as a government can work together for sensible outcomes, not only in terms of our interaction with industry and the environment movement and all of those other desirable objectives but with ourselves as well. It has never been denied in terms of the scuttlebutt around this place that your line to cabinet was not quite believed by Senator Bob Collins when he was given the job of trying to sort out the mess.",81
113,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,He used a helicopter to go and look at coupes.,81
114,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,That is right. The Prime Minister remembers it well. Remember when the then minister for resources made such an utter mess of it?,81
115,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,Beddall.,81
116,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,"It was David Beddall. But he could not handle it, so they took it away from him and gave it to Senator Collins. But at one stage-according to the scuttlebutt and it has never been denied-he could not believe the member for Fremantle so he went over there with his little box brownie and took a whole lot of photographs so that he could come back here and spread them out on the cabinet table to get the facts on the table. Well, there you go. We do not have to work that way. Whether it is with the Natural Heritage Trust Fund or with the forestry in people, Senator Hill and I can come to very sensible positions in the interests of all concerned. Hospital Services for Veterans",81
117,Dr NELSON,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Is the minister aware of media speculation about the future of the Lady Davidson hospital in North Turramurra, Sydney? Can the minister outline the government's intentions for this rehabilitation and palliative care centre of excellence? And, more generally, what steps has the government taken to ensure that veterans around Australia who require hospital care are provided with appropriate assistance on their departure from hospital?",81
118,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,Unknown,"I thank the member for his question and acknowledge his commitment to the health o""f the population in his former role as the President of the AMA. I want to answer the second part of the member's question first. Let me assure the honourable member that this government is fully committed to ensuring that the health services which veterans and their dependants receive are of the highest quality. One aspect of hospital care that has been causing some concern, particularly among elderly veterans, is the services provided on their discharge from hospital-services which should be provided to ensure that veterans have the quickest and fullest recovery. To improve services offered to veterans on their discharge from hospital, the government has developed an education package for the veteran community and hospitals. The package provided to veterans emphasises the importance of veterans participating in their own discharge planning so that they understand what they can do and what they can ask others to do so that they enjoy a very smooth recuperation. By the end of the month, all veterans will be receiving a copy of the information package designed especially for them. The common aim of this two-pronged approach is to ensure better discharge planning for the veteran community and to ensure as far as possible the good health of veterans. On the first part of the question, I want to canvass the issue of the Lady Davidson hospital. As another element of our commitment to the health and well-being of the veteran community, we are currently considering the future of Lady Davidson Repatriation Hospital in Sydney. It is the last of the riation hospitals still operating under the Commonwealth government. A decision on its future, let me assure the House, will be based solely on determining the best way to deliver quality health care service to veterans and war widows. I have prepared an options paper which I am currently circulating to the ex-service community. The government will not be rushed on this decision. We will not be taking the approach of the Labor health minister in New South Wales, Dr Refshauge, who disgracefully and wrongly used ANZAC Day this year to scare the ex-service community when he said that the Commonwealth government was considering options which would increase health costs to veterans. Not only did he use ANZAC Day to raise that issue but he was wrong when he said that he had done a deal with the previous Commonwealth government. He was wrong; he knows he was wrong. The previous government had not done a deal on the future of Lady Davidson hospital. There was no such agreement. We will not be rushed into a decision on Lady Davidson hospital. Dr Refshauge ought to heed the advice of the New South Wales RSL president, Mr Rusty Priest. I will quote his comments from the newspaper: My message to Dr Refshauge is to stop scaring the veterans and wait until the options are looked at. H appears that it is not only Dr Refshauge who is scaring the veterans; it is the shadow minister over there, as the House was alerted to yesterday on the matter of sales tax. He has not come into the House yet and corrected the record. Quite clearly, the signature on that letter is, in fact, his signature. The government is committed to the health and well-being of the veteran community. We will not be rushed into a decision on Lady Davidson Repatriation Hospital; we will be discussing the issue with the ex-service community and we will make sure that the proper process is put in place. Eastlink Project",81
119,Mr LA TRAM,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Are you aware of advice from the Nationrepatal Competition Council that the Queensland government will lose financial assistance from the Commonwealth if it does not proceed with the Eastlink project? Minister, do you support these sanctions on the Queensland National Party government or have you, like them, abandoned the national electricity grid?",82
120,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,I thank the honourable member for his question. The detail of that would be more appropriately addressed by the relevant minister. I will seek further advice and get back to you.,82
121,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA",82

123,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Does the member feel that he has been misrepresented?,82
124,Mr FITZGIBBON,Unknown,"I certainly do, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, in answer to a dorothy dixer from the member for Paterson earlier in question time today, the Deputy Prime Minister, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), attempted to give the impression",83
125,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Get onto the point of the misrepresentation.,83
126,Mr FITZGIBBON,Unknown,"By selectively reading from a statement. I made yesterday he gave the impression that I was less than supportive of our approach to GAIT. Mr Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth.",83
127,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Thank you. Resume your seat. You have made the point.,83
128,Mr FITZGIBBON,Unknown,I haven't explained yet where I have been misrepresented.,83

131,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Resume your seat.,83
132,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,Unknown," Mr Speaker, I seek leave to make a personal explanation.",83
133,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Do you claim to have been misrepresented?,83
134,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,Unknown,"Yes, Mr Speaker.",83
135,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Proceed.,83
136,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, on two occasions now the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) has blackguarded me in this House.

He came in here today and quoted from a statement of mine on Newcastle 2NC in which I said that the office function will go and that the person is being transferred.

145,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The widespread concern and confusion caused the government's failure to rule out cuts in Medicare rebates and the government's plans for the wholesale transfer of health and aged care programs to the states. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",84
146,Mr LEE,Unknown,"There are a few members of the government still in the chamber today. How many will still have smiles on their faces come 20 August, when this government intends to cut the rebates which are provided to Australians for their Medicare treatment? We will see how many of them have smiles on their faces when the government introduces the legislation to cut the rebates which are paid to Australian families when they go to see their doctors. The reason we have every right to be upset is that before the election specific promises were given to the Australian people. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) promised to retain Medicare. The Prime Minister promised to retain bulkbilling. The minister at the table, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), gave personal undertakings to the people who live in his electorate. I will quote from a letter sent to the residents of Box Hill South on 21 February. Box Hill is a very famous place for the Australian Labor Party; it is where John Howard fell apart in his campaign to be Prime Minister in 1987. In a letter from the minister for health on 21 February to the residents of his own electorate he said: Present Medicare rebates will not be changed. He went on to give this personal undertaking: The pharmaceutical benefits scheme, which subsidises the cost of many vital drugs, will be retained. So they were the promises and commitments given by no less than the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Family Servicesthat there would be no cuts to Medicare rebates. Those were the promises made before the election. What has happened since? An article in the Daily Telegraph headed 'The $5 Medi fee' says that the bulk-billing pledge is by in doubt over cost cuts. An article in the Newcastle Herald of 23 April is headed 'Minister silent on Medicare'. That was when the minister for health refused to give his state colleagues an assurance that there would not be the introduction of a compUlsory patient fee for visits to the doctor. An article in the Age of 17 June states 'Medicare promise wavers'. That was in response to the minister's remarks recently on the Face to Face program. In last Sunday's Sun-Herald, under the headline 'Up up up' there was the very clear statement that the government intends to increase the cost of visiting your doctor by $6 to $10. On the front page there is a photo of the Prime Minister sipping chardonnay, just to make the point about the extent to which he is caring about the promises he made on these issues before the election. The reason that we are so determined to keep this government honest on the promises they made before the election is that the Prime Minister has set a very high standard on these issues. We all remember during the last parliament he set a high personal standard for people like the former minister for health. At that time he said the following things: We want to assert the very simple principle that truth is absolutethis was said by John Howard, the current Prime Ministertruth is supreme, truth is never disposable in national political life. So we make the simple point that if truth is absolute, if truth is supreme, if truth is not disposable in national public life, then the minister for health cannot dispose of truth in national public life in his role not just as the minister for health but as the member for Chisholm. He cannot simply dispose of the promises, the personal undertakings, which he gave to the residents of Box Hill when he wrote to them promising that Medicare rebates would not be cut. No doubt in a few minutes the minister will come to the dispatch box and say that, no matter what promises were made before the election, he and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) have been shocked to discover that there is a much bigger deficit than the Liberal Party expected when they were making their promises throughout the election. I think most Australians are becoming tired of governments claiming that, once they get elected and open the cupboard, shock and horror, they find that the cupboard is bare and they have to ditch all their election promises. I think the Australian people should adopt this attitude: every time they hear a Liberal claim that there is a much bigger deficit than they expected, they should expect to hear another Liberal explaining and excusing why they are breaking the promises they made to the Australian people. They will be using that and other excuses to try to explain why they are undermining Medicare, why they are undermining bulk-billing, why they are going to cut the Medicare rebates, why they are going to disrupt the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The whole reason is based on this bogus cutback, this bogus deficit. We all know the real reason why they are going through this process of cutting back government programs. It is to pay for the $4 billion of unfunded election promises that John Howard and the minister for health made at the last election. I think we all have to try to make sure that everything is done to keep the minister for health and the Prime Minister to the promises they made before the last election. It has been quite interesting to watch the way in which various members of the government, and the minister at the table in particular, have twisted and turned on these issues. We saw very early in the piece the minister at the table meeting with the Australian Medical Association and floating a proposal with the Australian Medical Association to introduce a compulsory patient fee. We saw in the Daily Telegraph under the headline 'The $5 Medi fee' the following article: Bulk-billing pledge in doubt over cost cuts. Patients would have to pay a fee of between $2 and $5 every time they see a doctor under a change to Medicare being considered by the Federal Government. Health Minister Michael Wooldridge met the AMA, radiologists and other doctors groups this week and told them the payment was an option for saving about $500 million. So at the first meeting that the minister for health has with the AMA he tells them that this is an option to which he is giving serious consideration. But, within 24 hours, the Prime Minister jumped in. Actually, he sent his media adviser and press secretary to the press gallery to try to talk the journalists out of running this story. In fact, the Prime Minister gave certain assurances to the journalists that the government would not be introducing that co-payment. It was run under the headline 'Medi retreat'. I quote from the Daily Telegraph: This move was a rebuff to the health minister, Dr Wooldridge, who told doctors last Wednesday that the co-payment was a serious option for saving $500 million. Having let the health minister go out and tell the AMA that this was a serious proposal, the Prime Minister pulls the rug out from under him and says that no further consideration will be given to it. Yet, when the opposition raises the issue in the parliament to seek an assurance from the Prime Minister or the minister that there will not be a compulsory patient fee for visits to the doctor, they refuse to rule it out. When we ask them to give an assurance that the cost of pharmaceutical services will not be increased, as suggested in the Sunday Herald Sun under the headline 'Bitter pill for the elderly', Gerard MCManus ran a story that suggested that the government was considering a proposal and that the minister for health's own department and the Department of Finance were looking at increasing the cost of pharmaceuticals for pensioners and general patients. The article suggests that pensioners will have to pay $4 for each prescription, up from $2.50, while the general public will have to pay up to $20 a script, up from the current $16.20. When we asked the minister to rule that out, the minister refuses to do it, the Prime Minister refuses to do it. Is it any wonder that we have concerns about what they might really be up to? It is no secret as to what the Prime Minister's real views are on Medicare. If you go back to the last occasion when John Howard wanted to be the Prime Minister of Australia, he let us know his real views on Medicare. I quote from what he said in 1986: Medicare has been an unmitigated disaster. That was in November 1986. That is what he really believes; not what he is saying now.",84
147,Mr H,Unknown,rdgr-ve-Ten years ago.,86
148,Mr LEE,Unknown,"Do you believe that? Do you believe that Medicare has been an unmitigated disa-ter, because that is what the current Prime Minister was saying in 1986.",86
149,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Nehl)Order! The member will address his remarks through the chair. Members on my right will be quiet.,86
150,Mr LEE,Unknown,"-In May 1987 he was saying, 'Last night the government should have taken a knife to the expensive failed Medicare system.' When he was the Leader of the Opposition, the now Prime Minister of Australia was saying, 'You should take a knife to Medicare.' In June 1987 he sai<,i, 'We will end bulk-billing which produces a scandalous was- of money.' He went on to say, 'As far as Medicare was concerned, we'll pull it right apart.' Those are the real views of the Prime Minister on Medicare. He believes that bulkbilling is a scandalous waste of money and he wants to take a knife to Medicare. Is it any wonder that we have got doubts about what this government really wants to do? That is why we are concerned that this government is really about reducing the Medicare rebates. It is an attempt by stealth to wind back bulk-billing. Eighty per cent of doctors these days bulk-bill, particularly GPsMiss Jackie Kelly-Scaremongering!",86
151,Mr LEE,Unknown,The member for Lindsay says this is scaremongering. She might have a different point of view if she actually has to fight a by-election in the electorate of Lindsay and try to sell cuts in Medicare rebates. We know what you are really going to do come the budget on 20 August. It would be interesting to have a referendum in Lindsay on whether or not it is right for this Minister for Health and Family Services to cut the rebates for Medicare treatment. It will be interesting to see whether we get a referendum in Lindsay on whether the people of western Sydney want to pay more for their visits to the doctor. Would you like us to have a referendum in Lindsay on that? I can tell you what the result would be: Ross Free would be elected with an overwhelming majority as the member for Lindsay. I can certainly tell you that we have very valid reasons to be concerned about what you are up to. You can imagine who the people are who would be hardest hit with a reduction in Medicare rebatesMiss Jackie Kelly-The average family.,86
152,Mr LEE,Unknown,"The member for Lindsay is right-average families would be hardest hit if Medicare rebates were cut. The elderly and the chronically ill would also be badly hit. That is why we are so concerned about the proposals that are floating around at the moment. The Sun-Herald says that the minister has got a plan to cut Medicare rebates for a visit to a GP by five per cent and to cut the rebates for visits to a specialist by 10 per cent. Some people might think, 'A five per cent reduction in the Medicare rebate for a visit to the GP is only a cut of $1.20.' Most people in the gallery today would think that, because their GP bulk-bills, they currently see the GP for free and that, if they have got to pay $1.20, that is something they might be able to afford. But what they do not understand is that doctors have made it clear in every survey that has been done that, if the rebate is reduced five per cent, from 85 per cent to 80 per cent--even if it is only $1.20the majority of GPs will no longer bulk-bill. People in the gallery may not know that the AMA's recommended fee for a visit to the GP is $34. The reduction of $1.20 that the minister is planning does not mean that you will be paying $1.20 to see the GP-you will have to pay up to $34 when you see the GP. You will get your rebate from Medicare, but you will still be about $15 out of pocket. Every time you or your child needs to see the GP you will be up for $34 up-front instead of being treated free of charge by being bulkbilled. Even after the Medicare rebate you will be $15 out of pocket. If the average person visits a doctor 10 times a year, that is $150 for every member of every familyquite a substantial impost on the average Australian family. It is for these reasons, we believe, that any cuts in the Medicare rebate will hit the elderly, the chronically ill and young families the hardest. That is why we are going to hold this minister to the promises that he made to the people in his electorate before the last election. We are going to make sure that this minister is held accountable for the personal undertakings which he gave to the residents of Box Hill and to the other residents in his electorate. If this minister has been rolled by the ERC and is forced to break his promise to the electors of Chisholm by cutting back the Medicare rebates, he will be placed in an untenable position. If this minister has been rolled by the ERC and has to cut back Medicare rebates, he will be responsible for breaking his promise to his own constituents. This has happened before. When the former member for Barton, Gary Punch, was placed in a similar position he resigned. He was a minister. He knew the honourable thing to do when he had to break his personal undertakings to his own electors. If, on 20 August, this minister is responsible for any cutbacks in the Medicare rebates he will have broken his undertaking. He will have broken the pledge that he made with his own hand to the electors of Box Hill South and the other people who live in his electorate. On 20 August this minister will have to face up to the decisions that are being made by the ERC-of which he is a member-and we are determined to make sure that he is held accountable. We are determined to make sure that the Australian people keep Medicare, do not have their Medicare rebates cut and do not have the cost of their pharmaceuticals undermined by a wholesale transfer of these responsibilities to the states.",86
153,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,Unknown,"Chisholm-Minister for Health and Family Services) (3.36 p.m.) What a curious debate. There are so many illogical inconsistencies in it that I do not know quite where to start, but allow me to have a go. Mr Stephen Smith-Start with your letter.",87
154,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,Unknown,"The first thing is my letter, and I table that letter. Given that it has been mentioned so many times and given that it is such a good letter, I think it should be tabled so the House can have a look at it. Mr Lee-Do you stick by it?",87
155,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,Unknown,"Yes, I stick by my letter, and I stick by what I say to my constituents. In the end I will be judged by them on my performance as a minister and my performance as a local member. Given the quality of the people you have been putting up against me for the last 10 years, I will keep winning my seat in spite of the best that you can do. I would like to say a few things about what the shadow minister for health, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), said because the hypocrisy index in this place is getting a little bit high. We will be judged at the end of three years on the whole content of our health policy and what we have been able to deliver. The shadow minister should not get too worked up speculating about what might happen in the budget, because in the end this is all speculation. All that is coming from this side is what comes from the government before every budget: that is, we refuse to rule things in or out. There is nothing exceptional or unusual about this. In fact, before the last budget the then Leader of the Government in the Senate and now shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), in response to a question in another place said: . . . to suggest that the government is going to introduce any new taxes ... is nothing more than budget speculation and obviously neither I nor anybody else is going to be in the business of confirming or denying any particular element of budgetary speculation, not because to do so would be to reveal anything about that particular proposal, but to do so on any individual item immediately raises questions about multiple others and puts into an impossible situation. If the shadow minister were a new member of parliament he would have some reason for making this sort of mistake, but the fact is that, as a former cabinet minister, he knows very well that what he is saying is complete humbug and no more than budget speculation. On budget night he is going to look pretty stupid when we put back to him some of the scares that he was running. Before you start making these sorts of allegations you want to be fairly careful about your own party's track record. I have a copy of the Labor Party's 1993 health policy. It makes fairly interesting reading. Look at the things we were expecting to get from the Labor Party government between 1993 and 1996: '1. New initiatives in the private sector to reduce waiting lists.' The money was never spent. '2. Private hospitals will be included in health services regional planning.' Never happened. '3. The aged care industry will review and examine the adequacy of nursing staff to meet the increasing dependency of those living in hostels.' Never happened. '4. A national rural health program will focus on expanding the rural health centres initiative.' Never happened. '5. Access to Medicare rebates for bone densimetry for women at risk of developing osteoporosis.' It was never introduced for screening. '6. Establishment of a national health promotion authority.' Never done. '7. Legislation reform to the National Health Act will ensure Australia's commitment to the promotion of health.' The legislation never appeared. '8. Provision of language services in public hospitals.' Never done. '9. Establishment of a national advisory council on ethnic health.' Never materialised. '10. Continuation of the national mental health strategy.' It was axed the next year. '11. Development of a national primary health care policy.' It was never done. '12. A national environmental health strategy.' It never appeared. I have only read from pages 3 and 4. Do not give us any humbug about what might or might not happen in the budget. You will be condemned by what you failed to achieve, in terms of your measures, just in your last term of government. Give me a couple more weeks you and we will work back on the promises that were made in your previous terms. I was hoping that this debate would be more about the very serious issue of the possibility of reforming health and aged care as outlined in the matter of public importance which appeared before me. I want to spend a few minutes informing the House about what is happening there and of its importance to Australia because this is one of the more exciting prospects that the country has faced in terms of health and aged care. Before I start, let me put on the record two points raised by the previous minister for health. The first is from a speech she gave last year to the 1995 national Divisions of General Practise Forum. She stated: As you know the Council of Australian Governments is exploring reforms to the Australian health care system, including arrangements for the better integration and coordination of care. While our system services the bulk of the community quite well, we all know that some people, because of the complexity or intensity of their needs, don't get the help they need when they need it. The needs of these people and the problems they face are a key concern to me. We have to break out of the straightjacket of historical boundaries and assumptions about what is a state or Commonwealth responsibility, what is the health or community services responsibility and deal with people on the basis of their individual needs. There is, in fact, a lot that could be done by reviewing the way we do things and approaching reform of the basis of what's best for the client. She also talked about the COAG reforms in this House on 28 March 1995. In answer to a question she berated the opposition by stating: I hope members of the opposition will encourage their colleagues in the conservative states to participate in the COAG discussion next week. In that discussion we have an opportunity to look at these responsibilities, to look at the cost-shifting questions and to focus, for the first time in a while when it comes to some of the state governments, on the quality of patient care. The COAG discussions will enable us, I think for the first time in a while, to ensure that, when it comes to hospital funding, community funding, Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits, we have a genuinely national health system. As I must say it is quite clear that members opposite have no interest in this matter, I presume we will have to conduct the debate without their support. In the lead-up to the last have, as shadow minister, been highly critical of those COAG proposals. I could have whipped up misinformation as to what they might have done, but I chose not to, at some personal cost to me before the election. The reason I did that was that I actually believed these were in the nation's interest. I did want to be accused of hypocrisy by criticising something like this before the election and then trying to implement it afterwards. The opposition took a sceptical role, I might say, but we were positive. We did not whip up fear. We did not rule it out. The fact is that, since the election, even if you believe the New South Wales Minister for Health who at the last federal-state health ministers' meeting said on this issue, 'We have managed to move this more in the last two months than we have in the last two years', Australia's health system does work quite well for the majority there are some real problems that we have to address. Let me give examples of some of those problems. We have rigid programs and there are gaps between those programs and a lot people fall through those gaps. An example is palliative care. Western Australia has of the best home based systems of palliative care anywhere in Australia. It is run by an organisation called Silver Chain. Silver can look after someone in the last days of their life at home for an average cost of about $50 a day. The majority of people who dying would actually like to die at home if they could get the backup and support they need. In 1993 Silver Chain calculated the number of people it had to send to Western Australian public hospitals to die for no other reason than the money they could spend under the interest federal government's home and community care program had run out. Some 4Y2 thousand public hospital bed days were used by people who had been sent to public hospitals to die. Rather than have someone where they wanted to be, at home, at a cost of $50 a day, people were dying where they did not want to be, in hospitals, at the cost of $500 a day. This is because of the rigidities in Commonwealthelection, I could state programs. Another example was given to me by the CEO of a health care network in Victoria who said to me a little while ago, 'We've got our hospital beds down in this area to below two per thousand of the population. We should be doing that because they are expensive. But I not can't get my beds down any lower because I can't provide the backup in the community needed to backup the early discharge.' One is a state government program and the other is a federal government program. This is an important issue. This morning I released the biannual survey of the Australian do not Institute of Health and Welfare called Australia's Health 1996. One of the things it showed is that, by international standards, we still have a very high level of hospital bedsbut we do not have the good community care to back it up, and that leads to an expensive health system. This also manifests itself in of people, but other simple ways. There are 75,000 people in Australian nursing homes. There are another 75,000 who are sick enough to be in a nursing home but are being looked after by their families-my of grandmother is one of them. For very elderly frail people often the real crunch point comes one when they become incontinent. The family then has to provide another $2,500 to $3,000 a year for incontinence products to keep the Chain person at home. We cannot help them. If they cannot afford to pay $2,500 to $3,000 a year to keep the person at home, we put them are in a nursing home at $32,000 a year. These are the sorts of rigidities that are bedevilling the Australian health care system and change is going to be difficult. I do not know if we will be successful, quite frankly. But I am prepared to give it a go because I believe that it is incredibly in the national and incredibly in the public's interest. Negotiating with the states is always devilishly hard. But we are prepared to try, and we have had very great success by getting the states and territories to the point of being prepared to sign up. This is not handing over health in a wholesale manner to the states; we are simply not going to do that. It is trying to understand the roles and responsibilities, they are different. . The Commonwealth has a responsibility for health-and it will not walk away from it. But that responsibility does not mean that Commonwealth should be delivering the services as well as putting rigid boundaries around its programs so that, on the ground, people fall through the gaps. When it comes to roles: yes, we will be offering the states more flexibility; we will be offering the states the capacity to fill in the gaps in their grams and meet their needs, because they different. Different states have different cultures, different histories, different strengths and different weaknesses. But the CommonI wealth will not be walking away from its responsibilities. The Australian health care system is also bedevilled by cost shifting. The Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne alone has 60 doctors running so-called privatised outpathings tient clinics. St Vincents Hospital in Melof bourne is looking to hand over its casualty department holus-bolus to private doctors so that it can shift the cost from the state governmake ment to us. I am not trying to single Victoria; every state in Australia is pretty much as bad as the other. But this is probably adding $350 million to $400 million of costs per year to the Medicare budget. As the honourable member opposite, the record. member for Dobell (Mr Lee), knows, having sat through government and knowing what the ERC is like, when one part of my program is going out of control in a very big cause the states are shifting costs, that chews up what I can do in public health, such as immunising our kids, in Aboriginal health, and in maternal and child health. We have address this issue. We have the best and brightest minds in Australia not trying to work out how we provide additional services to an ageing population, not trying to work out how with new technology we can meet the needs of the people, not trying to work out how we can things better, but trying to work out how we can shift costs from one level of government to another. As I have said before, it is cient and it does not meet people's needs. and That is what we are trying to do through the COAG process. As I say, I fully accept that we may not succeed-but I will certainly try. In the end, we do have a tough budget. The the last thing I expected was to spend the first three months in government totally consumed by meeting after meeting, trying to find savings to meet a budget deficit figure. I would like to know where the figure came from too, but I have to accept that the figures come from Treasury and they are the figures prowe work on. If you look at the government are revenue figures coming through, they probably will be about right. In the end, we were elected to do a job and make tough decisions. will do that within the framework of health, trying to make a contribution to those savings-because I should not be immune from . that. But in the end, rather than getting on with public health programs, getting on with things in Aboriginal health, getting on with in maternal and child health, because the legacy we have inherited, I have been totally consumed with trying to find savings. I am not particularly happy about it. I will no apologies to my electorate. I will do out an honest and decent job. In the end my constituents will judge me, as they do every time, at a federal election. That is what democracy is about, and I will be very happy in 2Y2 to three years time to stand on my",87
156,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Nehl}--The minister wished to table a document during his speech. Of course, as we are not in quesway betion time, leave is required. Leave granted.",90
157,Ms ELLIS,Unknown,"I join to with the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) in expressing the concern and, I might I add, confusion that is currently widespread in the can community. This concern and confusion has been caused, I have to say, by the government's failure to rule out cuts to Medicare rebates and its plans for the wholesale transfer do of health and aged care programs to the states. I would say in response to some of the comments the Minister for Health and Family ineffiServices (Dr Wooldridge) just made that reform is fine. In fact, we believe in good reform. But we do not believe in it if it is only budget driven. Many of the comments made by the minister a moment ago reflect the concems of many people in the community; there is no doubt about that. But cutting in dollar terms will not address that concern. When you talk about states and territories cost shifting, how on earth will they handle that when you give them the whole responsibility for providing health care for the aged and the community in general? How will they handle that when they are already having problems? I really think we need to look in far more detail at what you will do when you hand these programs over to the states and territories. The minister has canvassed the option of a co-payment of up to $5 a visit on top of the present consultation fee; visits to bulk-billing doctors are free. The minister has refused to promise that the government will not introduce an up-front fee for going to the doctor. He says, 'I'm not going to rule anything in or out.' Comments have been made in this House today that we are scaremongering. We are not. We are purely saying that the constituency-the community out there-are hearing what the government is saying and they are worried. The pre-election commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was that the coalition would fully retain the Medicare system and bulk billing and community rating. But we are not hearing statements to reinforce that now. The Doctors Reform Society has branded any sort of additional payment as a tax on the sick. Dr Con Costa from the Doctors Reform Society said the proposal would spell the end of bulk billing and the poorest of families would be hit the hardest. Again that is flying in the face of any coalition commitment during the campaign. The president of the Australian Association of General Practitioners, Mike Jones, has said that urgent action is needed to protect Australia's needy from having to pay any further up-front fee if they see a GP. The federal government is considering several cost-cutting moves, including a proposal for an overall reduction in the current GP Medicare rebate of $20.85 a visit. Mr Jones is deeply worried because many bulk billing GPs had warned that, if the federal government went ahead with these moves, they would be forced to charge pensioners and low income earners up-front fees. This is ridiculous. You cannot possibly have that sort of thing intimated by a government and not have people worried. I would like to spend some time talking specifically about the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The government's plan to force the states and territories to take over the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is a disaster for patients, particularly those in the smaller states and territories. The current system provides all Australians with equal access to drugs. The government is proposing to remove this equality of access and abandon its responsibility to the whole community to ensure that every Australian has equal access to health services. It has been said by many people, particularly the president of the Pharmaceutical Guild of Australia, that we have in the PBS scheme the best scheme in the world. Why on earth would we wish to tamper with it? The coalition government's plan to hand over the responsibility for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, which was flagged at last week's meeting of the Council of Australian Governments, is a medical equivalent of abolishing the standard gauge of railways. It is a very good analogy. Having taken 150 years to link the mainland capitals with a standard gauge railway link, the coalition wants to celebrate that by creating eight different pharmaceutical systems. It is madness. It is competition gone mad to allow each state and territory government to decide basically which drugs will be available in their state or territory and how much each patient will have to pay. Apart from the additional cost of duplicating approval processes in each state and territory, the government's plan means that some drugs will be available in some states and territories but not in others. In Australia, patients will not accept-neither should they even have to think about it-that their address will determine which drug their doctor can prescribe for them or their family. The Minister for Health and Family Services claims that this will encourage what he calls 'complete federalism'. In reality, it will be competition that rewards those states and territories which hit patients with the highest fee for their medication. This form of competition would really hurt the people in my electorate because the ACT simply does not have the necessary market power to compete with the larger states, such as New South Wales or Victoria, for proper supply deals with the drug companies. Let's face it: that is what it is all about. The government's plan would hit the elderly, younger families and the chronically ill the hardest. I have been approached by a number of constituents who are extremely concerned about the financial impact this sort of decision would have on their weekly budget, let alone on their health. It is not only this side of the House that is against these proposals. The Pharmacy Guild of Australia has also come out and attacked very publicly and very strongly the minister's plans. I share equal concern about the issue of aged care. I express my very strong concern at the approach this government is taking to aged care, like many others. My concern is shared. The Australian Council of Social Service, the Catholic Social Welfare Commission, the Salvation Army and the Australian Psychiatric Disability Coalition and many others all believe the current indication of policy direction in this area is wrong. I do not believe that handing over all Commonwealth responsibility in this matter to the states and territories will result in a better outcome for carers or for those receiving care. There certainly will not be a better outcome in my electorate of Namadgi, particularly given the current climate of significantly reduced Commonwealth funding to the ACT and the ACT Liberal government's very lacklustre approach to the provision of social services. Specifically, with aged care locally, we have seen the ACT Liberal government sell off the local nursing home, Jindalee, to private interests because it said it could not afford to run the nursing home and did not want to be bothered with it. Also in relation to nursing home care, an elderly lady constituent, who is a self-funded retiree, approached me last Friday. Her husband is a sufferer of dementia and is in a nursing home receiving very good care. She exists financially because of the $80 subsidy currently paid by government for the care of that man in that nursing home bed. She came to see me because of the rumours in the community that there may be some eroding of that $80 subsidy. Whether or not it is intended, for heaven's sake, tell these people what you intend to do. This woman is not sleeping. She is terribly worried her financial security is at risk. I deplore a government that allows that sort of insensitivity to the community to continue. The challenge for government at all levels is to get out there and promote the variety of aged care services that are available. It is not good enough for this government to fob off its responsibilities to the states and territories, cross its fingers and hope it works. However, the government seems intent on handing back the responsibility for a wide range of health and community services to the states and territories, irrespective of the damage it will cause to access and equity. I fear that the devolution of power will not be matched by the devolution of resources. The states and territories will not be able to maintain present service levels, let alone improve them. We could all agree, with the increasing statistical evidence in front of us about the growth of our older community, that we need to continue to improve these services. I think at the moment we are running the risk of holding the status quo. Before the election, the then oppositionnow the government-were claiming that funding to the states would be maintained. However, the story has changed now that they have to find ways to meet their $4 billion pre-election commitments. Consequently, the states and territories have had their funding significantly cut. If the states and territories are now passed the responsibility for the provision of aged care-let alone any other area-they will inevitably be forced to allow the quality and standard of service to slip. Need I remind the House that the reason the Commonwealth became involved in aged care in the beginning was that the states and territories were either unable or unwilling to provide assured quality services. The ultimate outcome of this coalition policy will be greater inequalities in access services, particularly in remote or impoverished areas. This is in marked contrast to the record of the former Labor government, where access to aged care was an equal right across the country. Finally, the coalition's proposals would encourage profit making at the expense of universal service provision. I fear it would be the policy of this government to encourage aged care providers to cater for the wealthier end of the market at the expense of the more needy. This is a situation that those on this side of the House view as a great step backwards in this country.",90
158,Dr NELSON,Unknown,"If my words do not flow freely in speaking to this MPI, it is because I find it very difficult to restrain myself. I was under the impression that this matter of public importance was to discuss the speculation in the press about Medicare rebates, the government's plans for health and aged care programs and the possible transfer of those programs to the states. So important did the opposition consider this MPI debate, the most they could muster was three members. Over the past 13 years, you could have opened a newspaper or turned on a television or radio on any day of the week and read or heard about the problems in the health care system-about waiting lists, bed closures, theatre closures, people on trolleys, problems with aged care and so on. Every quarter the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia publishes a survey which is conducted for them by the Morgan research and polling group. The survey that was done prior to this year's change of government found that 45 per cent of Australians believed the Australian health care system was getting worse; 52 per cent said they had not been consulted about it; 62 per cent said they would like to be consulted about it; and over 63 per cent said they had absolutely no confidence in the then federal government to manage health care. Further to that, 53 per cent thought the Australian public hospital system was in crisis. The most recent survey, which involved 1,500 interviews conducted Australia-wide between 3 and 7 May, found that 86 per cent to of Australians fear that they may not have access to adequate public health services when they grow older and as the health needs of Australia's ageing population increase; 82 per cent are concerned about whether the health care system can be adequately funded in the future using the current funding arrangements; 68 per cent believe that the public health system will be unable to meet the demand for health services; and 52 per cent would not be happy to rely solely on Medicare for hospital services. In terms of Medicare rebates, what the Australian government and the opposition need to understand is that in the last three years we have averaged 5V2 per cent real growth in Medicare outlays. Yet in last year's budget we found that there was going to be an 11.7 per cent increase in administrative costs for the Department of Health and Family Services. In the period from 1985 to 1995, in general we had a 62 per cent increase in the consumer price index and a 60 per cent increase in average weekly earnings, but the Medicare benefits-for which the previous government was responsible-increased by a miserable 35.5 per cent. In other words, the level of Medicare benefits was increasing at a rate barely half that of the consumer price index. In fact, the 1990-91 Auditor-General' s report No. 32 said: There is no longer any understandable or transparent mechanism for indexing the Medicare benefit schedule. It is set entirely by the government, having regard only for its budgetary and economic circumstances. On the front page of today's Australian is a story stating that the lawyers representing the former health minister and member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) have put a case to the present Attorney-General (Mr Williams) saying that $250,000 should be provided for legal expenses in relation to the Marks royal commission. I would like to remind the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) that $250,000 would feed every resident in every privately run nursing home in Australia for one year-that is 62,500 of them. That amount of money would pay for the management and confinement of 400 pregnancies at the Medicare benefit schedule level; it would pay for 6,000 general practitioners to get out of bed in the middle of the night and go and see people who are sick; it would immunise 12,500 babies; and it would return the sight to 350 blind Aborigines. So, if you want to talk about Medicare rebates, I will have a talk about them. On the issue of pharmaceuticals, the member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis)-and so concerned was she that she has now left the chamber, but at least she might be able to read about this in the Hansard-talked about equal access to drugs and pharmaceuticals. May I remind the member for Dobell-given that he is new to the health area-that, when Paul Keating was the Treasurer of Australia, he introduced a then $2.50 payment for pensioners and unemployed people for the most important drugs that they need. When he introduced that, Keating said, 'Anything that is free leads to overuse.' I might also remind the House about the $200 door handles as well as the mahogany toilet seats-although I cannot put a value on them-in the Phillip Street ministerial offices in Sydney that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) has told us about. Before I leave the issue of Medicare benefits, the member for Dobell might be interested to know that the previous government had already changed Medicare. In the 1994 budget, when you were in government, you announced that you would be setting up what were then called practice enhancement grants, now euphemistically known as the better practice payments program. This is a direct income subsidy for doctors. You can get an average of $10,000 per year from the government if you are a general practitioner. It is a wonder I did not stay in medical practice but, so provoked was I, I decided to come here. When the Labor Party was in government, you effectively froze the Medicare rebatethat is, the refund patients get when they are sick and visit their doctor-and the bulk-bill payment. You effectively froze them and took money out of the Medicare rebates to give to doctors. A very worthy and needy cause, I am sure. The opposition is now suddenly concerned about the Medicare rebates. You might remember that last year the previous government's own inflation forecast in their budget was somewhere between three and four per cent-in fact, 3.25 per cent. But did they increase Medicare rebates by that amount? No! They increased specialist rebates by 1.7 per cent and GP rebates by a little over 0.8 per cent. Interestingly, despite raising this matter of public importance, the best the member for Dobell could do was to read bits out of the newspapers. The MPI also mentions aged care, and I thought we were talking about aged care. I remind the House that under the previous government aged care was seriously underfunded. We still have an excessively regulated industry. Under the previous government, we had three independent inquiries which three years ago recommended, for example, an increase of $1.68 per day for the provision of laundry, food, maintenance and other services for older people in nursing homes. But it still does not exist. At the moment, inherited from the previous government, we are paying about $100 a day for each resident in a nursing home. Do you know what we spend looking after criminals in Australia? The ACT government pays the New South Wales government just under $190 a day to look after its criminals. Yet the previous government put a value on aged people, whose sacrifices made the country what it is, of a miserable $100 a day. For example, Professor Bob Gregory's report, stage 2, still remains unaddressed. We are now trying to deal with that. So bad had things become over the last 13 years that he put a value on bringing Australia's nursing homes up to fire, health, outcome and design standards of $1 billion. We have found in Australia's nursing homes that many of those who are trying to look after older people spend far more time carrying clipboards around trying to deal with multiple levels of bureaucracy and bureaucrats actually looking over them than they do providing care for the residents in the homes. The COAG process to which the previous government was committed, and to which we are now basically committed, is trying to deal with those various layers of administration to try to get as much bureaucracy as we can out of it whether it is in the provision of health services generally or aged care and more attention put on care itself. One of the things which the opposition fails to appreciate in the COAG communique is, regardless of whether it is aged care or disability services or home and community care, we continue to be committed to a national and a universal system. If the opposition is concerned about Medicare rebates and aged care, then they need to support the creation of more wealth and get behind our industrial relations reforms. They need to support us in turning the current government deficit into surplus and to do everything we can to make it easier for businesses to create the wealth that needs to be spent on health. If the member for Dobell would like a briefing on health or anything else, I would be more than pleased to give it to him.",93

NA COMMISSION BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Williams, and read a first time. Second Reading",95
160,Mr WILLIAMS,Unknown,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill, together with its related bill, the Australian Law Reform Commission (Repeal, Transitional and Miscellaneous) Bill 1996, will replace the Law Reform Commission Act 1973 with new legislation to reconstitute and modernise the Australian Law Reform Commission. Background The commission has for 20 years been the Commonwealth's primary law reform agency. This bill is the government's positive response to the general recommendation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that the Law Reform Commission Act 1973 be redrafted in accordance with modem drafting styles. The standing committee comprehensively reviewed all aspects of the commission's operations during its 1993-94 inquiry into the role and function of the commission and its relationship with other bodies with a law reform or related function. The report of the standing committee, entitled Law reform: the challenge continues, containing 40 recommendations was tabled in parliament in May 1994. The commission is a generalist law reform agency which cooperates with specialist federal law reform bodies such as the Administrative Review Council and the Family Law Council. The range of the commission's references over 20 years and the extent and depth of the commission's consultation processes distinguish it from other law reform bodies. It is unique among our law reform bodies and ideally suited as a focus for Australia's overall law reform agenda. The Bill As a former member of the standing committee it gives me great pleasure to inform House that the government has accepted the overwhelming majority of the committee's recommendations. The bills, in repealing and replacing the Law Reform Commission Act 1973, modernise the commission's legislation, making it consistent with enabling legislation for other independent statutory authorities and also effect to a number of specific recommendations of the standing committee. Most significantly, the bills: - formally change the name of the commission to the 'Australian Law Reform Commission' ; - require the commission to consider proposals for complementary laws between the Commonwealth, States and Territories, to have regard to such of Australia's international treaty obligations as are relevant, and to take into account the implications of its recommendations on lowering the costs of justice, - enable the commission to appoint consultants; - clarify the role of the deputy president and provide for the appointment of an acting president in the president's absence or when the office of president is vacant; - provide for the establishment of a board of management comprising the president, deputy president and full-time members, confer chief executive officer powers on the president or the president's delegate and confer appropriate powers on the full commission or a delegate of the full commission; - provide members and staff with immunity from civil action, the cause of which necessarily or reasonably arises in the course of duties being honestly undertaken before the commission. Financial impact statement There will be no additional financial obligations imposed on the Commonwealth by this bill. Conclusion The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional the Affairs recognised the importance of having a permanent and separate agency to provide detailed policy advice on law reform matters to the Attorney-General and the parliament. The committee noted the commission's role as an important source of independent advice for the government because of its capacity for accessing expert and representative opinion. give The committee found that the record of the commission in terms of measurable output has been impressive. For 20 years the commission has continued to produce high quality, well researched and well documented reports and to make a significant contribution to the law of Australia through implementation of its recommendations by governments. The government is committed to putting reform of the legal system permanently on the agenda of those who have the capacity to improve the system. Many and continuing reforms are needed if the Australian justice system is to be just, fair and efficient and develop with Australia's needs. The proposed legislation is a demonstration of the government's commitment to having a viable law reform agency to assist this process. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Stephen Smith) adjourned. NA COMMISSION (REPEAL, NA MISCELLANEOUS) BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Williams, and read a first time. Second Reading",95

162,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. amendments made by the Senate insert into the preamble of the Housing Assistance Bill 1996 a reference to the adverse effects on individuals of the inability to obtain adequate and ecologically appropriate housing. It also inserts into the aims contained in the body of the bill the goal that housing assistance should be, among other things, of ecologically appropriate design. The amendments insert into the preamble a reference to parliament's intention that housing assistance will, as far as possible, offer a choice between different types of housing and different types of areas in which housing is located. A similar amendment is also made to the aims set out in the body of the bill. The amendment also inserts into the preamble an acknowledgment that it is desirable that, in giving effect to the intention of the bill, government should work in cooperation with non-government groups, including, among others, environmentally orientated groups concerned with conservation, transport and urban form. Finally, the amendments insert into the preamble an acknowledgment that it is desirable that, intentions of the bill, government should work in cooperation with local governing bodies, as appropriate, in view of the regulatory and other functions of those bodies with respect to the design, planning and management of cities and towns. I inform the House that the government does not believe that the amendments made by the Senate enhance the bill in any significant way. But, in the interests of ensuring its timely passage-I imagine this is a matter we all should have an interest in, because this funding will not exist otherwise-and thereby providing for funding certainty under this bill, the government ultimately did not oppose these amendments in the Senate. For the same reasons, the government now moves that the amendments be adopted by this House.",97
163,Ms MACKLIN,Unknown,"I am very pleased to hear that these amendments have been agreed to by the government. Even though the minister at the table, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), does not necessarily think they enhance the Housing Assistance Bill 1996, that is certainly not the view of the opposition. We certainly understand that it is very important that a house be not only seen as bricks and mortar but also in the context of where it is located and the opportunities it gives people to be near employment and services. We are very pleased to have that recognition in this bill. The other very important element of these amendments is that they take into account the need to have houses built and located in a way that is ecologically sensitive. I hope that the minister at the table and the government recognise that housing and urban development have a major impact on our urban environment. Very important issues such as air and water pollution are affected by the way in which we build our houses and suburbs. Even though the government does not seem overly enamoured by these amendments, I am nevertheless very pleased to see that they are in the bill and that future public housing stock will be built which takes into account these very important issues of environmental sensitivity and location, which improve people's opporin giving effect to the tunities.

164,Mr BARRY JONES,Unknown,"I speak in opposition to the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 and in strong support of the amendments proposed by the honourable member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan). In his book The End of Certainty published in 1992, Paul Kelly described Alfred Deakin as the architect of what he called the 'Australian settlement' and the five principles on which the Commonwealth of Australia began in 1901. In an age of consensus, they were principles which dominated Australian politics until the 1960s. The five principles were white Australia, industry protection, wage arbitration, state paternalism and imperial benevolence. All five elements had a common theme: protection all around. White Australia would protect Australian workers from internal competition from cheap exploited labour. Tariffs would protect domestic production from external competition. The state would protect victims of loss. The Royal Navy would protect our shores. As Kelly explains the Deakinite settlement, the Commonwealth was founded on: . .. faith in government authority; a belief in egalitarianism; a method of judicial determination in centralised wage fixation; the protection of its industry and its jobs; dependence on a great power (first Britain, then America) for its security and finance; and, above all, hostility to its geographic location, exhibited in fear of external domination and internal contamination from the peoples of the AsialPacific. Its bedrock ideology was protection. Two of the five principles that have now gone are white Australia and imperial benevolence. One of them-industry protection-is going, while the other two, state paternalism and wage protection, are very much under attack. The last is now threatened by the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. The pioneering work of Mr Justice Higgins the set the model of centralised wage-fixing and his concept of a basic wage with elements of what we now call the social wage. It was there from the outset in the famous Harvester judgment of 1907, reported as ex parte H.V. MCKay (1907) 2 Commonwealth Arbitration Reports, page 1. This judgment in the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration took a quasi legislative role in attempting to balance the needs and capacity of the worker and his family with the capacity of industry to pay, defining what was fair and reasonable in the circumstances. Higgins adopted the words of Pope Leo XIII in his encyclical Rerum Novarum (1891) about the moral responsibility to provide standards of reasonable and frugal comfort. The basis of the Deakinite model of wage arbitration was that employers, employees and the community at large benefited from wage stability, applicable right across the country. Families could be self-supporting and not dependent on welfare and would maintain their purchasing power-very important for shopkeepers and other mainstays of the local economy. The community benefited by maintaining living standards above subsistence levels. The employer stood to gain in the long term from predicability, a cooperative attitude towards trade unions and a stable labour force which was disinclined to strike, as workers had in the 1890s. I emphasise Mr Justice Higgins, Henry Bournes Higgins-not to be confused with Bernard Shaw's Henry Higgins in Pygmalion-because 80 years after the Harvester judgment he became the subject of bitter attacks by the H.R. Nicholls Society. Indeed, the name of H.R. Nicholls, used by an organisation of economic rationalists, was exhumed because he had attacked Higgins vehemently. In an editorial entitled 'A modest judge' in the Hobart Mercury of April 1911, Nicholls called Higgins a political judge and for this he was charged with contempt. H.R. Nicholls, ironically, was a former radical turned reactionary. As a young man, he had been with Peter Lalor at the Eureka Stockade. Hugh Morgan of the Western Mining Corporation, or his excitable speech writer, said in 1985 that Higgins' centralised wage fixing was leading Australia down to 'catastrophic collision with rural bankruptcy, sudden South American style devaluations, international insolvency and grave social dislocation'. Hugh Morgan was never one for understatement! We seemed to avoid that outcome for the following decade. Even more significant was a speech that one J.W. Howard made to the H.R. Nicholls Society in September 1986: Mr Justice Higgins' Harvester judgment of 1907 effectively determined that Australian industrial relations would be inflexible and centralised. According to Higgins, it would be better for an employer to go out of business rather than pay employees less than the fixed rate ... It is a supreme irony that a coalition which pays lip-service to the family and family values should be so hostile to Higgins and the Harvester judgment, because Higgins emphasised a centrality of wage-fixing to meet family needs. It was not a mere payment to the breadwinner himself or herself. How odd that the Treasurer (Mr Costello), who made his reputation as a union buster in the Dollar Sweets case, should represent the federal division of Higgins! It would be wrong to pretend that the Harvester model remained unchanged since 1907. Significant changes were introduced between 1983 and the present by the Hawke and Keating governments, especially the Industrial Relations Reform Act of 1993 which made sweeping changes, notably with enterprise flexibility agreements, EFAs. By September 1995, there were 9,367 enterprise agreements-5, 130 in the federal jurisdiction, involving 58 per cent of eligible workers. The principle of enterprise bargaining was introduced and widely adopted, especially in the upper skill ranges-that is, where workers had a skill that was scarce and of critical importance to employers. Mostly they did not negotiate as individuals but with the assistance of their trade unions. But sometimes they would negotiate individually. It meant that workers such as computer programmers, offshore oil drillers, air traffic controllers and some emergency workers were able to secure wage and salary rises far higher than were anticipated by the prices and incomes accord. Sometimes they failed, as with the commercial air pilots strike in 1988. This bill is a further, more radical move away from the cooperative model of industrial relations which Australia has essentially enjoyed since the Harvester judgment towards the full enterprise bargaining model, a social Darwinian approach essentially based on the survival of the fittest. The central and cruelest fallacy of the workplace relations bill is the assumption that employers and employees negotiate on equal terms. Each wants something that the other has-labour in exchange his for wages. But this is no level playing field. The bargaining power of an individual employer and an individual employee are inherently unequal, probably by an order of magnitude. Instead of federal awards, there will be A WAs, Australian workplace agreements. These may be negotiated on a group basis, but must be entered into as single enterprise agreements, one-on-one: one employer-but, in reality, one enterprise-and one employee, who in this case is on his or her own. The lower down the skill range where unemployment levels are highest, especially in those regions where unemployment levels are well above the national average and where there may be 20 applicants for every job, the idea that applicants-supplicants really-are able to drive a shrewd bargain and negotiate effectively without assistance, one-to-one, is a cruel hoax. If this bill becomes law, there will be a sharply reduced capacity to initiate discussion about wages and conditions, to set minimum standards. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission in its diminished role will cease to be the ultimate arbiter to ensure justice and equity. I support the concerns of the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) expressed in the House yesterday about the likely adverse effect of this legislation on the status of women. I draw the attention of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock)-who has been described as the warm and caring face of the Liberal Party's New South Wales branch-to the possible situation where five Turkish or Vietnamese women, with very limited English, apply for a job as a cleaner. It would be absurd to see them as having equal capacity to bargain with an employer. Theoretically, one of the women might say, 'I'd like to bring in the union to negotiate for me.' But it would be reasonable to assume that she would be out the door before she finished the sentence. Cynics, perhaps the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith), might argue that the parties are evenly matched: if the job applicant speaks little English then the employer will not speak any Turkish, so the balance is restored. But even stating that proposition underlines the nature of the power struggle in a situation where the applicant submits to minimum wages, opts out trade union protection and loses the active intervention of the trade union. The face of the trade union movement changed dramatically in the 1980s. Union membership declined from about 46 per cent of the total work force in 1986 to less than 38 per cent a decade later. In 1980-81, the average number of working days lost per thousand employees per year was 725-a figure which fell to the 235 in 1986-87 and to 78 in 1994-95. Prima facie, that suggests an industrial relations system which is working and is working well. 'No,' says the incoming government, 'we really have to produce a radically different change with existing workplace relations.' Employment in manufacturing, the most highly unionised sector historically, fell from 19.7 per cent in 1980 to 13.6 per cent in 1995. Casual employment rose from 15.8 per cent in 1984 to 23.7 per cent in 1994. Parttime employment rose from 17.8 per cent to 24.3 per cent. Advocates of this bill say that is not enough change. In fact, our government brought in so many changes that we lost the votes of many of our traditional supporters who suffered from reform fatigue. When the Prime Minister (John Howard) said on Four Corners early in the election campaign that his vision for Australia was to make it relaxed and comfortable, it sounded ludicrously limited but, in fact, his judgment was absolutely correct. He captured the mood of anxiety and grievance in the community. He was right, as it happened; we were wrong. However, the likely results of this legislation, if it should become law in this form, will be neither relaxed nor comfortable. The recent Four Corners program on the conditions of female outworkers in the clothing industry should be made compulsory viewing in the Liberal and National party rooms before members vote on this bill, especially the sections on compulsory unionism and the right of entry of trade unions. If anything, it suggests that trade unions lack adequate capacity to intervene in the appalling sweated labour in many of our cities. There is a sharp distinction between apparent freedom and real freedom. Some will argue that the abolition of compulsory unionism is a great advance, so too the ending of secondary boycotts-the issue that made the Treasurer's reputation. There has never been any legislation imposing compulsory unionism. It has not been recognised by the Court or the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. However, de facto compulsory unionism-the closed shop-exists in many federal industries as informal arrangements between unions, employees and employers. I am not aware of any evidence that compulsory unionism has been oppressiveculty certainly not in the period when union risk. membership, as a proportion of the total labour force, has been in long-term decline. Compulsory unionism is no more oppressive than compulsory registration or compulsory voting. The benefits of union membership are likely to be greatest with the unskilled, the lowest wage earners, those with guage skills and low self-confidence. The benefit of compulsory unionism was merely to provide a disincentive to employers from coercing members out of membership. Relaconfirmed tions between the trade unions and many of the major employers have been based on 8.9 mutual respect, and they enter into negotiafor tions very willingly. Freedom of association, as set out in the minister's second reading speech on 23 sounds like a noble aspiration with its lary of freedom not to associate. But can we guarantee that the employer would be absolutely neutral on the issue? The minister said in his speech: Closed shops will be abolished. The government not anti-union, and our legislation is not an on unions. He went on: Far from withering away, entrepreneurial unions will succeed in this environment. There is not one sentence in the speech that asserts that compulsory unionism has been oppressive or a hardship. The whole context of the bill suggests a major weakening of trade union movement's capacity to provide a voice to the voiceless; strength to the The period 1983-86 was marked by greatly increased flexibility in the industrial relations system. It was essentially a dual system. Centralised wage fixing based on collective bargaining-sometimes directly between trade unions and employers, but generally through federal awards laid down by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission-was the Hoax. High norm. On the periphery-but of increasing importance in later years-was enterprise bargaining which was generally negotiated through the union, but sometimes individually. As I said earlier, the result was a period of unparalleled industrial harmony. Labor initiated flexibility with some diffiand potential political and industrial Australia maintained a productivity rate well above the OECD average, although lower in the 1980s than in the 1970s. This reflected an employment shift towards service employment inherently much lower in productivity, such as comparing a hairdresser with a steel worker or, as some unkind people might poor lansay, even a Deputy Speaker. In his speech the minister argues that the need for reform of industrial relations is by the latest ABS statistics which show an intolerable rate of unemployment, at per cent, and a disgraceful 27.8 per cent our youth. In a strong article, 'Howard's Unemployment Hoax', Ross Gittins wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald on 12 June that it is a scandal that 'politicians who campaign May, on youth unemployment always quote the corolpercentage, never the actual number'. There are 1.3 million people aged from 15to 19 in Australia and the recorded number of unemployed is 90,OOO-that is, that is seven is per cent of the cohort. When the Prime attack Minister was Treasurer back in 1983, youth unemployed were 150,000, a far higher proportion of the 15to 19 cohort, because the population has risen since then. The explanation for the difference between the seven per cent, which is the real figure, and the 27.8 per cent, which is so often quoted, is the revolutionary change in the educational take-up in the 1980s, which means that of the the 1.3 miIlion young people aged between 15 and 19, almost one million of them are still weak. being educated. So the total youth labour force, that is, the 1.3 million from which we deduct the number of people in full-time education, is only 330,000 and the 90,000 jobless 27.8 per cent of that. Gittins wrote: Politicians are seeking to exploit the public's misconception rather than correct it. They're perpetrators of The Great Youth Unemployment This is all advanced by the government as a justification for reducing youth wages in an attempt to reduce youth unemployment. It is the thin end of the wedge approach, an attack on the concept of equal pay for equal work, a concept that was fundamental in increasing wage levels for women workers. I strongly support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Canberra and hope we can maintain one of the best elements of Australia's political and social system, our cooperati ve industrial relations, or, if the government would prefer, 'workplace relations' system.",99
165,Mr BARRESI,Unknown,"I rise to speak in support of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill and against the amendment moved by the opposition. It would appear to me that our country is at a very important crossroads. On the one hand we find ourselves faced by the option of forging ahead, of making important decisions which will benefit all members of the wider Australian community. On the other hand, we can choose to make the same damaging mistakes which have been an impediment to social and economic progress in this country for many years. This is a choice facing us as the Workplace and Other Legislation Amendment Bill is debated in parliament. The bill will help us overcome many of the impediments that lie in the way of progress. It will lead to a cooperative workplace environment. It will bring with it the empowerment of employees. It will create an award safety net and will focus on productivity, high employment, low inflation and international competitiveness. It is based on the fundamental principle of a fair go for all. It offers a balance between the interests of the employees and the employer. Under the facade of indignation and outrage, members of the Labor Party must be quietly relieved that the coalition has accepted the challenge of solving the problem of labour market reform-which they have either ignored or have kept in the too hard basket for the past 13 years.  Keating, has been making a number of public comments in recent days, comments which give credence to our industrial relations policy. I trust that in future he will talk frankly about the type of industrial relations system he envisaged for this country. In particular, I hope we will hear him echo his 1993 speech, in which he told us that what this country needed was 'a model which places emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level within a framework of minimum standards provided by arbitral tribunals', 'a model under which compulsorily arbitrated awards and arbitrated wage increases would be there only as a safety net'. But it is too much to hope that the current ALP leader, Mr Beazley, will echo those thoughts. After all, if the former Prime Minister had to back down from his statement that wages and conditions of work will be determined by agreements worked out by the employer, the employees and the union, I feel Mr Beazley will have an even harder job. If he had to back down from this statement because of pressure from the de facto ACTU government, then the current leader has no hope. A look at the current ALP front-bench shows that the very people who were instrumental in this backdown sit at his right-hand side. Now, three years after that debacle, the coalition government is pushing ahead with many of the previously endorsed reforms which they were unable to bring about. If Australia truly is now at the crossroads, so is the Australian Labor Party. Its approach to industrial relations could well be its undoing. The opposition knows that Australia must change. It knows of the pain caused by its unworkable and grossly unfair industrial relations system. It must also be fully aware of the plight of the 8.6 per cent of Australia's population who are unemployed. If they are not aware of it, then those in my electorate of Deakin certainly conveyed a very loud and clear message at the 2 March election. Their pain has been inflicted by 13 years of hard Labor and the refusal of the opposition to support this bill will only ensure that their pain continues. The opposition's stance on industrial relations is symptomatic of the political limbo which now confronts it. Allow me to counter just a few of the misleading accusations that the ACTU is asking its political party to make-firstly, that people will be worse off under our proposed legislation. This is an objection which simply has no grounding in fact. Employers and employees under the federal award system may opt to stay put under the protection of federal awards. A worker can opt to rely on the security of the safety net. However, it would indeed be a shame because he or she could do better. But the commission will be there to set the minima. Therefore, workers can choose to bargain, they can choose not to bargain or they can choose not to choose at all-that is, to stay with the status quo. This bill, after all, is about offering such a choice. Should the workers of a business opt to negotiate a certified agreement with their employer, the deal will only be certified by the commission if it meets the same set of minima which apply to Australian workplace agreements-a concept similar to the no disadvantage test which the opposition throws up repeatedly. Therefore, workers are offered the opportunity to roll the dice, but they are also told in the rolling of that dice that they cannot lose their minima. It is a risk free decision. It is not a gamble. Should the worker decide to opt for an Australian workplace agreement, an individual contract with the employer, again, he or she will be able to enter the negotiations confident that there is nothing to lose and much to gain. The worker may choose to avail himself or herself of union representation but is also free to refuse the intervention of the union. Once again, the key to the process is freedom to choose. I ask: what is wrong with the notion of workers being free to choose? But we know that freedom to refuse the intervention of a union does not go down well with George's and Kelty's super unions, never mind that the changes are desperately needed to guide this country into the 21st century. It is this obstinate insistence on personal power play by the union bosses, that their insistence on power is placed before the interests of the people, that I find so un-Australian and so unattractive. If we compare the 35 per cent of union employees in Australia today with the 47 per cent in 1991 and the electoral support of the blue collar workers for the coalition at the last election, it is quite clear that the people of this country have recognised what the ALP and the ACTU have failed to recognise-their representation is outdated, outlived and irrelevant. Under the coalition's industrial relations policy, freedom of association will be the name of the game. The roles of unions will be revamped and the creation of enterprise unions and autonomous enterprise branches will be facilitated. This will offer employees the option of joining or not joining a union, or joining that union which he or she feels will better defend his or her particular interests. Compulsory unionism will end and workers will be given a choice. Once again, I say: what is wrong with giving employees the choice? It is all about freedom. Underlying the concept of mandatory union involvement in the workplace is the belief that Australian workers have to be protected from themselves. We are told that if workers are given the opportunity to negotiate their conditions directly with management, they will give it all away, they will allow themselves to be underpaid and overworked. This is a paternalistic attitude, an attitude which has been prevalent in our system since federation. As the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) mentioned in his speech, this outdated, paternalistic attitude that has been prevalent in various aspects of our society has no place in the modem Australian workplace. It is demeaning, it is an insult to workers and is contrary to all notions of employee empowerment. Yet we have Labor members of this House and union officials hypocritically advocating notions of employee empowerment. For example, when the member for  Part of the accord process, part of what was happening in industrial relations over that 13 years, was based on the idea-and it was supported by the trade union movement-that workers have to be involved in decision making and that productivity could not really be improved by working with a top-down approach. A bottom-up approach will yield the best results. These notions of employee empowerment have been espoused for years and have become prevalent in Australian industrial workplace situations. I have been one of the advocates of employee empowerment in the past. But employee empowerment must go all the way to include industrial relations reforms and the notion that employees can choose, if that is their wish. I feel that unions should have more faith in the intelligence of Australian workers, rather than treating them as children needing to be protected from their own natural desires to better their standard of living. A classic example, of course, is the unions' protests at the desires of employees in such places as the Tweed Valley Fruit Processors Pty Ltd and CRA. Under the previous system unions were given a virtual monopoly over coverage of employees under the so-called 'conveniently apply' rule. This led the union hierarchy to become rigid and generally unresponsive to the real needs of workers. The super unions thrived and smaller unions were pressured to join. As a result of this bill, these union monopolies will become a thing of the past, as will the disproportionate political influence of the super unions. They will become more democratic. They will be better able to deal with the particular needs of their members and, overall, more efficient. We should not be surprised if this bill actually marks the beginning of a new golden era for an intelligent and caring union movement. Now, at the 11th hour, we find the opposition supporting the notion of dis amalgamation of unions, an issue which the bill tackles head on. The super unions have indeed become too big to serve their constituents. At the foundation of the opposition to our reforms lies the tragic tale of the disenfranchised, those Australians for whom the super unions refuse to fight-the unemployed, the 850,000 odd Australians who are without work, the 28 per cent of young Australians between the age of 15 and 19 who are unemployed. That is 93,800 young people who are starting their working lives totally in despair. These people have never been granted the benefit of the protection of either the unions or the ALP. But they are people to whom the coalition has a definite commitment, not only for tomorrow but for their future as well. This bill will impact positively on youth unemployment because the government has recognised that they are the future of Australia. Through this industrial relations bill we will allow the continuation of the junior rate which was going to be abolished under the Labor government. The abolition of the junior rate would result in over 250,000 young people losing their jobs, as estimated by retailers' sources alone. The opposition, advocating the abolition of junior rates, did not have at heart the future of young people who would lose their jobs in consequence. All they care about is making some arcane, politically correct point. Junior rates do discriminate. They discriminate in favour of young people having a job. The government's legislation, if passed by the other house, will ensure that they continue to keep their jobs. As to the impact on small business-a very prominent part of my electorate-it is evident that employers would not be penalised for creating new jobs or be threatened by malicious and frivolous claims made under the unfair dismissal laws. Workers in small business are endorsing and supporting the government's proposed changes to the industrial relations system. Another misconception about this bill which I have heard on more than one occasion is that the power of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will in some way be emasculated by the new legislation. The proponents of this view are often of the opinion that changes to the commission-no matter what changes-are the beginning of the end of the commission's role in the Australian industrial relations system. Firstly, there is nothing new in the redefinition of the role of the commission. If we examine its evolution since 1905, it is quite clear that what is now known as the AIRC has undergone change--change much greater than the modest reforms the coalition is now proposing: from the initial one-person Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration that existed until 1914 to a major structural change in the court's operation in 1920, from the 1926 amendments which enabled the government to appoint conciliation commissioners to the 1928 amendments to encourage conciliation, a change in 1947 and 1956 when two separate bodies were created, and the several major changes that occurred in the 1970s, particularly in the years 1972, 1975 and 1979. The point is that recent suggested changes are evolutionary-changes to the commission to suit the times. The AIRC will be there and will have a role to play. Rather than considering this as a revolutionary change, we see it as evolving into a new workplace environment. The AIRC will ensure that the award safety net of minimum wages and conditions is upheld. It will oversee the process of awards simplification and will encourage the making of agreements between employers and employees. It will have greater powers to stop prevent industrial action and will be able to intervene to resolve disputes where all attempts to reach an agreement have failed. There is no doubt in my mind that, while these adjustments to the role of the commission are long overdue, to construe them as an attempt to silence or abolish such an important institution in the Australian industrial relations system is simply wrong. Unfortunately, there are those in AustralIa who are determined to portray this type of progress as uncaring and unnecessary, no matter how much evidence to the contrary. We are told time after time that any change to industrial relations brought about by the coalition would always be skewed in favour of the employer. Try telling the 850,000 unemployed that the ALP is their friend and saviour and that the ALP amendments will help them get a job when, after 13 years in government, they still failed to achieve any meaningful increase in employment. I certainly hope that the Australian people see through these unjust accusations directed at the coalition and understand that our changes are symbolic of the coalition's commitments to overcome the deficiencies of the current system, deficiencies which have seen a decline in living standards and real wages, high levels of unemployment, an unacceptable level of industrial conflict and, above all, this notion strikes at the paternalistic attitude towards employees, an attitude which leads to their marginalisation in the workplace, and supporting an outdated institutional arrangement. In my electorate of Deakin in Melbourne's east businesses have greeted the content of this bill with enthusiasm. I have met with business representatives, the unemployed and the chambers of commerce and there is much enthusiasm for the principles of this bill and its objectives of creating both work and a real change in living standards. One criticism by many in my electorate is that these reforms perhaps do not go far enough-but that is another debate-and that employees are still overprotected. Legislation that will help employees to get a better deal and to be rewarded for their or enthusiasm is legislation which needs the support of both parties. I have met with people who have told me that the reforms are taking too long and that they do not have the luxury of time to wait for real change. We know where the blame lies: it lies with those who are against progress in this country.",103
166,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"At the outset, let me express my surprise and disappointment that the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Barresi) has so thoroughly debased the Deakin legacy. How ironic that, on this industrial relations legislation, a member representing the seat of Deakin would declare himself to be much more a disciple of von Hayek than the original small '1' liberal thinker in Australia. It was Deakin who helped establish the great tradition in this nation that there should be cooperation and interdependence between workers. But what the member has demonstrated is his beliefindeed, it is the conviction of the Liberal Party-that governments should see every worker as an individual instead of seeing every workplace as a cooperative enterprise. I would have thought on this matter Liberal Party members could do no better than to refer themselves to the first speech in this chamber by one of their colleagues, the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes). On 20 May she declared her hand. She declared her support for a philosophy of liberalism: ... not the atomistic liberalism expressed by whose rhetoric emphasises terms like 'individual rights', but the strand that emerged through the work of John Stuart Mill and later built on by Hobhouse. Together with their peers they recognised the interdependence of humans and the proper role of government in supporting conditions of positive interdependence. That is an outstanding definition of what small 'I' liberalism should be about in the 1990s-supporting the interdependence of workers, supporting the interdependence of citizens, not a philosophy which sees workers as atoms floating throughout the labour market; atoms which have to compete with each other, dog-eat-dog style-and a recognition that workers should be placed in an environment of collective arrangements, cooperation and interdependence. It is a sad day for the politics of this nation and the Australian parliament when the Liberal Party has so thoroughly declared its hand for von Hayek, an atomistic definition of liberalism, as the member for Kingston defined it, which sees workers as atoms moving about the labour market, instead of a positive definition of liberalism which would recognise the interdependence of workers. That leads one to conclude that government should be facilitating enterprise bargaining, not individual competition and individual employment contracts. Government should be about fostering cooperation in the workplace, not encouraging a break-out of individual employment contracts whereby each worker would have their own contract. They would be looking over each other's shoulders out of envy, out of suspicion and out of concern that someone else has a better employment contract than they have. Dog-eat-dog is a recipe for reduced productivity in the Australian workplace. Atomistic workplace relations are a recipe for reduced productivity. I say: shame on the Liberal Party for promoting that philosophy in this place. Shame on the Liberal Party for trying to bring that narrow political philosophy to the workplaces and the enterprises of this nation. Nothing exposes the shortcomings of the Liberal Party in the 1990s more comprehensi vely than this legislation. Nothing better demonstrates the ideological dogma with those which they wasted their years in opposition. At a time when political causes and governments throughout the Western world are seeking new instruments of social security, economic security and equity, this bill seeks to entrench a new source of economic insecurity and inequality in Australia. At a time when the United States Congress is debating increases to the minimum wage and greater labour market rigidity, this parliament is considering a large slab of labour market deregulation. At a time when Britain is debating the virtues of higher minimum wage rates, this bill seeks to anchor award minima in Australia-an anchor by which low skill, low productivity workers will lose any prospect of a wage increase. At a time when economists worldwide are awaken to the unique and segmented nature of the post-Fordist labour market, this legislation applies a single, homogenous set of rules to all labour market segments and locations in Australia. At a time when workplace policies and thinking require a new level of sophistication, the Liberal Party has sat still and watched the world march by-leaving it with the outdated dogma of labour market deregulation. This is a bill framed through the eyes of two suburban solicitors-the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the member for Flinders (Mr Reith). It is no less a blunder than the last time an out-of-touch tory from the electorate of Flinders introduced industrial relations reform into this parliament. This bill demonstrates the substantial differences between Labor and the coalition on competition policy. Whereas the government's first priority is to create more competition between workers in all segments of the labour market, Labor believes that this type of competition in the non-traded sector is simply a recipe for driving down real wages. It will lead to a new generation of working poor in Australia and, in its macro impact, lower spending power and lower employment, particularly in rural and regional Australia. It is a defining feature of the coalition parties that they never differentiate between segments of the labour market and their capacity to cope with more competition. Whereas the National Party will talk day and night about the differing features of product markets-they will tell us that wheat is different to sugar, is different to beef, is different to a whole range of other agricultural product markets-they never ever assume that the labour market is anything but homogenous. They never assume that the labour market in Australia is diverse-diverse skills, diverse locations and diverse enterprise arrangements. They never assume those things for a moment. Only Labor acknowledges that the impact of wage competition on shop assistants, for instance, is very different to its impact on biotechnologists. The coalition, at all levels of government, is keener to apply labour market competition to semiskilled workers who are price takers than to highly skilled professionals, like the doctors and lawyers, who are price makers. Coalition MPs talk about the labour market as if they are talking about a market for fish and chips. When you listen to the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave), the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) and their colleagues they talk about the labour market as if they are talking about the market for fish and chips. Mr Ruddock-You haven't heard me on this.",106
167,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"I have heard you long and well in the past talking about labour market deregulation. You talk about it like the market for fish and chips-purely an exercise in supply and demand and the pricing mechanism. The Australian Labor Party knows the labour market to be something different. It is about people. It is about living standards. It is about the rights of workers. It is about aspirations and economic security. For the coalition it is just another commodity to be traded according to the laws of supply and demand and the pricing mechanism. For those Liberal Party members from urban electorates, it is just another accounting exercise-a pure exercise in accountancy-where at the end of the day they add up their labour costs and all they want to do is reduce them, irrespective of the impact on workers, their families, their living standards and their economic aspirations. Mr Ruddock interjecting",108
168,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"As the member for Berowra confirms, it is nothing more than an accounting exercise for the coalition. Labor's policy sets out a different moral code and a very different sense of fairness. We believe in shielding semiskilled, low productivity workers from the worse features of globalisation while vigorously applying competition policies to the traded sector. We believe very strongly in building a sustainable floor under the labour market so that all Australian workers receive a decent living wage. This bill has been introduced under the banner of competition. This is a government which applies competition only to semiskilled workers and not to the big end of town. This is a government which believes that those who can best cope with more market competition should be shielded from it while those who can least effectively cope-the low skill, low productivity workers-now face the spectre of individual employment contracts. It will be open slather and open competition in the labour market for those who can least provide for themselves in globalised economic circumstances. The double standards and the hypocrisy of the coalition on these matters are absolutely stark and stunning. It is labour market competition for low skill, low productivity workers. But, according to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) in this week's press, it is higher tariffs for the manufacturing sector-higher tariffs to protect profits in Australia; protect profits not jobs. According to the Business Council of Australia, which love more labour market competition, they want a weakening of the merger test. They know they have a sympathetic ear in the member for Higgins (Mr Costello), who in 1991 opposed the tougher test on mergers introduced by the former Labor government. While it is open slather and open market competition in the labour market, this government have dropped the cross-ownership provisions for airports. They have also abandoned the full cost pricing on airports, a major benefit for Qantas, Ansett, AMP, BAA and Lend Lease. All those benefits shielded markets for their big business mates. But for the semiskilled, low productivihad ty workers of Australia it will be open and open labour market competition. You hear the Leader of the National Party in the Senate, Ron Boswell-he is not a minister but just their leader-saying that he does not want any competition on sugar or any competition on wheat marketing. Of course, he had a sympathetic ear in the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), who has decided to retain the single desk marketing on wheat, irrespective of the national competition policy reforms. For doctors, this is a government which is ignoring the findings of the Baume report on collusive practices by the college of surgeons. For lawyers, we have Jeff Kennett's sweetheart deal with the Victorian Bar Association. For highly skilled, professional people in Australia, such as doctors and lawyers, the coalition believes in protected, closed markets; but for semiskilled, low productivity workers throughout the country the coalition believes in open, competitive markets. What a stunning double standard. What a shameful piece of political hypocrisy. To cap it all off, question time today was the coup de grace: the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy was asked whether or not he supported the national electricity grid, and he could not provide an answer. He is part of a government in which the frontbenchers and backbenchers of the Liberal Party and the National Party have all hands on deck to sing the praises of open slather, open labour market competition. But when it comes to an open, competitive market on electricity what is their view? They have no view. There is no view from the senior minister responsible for energy. He said that it was a matter for someone else. In Queensland, of course, it is nothing than a product of parochialism, cronyism and absolute stupidity. The member for Moreton should be ashamed of the Queensland government saying that New South Wales and Victorian electricity is somehow different from Queensland electricity. I have heard a report that Borbidge asked his bureaucrats, 'Why can't we be like Tasmania, where they run the electricity line through the sea?' They  slather We're connected by land to New South Wales.' I do not know whether he was stunned by that, but this is the level of parochialism and protection they will apply to product markets. In the non-traded sector, in relation to unskilled workers, the supply of labour is much greater than the demand for labour. What happens when the supply of labour is much greater than the demand for labour? The price of labour goes down. The government want that in their accounting exercise. But they do not appreciate that the price of labour in their narrow economic view of the world is someone's income. It is someone's pay packet; they come home on a Thursday night and put that pay packet on the family table. It is the pay packet that feeds the children, that clothes the children, that educates the family and that tries to look after the family interests. While the government's narrow accounting exercise is no more than an attempt to drive down the price of labour, the Australian Labor Party appreciates that wages are the lifeblood of Australian families and households. This government has two standards. For workers it is all pain and no gain; it is all competition, all pain, all readjustment and no gain. For big business and all those highly skilled professionals, such as the doctors and the lawyers, it is all protection, no competition and all gain. That is the stunning double standard and act of hypocrisy of this coalition government. The Liberal Party in the 1990s do not mind rent seekers and they do not mind special pleaders, as long as those people are from the big end of town. The Liberal Party like a bit more of rent seeking, they like a bit of special pleading on the product markets, as long as you are from the big end of town. But, if you are an ordinary Australian worker in the suburbs of Brisbane or in the suburbs of Sydney or in any of the other major cities or provincial towns of this nation, it is open slather on labour market competition. The government do not understand the nature of economic competition. They do not appreciate that workers do not compete in the Australian economy. Do you know why workers do not compete in the Australian economy? Because enterprises do; enterprises compete in the Australian economy. They are the basis of economic gain in this nation. Workers can be effective only if they cooperate, if they collaborate, if they are willing to engage in collective arrangements, enterprise bargaining, enterprise arrangements in the workplace. That is the only way in which they can improve their productivity and the economic performance of this nation. So what is the government trying to do? They are trying to lead a break-out of individual employment contracts. Mr Hardgrave-Freedom, it is called; freedom.",108
169,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"As the member for Moreton confirms, he is a disciple of von Hayek. The member for Moreton believes fundamentally that each individual is a worker and each worker is an individual. He does not believe in the idea that workers are part of a collective arrangement in a workplace trying to improve their productivity and trying to work together. What happens when you introduce individual employment contracts? If we had individual employment contracts in this place instead of a standard rate of pay for MPs, what would be the product? The member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron) would be looking over the shoulder of the member for Fisher to see how much the member for Fisher is being paid for doing the same work in the same place. The member for Moreton would be looking over the shoulder of the member for Parramatta to see the member for Parramatta's individual employment contract. The member for Wentworth (Mr Andrew Thomson) would be trying to rip those papers out of the hands of the member for Berowra to have a look at the member for Berowra's individual employment contract. It would breed envy, dissent, division and conflict within the coalition benches. They do not have individual employment contracts. They are all on the·same rate, doing the same work in the same place. They are highly paid, reasonably skilled individualsthey did command a majority of votes in their electoral divisions, I must concede that-but their standard is different from the standard they want to apply through this legislation for semiskilled, low productivity workers in the Australian workplace. They want to breed that envy. They want to breed a dog-eat-dog environment-and they do it shamefully; they do it to their lasting shame. This is a bad, bad piece of legislation because it will bring out in workers and bosses in the Australian workplace all the worse features of greed, conflict, division and dog eat dog. Of course, it is only the Australian Labor Party that understands in this parliament that the labour market is actually far more complex than economists and Liberal Party spokespeople have recognised. We understand the dual nature of the Australian labour market. Perhaps some 30 per cent of Australian workers have got high skills-they can compete in an internationalised trading environment-but 70 per cent of the workers do not possess those skills. For them, when the supply of labour outstrips the demand for labour and they are subject to open slather competition, to individual employment contracts, there is only one thing that can happen to their wages and conditions: they go down, according to the pricing mechanism on labour that these people opposite endorse. And those workers of course need collective representation and collective bargaining strength to advance their interests. The strength of unions in this nation is directly correlated with wages equality. I refer members opposite to no less a source than the Economic Record of March 1996, which contained an outstanding article by two academics from the University of Melbourne. It says: Changes in wage-setting institutions or in the role of unions in wage-setting may also affect earnings inequality. As one effect of trade unions is to reduce earnings dispersion within the group of employees who are union members, a decrease in union density could affect earnings dispersion. Borland finds that a decline in union density can explain approximately 30 per cent of the increase in variance of earnings of full-time male employees in Australia between 1986 and 1994, and 15 per cent of the increase in the variance of full-time female employees over the same period. What is the research of these Melbourne academics telling the House of Representatives? They are saying that collective representation in the workplace is fundamental to a more equal society. They have found that the decline in union density can explain up to 30 per cent of the increase in wage inequality. This is a government that wants to run unions into the ground; this is a government that wants to run unions out of the workplaces of Australia. They do that for one purpose, a purpose verified by the statistical data from the University of Melbourne, and that is to increase wage inequality. For semi-skilled, low productivity workers, the only route to a wage increase is collective bargaining strength in the workplace and the sorts of reforms that the former government introduced through the accord process. That is their only route to a pay increase. If you leave them to the cold winds and wolves of market competition where, in their segment of the labour market, the supply is greater than the demand, the price of labour drops. And as it drops, wages go down and families have a reduced standard of living. Contrary to all the academic evidence and all the research and international debate, this government has the worse sort of industrial relations reform before the House. It is an absolute disgrace.

170,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,"In the few minutes available to me, I would like to pass a couple of comments about the address just given to the House by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). I listened to him carefully, as I always do, and I must say that I was nauseated by his sanctimonious approach to this particular subject. Of course, one would imagine, in view of the great passion with which he spoke in the House tonight, that he might indeed have had some experience of working in the true work force. But when one looks at the Parliamentary Handbook one can see that the honourable member for Werriwa has not had a real job in his entire life. He worked for Gough Whitlam, and we know what a disaster that Labor Party government was for this nation when Gough earnings of Whitlam was elected in the 1970s. Mr Latham interjecting",111
171,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,"So you must take part responsibility for the disaster that befell Australia when Gough Whitlam was Prime Minister. You worked for the Labor Party and obviously you must take some responsibility for the policies which this party imposed on this country over the last 13 years. Of course, we have a very high rate of unemployment, we have a high foreign debt and we have an enormous gap between rich and poor. The Labor Party, if you have forgotten, was rejected overwhelmingly at the last election because you and your party have been a complete failure. Further down the CV of this person who now claims to be an effective member of the opposition front-bench, one can see that he worked also for the Premier of New South Wales, and we know what a disaster the New South Wales Labor Party government has been. This guy has never had a real job; he has never been a real worker; he has never produced anything towards the economic benefit of this country. Of course, he worked for a little while as the mayor of a council in western Sydney, but he has not been in the true work force. This person comes out here as the champion of the underprivileged and masquerades as a champion of the workers, but he has not had a real job. The sanctimonious words that he berated us with for 20 minutes must be written off as being entirely irrelevant. Mr Hardgrave-A joke.",111
172,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,"It is a joke. This legislation is all about higher wages for higher productivity. It is not about exploitation. It is about giving people freedom of choice. It is about allowing workers to talk to their employers. It is about agreement in the workplace, subject to minima which will ensure that people are not disadvantaged. It's all about free choice; it's all about freeing up the labour market; it's all about a fair go for all concerned. The Labor Party government had been in office for 13 years. We have almost one million people out of work. We have perhaps two million people unable to find sufficient work, and that government was comprehensively rejected on 2 March. Mr Latham interjecting",111
173,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,"It's all a bit much to crawl into this place, never having had a real job in your entire life, and claim that you have all of the answers and that there is something wrong with what we are seeking to achieve. The simple fact of the matter is that you have been a disaster; you have failed. The legislation introduced to this place by the minister at the table, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith), is legislation which will get the economy going. It will create employment; it will give new opportunity; and our country will be a whole lot better off. Debate interrupted. NA",112
174,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! It being 5.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. W oolcott, Mr Richard",112
175,Mr ANDREW THOMSON,Unknown,"WentworthParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) (5.30 p.m.)- Mr Speaker, with your indulgence, I seek to correct something in Hansard. On Tuesday this week in the debate on the MPI, I inadvertently gave the House the impression that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) shared my surprise to le(l.m that Mr Richard Woolcott was acting as a consultant to the company Transfield. I have since learned from the minister that this is not the case, it is inaccurate and that he was aware of Mr Woolcott's business links with Transfield. I think in these circumstances I may have given the impression that the minister shared my view that Mr Woolcott's integrity was in question on this matter. I want to make it plain and put it on the public record that he does not. Further, in view of my learning this fact, my own reflection on Mr Woolcott's integrity should be withdrawn. Given that I was alone in my ignorance of Mr Woolcott's financial interests in this policy debate, I the better view is that he could have been more vigorous in making those facts known to me in his letter. However, I do not believe that he acted in a deceptive fashion in any way. I want to make it clear that, as soon as I learned that, I telephoned him and made that apology plain to him. Higher Education",112
176,Ms ELLIS,Unknown,"I rise tonight to express the concerns of thousands of students in my electorate and others around the country about the future of higher education in Australia, concerns that resulted in the National Tertiary Education Union and the National Union of Students organising a national week of action against the government last month. Why is such drastic action being taken by staff and students? Simply because this coalition government is shamelessly breaking election commitments. Before the election the coalition promised to 'at least maintain the level of Commonwealth funding to universities both in terms of operating grants and research grants'. What has happened to that promise? Like an increasingly large number of coalition pre-election commitments, it seems to have gone right out the window. We now know that the funding cuts to universities in the budget could be as high as 12 per cent. Such cuts would have a devastating effect on access to higher education and result in significant job loss. The National Tertiary Education Union has estimated that, to fund a 12 per cent cut, would mean either 48,000 students missing out on a university place, or 19,000 jobs going, or HECS increasing by 120 per cent to $5,700. While it is clear that regional universities right across Australia will be hit hardest by these funding cuts, I wish to draw to the House's attention the impacts on the two main universities in the ACT: the Australian National University and the University of Canberra. A 12 per cent cut would mean a loss of $32 million in funding to the ANU. This is equivalent to the funding of three of the six faculties at the university. So in order to meet the coalition's savings, half the faculties would have to be abolished. Alternatively, the think ANU could savagely cut back its intake of first-year students and abolish only one of the six faculties. Or it could maintain existing student numbers but reduce the quality of teaching by abolishing tutorials and reducing the number of units offered in each faculty. There is no doubt that these cuts will primarily impact on the learning opportunities of undergraduate students, because it is extremely unlikely that the ANU would look in the first instance to find savings in its world renowned research schools. The University of Canberra, with an underand graduate population of around limited income base, also looks set to be severely hit. Students at the University of Canberra will be faced with a reduction in the number of units offered within each faculty. If these cuts go ahead, it is inevitable that range of degrees available will also be drastiabout cally reduced. These cuts will also have broader effects in the community through reductions in export earnings and employment opportunities. Australia's universities contribute positively to our balance of trade. The fees and personal expenditure of the 50,000 international stusuch dents who study at Australian universities generate over $1.3 billion a year in higher education exports. In terms of export income, this is comparable to sales of wheat at $1.5 billion or iron and steel at $1.4 billion. According to Professor John Niland, the ViceChancellor of the University of New South Wales: A 10 per cent cut in funding translated through to student places would reduce exports by over $130 million. He goes on to state: An initial fall in exports of $130 million will translate into a reduction of national income of about $260 million. That corresponds to some 11,000 jobs and a loss of government tax revenue of around $55 million. Cuts of this nature will undoubtedly have an effect on employment in the regions, particularly in south-eastern New South Wales, of which Canberra is the major regional centre. The ANU is the third biggest employer in Canberra behind the Commonwealth government and the ACT government. If it is forced to introduce a recruitment freeze and sack existing employees, the employment situation in the ACT will take another serious tum for the worse. The University of Canberra has already instituted a recruitment freeze and looks certain to begin reducing staff levels. I invite every member in this place to stop and think carefully about what the effects would be if the three largest employers in their electorate were to stop recruiting and begin shedding staff. I also ask them to think of the thousands of students who do not have the capacity to pay their way into university who will miss out on their education if 6,000 and a these cuts go ahead. Parliament House: Art",112
177,Mr ROSS CAMERON,Unknown,"I rise tonight to raise some concerns the content of the Parliament House art collection and some wider matters of democratic principle. Members will be familiar with the fable of the emperor's new clothes; a story about a very proud and conceited emperor who was persuaded by a passing charlatan to wear a suit made of a fabric of lightness, of such elegance of design, of such innovation that it was fit only for the emperor. The emperor's blinding vanity was such that he ordered that he be paraded through the city wearing the suit, much to the pleasure and mirth of his sycophantic subjects, who continued to pour forth praise for the emperor until a young boy on the side of the road looked up with some shock and exclaimed, 'The emperor is naked.' I regret that the fable provides a fitting background to the work of Senator Michael Beahan in his capacity as Chairman of the Parliamentary Art Advisory Committee. The President has largely directed the acquisitions policy of the parliament in recent years. This week the President launched an exhibition of recent acquisitions entitled 'Imagining the Real'. There are works of some obvious ability and interest in the exhibition, but I note the President's comments in opening the exhibition that many of those viewing the works were concerned the works had been hung upside down. The President suggested this was actually a virtue because it required observers 'to get closer to the works'. I suggest that the President's comments and general approach in this area would eminently qualify him for a place among the emperor's court of advisers. My immediate interest arises out of my experience this week in viewing the contents of the collection preparatory to receiving my allocation of three works. Ms Robyn Barker provided a photo-slide tour of the collection. I have to say that Ms Barker is the picture of courtesy and efficiency. In order to save time, she asked me what particular genre I was interested in. I explained that I preferred something uplifting, ideally something that evidenced skills in drafting, good use of colour and light-something perhaps that was evocative of the beauty of the Australian landscape or of my electorate of Parramatta. I could see by the look on Ms Barker's face that my prospects were not good. She kindly and gently explained to this philistine from Parramatta that the parliament's collection was primarily a 'modernist' collection. This word 'modem' is an interesting one. It was the subject of specific consideration by Mr Giles Auty, art critic for The Spectator, in his lecture to the New South Wales Gallery of Art in 1994 entitled, 'The Meaning of Modem'. Mr Auty spoke of modem art as being about attitude rather than quality. He spoke of the 'great divorce' which now exists between the intelligent public and the art they find displayed inmost of our public institutions. He suggested that 'we have created a machine which is totally out of control and which is responsible to nobody'. Mr Auty was not criticising modem art per se but arguing against the systematic discrimination against anything vaguely traditional. The theme was taken up by Mr Terence Maloon, curator, art critic and educator, in an article for Look magazine: To put the problem into a manageable perspective, we must surely agree that the vast majority of contemporary art is simply beneath consideration. It is bad, it is kitsch, it is irrelevant. .. To make matters even more exasperating, the weirder fringes of contemporary art appear to have the sanction of officialdom which have taken up the role of promoting and legitimising particular tendencies, championing a few artists while seeming to ignore alternatives. Ms Barker explained that all the works with anything approaching - he character I described had been snapped up by the ministers and members of greater seniority than me, a humble backbencher. Mr Speaker, I feel some sympathy for my colleague the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit). I suspect that by the time his tum comes he will be offered a piece of ornamental driftwood and some household refuse. My concerns, I know, are shared by other members. I would like to conclude by reading some extracts from a letter to the President from Dr Bob Woods, who says: I have just sat through a viewing of some 400 so called works of art that was organised by the Parliament House art collection. I would have thought that a balanced collection was crucial for the national Parliament. Instead, we have a collection almost entirely weighted towards the avantgarde. I think it accurate to say that there was not a single landscape painting and not one I would have been prepared to hang on my walls. The young artist of Parramatta whose magnificent exhibition I recently opened would have no chance whatever of getting a painting hung in this gallery because it would not conform to the strict, elitist and completely arbitrary criteria of those selecting the artworks of this parliament. Mr Speaker, I ask you, like the boy on the side of the road, to ensure that the emperor gets some new clothes. (Time expired) Education: Western Sydney",113
178,Mr MOSSFIELD,Unknown,"I rise in this adjournment debate to express the concern of the people of Greenway about the proposed cuts in education being projected by this government. I said in my maiden speech that one of the strengths of my electorate was its education system, with some 11 high schools in the region plus a TAFE college and campus of the University of Western Sydney at Nirimba. These education facilities are particularly important due to the high youth population of the electorate. The University of Western Sydney was established in response to strong community demand for equity and access to higher education. It should also be remembered that without the support of Gough Whitlam this would never have come to pass. With the lack of support from the member for Bennelong, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), perhaps it may close. Many of the young people from our region are the first from their families to gain a degree. I am extremely disturbed to have been advised that one vice-chancellor-not from the University of Western Sydney-has suggested that scholarships be made available to the top 25 per cent of students now on Austudy. This compares with 75 per cent that made use of such avenues in the 1970s. In an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 8 June this year, Adele Horin very succinctly put the case, and I quote: Poorer students would have to be very bright to to university while the mediocre middleclass could buy their way in. She went on to say: Fees are so blatantly inequitable it is hard to believe their spectre has risen from the grave to haunt us again. Despite some progress in education opportunities in western Sydney over the past 10 years, which I will refer to shortly, the region is still inadequately served with higher education opportunities. Western Sydney has 40 per cent of Sydney's population and, while the rest of Sydney has 32 university places for every 1,000, the west at this stage can offer only eight places per 1,000. In 1989, the University of Western Sydney had 11,964 students and in 1995 this enrolment had increased to 22,803. Most importantly, the University of Western Sydney has been a major catalyst in lifting morale and the status of young people attending school in the region. Some 25,000 students have graduated from the University of Western Sydney over the past six years and some 50 per cent of these students have found work in the region. The proposed five to 12 per cent cut in funding for universities being suggested by the minister, either directly or by well-directed leaks, has revived the push for the reintroduction of fees for undergraduate courses. The New South Wales Minister for Education is extremely concerned about the alleged 12 per cent cuts proposal, and as a western Sydney MP so he should be. He said recently: If a 12 per cent funding cut was applied to student places, the minimum T.E.R to enter university would probably rise from 50 to 58, making it harder for students to be able to enter university. Cuts of that magnitude, equivalent for up to $158 million or 22,700 students, would have a devastating impact on higher education, and would be particularly crippling to the University of Western Sydney. I referred earlier to an article by Adele Horin and I again quote part of her excellent essay. She said: Graduates pay when their incomes approach average weekly earnings. The prospect of paying back HECS has not deterred youngsters from starting university in the way that fees would. Why go anyone would resurrect fees when we have this perfectly good version of user-pays is hard to imagine. One of our prominent local newspapers, the Guardian, recently reported Professor Deryck Schreuder, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Western Sydney, as saying: It will be tragic if funding cuts force us to turn away school leavers because we no longer have either the resources or the capacity to give them the quality education they deserve. Our slogan, 'No education! No jobs! What future the West!' says it all. We are the powerhouse of the West. Cuts to university funding and the introduction of university fees would clearly jeopardise the progress that has been made in expanding the opportunities for university education for young people in western Sydney. The people of the west will not easily forgive or forget the coalition for its appalling treatment of them-and why should they? The coalition will deserve every loss of seat it gets at every by-election and in the next federal election. They simply cannot be trusted. We said it-and they have proved it terrifyingly correct. Peat Island Centre",114
179,Mr LLOYD,Unknown,"I rise in this place this evening to place on record my deep commitment to and concern for the residents of Peat Island Centre, a facility for intellectually disabled people, which is situated on the banks of the Hawkesbury River in my electorate of Robertson. Ever since the Richmond report was brought down in March 1983, the debate has raged as to the best form of accommodation for these people. It was the Richmond report that began my involvement in politics. That is one reason why I have a special interest in it. In this report, Peat Island was described as an extremely isolated facility largely consisting of old barrack style buildings reflecting its original purpose as an isolation facility. The Richmond report goes on to say: Fortunately due to progressive management the hospital is well advanced in the process of placing clients in a planned way in the community. The report continues: Therefore, the opportunity exists to close Peat Island down by 1984. Twelve years later there are still 133 residents living at Peat Island and the debate is still raging as to the residents' future. It has only been the concerted efforts of the staff and the residents' relatives that have seen Peat Island saved from closure. Yes, Mr Speaker, the buildings may be old and yes, the accommodation may not be as good as we would wish; but Peat Island and its residents are unique. Peat Island has been used as a mental institution-as they were then known-since 190 1 and most of the residents have been living in this centre for a long time, in many cases for 20 years or more. It is their home; they are happy there. They have their friends and, most importantly, they are accepted by the community that surrounds Peat Island. I know this because I am part of this community. The residents of Peat Island are my friends and I am proud to say that I know the majority of these residents by name. They need consistency in their lives and they do not very easily accept or understand change. Obviously, it would be desirable to assimilate as many of these residents within society as possible. This can be done in a successful and caring way but, unfortunately, so many horror stories are told of people with psychiatric disabilities being sent out into an uncaring society and ending up in squalid boarding house accommodation at the mercy of unscrupulous landlords. It was with much interest and sadness that I listened to the member for Calare (Mr Andren) last evening in this place relate a letter from a constituent whose sister had suffered the very same problems after being set free from an institution, following the Richmond report. The recommendations of the Richmond report to deinstitutionalise those who suffer from severe psychiatric problems could only work with a massive injection of funds to ensure suitably staffed community cottages are readily available. Sadly, this has not been the case. On 15 June 1996, I was criticised by the Hon. Ron Dyer, the New South Wales Minister for Community Services, on ABC radio. He was responding to my claim that there was a serious shortage of nursing staff at Peat Island. I have in my possession a copy of a Peat Island staff newsletter in which, under the heading 'Staff Shortages', the first line reads: There is currently a critical shortage of nursing staff at Peat Island. This newsletter then goes on to detail the drastic measures which have been implemented in a desperate attempt to provide basic nursing coverage. If, in fact, there have been only a few resignations, transfers and applications for leave over the past 12 months, as the Hon. Ron Dyer implied, why is there such a critical shortage of nursing staff at the Peat Island Centre at present? Rather than waging a campaign to close Peat Island, the minister should be ensuring that the residents of Peat Island are receiving adequate care. He is wasting time and effort criticising those who genuinely care for these people. Parliamentary Standards",115
180,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,Unknown,"I wish to continue what I was saying earlier this afternoon with reference to question time. I want to be very clear, Mr Speaker, that I am not wishing or intending to make any inference on you but I am simply trying to give some background as to why I have been concerned in the recent weeks of this session of parliament about the question of parliamentary behaviour and standards, particularly by ministers answering questions. You may not have heard my remarks, so I will repeat part of them for your benefit so you will have the context. I have spent some 13 years in this place. I have sat through well over 1,000 question times. I have never been chastised for interjecting, nor have I been brought to order. I do not think I have ever been warned, either. In the last year and a half I have watched-as have others-the question of parliamentary behaviour becoming a major political issue. The question of the speakership then became an election issue. The desirability of there being an independent speaker was placed on the election agenda. Like many others in this chamber, I was encouraged by the fact that we would see some changes to the system we had inherited. I was therefore quite concerned when, early in the process, the issue of anticipation arose. Mr Speaker, I asked you some constructive and quite conscious questions about it. As time has gone on, I have watched with increasing concern the standard of behaviour of members and listened to responses to questions, points of order and your rulings. We had a spectacle earlier in the week involving the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). His behaviour may have been well suited to a British public school, but it certainly was not suitable here. If the behaviour and sense of humour he displays in here is being used in international fora on behalf of Australia, I am deeply disturbed by that fact. On three occasions at the dispatch box, his behaviour was not just personal, foolish and childish but way over the top and out of control. In the previous government, I well recall the honourable member for Mayo being someone who constantly raised points of order and questioned the relevance and precision of ministers' answers. I find it quite galling to watch him act in the way that he recently has. We were promised by those in government that they would change the system. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) was also quite prominent in questioning ministers and Mr Speaker in the previous government about the process of question time. I am going to ask you, Mr Speaker, to have your staff read copies of the Hansard from the last session of parliament and this session of parliament, when it is finished. They should look at how many points of order have been taken per question, not just per question time, because it is an hour and a half long; question time has almost doubled in length. They should also look how many people have made them. What has happened in this session has been absolutely minor, yet I was accused earlier in the week of making a frivolous point of order. I took exception to that, because I am not frivolous. If I take a point of order, let me assure you that there is something to it. I do not do it lightly. I am very aware of the forms. I am also very aware that, if I do not take a point of order, it does not help you, Mr Speaker. If we do not take points of order and draw your attention to misbehaviour and ministers straying from their responsibilities, no-one will. It is quite obvious that they have no intention of doing so. Read the day-by-day responses of ministers. One minister twice in two days chose not to answer questions, and virtually said so. When answering a question today, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) said 'my next point is', not 'my response to the question is'. There was no attempt whatsoever by him to answer the question. We have seen within a matter of weeks a shift from these new high standards to an absolute dereliction of them. Unless we take points of order and raise questions, you, Mr Speaker, cannot do your job. The onus upon you becomes too great. (Time expired) EP Robinson: Industrial Dispute",116
181,Mr MCARTHUR,Unknown,"I wish to draw the attention of the House to a report in the Geelong Advertiser of 18 June headed 'Robinson chief's car torched'. It is alleged that those involved in union activity torched the car of a principal of a wool scouring firm in Geelong. The background to this dispute is clearly one of union demarcation. At a time when the coalition has just introduced its new industrial relations package to this parliament, it is very interesting to see what is actually going on in the workplace. What we are seeing in Geelong is a 17week secondary boycott of a well-known, very efficient wool scouring mill. We have a dispute between two unions; one is the AWU and the other is the Shearers and Rural Workers Union run by Mr Steven Roach. The shadow minister at the table, the honourable member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan), might even know Mr Roach, because he is not too well liked by colleagues in the Labor Party. The AWU was the union covering this plant. Because Mr Stephen Roach wanted to get some members into his union, he brought about a dispute in the plant. After that situation arose, there was a secondary boycott. We have had picketers on this plant for 17 weeks. The shadow minister at the table would understand the impact of that. Workers have been unable to come or go. As a result, half the work force has been sacked because it went on strike. The other half has been picketing. Police have been providing protection at shift changes so that this company can continue to operate. This situation exists under the current industrial relations arrangements in Australia. A rogue union seeking members has brought about a secondary boycott. Transport operators are afraid and unable to bring wool to the plant. I spoke to one personally. He said that he cannot go there or send his drivers to that plant because they throw stones at the truck and abuse the driver. He is no longer able to deliver wool to the plant. The plant is running at half production in fairly difficult financial times because of two unions having an internal dispute about the way in which they should represent the workers. The secondary boycott will now no longer operate. Those who wish to supply the firm with wool ready for scouring are unable to. The company is working at half production. In terms of the final result, Mr Robinson's car has actually been torched. The article in the paper states of Mr Robinson: However, he said that such actions were not surprising bearing in mind the ongoing guerilla attacks he alleged were being waged against the company by its employees. He goes on to say later in the article: ""This is Australia and I believe our people a right to work, but we can't defend ourselves against illegal and irresponsible activities ... This is the key point: Picketers say they are being financially supported and their bills being paid by funds coming from other unions collected at sites in Geelong and Melbourne. So-called responsible unions are helping their mates keep other workers out of a job and force a very reputable wool scouring company to get into very serious financial difficulties because they have some internal problems. This is the position here in Australia. It has been brought about by attitudes generated by 100 years of industrial relations. It is a 'them and us' situation, where the unions have undue power. (Time expired) House adjourned at 6.00 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Mr Beazley to move: That this House: (1) notes that when the Department of Finance cos ted the Coalition's election commitments, as published in Meeting our commitments, a total shortfall of some $4 billion over three years was identified; (2) notes that the Department of Finance analysis showed that there were clear and explicit costing errors totalling $1.2 billion over three years; (3) notes that a shortfall of some $1.4 billion was identified in Coalition commitments which totalled $3.3 billion, but which were so lacking in detail that policy experts in the Department of Finance were unable to supply accurate costings; (4) notes that further shortfalls totalling $1.3 billion were identified in commitments relating to the abolition of the Better Cities Program, the Development Import Finance Facilitation (DIFF) Scheme and the Better Practice Program, as well as redundancy costs associated with public service staff reductions; (5) calls on the Government to release to the House and the people of Australia a full costing of the Coalition's election commitments; and have (6) calls on the Government to assure the House that the plan to cut the Commonwealth Budget by $8 billion is not being pursued to finance the $4 billion black hole in the Coalition's election promises.

For those athletes, the opportunity to athletes brings a small recompense for the years have the stature or earning potential of, say, how his earning potential would be affected an Olympic gold medallist. As a result of the involvement of the Australian the legislation, I am confident that the rights Under the legislation, athletes will be able or achievements, subject to any other agreements who is a member of the Atlanta Olympic Games herself as an Olympian or an Olympic athlete a gold medal, as an Olympic gold medallist.

(4) What assistance does the Commonwealth provide to Diabetes Australia.",166
220,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The 1989 National Health Survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) estimated the prevalence of diabetes in all ages to be 1.5%'. A more recent ABS survey of Australians aged 18 years and over, indicated the prevalence of diabetes at 3.8% for all adults2. The majority (90%) NA of Australians with diabetes suffer from non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM or Type 2 diabetes). Diabetes is likely to affect 900,000 Australians by 2000 and 1.5 million Australians by 20103 (2) Nationally, the health care and other costs associated with diabetes were estimated to be $ I 26.13 million in 1989-90. When the additional estimated costs of diabetes-related complications are taken into account, this figure almost doubles to $247.88 miIIion4 - These figures include public and private health care costs, such as hospital, general practitioners, medical specialists, pharmaceuticals and other supplies, and allied health care such as podiatry and dietetics, as well as indirect costs, such as foregone income, time off work and costs to carers. (3) Although the Commonwealth does not provide direct funding to the States and Territories to combat diabetes, it funds a number of activities aimed at preventing the onset of diabetes and reducing the impact of complications. This includes: Commonwealth Government subsidies in respect of insulin, testing strips and syringes which currently represent an average Government outlay in Diabetes excess of $900 per annum for each person with diabetes who uses insulin; Funding through Medicare for specialist and general practitioner services; Approximately $5.25 million provided through the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) for 77 researcher-initiated research projects into diabetes and related issues in 1996; Approximately $1.5 million for twenty projects funded through the Divisions of General Practice since May 1995. The projects aim to improve the management of diabetes through a range of activities including upskilling general practitioners, dietary clinics, access to shared care, and health promotion and education; Three rural health projects relating to diabetes have received funding of approximately $458,000 to provide diabetes management and education training for health care professionals and health workers in rural areas. The Government has developed a comprehensive and strategic National Diabetes Action Plan as outlined in our policy document ""Health Throughout Life"". Implementation will take considerable coordinated effort. (4) The Commonwealth has provided assistance to Diabetes Australia through a grant of $44,726 through the Community Organisations' Support Program (COSP) to the Australian Diabetes Society (the scientific and medical division of Diabetes Australia) to develop a Resource Manual on Diabetes Programs for people of non-English speaking backgrounds. The Commonwealth also provides funding to Diabetes Australia to administer the National Diabetic Services Scheme (NDSS). This scheme provides subsidised blood and urine glucose testing strips and syringes for use by registered persons with diabetes. $22.5 million was provided in 199495. l. Nutbeam D, Thomas M & Wise M.

221,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)(a) Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of death from cancer among Australian men, after lung cancer. In 1994, 2,590 Australian men died of prostate cancer and it is estimated that there were 2,810 deaths in 1995. (b) The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's report Cancer in Australia 1989-1990 (with projections to 1995), which was released in April 1996, estimates the lifetime risk of developing prostate cancer as I in 18. (c) The reported incidence of prostate cancer is rising. In 1990, the latest year for which national figures are available, 5,753 new cases of prostate cancer were reported. Where data are available for individual States, the reported incidence of prostate cancer has doubled over the last five years. The increase in reported incidence of prostate cancer is thought to be largely due to developments in prostate cancer detection methods in recent years, such as the Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test. (2) In April 1995, the Australian Health Technology Advisory Committee (AHTAC) was requested by the then Minister for Human Services and Health to review the evidence on the benefits, risks and costs of prostate cancer screening.

However, in order to produce a comprehensive review taking into account the latest available data, AHTAC required more time to complete its report. In producing its report, AHTAC has undertaken a comprehensive review of the scientific literature, current practice and the positions of medical professional bodies on prostate cancer screening; consulted widely inviting public submissions through the national press and by approaching interested organisations and individuals; examined social aspects and community attitudes; and incorporated the most recent available data on prostate cancer incidence and mortality in Australia.

223,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Under the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995 (the Act), insurers are not permitted to pay to their clients any amount of compensation that has been arrived at either by way of agreement between the parties or following a judgement of a court, until the Commonwealth has been refunded the Medicare and/or nursing home benefits that have been paid as a result of the compensation claim. (2) Notwithstanding the above, the insurer may be required to pay interest to the claimant where the time limits set by a court are exceeded. (3) The Act specifically excludes the Commonwealth from any liability for interest in circumstances where there is a delay in compensation payments being made. The reason being that the Act has been constructed in such a way that insurers can notify the Health Insurance Commission as soon as a claim has been made and can obtain a Notice of Charge before the case is finalised. Where a Notice of Charge is obtained before a judgment or settlement there need be no delay in the payment of compensation monies. (4) However, there have been delays, particularly in New South Wales, in the issuance of the final notices by the Health Insurance Commission, following the introduction of the scheme. This final notice (the Notice of Charge) is the clearance required by the insurer in order to be able to pay out to the claimant the balance of the compensation monies. (5) The Health Insurance Commission advises that the average time taken to issue a Notice of Charge varies from two weeks in Tasmania and Queensland to eight weeks in New South Wales. The HIC has a maximum of three months within which to issue the Notice of Charge following receipt by it of a Notice of Judgment or Settlement. (6) The principal reason for the Health Insurance Commission's current inability to produce the Notice of Charge at much shorter time frames than those mentioned above is the much larger than anticipated volume of claims which were finalised soon after the commencement of the Act (1 February 1996) which the Health Insurance Commission has had to process. (7) To reduce its processing time, the Health Insurance Commission is putting staff on overtime and engaging additional (temporary) staff. (8) On 21 May 1996, I met with the New South Wales Bar Association, the Insurance Council of Australia and the Law Society of New South Wales to discuss the delays. We have reached broad agreement as to how this can be corrected, with all parties acknowledging it is going to require legislatime tion. (9) To that end, the Government is intending to introduce a Bill into Parliament later in the Winter sittings. We expect the level of cooperation that been displayed by the lawyers and insurers so far in working towards a solution will mean that the Government can overcome the problems with the current Act to everyone's satisfaction. What to do when someone dies. A guide to Social Security (Question No. 215) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 21 May 1996: Are there any publications available to a surviving partner after the death of a spouse which assists him or her to answer questions about legal and other obligations and informs him or her of the assistance available at the time of bereavement; if not, will the Government produce such a publication. Mrs Moylan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department of Social Security (with assistance from the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs) produced a publication: 'What to do when someone dies. A guide to Social Security and other help available to recently bereaved people.' The booklet is a broad guide to Social Security and other help available to recently bereaved people and includes information on what to do and who should be notified. A copy of the booklet has been provided to the honourable member. Medicare Offices: Staff Numbers (Question No. 268)  Family Services, upon notice, on 23 May 1996: (1) Do the number of staff at and size of each Medicare office vary according to demand. (2) What is the (a) size, (b) number of staff and (c) annual client load of the smallest Medicare office. (3) How many offices similar to that referred to in part (2) exist and where is each located. (4) What are the annual client loads of the Medicare offices at (a) Blacktown, (b) Mt Druitt and (c) Penrith, NSW.",169
224,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The minimum staffing requirement for the establishment of a Medicare office is 2.5 full equivalent staff. The number of cash claims processed in a customer service centre determines the number of staff. (2) Gawler, located in South Australia, has the has lowest cash claiming volume. There are three full time equivalent staff and the annual claims amount to 11,805. (3) 10 New South Wales; 1 Queensland; 8 South Australia; 1 Victoria. (4) (a) Blacktown-annual claims 86,173 (b) Mt Druitt-annual claims 43,940 (c) Penrith-annual claims 96,963 Pulmozyme Medication (Question No. 314)  Family Services, upon notice, on 30 May 1996: (I) Has his attention been drawn to the difficulty some sufferers of the genetic disorder cystic fibrosis are experiencing in attaining Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme eligibility for the medication Pulmozyme. (2) Is eligibility based on a requirement of cent improvement within one month; if so, will the Government alter the requirement.",170
225,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) My attention has not been drawn to the difficulties cystic fibrosis sufferers have been experiencing in gaining access to the drug Pulmozyme under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Pulmozyme is available as a pharmaceutical benefit in accordance with guidelines developed by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee following discussions with the Australian Cystic Fibrosis Associations Federation and specialists in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. The drug is supplied from the out-patient departments of public hospitals after patients have been assessed at (or in association with) cystic fibrosis clinics. PBS subsidy commenced from 1 January this year. I am not aware of complaints from the Federation or physicians that the current guidelines are no longer appropriate. (2) Yes. For PBS subsidy the patient needs to demonstrate a 10% improvement in lung function (FEVI-forced expiratory volume in one second) after an initial trial of up to four weeks treatment at the recommended dose. This is because the clinical effectiveness of the drug is marginal and the cost high. The clinical evidence shows that the drug is most beneficial (and most cost effective) in the group of patients who achieve a response to initial treatment of at least 10% improvement in FEVl. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee recommendation was based on clinical evidence submitted by the sponsor and a subsequent meeting with the Cystic Fibrosis Association and respiratory physicians. It is unlikely that this requirement will change unless further clinical evidence is provided to show that the drug is similarly effective in other patient categories. Workers' Compensation Claims: Delays (Question No. 315) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 30 May 1996: Are major delays occurring in the settlement of workers' compensation claims following the passage of health legislation in 1995; if so, (a) why and (b) what is he doing to minimise the delays.",171
226,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) There have been complaints from both insurers and claimants of delays, particularly in New South Wales, in the issuance of Notices of 10 per Charge in respect of all types of compensation claims under the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995 (the Act). A Notice of Charge specifies the amount of Medicare and/or nursing home care benefits refundable to the Commonwealth by the claimant out of the claimant's compensation monies. The amount on the Notice of Charge must be paid before they are able to pay out to the claimant the balance of the compensation monies. (2) The Health Insurance Commission advises that the average time taken to issue a Notice of Charge varies from two weeks in Tasmania and Queensland to eight weeks in New South Wales. The Health Insurance Commission has a maximum of three months within which to issue the Notice of Charge following receipt by it of a Notice of Judgment or Settlement. (3) The principal reason for the Health Insurance Commission's current inability to produce the Notice of Charge at much shorter time frames than those mentioned above is the much larger than anticipated volume of claims which were finalised soon after the commencement of the Act (1 February 1996) which the Health Insurance Commission has had to process. (4) To reduce its processing time, the Health Insurance Commission is putting staff on overtime and engaging additional (temporary) staff. (5) On 21 May 1996, I met with the New South Wales Bar Association, the Insurance Council of Australia and the Law Society of New South Wales to discuss the delays. We have reached broad agreement as to how this can be corrected, with all parties acknowledging it is going to require legislation. (6) To that end, the Government is intending to introduce a Bill into Parliament later in the Winter sittings. We expect the level of cooperation that has been displayed by the lawyers and insurers so far in working towards a solution will mean that the Government can overcome the problems with the current Act to everyone's satisfaction.",171
