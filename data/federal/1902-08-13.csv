1,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,Unknown,Las t week the conference of - colonial Premiers in London had under consideration the question of' reducing the cost of sending newspapers from Australia to Europe- a matter in which the public are muoh concerned-and I now wish to ask the Acting Prime Minister what attitude the Government are likely to take up in regard to the subject ?,14
2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The information which I have received shows that the resolution arrived at was general in its purport. It left to each Government the task of considering in what way, and to what extent, it ' could make a reduction in the postage upon newspapers. . It will be for the. Postmaster-General to consider the matter, and to present proposals to the. Cabinet, .the members of which arc, I am sure, prepared to give tbem the most favourable consider a tion. PEARL - FISHERI ES COMMISSION .",14
3,Mr R EDWARDS,Unknown,Can the Acting Prime Minister say when Jndge Dashwood's report on the pearl-fishing industry will be available? The people interested in that'industry are naturally anxious to know what the commissioner's recommendations are.,14
4,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"A proof of the report was to have been sent to me from the Government Printing-office this morning, but it has not yet reached me. I ' expect, however, to receive it today, and so soon as it is corrected the document will be laid upon the table. NA INSTRUCTORS.",14
5,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"Bearin g on a matter to which I referred last week, I would like to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether his attention has been directed to a statement made by the Lieutenant-Governor of South Australia at a review held in Adelaide last Saturday. This is the statement to which I allude:Colonel Stuart and ollieers of the military forces of South Australia,-The review today reflects great credit not alone on the commanding officers, but also on the non-commissioned officers by whom the men have been drilled. For half-acentury I have been in the habit of witnessing reviews in this and other parts of the world, and if this review had been on the other side of the world, at Aldershot, you, Colonel Stuart, and the ' officers under YOU, need not have been ashamed of your men. I congratulate you, Colonel Stuart, on the admirable traimng of the forces you will hand over to your successor, Colonel Lyster, and T congratulate you, Captain Clare, upon the men of your Naval Brigade, who are quite worthy to march with the Military Forces. Before sitting down I would also ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he has received any communication on this subject' from the Government of South and,.if so, whether there is any objection to making its nature known to this House 1",14
6,Mr DEAKIN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"The expressions of opinion in South Australia, which bave been published in the press, have been read by me. The Government of that State have communicated with this Government on the subject by a telegram, the general purport of which was that, so far as they can judge, their troops compare favourably in point of drill and discipline with those - of the other States, and they are, therefore, at a loss to understand why the extra cost which they consider will be involved by the appointment of the drill instructors has been incurred.",15
7,Mr GLYNN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,Do the Government propose to do anything in the matter if the statement that the South Australian drill sergeants who competed for the positions which have been filled up were incompetent is incorrect ?,15
8,Mr DEAKIN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"The Minister for Defence naturally acts in these matters upon the advice of his chief military officer. The telegram and other papers which I have received have been forwarded to him, and, no doubt, the matter will be reported upon by the general officer commanding. FEDERAL PRINTING.'",15

12,Sir PHILIP FYSH,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. The Post-office collects customs duties on parcels from oversea; and under .the special Tariff of Western Australia on Inter-State parcels received in that State. 2. The Post-office is not being reimbursed for this service either by the Customs department or by the State Government of Western Australia, The question of obtaining payment is under consideration.

13,Sir JOHN QUICK,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"In asking the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Whether it is true that the' Collector of Customs'in Melbourne has impounded and refused to deliver to the agent of the importer (Sam. Keam and Co., of Bendigo) certain American Dunlop bicycle tyres unless and until a royalty of 2s. 6d. per tyro, alleged to bo due, is paid to the Dunlop Tyre Company ? 2.

The goods are found to be under detention l under the practice referred to in answer to question of the honourable member on last Friday. .The matter bas been wrongly omitted by the Victorian Customs office to be brought under the notice of the State Minister. 2. It was claimed by the Victorian Customs office that the action taken was justified under the Trade Marks Act, 1890, No. 1140, section 3. Tho whole matter is under consideration, and it is not intended to bring the aid of the Customs to any action in aid of patentees or trade mark owners which is not required by law special and which is in restrains of trade.

16,Mr DEAKIN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"The Noi-folk, being purely a troopship, was not inspected with the same care as ordinary vessels. Customs officer has no knowledge of there having been a Basuto boy on board, and both the disembarkation officers, who made inquiries from some officers of the contingents brought here by the transport, have been unable to trace him , though they have been informed that a lad answering the description marched with the contingents through the streets. CUSTOMS TARIFFBILL . In Committee (Consideration of Senate's requested amendments resumed from 12th August, vide page 15049) : Division VI - Metal s and machinery. Item 77, Mangles. . orem 20 per cent. Bequest - That the duty be reduced to 10 per cent.",16
17,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L," The Government are not able to accede to the request of the Senate by reducing the d u t y on mangles from 20 to 10 per cent, but, with a disposition to compromise, we propose that ih e rate be fixed at 15 per cent. I therefore moveThut the amendment requested be .not made, but that the duty be reduced to 15 per cent.",16
18,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L," A l t h o u g h this is not one of the most important items in the T a r if f , there was a considerable discussion upon it when it was last before the committee, the general feeling of honourable members on this side of the Chamber being that the d u t y proposed was far in excess of the rate necessary to protect the manufacturers of these articles. I do no t suppose that mangles are very difficul t or costly to manufacture, but they are b u l k y and heavy, so that the cost of i m p o r t in g them must be large. That being so, I think that a d u t y of 10 per cent, would afford quite sufficient protection to the manufacturers, and I therefore move That the motion be amended by the omission of the figures "" 15,"" with a view to insert in lieu thereof the figures ""10.""",16
19,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"When the it e m was last under discussion, there was a m a j o r it y of 25 to 14 in favour of a d u t y of 20 per cent.

Request - That the duty be reduced to 10 per cent.",16
20,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"Wentworth), - W it h a view to shorten debate, I suggest that honourable members might be permitted tb discuss the duty to be imposed upon machinery generally, and that the Government should consent to a test vote being taken upon this request. The Senate have proceeded upon the general principle of reducing the all-round duty of 15 per cent, upon machinery to 10 per cent., and one vote should' suffice to test the feeling of the committee.",17
21,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"We have eveiy wish to shorten debate ; but at the same time we desire to obtain an expression of opinion with regard to each requested amendment. We have no objection to a general debate, so that useless repetition may be avoided ; but we could scarcely regard the vote upon this request as a test of the feeling of honourable members regarding other duties.",17
22,Mr CONROY,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L," We might discuss the whole of the requests relating to the reduction of the duty upon manufactures of metal, excepting the proposal that horse-shoe nails should be placed upon the free list, and take a test vote upon the item now before us.",17
23,Mr KIRWAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L," It would be of advantage if we could' take a vote upon the general question whether the duty upon machinery, including mining, agricultural and all other classes of machinery, should stand at 15 per cent, or 12^ per cent., or be reduced to 10 per cent., as requested by the Senate. It is desirable that we should dispose of the Tariff as quickly as possible.",17
24,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L," The new-born zeal on the part of the Opposition with reference to the speedy disposal of the Tariff is to be commended, but it would be scarcely fair to allow all the requests of the Senate relating to machineiy to be decided by a test vote upon the item now before us. Many honourable members hold strong, views with regard to the reduction of the duty upon agricultural machineiy, but would be prepared to support the imposition of a higher duty upon engines.",17
25,Mr THOMAS,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"Ye s ; they want to make the "" other fellow "" pay the duty. That is a scandalous thing.",17
26,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"Whils t I agree with the honourable member for Wentworth that we should have a general debate upon the requests of the Senate relating to this division, I do not think one vote should settle the whole question.",17
27,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"I m o v e That the amendment requested be not made. After very long debates, the committee decided that a 15 per cent, duty should be imposed upon agricultural, horticultural, and viticultural machinery, and it is of the highest importance that we should encourage the manufacture of these goods in our midst. We must not forget that whilst it is highly desirable in the interests of the agricultural community that their implements should be manufactured here, the industry is deserving of special encouragement, because it affords employment to a large number of skilled labourers. Moreover, the facilities afforded to our agriculturists in the shapeof cheap machinery largely assist in the development of that industry which is the backbone of all our resources. Erom all I can hear, hardly any request of the Senate has caused more alarm than the proposal to cut down the protection afforded to the manufacturers of agricultural machinery.",17
28,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,Where 1,17
29,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"In all the States. The collectors of Customs have been asked to report upon the probable effect of .a reduction of the duty. I do not propose to quote their opinions in all cases, and I need only refer at present to the report of the Collector of Customs in New South Wales, who says :It is a matter of doubt as to whether manufacturers could progress to any extent in this State if the suggested reduction were given eflect to. At any rate it will be a severe blow to intended expansion of trade.",17
30,Mr CONROY,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,Did the' Minister promise to dismiss the officer if he did not write that?,17
31,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,Onl y a mind which we cannot envy could suggest such a dirty act.,17
32,The CHAIRMAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,I am sure that upon reflection the honourable and learned member for Werriwa must see that he has made a very offensive remark. It must be withdrawn.,17
33,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,The matter ought not to be allowed to rest there. We are getting tired of these repeated insults.,17
34,Mr CONROY,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,I withdraw the expression which I used.,18
35,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,Member s ai-e growing tired of these insults.,18
36,Mr CONROY,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,Why does the honourable member come bere as a paid advocate ?,18
37,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"I would direct attention to the insulting remark made by the honourable and learned member. We are continually being subjected to such insults, and 'it is your duty, sir, to protect honourable members from insulting insinuations.",18
38,Mr CONROY,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,I am glad that the honourable member is able to feel that it is an insulting insinuation.,18
39,The CHAIRMAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"If the honourable and learned member for Werriwa applied the term "" paid advocate"" to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, I trust that he will withdraw it .",18
40,Mr CONROY,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,I withdraw the remark.,18
41,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,I am sure that no honourable member will discount any opinion to which Mr Lockyer sets his hand. Mr G. R. EDWARDS - But we are going to take our policy from the collectors of customs.,18
42,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"I am not suggesting that we should do so, but when information is sought from certain sources I am only too glad to supply it . I should like to read the reports of all the collectors.",18
43,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,-Do tliey refer to the revenue aspect of this matter ?,18
44,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,The question which they were asked had reference to the probable effect of the adoption of the amendments requested in the Tariff by the other Chamber.,18
45,Sir AVILLIAM MCMILLAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,Who is Mr. Lockyer ?,18
46,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"He is the collector of Customs in New South Wales, and a most valued officer. He was asked to report generally upon the effect of the amendments requested by the Senate. There was nothing to check the collectors from reporting generally, and they did so.",18
47,Mr GB EDWARDS,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,Is it permissible to have a third House under the Constitution?,18
48,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"It is not a question of a third House, but is simply one of skilled officers speaking freely upon this matter. If , however, honourable members prefer not to have their information on the subject, I shall not offer it . But in this connection I should like to quote from the report of a deputation which waited at my office, and which was received by my officers. The report readsOn the 31st July, a deputation consisting of Messrs. Forwood, Eeid, and Evans, representing the South Australian Chamber of Manufactures, waited on Mr Smart, to Uiy before him the views of* their Chamber relative to the suggested amendments by the Senate on the duties passed by the House of Representatives. Mr Forward said, with reference to the above, that the trade in South Australia are practically convinced that if the duty is reduced to 10 per cent., as proposed by theJ3enate, a large number of them will have to give up manufacturing altogether. They will hardly be able to get along with the .15 per cent., but the 10 per cent, would be fatal, and the consequence will be that a number of things that are manufactured now will be imported instead. In South Australia, it was only after the imposition of the 1885 Tariff, which imposed a duty of from 20 to 25 per cent., that we were able to get a start in the manufacture of these goods. Before the 1SS5 Tariff the duty imposed on mining and agricultural machinery was 5 per cent. Since the imposition of the higher duty, factories have grown up largely in South Australia, the men have been well trained, and today we can turn out work very much cheaper than we could before. Most not of the manufacturers are determined that they will not lose their trade simply because the3' are manufacturers only-the y will become importers as well. Several of the Victorian manufacturers have informed me that it will be impossible for them to manufacture under the proposed duty. Another gentleman representedOne of the strongest points in asking for a higher duty is that a duty of 10 per cent, will simply he phiying into the bauds of the American and German manufacturers. In America, machinery for export is sold at specially reduced prices, and with the cheap labour prevailing in other countries, it is impossible for our manufacturers to compete against it. In connection with this matter we have received all sorts of letters, and there is no doubt whatever that the position is-as has been put repeatedly, and with considerable strength-that this House did all that it could reasonably be asked to do when it reduced the rate upon this machinery to 15 per cent. If a further reduction be made it will be to the danger, if not the extinction, of many manufactures, and must result in increased importation from abroad to the loss of Australia. I ask honourable members to consider whether the industry is not worth preserving, and also to declare that 15 per cent, is a fair duty to impose. In this connection I know-as was pointed out by the honourable member for Grampians-the cruel competi- tion to which Australian manufacturers are exposed. Their ideas, which conform to local requirements and which are properly the subject of their personal ownership, are copied, the designs are taken elsewhere, and some trifling alteration is made in them so that the inventor, instead of having the full benefit arising from his invention, not only loses it, but is subjected to competition from which he ought to be free. I have no desire to invite a lengthy debate upon this subject. We are all familiar with the arguments upon both sides. What is a 15 per cent, rate? It is practically what the acting leader of the Opposition suggested as a fair all-round drag-net rate after levying special duties upon stimulants and narcotics, and with a special fixed list upon various articles. It seems to me that we cannot reduce the protection afforded without withdrawing all pretension to give encouragement to an industry which is well worthy of it , which is already fairly established in our midst, but which has been exposed to cruel risks from which it ought tO ID6 f F66",18
49,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L," I thought that during the last fifteen months I had been able to form a tolerable idea of my right honourable friend's character, and I did believe, notwithstanding his well-known obstinacy, that he at least possessed some sense of humour. That he should quote the opinion of the manufacturers of any State as proof that we should retain a 15 per cent, duty upon machinery is ludicrous in the extreme. Does he think that any manufacturer in the world who has a regard for his own interests would refuse to accept even a prohibitive duty if we offered it to him ? The thing is ridiculous. But the right honourable gentleman has made a still greater mistake. He has actually intruded into this debate the opinion of one of his oflicers-the New South Wales Collector of Customs-wh o has nothing whatever to do with the policy ' of this country. If the Minister had said that that officer had reported upon the revenue aspect of this question, his opinion might have been given without dragging in his name.",19
50,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,Was that opinion given as the result of a deputation ?,19
51,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"The Minister told us that he had given instructions to Mr Lockyer and the other collectors to report to him upon the effect of the Senate's requested amendments, but when I asked whether those reports did not refer to the revenue aspect of the question the Minister did not give me a direct answer.",19
52,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"Yes , I did.",19
53,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"When the Treasurer submits his figures to this House, honourable members know very well that they are the result of the information which he has received from his own officers throughout the Commonwealth.. It is, therefore, unnecessary to drag in the names _ of those officers. The reasons adduced by my right honourable friend why we should differ from the amendments requested by the Senate are not worthy of him.",19
54,Mr SALMON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,Is there any other source from which he could obtain the information ?,19
55,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"At this time of day I am not going to instruct the Minister, and I am sure that my right honourable friend would not take my instruction, even if I proffered it . We are now approaching the end of this long struggle upon the Tariff. Honourable members have differed very materially during the course of the debates which have extended over the past nine months. The enormous divergence of opinion was well illustrated by the interjections of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. We also know that instead of the compact which was entered into being honourably carried out, many honourable members who believe in extreme protection have declared that they would vote for every duty that would prohibit importation. But upon several occasions we were, I might almost say upon neutral ground, because even if the war did not cease there was more or less a temporary truce. As far as my recollection of the debates goes, when the committee came to discuss the question of the duties to be levied upon machinery, honourable members from both sides of the Chamber got very closely together. Now, putting aside the large distributing forces which must form a part of every State, and which, to my mind, are just as necessary as is any other part of our industrial life, not we have the great primary producers of Australia upon the one hand and the great manufacturing industries upon the other. Now, what was the feeling of the committee when 'they came to deal with the question of the duties to be imposed upcn machinery 1 We felt that we were not dealing with an ordinary item under a protective Tariff, but with the actual tools of trade of various industries. As honourable members know, we have not merely to deal with the tool of trade which is necessary in the simplest arts of agriculture, but with the most complicated scientific machineiy used in all the industries connected with manufacture. In this connection, the first thought which strikes one is- "" Are we, as a manufacturing and producing country, to face the competition of the world."" Honourable members must recollect the peculiar character of the Australian continent. Although by communication we are now in closer touch with the outside world than we were formerly, we are still more or less an isolated community. Even witli this large continent we are a mere handful of people, and we must face the fact that we over-produce, and that under a protectionist system we must over-manufacture. Consequently, under the very system which we have been creating in this Parliament, we must face the question of the disposal of not only our surplus products, but also our surplus manufactures. There is one thing which protection cannot do, and that is to give efficiency in the skill of the workman, and to give nice, complicated, scientific adjustments to the most modern machinery. What is the good of protection if in this industrial life we have not the most modern inventions in machinery ? It is all very well to impose a duty on say locomotives to such a point of ' prohibition that we import none; but while we are using a locomotive which perhaps would take only twenty cars in a train, there might be invented and patented in another part of the world a locomotive which would enable a train, at the same expenditure, to draw 40 cars. That is what protection cannot do, and fortunately for the interests of the inventor patents have been granted all over the British Empire to protect the man of genius against every person who desires to pirate the f r u it of his brains. Are we going at the very outset of the Commonwealth to strike a blow at the very machineiy which is so necessary to give us that superiority in manufacture and in production which is required once we begin to export our produce ? The use of machinery lies at the very bottom of our industrial life, and in a young nation like this, which must rely more or less on the inventive genius of the larger populations of the world, it ought to be free. I should like to give an instance of the wisdom of this policy. Fifteen years ago I had the good, or bad, fortune to offer a coal mine in London - I suppose at the time the largest coal mine in Australia. We required to sink to a depth of 1,100 feet, a thing which had never been done before in a coal mine. The colliery had to be opened out and the industry carried on under conditions which had never prevailed before in that business. It was absolutely necessary, for the maintenance of the industry and the preservation of the lives of the people, that we should have the best mechanical appliances which the world could produce. England and Scotland were ransacked by the directors of the company, and the machinery which at the time, if not now, was equal to any machinery in the world, came from 50 or 100 firms, and of course it was supplemented by some of local manufacture. We laid tribute on the world; we sank our shaft 1,100 feet; we created a business which, since that day, has been' keeping 2,000 men, women, and children in comfort, and everything which human wit could do in order to make that property productive, and protect human life was done. Are we, a handful of people isolated from the centres of the world, to put an embargo on the very privilege which we ought to enjoy ? Such a policy is unstatesmanlike. In support of a reduction of duty we claim not merely the voices of the primary producers, who get precious little out of the Tariff, but also the voices of the industrial manufacturers, who, to the disgrace of Australia be it said, in the future, if these embargoes are imposed, will be behind the rest of the world - as regards the use of - scientific appliances. We have no right to impose an embargo on science and skill, or to do anything which would prevent the industrial life of Australia fi'om competing with the rest of the world. We must recollect that whenever a man of genius invents a new mechanical appliance, it becomes available to nearly the whole world. Are we going to put an embargo on the use of that appliance ? Again, when we wish to engage a professor of chemistry or a great railway expert, do we depend on our colonial stock?. Do we not go to America, England, or elsewhere in order to secure the talent of the world? Are not the mechanical appliances which we are importing and on which there should be no embargo the most effective capital which could be introduced 1 My honourable friends on the other side have to deal with this question from the stand-point of the industrial life of the future. We are now forcing manufactures not merely in Victoria, but in all the other States. Within ten years, I venture to say,' uncier this Tariff, if it is not amended, either we shall have a large surplus stock of manufactures or we shall have men unemployed. What are we going to do then 1 Are we going to make our industries simply commensurate with the area and the wants of Australia t Are we never going to aim at the destiny of Australia in the eastern part of this world? Do we not expect, as time goes on, if we have the industrial and the intelligence of our who made the English nation the greatest manufacturing power under the sun, to export to every part of the - eastern world 1 Certainly we do. Once a man of genius invents any mechanical appliance, it becomes by right of purchase at a certain price the property of the Japanese, the Chinese, or the Indian, just as much as it becomes ours. There is no fear of those people shutting out the mechanical appliances of the world, putting an embargo on genius, or hesitating to'get a professor or an engineer from any part of the world. I am not opposed in any sense to the rise of the manufacturing industries of Australia. I believe that within 20 or 30 years, without one jot of duty, we should have had manufacturing industries which would not merely have provided for the wants of Australia, but would have made us the emporium of the eastern world. But, taking it for granted that this position is forced, I wish to see the industries of Australia placed on the same basis as the best industries in all parts bf the world. Will the honourable member for Melbourne Ports deny that today, largely by reason of these duties, and largely from the want of an active and healthy competition, there is employed in Victorian manufactures machinery which is far behind the times 1 That is one of the great dangers of this protectionist system, especially if it is carried to a point which almost prohibits importation. We lose the strengthening element of a healthful competition. honourable members wish to - bolster up industries when they are behind the rest of the world ? If so, the system must break down. We should not have any duty affecting an industry unless that it is of such a moderate Sir William MCMillan. character that, if the industry does not keep in touch with the march of civilization and the march of science, it will inevitably go down. I feel that the Government might give way on this item. I would point out to Ministers and their supporters that here we have an opportunity to pursue a broad line of public policy, by agreeing to the sensible proposal of the Senate. I think if that course be taken it will go a long way to smooth the differences between the House's. I feel strongly on this matter. I make no distinction between the machinery of the agriculturist and that of the miner. I submit that all machinery-everythin g which is necessary to a man for carrying on his inbrain dustry and which can come under the forefathers general title of tools of trade-ough t to be absolutel}' free, or, if not free, subjected to the least possible duty. I move That the motion be amended by the omission of the word "" not.""",19
56,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L, I wish in the first place to draw the attention of the honourable member for Wentworth to' the statement that honourable members on this side of the Chamber have advocated the imposition of prohibitive duties. I have not heard that term mentioned once. We recognised from the very first that this would be a compromise Tariff. To talk of it being prohibitive,21
57,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"The honourable member speaks of 25 per cent, duties.",21
58,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"That rate is not prohibitive. Imports have continued to come into Victoria under duties ranging as high as 35 and 40 per cent. We have never had anything approaching a prohibitive Tariff in this State, and no one knows it better than does the honourable member for Wentworth. It has been recognised by leading protectionists on the public platform in Victoria, and in the course of parliamentary debates, that owing to financial requirements this Tariff must be a compromise, and for any one to contend that it contains a prohibitive item, or that - a prohibitive duty has been proposed in connection with it, is simply to ring the changes on words. The honourable member for Wentworth has referred to overDo production in Victoria. In what line has that taken place 1 In a report relating to the establishment of grain elevators here, an unbiased judge, Mr Mathieson, ex-Commissioner of Railways in Victoria, has pointed out that even the export of wheat, as compared with that consumed in the home market, is of comparatively little importance to the wheat-growers - of Victoria. The same remark will apply to both producers and manufacturers in any country. I commend Mr Mathieson's report to my honourable friends opposite. It is worthy of perusal.",21
59,Mr FOWLER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,Does not the export price fix the rates ruling in the home market ?,22
60,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,If it were not for the home market the wheat-growers would be in a bad way at the present time.,22
61,Mr BROWN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,Whic h is more profitable to the wool-grower-the home or the foreign market ?,22
62,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"I am not discussing that matter. What line of manufacture in Australia is in a position to export 1 To talk about over-production at this stage of our industrial development is simply to anticipate a condition of affairs which, I think, is not likely to occur for at least 50 years.",22
63,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,Nonsens e !,22
64,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"I hope that my honourable friend is right, and that at an early date we shall be able to overtake our home market. But there is no indication of it , and I am afraid there is no possibility of it under this Tariff. The honourable member for Wentworth has asserted that we have obsolete machinery in Victoria. Where is that machinery ? The honourable member must be acquainted with our various manufactories, and surely he will admit that in our boot, hat, and other leading industries we have the very best machinery, and employ the most skilled workmen?",22
65,Mr THOMAS,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,Importe d machinery.,22
66,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"That is not the question. The honourable member for Wentworth has urged that we ought to obtain the latest patented machinery from all parts of the world, and the honourable member for Barrier now says that the up-to-date machinery used in Victorian factories is imported, thus proving that our duties have not prevented its importation. The honourable member knows that in all the better classes of manufacture,. Victoria is doing better than is the State he represents. Highclass hats, boots, and clothing have been, and are being, .made in Victoria to an extent not equalled in any other part of the Commonwealth, yet the honourable member' for Wentworth talks about obsolete machinery. Sir WILLIAM , MCMILLAN - Does the honourable member mean to say that all the machinery used in Victorian factories is as up-to-date as is that employed in England ?",22
67,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,The machinery in our leading factories is equal to anything to be found in England. Those factories send men to England every twelve months to pick up the latest ideas.,22
68,Mr FOWLER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,The machinery' in some of the Victorian woollen factories would have been broken up in England long ago.,22
69,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"If some of my honourable friends had been in the British Parliament, they would have been turned out long ago. One swallow does not make a summer. I cannot say that all our mills have the best machinery, but I do say that those which are commanding the market, and producing the best material, send experts to England from time to time to obtain the best machinery in the world.",22
70,Mr MCDONALD,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,The honourable member thinks that they cannot obtain better machinery ?,22
71,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"I have not said that such is my opinion, nor have I indicated that it is.",22
72,Mr FOWLER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,When was the latest woollen-weaving machinery introduced into Victoria ?,22
73,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"W it h in the last six months. It was ordered before the duty was altered. I visited the Ballarat Woollen Mills last week, when a new wing was opened, and I was assured by the manager that they had the latest and best machinery.",22
74,Mr FOWLER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,Then the industry is not being ruined by the reduced duties.,22
75,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"My honourable friend is edging away from the question. I am not discussing high or low duties. What I contend is that, in the leading lines of manufacture in Victoria, the veiy best machineiy that can be secured in any part of the world is employed, and that the duty upon machinery has not shut it out. The honourable meinber for Wentworth has also referred to the genius of invention. I have the fortune or misfortune to be an Australian native, and I claim that Australia young and unimportant and insignificant as it is in the eyes of some honourable members opposite-ha s given to the world some of the best inventions known. What I about the torpedo ? ' ",22
76,Mr MAHON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,Some of the best inventions in fiscal statistics 1,23
77,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"I do not know what that has to do with machinery. Surely my honourable friend will not reason that Australians are not just as capable of inventing machinery of all kinds as are any people of equal number in any other part of the world ? To urge that, because we propose to develop our own industries, we are going in. any way to stifle genius is to contend what is contrary to experience. Mr O'MALLEV - What about the stumpjumping plough 1",23
78,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,Yes . Take agricultural machineiy. It cannot be disputed,23
79,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,That does affect the question. I did not say a against the genius of Australians.,23
80,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"The honourable memI ber said that if we imposed the enormous duty 'of 15 per cent, genius would shut out, manufacture would be stifled, all sorts of disasters would overtake us.",23
81,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,The member has done his best to bring that about.,23
82,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"I have done my best to bring about the opposite result; and advocating the policy of protection I anxious that we should follow the example of the nations that are leading the world. It is a notorious fact-and the honourable member for Grampians knows it-that the kind. combined harvester, an agricultural ment invented and manufactured in Ausspoke tralia by an Australian firm, is being copied at the present time by a Canadian firm which has branches here, and can tranship and transfer without the slightest trouble. To that firm the duty will be no Foreign manufacturers are sucking the brains and the inventive genius of Ausengines. tralian people, and yet we are asked some friends of the Commonwealth to give them an open market without any restricside tion. The manufacturers have not pealed for free machineiy; and men are petitioning us to impose the reasonable duty of 15 per cent, proposed by the Government. Mr WINT ER COOKE - Hav e the users of promise engine. machinery asked for this duty 1 - Mr Mauger - I can assure my honourable friend-and the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs will verify the statement-that users of machineiy are urging that, in their own interests, as well overtaken for 50 years. as in those of the Commonwealth generally, Australian manufacturers should be supported. At a conference of farmers, held recently in the electorate of Darling Downs-, one of the leading farmers of the district said that he had used Australian machinery, and could commend it. He appealed to his fellow farmers to do their best to support it .",23
83,Mr MCDONALD,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,The same people desire black labour.,23
84,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"The honourable member for Moira does not support black labour, and he will tell the committee that farmers in Victoria, where we have machinery manufactories, have been better served than have those of New South Wales. not Even the producer is not urging that these word duties should be imposed. Notwithstanding the insinuations that have been made, have no monetary interest, either direct or indirect, in any manufacture. I am here be to advocate the interests of our workmen and and those of our own people generally, and I trust that the duty proposed by the honourable Government will be agreed to.",23
85,Mr MAHON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L," I think that the committee will acquit the honourable member for Melbourne Ports of havin ing any personal interest in any duty am. which may come before us. . No one has made any such suggestion, and I am sure that so far as this side is concerned he stands acquitted of any interest of the The honourable member as well impleas the Minister for Trade and Customs very strongly about foreign manufacturers who had stolen the patterns of Australian machinery makers. When the Tariff' was before us on a former occasion, I cited a case showing that the ideas bar. of a foreign manufacturer had been stolen and utilized by a local maker of So that all these sins-if they be by sins-ar e not confined to one side. Probably there are just as many offenders on one as there are on the other. ap Mr KINGSTON - To what case does the the workhonorable member refer 1",23
86,Mr MAHON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"To the case in which a man utilized the design of the Crossley oil engine, and constructed a kind of comI n these circumstances I do not think the Minister has a right to advance that argument as a reason for maintaining this duty. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports said that there was no possibility of the local market being If that be so, we cannot have a stronger argument in favour of reducing the duty or making all machinery free, because the more machinery we have in the country, and .applied to our natural resources, the' greater our production will be. I cannot understand why the honourable member for Melbourne Ports should .be so anxious about the home market, seeing that it is already largely secured to Australia. I should like him to explain why he urges, as an argument in favour of protection, that local production cannot overtake the home demand for 50 years to come. If the statement be true, it is an argument in favour of allowing machinery either to come in free, or at as low a duty as possible, in order that production may be stimulated, arid that we may be able to overtake the home demand. The Minister for Trade and Gustoms mentioned that there had been an enormous increase in the output of factories in South Australia after 1885, when the duty was increased from 5 per cent, to some higher figure, but the right honourable gentleman omitted to state, and it was a most important omission, that Broken Hill broke out just about that time, and created a demand for machinery such as had never existed in South Australia before. He also omitted to mention that Kalgoorlie and other Western Australian gold-fields have since been discovered. I do not think the right honourable gentleman was as candid as he might have been. He is sometimes very outspoken, but I do not think that in this instance he has placed before us all the facts which should have been within the . knowledge of his collectors of customs. If he is getting the collectors of customs to formulate his policy for him, it ought at least to be formulated upon a knowledge of the whole of the facts, and not upon the knowledge of only a portion of the facts. The whole of the facts should be submitted, - and fairly considered. We ought to lower this duty in justice to the great agricultural and mining industries of Australia. If we cannot agree to the free admission of these implements and machines, we should at least make the duty imposed upon them as low as possible. There is no likelihood of the Senate going back upon its decision in this matter. I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the motion requesting the reduction of the duty upon this item from 15 to 10 per cent, was carried in the Senate by a majority 42 s of four in a House of twenty. Twelve voted for the suggested reduction of the duty, and eight against it . It is significant to note that of the minority of eight, three were Victorians.",23
87,Mr TUDOR,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"I suppose they had no right to vote, because they were Victorians 1",24
88,Mr MAHON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"I should be sorry to suggest anything of the kind, bnt I do say that it is a significant thing that nearly half the minority opposed to the reduction of the duty should be Victorians, and that only five honourable senators from the other States should be found to agree with them.",24
89,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,The honourable member is not quite fair in leaving the sixteen pairs out of consideration.,24
90,Mr MAHON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"I find that amongst the pairs there were two more Victorian senators against the reduction of the duty. Despite the dissent of the Minister for Trade and Customs, I consider it significant that there should be only five of the 30 honourable senators from the other States anxious enough about the duty proposed by the Government to vote for it. i hope that the Minister, when be rises again to instruct the committee, will place the whole of the facts before us, so that we may be able to give an intelligent decision.",24
91,Mr KENNEDY,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L," I do - not propose for a moment to traverse the whole of the ground covered by this duty. AVe have heard objections raised to the opinions given expression to by different authorities. First of all, we are told that the Minister has no right to consider an expression of opinion from the oflicers of his department. Then we are told that the opinion of the manufacturer is not entitled to consideration; then, that the opinions of the employees of the manufacturer are not worth considering.",24
92,Mr THOMAS,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,Who has said this ?,24
93,Mr KENNEDY,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"It has been said by different members of the committee. AVe have been told that the opinion of the primary producer, the user of these machines, is alone entitled to consideration. Let us for a moment view the . situation from his stand-point, more particularly as it applies to agricultural implements and machinery. What is the position 1 I venture to say that it cannot be refuted that since we have had the agricultural machinery industry firmly established in Victoria, under a duty similar to that now proposed by the Government, the A ictorian agriculturists have been much T better served than they were when they had to depend upon imports. As to the inventive genius and mechanical skill of our people, it is only since the establishment of the manufacture of these implements in Australia that we have been able to meet the requirements of the people. The double-furrow and multi-furrowploughs as they exist today are purely .Victorian inventions and manufactures. The stumpjump plough, the stripper, the winnower, as we know it today, and the travelling chaffcutter and automatic bagger are also Australian inventions. This shows that we can make machinery and implements in Australia to meet our requirements, and an immense proportion of these implements in use are made - within the Commonwealth.",24
94,Mr MAHON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"The free-trader does not say we cannot do it, but the protectionist says it cannot be done unless the local manufacturers, facturers are protected.",25
95,Mr KENNEDY,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"The free-trader says that the agriculturist can get these implements cheaper under his revenue duties. The representatives of free-trade in this instance propose a duty of 10 per cent., and the protectionists say that that is not suffito-day cient to insure the manufacture of these implements and machines within the Commonwealth, but that a duty of 15 per cent, is sufficient for the purpose. There is only a difference of ls. in the £ 1 , but it involves a considerable difference in the cost of the implement. For this reason : W it h the duty at 10 per cent., very little, if any, of this machinery will bemanufactured within the Commonwealth, while with the advantage of a 15 per cent, duty, a considerable proportion, if not the whole of it, will be made here. As a proof of that statement. I may say that the duty under the Victorian Tariff upon implements and machinery was 15 per cent., and all the implements subject to that duty were manufactured locally and used by the Victorian agriculturists. Strange to say, in the neighbouring State of New South Wales, where attention was given to the same lines of agriculture, but where they had no duty upon agricultural implements, little, if any, of the agricultural machinery employed was manufactured in that State. The agriculturists of New South Wales were buying their implements from the Victorian and South Australian manufacturers, and were paying the same price for them as were the Victorian agriculturists. The honourable member for Canobolas will not deny that the farmers in his district using strippers and harvesting machines manufactured in Victoria paid exactly the same price for them as did Victorian agriculturists. They did not get any rebate because they bought the implements from Victoria. Consequently, it will be seen' that there was no impost and no tax whatever upon the Victorian agriculturist because there happened to be a duty in Victoria upon agricultural implements and machinery. The same result will follow the proposal made by the Federal Government. I share the opinion that the revenue duty of 10 per cent, which is requested will crush the Australian manufacturer out, and that the extra 5 per cent, proposed 'by the Government gives him a bare margin upon which to continue his industry. The competition between manuand their known ability to adapt agricultural implements and machinery to the requirements of the Australian farmer, will enable the industry to - be successfully carried on without any increased cost whatever to the man using the machinery. As one who has been and is using these implements, and as one who is every year purchasing these machines as they are invented and developed, I can say on behalf of the Victorian farmer-and I think I can say the same on behalf of the agriculturists of New South Wales and Queensland, because the conditions of agriculture are almost identical-that the development of this industry within the Commonwealth under a 15 per cent, duty will impose no tax whatever upon the argriculturists of the Commonwealth. »",25
96,Mr KIRWAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L," The honourable members for Moira and Melbourne Ports have been very strong in what they have said as to the wonders that have been accomplished under the high Tariff imposed upon machinery in Victoria, and they are very keen in their opposition to any reduction in the duty imposed upon agricultural and mining machineiy. But it will be remembered that some time ago, when the question of the duty that should be imposed upon machine tools used in connection with city manufactures existing in Melbourne was before this committee, those honourable members developed very strong free-trade tendencies.",25
97,Mr KENNEDY,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,No ; I differed from the honourable member for Melbourne Ports on that point.,25
98,Mr KIRWAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"I speak generally of Victorian members, ancl I know that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports particularly exhibited very strong free-trade tendencies where a number of individuals engaged in city trades were concerned. A comparison has been made between New South Wales, where free-trade has obtained, and Victoria, where there have been high duties imposed on machinery; but from the latest issue of Coghlan I find that the number of hands engaged in manufactures of metals and machinery in New South Wales under free-trade conditions is considerably greater than the number employed in Victoria under high customs duties.",26
99,Mr KENNEDY,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"Omi t the number gaged in smelting works in New South Wales, and what will the honourable member find ?",26
100,Mr KIRWAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"Under the heading "" Metal works, machinery, <fec,"" the latest issue of Coghlan gives the number of hands engaged in New South Wales as 11,901, and the number of hands engaged in Victoria as 9,423.",26
101,Mr KENNEDY,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"Thos e figures do not meet the position,",26
102,Mr KIRWAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"Thos e figures are in reply to honourable members on the other side, who seem to think that we on this side are not the friends of Australian industries, and that we have not faith in the inventive powers of Australians. I claim that it is honourable members opposite who exhibit a want of faith in the Australian people. We on this side do not fear but that the Australian people will be able to hold their own if we have free ports. We have greater confidence in the Australian people, and it is honourable members on the other side who are the "" little Australians who seem to lack faith in themselves, and who think that without support the Australians will not be able to hold their own. After all that has been said upon the subject, both here and in the Senate, I do not think it calls for lengthy discussion now; but, as the members of the Senate request the reduction of the duty to 10 per cent., while a majority of the members of this committee favour a duty of 15 per cent., I think that the Government might well consent, as a compromise, to on all-round duty of 1 2 i per cent. While there are strong reasons for very much reducing the duty upon agricultural machinery, there are still stronger reasons for reducing, and even for removing, the duty upon mining machinery, and in New Zealand mining machinery has been placed upon the free list. Furthermore, while an. attempt has been made to impose duties to assist the agricultural community, thare are no duties which can be regarded as in any way benefiting the mining industry, because the mineral output of the country cannot be increased in price by the imposition of import duties. It is hardly necessary to impress, upon the committee the great importance of both mining and agriculture to the country. The total annual production of those two industries is worth about £40,000,000, whereas the total annual enproduction of the manufacturing industries of which we hear so much is only about £28,000,000, while many of the industries included in that term cannot benefit by protection. It seems to me, therefore, that we are sacrificing the larger interests of the Commonwealth to its smaller interests. I hope that an till-round duty of 12-Jper cent, will be agreed to.",26
103,Mr BROWN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L," If I understand the honourable member for Moira aright, he. argued that the manufacture of machinery has been developed more largely in Victoria than in New South Wales, because of the protective policy of the former State. I would therefore like to point out to him that the development of that industry cannot depend solely upon the existence or non-existence of a protective duty,, but is largely governed by the law of supply and demand. To my mind, the chief reason why the manufacture of machinery is an industry which has been developed tq a greater extent in Victoria and in South Australia than in New South "" Wales is that the agricultural development of those States has been spread over a longer time than that of New South Wales. On page 504 of Coghlan's Seven Colonies, a table will be found giving the acreage under agriculture in each of the several States for a series of years. By referring to that table it will be seen that in 1861, while New South Wales had only 265,000 acres under crop, Victoria had 410,000 acres, and South Australia 400,000. In 1881 the New South Wales acreage had increased to578,000 acres, the Victorian acreage to 1,435,000 acres, and the South Australian acreage to 2,156,000 acres. In 1891 New South Wales had 846,000 acres under crop, but in 1S99 the State made a great advance to 2,440,000 acres, while in that year the acreage under crop in Victoria was 3,155,000 acres, and in South Australia 2,23S,000 acres. New South Wales 'made her big increase in - agricultural development between the years 1895 and 1899, and then commenced an immense demand for machinery in that State. The increase in cultivation was due to the opening to selection of large areas of land which were formerly not available. Those who secured that land speedily put it under crop, and - then an immense demand was created for - agricultural machinery to reap the crop. The creation of a demand for agricultural anachinery resulted in the establishment of - works for the manufacture of agricultural ^implements, which would otherwise have not been brought into existence, - and the - original inventors of the stripper-the Meadow Bank Company-shifte d their - works from South Australia to New South Wales. W it h regard to the contention of --the honourable member for Moira, that the - farmers of Victoria were better off so - far as agricultural machinery is con..cerned than the farmers of New South Wales, I would remind him that about three years ago Victorian manufacturers were supplying agricultural machinery more - cheaply, to New South Wales' farmers than to the farmers of their own State, who paid for the protection afforded to them. This fact caused such a feeling of dissatisfaction among the Victorian farmers, how- »ever, that the practice had to be discontinued, and a bond was entered into among >the Victorian manufacturers not to supply machinery more cheaply in New Soutli Wales than in Victoria, though,I know that - despite that bond, New South Wales fanners were still able to secure Victorian machinery more cheaply than it could be bought in Victoria.",26
104,Mr KENNEDY,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,The honourable member - cannot give me a single instance in which implements of any class were sold more cheaply in New South Wales than ' in Victoria.,27
105,Mr BROWN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"I can give the honourable member instances, and the names of those who bought the machinery. Owing to the great demand for agricultural machinery in New South Wales, the Clyde Engineering Company, which is a firm not usually classed among the makers of agricultural implements, Messrs. Ritchie Brothers, and other firms entered largely into the business ,of making farming machinery. But these firms found that they \Vere unable to keep pace with the demand which was so ' suddenly sprung upon them, and many farmers had, therefore, to look elsewhere for their implements. So, too, in Victoria and New South Wales it is not protection that has been responsible for the establishment of agricultural implement manufactories so much as the demand for agricultural implements. W it h a sufficient demand, industries will arise, whether protected or not, but if there is no demand they cannot be created by the highest duties in the world. The Minister for Trade and Customs spoke of the encouragement given to inventive genius b}' the imposition of protective duties, and instanced the great improvements made in farming implements in Victoria and South Australia. No doubt such improvements have been made, and will continue to be made, because I think the inventive genius of Australia, when given a fair opportunity, and not restricted by unenlightened patent laws, is second to none in the world; but I do not think that any more complicated or ingenious invention has been made in Australia than the sheep-shearing machine, which is a New South Wales invention. The pastoral industry has never been protected, yet an invention has been produced which can accomplish what was formerly held by experts to be an impossibility. Similarly new inventions and improvement in farmi ng machinery will con tin ue to be made, whether we have protective duties or not. If, as some of the protectionists claim, the farmers will not have to pay increased prices for their implements, what benefit do the manufacturers expect to derive from the duty 1 It is certain that the duty cannot fall upon the foreign manufacturer. The farmers will not be able to secure better prices for their produce, because they have to compete in the open markets of the world. The Minister for Trade, and Customs has admitted that the grain duties can operate only in times of drought and distress, and that if the farmers wish to derive any benefit from the Tariff, they should pray for a continuance of drought conditions. It is unfair that the agriculturists, who derive no benefit from the Tariff, should be asked to bolster up manufacturing industries by paying heavy duties upon their machinery. I should prefer to see agricultural machinery admitted free of duty.",27
106,Mr OMALLEY,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L," I had hoped that after all the discussion which has taken place upon the Tariff honourable members generally would have refrained from further debate. Some honourable members appear to think that good machineiy cannot be made in Australia ; but T would point out that the Melbourne Tramway Company, after having had a most unsatisfactory experience with imported machinery, have for some years given then contracts to local manufacturers. I shall support the retention of duty at 15 per cent., and I hope that we shall at once proceed to a vote.",28
107,Mr FOWL ER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L," I shall not detain the committee at any length, because I am afraid that further discussion would be useless. When the honourable member for Melbourne Ports spoke in very optimistic terms of the position of the manufacturing industries of Victoria, he reminded me of an article which I read some little time ago. Mr J. H . Curie, a gentleman who represents the Economist, one of the best financial magazines in the world, - recently paid a visit to Victoria, and expressed the opinion that the equipment of the mines in that State was in some cases 30 years behind the times. Some honourable'members may he inclined to sneer at Mr Curie, but he is a man of world-wide experience in mining matters, and in view of the unsatisfactory position now occupied by the mining industry in Victoria, the probability is that there is something radically wrong in the methods at present adopted. Mr Curie speaks not with a view to injure mining interests in Victoria, but simply with a desire to see a promising field for investment worked to the fullest advantage. He recognises that there are large and valuable deposits of gold in Victoria, and he urges that the best and most up-to-date machineiy should be employed in their development.",28
108,Sir JOHN QUICK,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,AVho is Mr Curie 1,28
109,Mr FOWLER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,He is recognised as an expert of world-wide experience.,28
110,Sir JOHN QUICK,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,I never heard of him.,28
111,Mr FOWLER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"Perhaps that is because the honourable and learned member does not pay much attention to the course of events beyond his own State. It is remarkable that Victorians discover that tliey are behind the times only after they leave their own State. Many of them have 'made this discovery on visiting the mining fields of Western Australia, and I should be sorry indeed to see the policy which has proved so injurious to. Victoria extended to Australia in genera], and my own State in particular.'",28
112,Mr MCDONA LD,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L," The suggestion made by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie that the duty should be fixed at 12£ per cent, is a very fair one. The retention of a high rate of duty will have a most injurious effect upon the mining industry, which is taxed very heavily under the Tariff. Tliose who are engaged in mining do not derive any benefit from protection, and it is only fair that they should be supplied with the machinery they require at the lowest possible rates. In my electorate one mining shaft is being sunk through granite country to a depth of 3,000 feet. This work will involve an expenditure of from £60,000 to £80,000."" Anotheishaft will be sunk to a depth of 2,500' feet, and a third to a depth of 1,800 feet. When these shafts are completed, the companies interested will have to obtain very powerful and expensive machinery. Much of this will have to be imported, and if we impose a heavy duty upon mining machinery we shall largely hamper the operations of' those who are engaged in these important enterprises. I should like to see mining machinery admitted free of duty, but, undeithe circumstances, I shall support the request of the Senate. Sir MALCOLM. MCEACHARN (Melbourne) - The honourable member for Perth has stated that the mining maehinery employed in Victoria is of the poorest quality, and is far behind the times. Some eighteen or nineteen years ago, I had considerable experience in connection with mining enterprise in Western Australia, and as a member of the board of directors of one company, and as a shareholder in other companies, I found the directors in every case determined to obtain machinery from England. The result was failure, and ultimately they had to send to Bendigo for their mining equipment. The authority mentioned by the honourable member apparently does not know that different kinds of stone call for the employment of special classes of machinery. I undertake to say that at Bendigo they crush their stone and obtain the gold at less cost than in any other part of Australia. Not only is that so, but they recover all the gold. Mr . Curie has probably been accustomed to deal with ore containing refractory elements, i and requiring the use of the cyanide and other processes. Even in this respect, however, Victoria and the other States are quite abreast of the times, and the locally manufactured machinery is fully as good as, if not better, than the imported article. I can quote one instance to show that the imposition of a duty upon machinery will confer considerable advantage. In connection with certain works we were large importers of cars, and the various parts thereof. The result of the operation of a duty which was imposed upon these was to call attention to the desirableness of manufacturing them locally, and consequently we find today that we can manufacture them at very much less than the price of the imported article, plus the duty. Formerly they cost more than £800, but they can now be manufactured for less than that sum.",28
113,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,Then why is the duty necessary ?,29
114,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"To encourage others. Unless we give encouragement to manufacturers, the importers will obtain their own prices, and these articles will never be produced locally.",29
115,Mr CONROY,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L," Onl y yesterday the Minister for Trade and Customs declared that the imposition of a duty upon any article increased its price if there was any importation. He also admits that in regard to agricultural and mining machinery there is importation, so that by levying the proposed duty we shall be taxing the farmers and miners to the extent of 15 per - cent. Letters were quoted by the right honourable gentleman to show that the manufacturers of these machines must be, - allowed to charge the agriculturists and miners at least an additional 3s. in the £1 for their purchases. Of course, their request is a most natural oue. If I were a manufacturer enjoying the benefit of a high protective duty, I could even go to the extent of doubling the wages of my workmen without personal loss. The honourable member for Melbourne has referred to the Bendigo mines. But I should like to point out to him that the quartz there is a very free-milling one. That is the reason why mining operations there can be carried on cheaper than they can be anywhere else in Australia. A yield of about 4 dwts. to the ton has been found sufficient to pay working expenses. I know of no other place in the Commonwealth where such a free-milling quartz can be obtained in suflicient quantities. Usually the quartz is mixed with pyrites, and consequently the extraction of the gold is more expensive than it otherwise would be. But the question with which we have to deal is whether the present duty increases the price of mining and agricultural machinery, and in this connection we have the admission of the Minister for Trade and Customs that it does. Surely a duty of 10 per cent., or 2s. in the £ 1 , should be ample for any manufacturer ! To my mind 15 per cent, is far too high a rate to impose. It must also be remembered that every time we increase the cost of mining machinery, we diminish the productivity. The Sydney Colliery Company spent£30,000 in machinery alone, but it is questionable whether the work would have been proceeded with had there been a dutj upon it . T",29
116,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHAKN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"If the machinery had cost £50,000 it would have made no difference.",29
117,Mr CONROY,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"Despite what the honourable member asserts, I happen to know that the funds of the company were practically exhausted before they reached the seam of coal. That is an instance in which the operation of a duty would have absolutely prevented production. How will any farmer benefit by the imposition of the proposed duty ? Will he obtain a larger crop because he is compelled to pay £ 8 or £ 9 more for each machine that he uses? Yet the Minister for Trade and Customs admits that if the manufacturers cannot raise their prices to that extent they will be unable to continue operations. He is the author of a new doctrine, and one which cannot possibly be expected to mislead the great bulk of the electors. I shall content myself with recording my vote upon this item, and will not trespass upon the time of the committee by discussing the succeeding items.",29
118,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"Macquarie) The district which I have the honour to represent is keenly interested in the matter under consideration, because it uses machinery to a very large extent. In the case of one large industry established there, I am told that, under the original proposal of the Government, it would have had to pay in duty upon machinery imported just prior to the introduction of the Tariff no less a sum than £15,000 or £20,000. I am glad to say that that industry was started under free trade conditions, although the Minister for Trade and Customs wished to claim that it commenced its operations as the result of the protection afForded by this Tariff. One consignment of that machinery was in Sydney Harbor three days before the Tariff was submitted, but because an entry was not passed in theinterim du ty was charged upon The unfair feature in connection with this part of the schedule is that machinery for. scouring, (carding, washing, spinning, and finishing the manufacture of fibrous material is exempt from duty. Thus all the appliances required by the woollen manufacturers of Victoria, notwithstanding that they have enjoyed the benefit of a 30 per cent, duty during the last twenty years, in addition to the natural protection afforded them by reason of over-sea freights, have been placed upon the free list, whereas the miners and agriculturists who have to depend largely upon the export of their produce to the markets of the world are to be severely taxed. The natural protection afforded to the woollen manufacturer constitutes the natural drawback to the miner and agriculturist. The latter have to send their surplus products to England and otlier outside markets and compete with the imports from Erance, Belgium, and Germany, where, according to the Minister for Trade ancl Customs, low wages and protection reign supreme. I do not ask for any favour, but simply urge that, as regards machinery, the primary producer should be placed upon the same footing as the manufacturers of woollen material in Victoria. Tools of trade of nearly every Victorian industry, which are largely protected in other ways, have been placed on the free list. I have been astonished that the primary producers have received so little consideration - at the hands of honourable members. thought that the representatives of mining ancl agricultural constituencies would have been sufficiently numerous to succeed in placing mining and agricultural machinery on the free list - It is impossible for the manufacturers of Victoria, even if they had the greatest skill available, to manufacture patented machinery without the consent of the patentees. Being compelled to import the latest improved machinery, primary producers are charged a duty of 15 per cent., and, therefore, .are seriously handicapped in their efforts to compete in the great markets of the world. A most unjust Tariff has been framed. Theminer and the agriculturist are taxed not only on the clothing, boots and shoes,' and everything they require, but also on their machineiy. I cannot understand the action of the Government in not agreeing to a reduction "" of this duty. In New Zealand, a strong protectionist country, all agricultural and it. mining machinery is admitted free, because it was found advantageous to encourage the primary producers. But in Australia the primary producers, who are trying to get a footing in the markets ,of the world, are handicapped with a duty on their machinery. I shall vote in favour of the request of the Senate, and if we are defeated in the division, I shall then vote in favour of a reduction in the duty to 12^ per cent.",29
119,Sir JOHN QUICK,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L," I think it is to the interests of the primary producers to have their machineiy manufactured on the spot, and that they should not be dependent on importations from foreign countries. I may tell the honourable member far Macquarie that the primary producers of Victoria have long been under that impression. The primary producers know that the circumstances and conditions of Australia may be altogether different from those of distant countries, and they think it is desirable that we should have a number of artizans and manufacturers here who can not only manufacture but repair machinery required by Australian conditions. What would be the use of primary producers importing machinery, which, if it got out of order, could not be repaired ? Naturally, the process of repair is associated with the process of primary manufacture. It has been found by the primary producers in Victoria that it is to their interests, both in the first instance and afterwards, to use locally made machinery. In Victoria, the I local manufacturers are able to produce all the up-to-date agricultural and mining machinery which is required. I do not say that they have yet been called upon to produce all classes of machinery which may be required in all parts of Australia, but they will be able to do so before long, and if they do not, new manufactures will grow up in the States where there are peculiar conditions requiring a special class of machinery. As illustrating the capacity of Victorian manufacturers of mining machinery, I may tell the honourable member for Barrier that recently the directors of a large mine at Charters Towers called for tenders all over Australia for the manufacture and erection of a very large battery and plant. They requested a Bendigo firm to send in a tender, and it was in a position within 48 hours to tender for the required plant,- showing that in Victoria there have grown up a number of manufacturers who are not only capable of supplying the needs of Victoria, but who are able to a very large extent to supply the needs of various parts of Australia.",30
120,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,Does show that they do not want any protection,31
121,Sir JOHN QUICK,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"They do, because there may be directors of some companies who are interested in the importation machinery from outside countries - It is highly desirable that an inducement should be offered to these companies to use tralian productions, and a 15 per cent, duty is only a light impediment in the way of importing machinery and other requirements. To give another illustration of the capacity of the Victorian manufacturers of mining machineiy, I may mention that quite recently I was informed by Mr Henry Gore, a director of the Victorian Estates Comsize pany, who have a number of mines at Moolort, that originally they imported their machinery from England, at an enormous but that after it had been erected and sands of pounds paid in duty, it was found suppose, a good business man. that it could have been made here at less He told me that the next order for mabourne chinery was given to the Phcenix Foundry at Ballarat, and that it cost less the imported machinery.",31
122,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLIAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"An excellent free-trade argument-n o duty is required. - Sir JOHN QUICK - In the first inbeen worn out. stance, the London directors refused to. give an order to the local manufacturers, and went to the expense of paying the duty. The existence of a duty helps to draw attention of directors and others who interested in the erection of machinery to Bendigo and Melbourne Ports the fact that it can be made locally. mit that the duties on this line have reduced so very largely from the original Victorian standard, that the time has now come when we ought to say that we have arrived at the irreducible minimum.",31
123,Mr THOMAS,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L," The honorthat able and learned member for Bendigo extremely anxious that the mining industry should pay a tax on its machinery. On one occasion he asked that a machine cut soap should be admitted free. Does not the same principle apply in one case as in the other 1 On another occasion the honourable member for Melbourne Ports asked that a machine to make glass bottles should be put on the free list. The miner or the agriculturist is just as important as the man who makes soap or the man who makes glass bottles, and if, by the logic of those honourable members, it is necessary in the interest of these manufacturers that tlieir machinery should come in free, not that why not allow the miner to have his 1 machineiy free ? The honourable and learned member for Bendigo used the argument thati t did not pay the manufacturers to make of the machinery for these two industries.",31
124,Sir JOHN QUICK,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"--Because there is not sufficient demand for it, while there is a Aussufficient demand for mining machinery.",31
125,Mr THOMAS,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"All we have to do, - then, is to impose a duty, and the article will be made here. Soon after the House first met we were all invited by the Melbourne manufacturers to visit their establishments. I accepted the invitation, and I assert that a man cannot visit a manufactory of any in this city without finding that the indispensable machinery has been imported. Even rice cannot be cleaned here without cost, using imported machinery. The head of thouthe firm of Robert Harper and Co. is, I In his cost. manufactory we saw an abandoned Melboiler, side by side with Huddersfield boilers. I asked him why he used foreign than did articles, subject to duty.",31
126,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHAHN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,We make as good boilers here as can be made anywhere. The abandoned Melbourne boiler may have,31
127,Mr THOMAS,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"Why was it not replaced with a locally-made boiler ? Thinking that the information might be of the some advantage to Mr Harper, I men-are tioned that the honourable members for would I subtell him that he could get boilers made been here, and that it was only .prejudice which made him use an imported boiler. I said to him - "" Those two honourable members assert that you can obtain cheaper and better boilers from local manufacturers, and it is only prejudice that causes people is to go elsewhere for such goods."" He did not take my advice. As a business man, it paid him to import his machinery, notwithto standing that he had to pay £1,500 duty upon it . He told me that he paid the duty and did not grumble. I replied-""But you want a duty on rice to make up for it . "" Mr Harper informed me that he paid £1,500 duty on two boilers and some other machinery which I saw, and that statement was made in the presence of the honourable member for Darling and several others. In the same establishment we saw machinery which had been imported from Hungary being used to separate rice. It is true that, in some parts of the Commonwealth, excellent machinery is manufactured. Our mining companies nse locallymade machinery whenever they can do so, and there is an advantage in doing so. If I were a director or a manager of a company I should obtain locally-made machineryeven if I had to pay a slightly increased price for it in the absence of any dutyprovided that it was as good as any I could import, for the reason that' there is an advantage in being able to supervise its manufacture, and to see that everything is correct.",31
128,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"The honourable member's patriotism would induce him to accept a .15 per cent, duty ?",32
129,Mr THOMAS,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"No , I object to any such compulsory increase in price. Those who use machinery should be given an absolutely free hand. The honourable member for Moira said that a duty of 15 per cent, on agricultural machinery had a protective incidence, whilst a duty of 10 per cent, would be only a revenue-producing one. My opinion is that a duty of 15 per cent, on mining machinery is not of a protective character. Its imposition will not cause all machinery required in Australia to be obtained from local manufacturers. The mere existence of such a duty would not cause some men to have their orders carried ont here. The' engineers are asking for duties ranging from 30 to 35 per cent.",32
130,Mr MAUGER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"No , from 20 to 25 per cent.",32
131,Mr THOMAS,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"When this matter was before ns on a former occasion, I , in company with other honourable members, received a communication from the engineers of Melbourne, urging that duties ranging from 30 to 35 per cent, should be imposed. Is' it wise to tax mining machinery to the extent of 15 per cent, solely for revenue purposes? If it is desired to get at the mining companies they can be reached by means of an income tax. I admit that while we have power under the Constitution to impose such a tax, we are not likely to use that power; but if, for example, the Commonwealth obtained £10,000 a year less from Broken Hill companies in respect of the duty on mining machineiy, the Government of New South Wales would be able to impose upon them an increased income tax. At the present time they pay an income tax of only 2£ per cent., a rate which as applied to mining companies is, in my opinion, rather low. AVhat has taken place under this Tariff? Since its introduction one company in Broken Hill has been required to pay £6,800 by way of duty on machinery and other things. That company is now importing electrical, and other machinery, which, it is asserted, cannot be obtained here, and upon which they will have to pay within the next few days about £1,000 by way of duty. During the last twelve months 1,700 men have had to leave Broken Hill owing to the lack of employment. I admit that that want of employment is not due mainly to this Tariff. It has been caused to a large extent by the reduction in the price of lead; but is it wise for. us to tax a company to the extent of £6,800 in ten months, and thus make it more difficult for it to carry on operations ? The company to which I refer has made during the ten months in question a profit of £70,000, and the £6,800 paid by them by way of customs duties is equivalent to about 10 per cent, upon that sum. In urging the committee to allow the mining companies to obtain their machineiy as cheaply as possible, I do not ask that all taxation on machinery should be remitted, although I should willingly vote, as I , have done, against every item of taxation. If the mining companies can obtain better work in Bendigo than elsewhere, let them do so. We have heard a great deal about a battery made in Bendigo ; but, although the Broken Hill market has been free for years to the manufacturers of machinery in that city, how much machinery have they sent there ? Is it due to blind prejudice, like that displayed by Harper and Co - wh o preferred to pay £1,500 in duty, rather than have their machinery locally made-that so little machineiy has been obtained .from Bendigo by the mining companies in Broken HiU 1 All the indispensable machinery used in the hat, boot, rice-cleaning, and many other manufactories in Victoria, has been imported. I - venture to say that - without that machinery not one of those manufactories would carry on.  all free-traders so far as their machinery is concerned.",32
132,Mr THOMAS,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"That is so. I do not care much whetiier soap-cutting or glassbottle-making machineiy is allowed to come in free or not, although I sliould vote to make it free: but I think it is of the utmost importance that the duty on mining machinery should be removed. Upon the same grounds as those on which the honourable and learned member for Bendigo was prepared to vote against the duty on soapcutting machinery, I am ready to vote to make mining machinerv free.",33
133,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L," The desire of the Opposition is that the duty shall be fixed at 10 per cent., but I tliink that an arrangement ought to be made so that, if the Government succeed, an amenrlment may be moved that the duty be fixed at 12^- per cent.",33
134,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,Why not move to that effect now ?,33
135,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,How can I do so?,33
136,Sir GEORGE TURNER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,There is nothing to prevent it .,33
137,Sir AVILLIAMMCMILLAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"If the motion is negatived the duty will remain at 10 per cent., and surely we should be able to move, after the division has been taken, that the duty be fixed at 12£ per cent. ?",33
138,The ACTING CHAIRMAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L," I would advise the honourable member to move to amend the motion by omitting the word "" not."" If that amendment is carried the duty, will stand at 10 per cent.; if it is defeated it will be open to the honourable member to move that the motion be amended by the addition of the words- "" but that the duty be 12^ per cent."" Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN ) proposed - That the motion be amended by the omission of the word "" not.""",33
139,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L," I feel that I ought to raise a protest against these duties. Whatever the honourable and learned member for Bendigo may say, there can be no doubt that these duties will act harshly in their incidence upon the greater portion of the primary producers of the Commonwealth. It seems to me that it is of the utmost consequence that in a country like this, which for many years to come will have to depend upon its primary are industries - and upon the prices obtained for its products in the markets of the worldthe producers should be enabled to obtain their means of production as cheaply as possible. I was speaking quite recently to an expert from England- I refer to Mr. Thomas, a gentleman who is interested in the rjroposed bonus on iron-and he assured me that England today can compete both as to skill and enterprise with every country in the world. I was delighted to obtain from him such testimony to the splendid capabilities for production which are operating today in England. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo has told us-and it is a most astounding statement for any honourable member to make - that a duty is necessaiy in order to develop mechanical skill. Following the Socratic method, one needs only to put to him a question in order to show how absurd is the statement. If Tariffs develop mechanical skill, why is it that those countries which have the most perfect system of protection are at the very lowest ebb in that respect ?",33
140,Mr HUME COOK,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"America , for instance.",33
141,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"Americ a is not the most notable type of protectionist country. I should say that China enjoys that distinction. She has adopted the most effectual means of shutting out everything from her shores ; she has carried protection to its ultimate point, and to its logical conclusion, and yet she is the most backward country on the face of the earth so far as mechanical arts and appliances are concerned.",33
142,Mr HUME COOK,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,Tell the committee something about America.,33
143,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"I do not know that I can say anything about America, save that what is in America is favoured. The honourable member, of course, assumes that American ingenuity is the result of American protective duties.",33
144,Mr HUMECOOK,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,I did not say so.,33
145,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"The honourable and learned member for Bendigo said so. He said that we require to impose these duties in order to develop this skill and ingenuity, and that we cannot have those qualities operating in our arts and sciences in Australia unless by means of protective duties. I have said in reply, that in Canada, where they have the most perfect system of protection, it has not developed this skill. The honourable member for Bourke asks-""What about America?"" Honourable members opposite have only one country to which they can point, and that is America. The reply is : that there is only one America in the world, and that no other nation in the world can be like America, no matter how much the3 may try, and no matr ter what duties they may impose. There is no use in quoting America at the end of every verse and chapter of this debate. Why not go to other countries of of the world, where the protective system has been in operation even longer than in America? Why do not honourable members quote the European countriesthe celebrated Belgium about which we have heard sp much, Germany, France, or Bussia ? In none of these . countries will they find that the people have acquired anything like the skill ancl ingenuity which the people have acquired in free-trade England. I say we do not need to argue upon the contention that it is necessary to impose these protective duties in order to give people a particular kind of brain, and to bring about a particular kind of development. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo also told us-au d it is as well that the people of Bendigo should understand the position-that we require this modicum of protection only as a kind of ad vertisement, ancl in order to prevent Bendigo directors sending to England to get worse machinery than can begot in Bendigo. The honourable and learned member's statements were to the effect that in Bendigo they can beat the world in the manufacture of mining machinery ; that people wlio have any sense at all always go to Bendigo for their requirements ; but that because of the perversity and senselessness of the directors of large enterprises there, he desires that these duties should be imposed as a slight impediment-bn t especially as an advertisement for the Bendigo manufacturing firms. The honourable and learned member today whittled down the case for Bendigo-protection to an absurd point in saying that they want only a slight impediment, and do not desire to prohibit the importation of the machinery that will compete with the Bendigo machinery. If protection is a good thing, why not build a wall which will shut out all machinery made elsewhere? When we can supply the people of Australia, who require this machineiy, very much better than can anybody outside, would it not be the greatest kindness to the people of Australia to restrict them to the Australian market, which is so infinitely superior to all others, and I apprehend cheaper too ? Surely the honourable and learned member has not had the courage to state his case as he ought to state it. If I believed, as he does, that we have only to tax the people enough to 'make them prosperous, and to give them acute brains, ingenuity, and mechanical s k ill ; if I believed, as he evidently does, that we have only to shut out the foreign article to give the people inside the ring a cheaper and a better article, I would not argue as the honourable and learned member has done today. His apologetics were miserable in the extreme, and they sound strangely when contrasted with the triumphant ' declaration which he made on his entrance into this Parliament. Then he sounded a positive note of absolute triumph. To-day he has nothing but miserable apojogies for the system in which he believes, and which he says is going to effect this great revolution in the mechanical skill of the workmen of Australia. We ask simply that the people may be allowed to go to whichever market suits them best. Honourable members have today been taunting the honourable member for Barrier, because he said that if he were buying machinery he would probably go to Bendigo for it. I see nothing inconsistent in that. My own experience of the practical aspect of these matters is that whenever we find a protectionist talking loudest about protection, we shall find him hunting with the greatest keenness for the free-trade market for himself. I undertake to say that there are not three honourable members on the other side who, when they require a suit of clothes, will inquire particularly if they can get them of cloth made in Australia. They always go where they can get best value for their money, and if they find the imported cloth is cheaper and better, they go for it every time. The Victorian mills could be kept going night and day if the protectionists of Victoria were sufficiently patriotic to wear only the locally-made material. It is the essence of free-trade that a man should be allowed to go to any market he chooses. If he chooses voluntarily to buy at a higher price in the local market, all the more credit to his patriotism, but is quite another thing, by means of duties imposed by Ministers with the assistance of their majority, to compel a man to pay a certain price for what he requires when he really has not the means to do it . I protest that the argument of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo today was of the most feeble description. Either he believes that protection is a good thing for Bendigo or he does not, and if he does, why docs he come here as a miserable apologist for it, and say that all we want is a slight impediment to the entrance of machinery from foreign parts 1 What does the honourable and learned member mean by "" foreign parts""? We have been told that all the competing machinery comes from Canada and America. Does the honourable and learned member believe that Canada is a foreign country ? He has been foremost in the federation movement; he is an Imperialist of the well-known brand and order, and yet we hear him talking of England and Canada, and every other British country, as though they were foreign countries, and should therefore be kept at a distance when our manufactures are concerned. I say that I welcome the competition of these people, who live within the same Empire as ourselves, and who have something to send us which it will be to our advantage to receive. That is the Imperialism that I believe in-the Imperialism of free-trade, which is the only safe and sound policy to apply so far as our trade relations are concerned. I protest against the honourable and learned member speaking of these portions of the Empire as foreign countries. I feel that we ought to accept the request of the Senate - It is a moderate proposal, framed with a knowledge of the requirements of this great continent, of the relative importance to be attached to our primary industries, and liaving reference to our development. I think, therefore, that we ought readily to agree to make the requested amendment, instead of quarrelling with the Senate in this matter, as Ministers propose to do.",33
146,Mr R EDWARDS,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L," I do not propose to say very much upon this matter, which was thrashed out when these items were previously before the committee some months ago. On that occasion I voted for a duty of 15 per cent, as against the duty of 25 Sawers, W. B. S. C. per cent, then proposed by the Government. To-day, I am inclined to accept the suggestion submitted from the other side that the duty should be 12^ per cent., because I think this is an opportunity to meet the Senate, and to compromise matters with that Chamber. Though a supporter of the Government, I am not prepared to say that they have dealt very liberally so far with the requests submitted by the Senate. It is quite true that they have proposed to meet the Senate by accepting a particular word instead of the word originally used, and by agreeing to the request to make amendments consequential upon a misprint; but I ask the Government to go a little further on this occasion, and, at least, accept the suggestion of the Opposition to compromise matters by agreeing to a duty of 12^ percent., and allow the division which is about to be taken upon this motion to decide other, motions dealing with duties under this heading.

156,Mr MAHON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L," I think the Minister might be a little more explicit ] concerning his proposal to disagree. TI the do not quite agree with the honourable member for Canobolas, because the Minister cultihas been consistent throughout in imposing taxation on the poor, and allowing the rich to go free. Nobody except the rich newspaper proprietors could afford to buy linotypes, but the type used by the poor printers was subjected to a duty by the Government.",37
157,Mr THOMAS,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,The Minister also proposed to tax these machines.,37
158,Mr MAHON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"But he ""scuttled away"" quick and lively.",37
159,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,That is scarcely fair : I can give the honourable member the facts if he likes.,37
160,Mr MAHON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"I should like to hear the facts. If the Government did not "" scuttle away "" from the proposed duty upon linotypes, they did so in the case of the proposed duty on paper.",37

166,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"Honourable members will recollect that the words ""manganese steel parts "" were contained in the Tariff as it left this Chamber without any special definition. The Senate, however, has defined those parts to mean "" parts that are made of steel containing not less than 1 per cent, of manganese, and that are used for and worn in grinding, or crushing, or pulverizing material by coming in actual contact therewith."" That is an elaborate definition ; but, of course, the desire underlying it is to protect what are generally known as manganese steel parts. In a great number of cases it will be found that steel parts, which cannot properly be described as manganese steel 'parts, contain more than 1 per cent, of manganese. I think that the provision was chiefly intended to apply to what are known as Hadfield's steel parts. These, I am informed, contain 14 per cent, of manganese. If we extend the exemption to all steel parts containing only 1 per cent, of manganese, I think we shall be extending it in a way that we do not desire. After conferring with my officers, I am inclined to believe, that if we insert the figures "" 1 0 "" in lieu of "" 1,"" we shall be making all the provision that is necessary. Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN (Melbourne) - I should certainly like to know more about this matter before refusing to accede to the request of the Senate. It appears to me that the whole provision is qualified by the words ""that are used for, and worn in grinding, or crushing, or pulverizing material by coming in actual contact therewith."" If 1 per cent, of manganese is sufficient to temper steel so that it can be used in contact with these materials, the provision is right as it stands. By substituting 10 per cent., the committtee may altogether nullify the Senate's intention.",38
167,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L," Honourable members are now dealing with a highly technical matter of which they have had no notice : consequently, they have had no means of obtaining accurate information upon it. They are practically asked to vote in the dark. Evidently we do not understand what was the intention of the other Chamber in inserting this definition, and, therefore, it would be wise to postpone it's consideration until tomorrow.",38
168,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"Of course, honourable members understand that we merely desire to secure the insertion of a provision which will confer a special exemption in favour of the steel which we do not manufacture locally. The report of my officer is as follows:From inquiries made, it appears that manganese is present to some extent in all steel eastings and machinery parts. Mr James Martyn (Steel Company of Australia) states that the proportion of manganese which is naturally present in pig-iron sometimes reaches per eent. It is evident that the .1 per cent, stated in the request of the Senate is unduly low, and, if approved, would lead to very great difficulties, and possible encroachment on the revenue to an extent not intended. Mr Martyn has the best authority for stating that Hadfield's parts contain 14 per cent, of manganese. It is submitted that in place of 1 per cent., 10 per cent, be substituted. This would, he thiuks, severely limit the importation, and meet the objection raised by manufacturers. If honourable members think that, in exempting steel parts containing not less than 10 per cent, of manganese we are going too far, I .am quite willing to substitute 7 per cent. I therefore move That the amendment requested be amended by omitting the figure "" 1 , "" line 7, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the figure ""7,"" and that the amendment, as amended, be made.

U n d e r these circumstances I move- . That the amendment requested be not made.",39
176,Mr CONROY,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L," This request m i g h t very well be complied with . When this item was last discussed the Minister for Trade and Customs pointed out that liquid fuel might come into competition with coal, and for that extraordinary reason he suggested that we ought to impose a duty. I have read statements in which honourable 'members on the other side have rejoiced over the possibility of the discovery of - petroleum in Western Australia. If they really fear that it would compete with coal they must hope that the report that it is likely to be found in that State is untrue. Others of us hope that liquid fuel may come' into use on suburban railways. It would do away with all the smoke, which would be » very great boon. It would also be of great service to the men who are engaged in iron manufactures. Iron can be heated much more easily by the use of liquid fuel than by any other means, and if we are going to establish ironworks it is an absolute necessity that the fuel should be cheap. It would be of very great advantage to many machine manufacturers and others to be able to get cheap liquid fuel. I have spoken to two manufacturers on the possibility of its coming into use, aud each of them said that he was making an inquiry' with a view of ascertaining whether its use might not - be of considerable advantage to his business, and that if it did give the advantage which was claimed for it, it would be a great boon. Both manufacturers expressed the hope that when that time arrived they would be able to get their supply free of duty. It is worth only 30s. a ton, f.o.b., and the duty is equal to 10s. per ton.",39
177,Mr WATKINS,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"Benzin e and naphtha will go into the factories, and .liquid fuel into the big steamers.",40
178,Mr CONROY,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,I do not think it can compete with coal in the factories.,40
179,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,Sprecklej ' steamers are being fitted up now for liquid fuel.,40
180,Mr CONROY,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"If the use of liquid fuel would cheapen the cost of transportation, it would be a very fine thing for all the coast towns. Surely we are not going to cling to an old style of fuel, when a new one is introduced. I believe that in the Mudgee district, right down towards the head of the Colo, we may hope for the discovery of oil at some time or other. Surely the honourable member for Newcastle would not close up the works lest the oil might be used in place of coal in some directions ? At a time when we are trying to introduce motor engines with 42 i< a view of opening up communication with Central Australia, would it not be a good thing if liquid fuel, which is their motive power, could be brought in as cheaply as possible? Under an}' circumstances, does not my honourable friend think that the duty ought not to be more than \A. per gallon % In some parts of Western Australia and South Australia, where the supply of wood is scarce, it would be a great advantage to. be able to use liquid fuel for engines.",40
181,Mr HENRY WILLIS,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L," I hope that the Government will not insist upon refusing to make the requested amendment. When I was endeavouring to get a supply for the purpose of driving an engine, I found that the duty in Victoria was just suflicient to keep liquid fuel out of the market. I also find the federal duty of ^d. per gallon effective in keeping the article out of the market. No fuel oil can be obtained in Australia today. It costs from 13s. to 15s. per ton at the port of shipment, the freight and landing charges run from 15s. to 18s. per ton, and the duty of i d . per gallon is equivalent to 10s. 5d. per ton. I do not think I am justified in voting ; for a duty of 50 per cent, on the cost price of an article which is coming into general""' use. When we learn from the honourable member for Melbourne that Messrs. Claus. Spreckles and Co., of San Erancisco, are-, about to fit up their steamers running- to Sydney for the use of fuel oil, surely we are not going to impose a prohibitive duty of this character ? ' In an article which appeared in the Australian Mining Standard of 24th Apri l last, it is stated that a duty of £d. per gallon is equal to 10s. 5d. per ton, or about . 50 per cent, of its capital value, and that that rate is absolutely prohibitive. I draw special attention to that statement, because the Treasurer is of opinion that a duty of ' ^d. per gallon is equal only to about 25 per cent. If he is able to secure a duty of 25 per cent, upon this line, I take it that he will be satisfied.",40
182,Sir GEORGE TURNER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,We have a fixed?' duty upon all other oils.,40
183,Mr HENRY WILLIS,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"I have before, me a memorandum prepared by an expert who thoroughly understands what can be done with residual oil, its cost, and all its possibilities. .",40
184,Sir GEORGE TURNER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,Is it written by Mr F. C. Robertson ? 1507S Customs,40
185,Mr HENRY WILLIS,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"Yes. writesThe present duty of Jd. per gallon is prohibitive, being equal to 75 per cent, on the first cost of the oil at' the port of shipment, and no oil for fuel purposes can be imported until it is removed.",41
186,Sir GEORGE TURNER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,Who son 1,41
187,Mr WATKINS,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,He is connected with the Standard Oil Trust.,41
188,Mr HENRY WILLIS,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"He is the representative of a company which has in- terests in some of the South American Re' publics, and in Russia and the United States. Certainly he is interested in placing this oil upon the Australian market. He is interested just as any other man might be interested in placing upon the market a particulaiarticle which he believed would be of immense benefit to the community. He continuesTliere is uo possible chance of this class of oil being produced in the Commonwealth ; our only source of oil supply is from kerosene shales, and the residue from the distillation of these is a slag, and not an oil, and no distilled oil could be produced at a cost low enough to allow of its being used for fuel purposes. All classes of the community would directly or indiroctly benefit by the introduction of fuel oil, .as by its use the cost of haulage and manufacture will be materially reduced. One ton weight of fuel oil is equal in calorific value to two tons of the best coal, nnd could, therefore, be carried at half the cost. That is a very important statement. We - can readily see that manufacturers in remote places, to which the cost of carriage of coal is considerable, are at a great disadvantage for want of fuel such as this. The memorandum continues The farmers would benefit because their grain and wool could be carried on the raUways at lower rates than at present. There are no sparks from engines using liquid fuel, and consequently this fruitful source of loss by bush fires would be entirely prevented. The miners would be benefited, because many mines at present unpayable, owing to the excessive cost of pumping and haulage, could be .carried on successfully. The low-grade propositions at Broken Hill, Bendigo and Ballarat, to say nothing of longer distances such as Kalgoorlie, Gobar, Charters Towers, etc., could frequently be worked economically with fuei oil, when they have to be abandoned under present conditions, and thousands of extra miners would probably be employed. Those who desire to see these low-grade ores worked successfully should assist in [REPRESENTATIVES.] Tariff Bill. He reducing this duty so that residual oil can be introduced into Australia. The coal miners would not be injured, but instead, employment would be found for a large number of extra hands. (1.) Because the tank steamers would load with coal ou their return journey, taking the Australian coal to the eastern markets, which would is Mr Robertotherwise be supplied from Europe or Japan. These paragraphs should appeal to the honourable member for Newcastle. The importation of this oil would bring grist to the mills of the miners of Newcastle, whom he so well represents, but who would not be well represented by him if he allowed himself to be carried away by the statements of the Minister for Trade and Customs, and voted for the Government proposal. Another reason why the coal miners would not be injured, according to Mr Robertson, is- Because residual oil wonld enable the brown coal deposits of Australia to be worked successfully, as it is necessary to have some substance of this description in order to make briquettes from it, and residual oil is the cheapest and best article for the purpose. The manufacture of these briquettes, and the production thereby of a cheaper and more economical fuel, would be of immense benefit to the manufacturing industries of Australia. The last .paragraph should appeal to the honourable meinber for Melbourne Ports who desires to keep the workmen of Victoria employed. It is especially interesting to Victoria where immense deposits of brown coal exist. In order to make that coal a marketable commodity, it is only necessary for residual oil to be introduced and used. Very recently a gentleman requested me to obtain for him samples of brown coal from Gippsland. He desired to see whether it could not be manufactured into briquettes and placed upon the Soutli Australian market, but I was unable to obtain any large-quantity for him. This matter should come home to the Minister for Trade and Customs, who is always anxious to see the people of South Australia placed upon an equal footing with those of other States. If the importation of liquid fuel into Australia is encouraged, South Australia will be greatly benefited, for she has large quantities .of shale in the far north. Reference was made to those deposits by the State Premier, Mr. Jenkins, when he said that although his Government would not undertake now to enter upon the iron industry, they might do so in future, because they had a large body of low-grade coal, and it was possible that a superior kind of coal might be found.",41
189,Mr KINGSTON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,He did not put it quite so encouragingly.,42
190,Mr HENRY WILLIS,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"No ; probably because he is not quite so well acquainted with South Australia as I am. The reducuse tion of this duty would be a great advancompelled tage not on!} to Victoria and South Austunity 7 tralia, but to Western Australia, and the representatives of those States should supthe port the requested amendment. Mr Robertprepared to submit. son continuesSome of the iron manufacturing industries not be carried on successfully against American competition under the present protective duties, unless they are allowed the free use of this fuel. Tor instance, the famous American* malleable castings are made by its use, and rivetting machines and nail-making machines, and all work where a steady unvarying heat is required, this bi-product must be employed if the best article is to be produced at a reasonable cost Residual oils can only lie brought to Australia by the shipment of entire cargoesThat is a very important feature of the memorandum, for unless there is a large local consumption there will 'be no couragement to bring the oil here.and if a duty is imposed the additional price would make this fuel available only for a few special industries, and would put it beyond reach of the mines and railways up country. Indian Government will pay 30s. per ton for much of this fuel as they can obtain, and this as the cost to Australia (which is much further from Borneo or Sumatra than India) would cost 40s. laid down at the sea port with the duty added, which is prohibitive. Residual oils can never compote with - coal for ordinary uses, nor where that fuel can carried at a reasonable cost. It is only because of the saving in freight on long haulages by that it can compete up country. It is only in iron manufactories, because a perfectly steady strong heat can be obtained from no other fuel. He concludes by sayingThis duty is prohibitive, and no fuel oil - imported while it remains, and therefore revenue will be derived from it. If the duty is reduced, the Government will be able to raise a very large amount of revenue from the importation of this residual oil. As it stands, however, the duty is prohibitive, and consequently no revenue can be obtained from it . I would ask those who have hot received a copy this memorandum to consider these new facts.",42
191,Sir GEORGE TURNER,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,I have considered all of them.,42
192,Mr HENRY WILLIS,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"The Treasurer says that he desires a duty of 25 per One is almost ashamed to say that he is 42 T z Customs [13 AUG., 1902.] Tanff Bill. 15079 willing to support such a duty, but rather than see this oil kept out of the market, I shall be prepared to vote for a duty of 25 per cent, in order that those who desire to it-and , in some cases, people will be to use it-ma y have an opporof doing so. I hope the Government will accept a compromise, such as I trust acting leader of the Opposition will be ",42
193,Mr GB EDWARDS,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"South Sydney) can- - I have not troubled the committee much in the discussion of these requests of the Senate; but I think this is a subject upon which the committee does not seem to have been well informed. When the matter was previously discussed here I did my utmost, as did also the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, to point out the great importance that this liquid fuel was beginning to assume in the manufacturing world. t seems to me that if we refuse to make the I requested amendment to exempt liquid fuel enfrom duty we shall be setting our backs against the march of enlightenment and progress in manufacturing methods. It is defithe nitely ascertained now that this fuel must in The the near future play a very important part in as manufactures. I think there is nothing in. taking the argument that its use is likely to affect in any disastrous degree the value it of the coal deposits of this country. In all these inventions it would appear that that which we immediately ' fear be is the very thing that never comes to pass. It was believed that the introduction of the rail steam-rail car would mean that horses would used no longer be required, but we find that subsequent to its introduction more horses have been employed than ever before. So I say that upon the introduction of this liquid can be fuel we shall find that more coal will be no used than has ever been used before. This fuel has some specific advantages over coal and for certain classes of work, and in certain localities it will be very much to the advantage of those who require steam power to use it . The cost of the freight upon it will be much less than upon coal, and it is also more easy to handle. Again in many of respects it is a much safer fuel than either coal or wood. That must be evident from the fact that at a moment's notice, by simply turning a cock, we can stop a fire in case of an accident due to inability to get water into a boiler or anything of that sort. Any one who has had a practical acquaintcent. ance with large works must know the difficulty and danger attaching to the operation called ""drawing the fires "" in the case of accidents where ordinary fuel is used. I have here a very valuable article, appearing in (jlie issue of Mature for 19th June, 1902, upon the subject of liquid fuel for steam purposes. The writer is not like some of the authorities quoted pro and eon on this and other subjects, whose information is worked up to buttress or support one side or the other of the fiscal contention. He is simply dealing with the subject from the point of view of one who hails a modern advance in methods of manufacture. He says The possibilit3' of burning a liquid fuel great advantage in most circumstances, as compared with a solid fuel, has been so long recognised, that it is astonishing the practice has not been more generally adopted. The success that has been gained in the hist few years, however, will undoubtedly lead to a greatly extended use in the near future. He goes on to explain the economical difficulties of its use which, he says, have been overcome. He saysFor this reason, engineers who have perfected the methods of burning liquid fuel have always considered the possibility of its use becoming limited in certain circumstances, and all modernappliances are so constructed that with slight trouble coal alone may be used in them to the best advantage. One of the great claims to be considered in favour of liquid fuel is the ease with which the burners can be extinguished, and the coal fires substituted, thus enabling consumers to take every advantage offluctuations-in the - price of both fuels. For marine purposes this is most desirable, since at many ports liquid fuel would be far more economical to ship for boiler use than a suitable steam coal, whilst the vessel trading from a port-suc h as Cardift or Newport-woul d naturally replenish her bunkers with the steam coal at hand. This is very largely what the supporters of the requested amendment have contended. It is claimed for liquid fuel that it has distinct advantages in certain directions, and, when we have been spending sn many months in trying to assist various manufacturing industries, we should not put an embargo upon certain manufacturers by actually prohibiting the use of this fuel, for that is what the high rate of duty proposed by the Government actually amounts to. The writer of the article, to which I have referred, goes on to give an analysis of liquid fuel and to explain its use, and he shows it to be a veiy economical fuel, indeed, contrasting favourably with coal in most instances. He says further, on the subject of a definite trial of liquid fuelWe are indebted to the carefully recorded results obtained by Mr Urquhart, ou the Grazi Mr G. B. Edwards. and Tzaritzin railway, for probably the best publishedfiguresof the relative merits of solid and liquid fuel. In the winter he found that liquid fuel was 41 per cent, in weight, and 55 per cent, in cost, better than anthracite coal; or compared with bituminous coal, 49 per cent, by weight, and 61 per cent, in cost, better. This was under the worse climatic conditions, and, as might be expected, in summer better results still wereobtained. It must be borne in mind that these figures were deduced from the work of a large number of engines. There are some honourable members who look upon this fuel as being in the experimental stages of development. They think that no practical trials of it have been made, with very but this writer refers here to a foreign railway on which this fuel has been used for some time with successful results. Coming nearer home, he says, speaking of EnglandIn this country the pioneer of liquid fuel on our railways is Mr James Holden and his company; the Great Eastern Railway has now more than 60 engines burning it either alone or in conjunction with coal. In a note presented at the International Railway Congress, 1900, Mr. Holden gives the following particulars of express trains running between Liverpool - street and Cromer. The distance of 138 miles is covered in 175 minutes, with a four minutes stop, on a consumption of 14-4 lbs. of tar residues per train mile, and an equivalent of 5 lbs. per mile of coal which is used in raising the steam necessary for starting the oil injectors. In the same paper it is stated that on railways working with wood fuel a saving of 50 per cent, has been effected by burning liqued fuel.",42
194,Mr WATKINS,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,On what railway in England do they burn wood ? I did not think they had any wood in England which could be used as fuel.,43
195,Mr GB EDWARDS,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"I do not knowany more than the honourable member, but the writer of this article says that in a paper written by Mr Holden, who is the manager of the Great Eastern Railway in England, the statement is made that on railways working with wood fuel, a saving of 50 per cent. has. been effected by. burning liquid fuel.",43
196,Mr WATKINS,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,Everythin g would depend upon the circumstances in which it was used.,43
197,Mr SALMON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,What was the price of the wood %,43
198,Mr GB EDWARDS,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"I do not know the price. I know that wood fuel is very cheap in many parts of the - world, and in many parts of the Commonwealth. I know also that in some of the mining districts of the Commonwealth it is very dear. I know that to my own cost, because I have been in a mine which has been pumping for the last eighteen months-and pumping my money away at the same time-and the expense has largely been due to the use of wood fuel. In the case of a mine like that, and of many mines throughout the Commonwealth, where it is difficult to get wood fuel, this liquid fuel would be an important assistance. Again, liquid fuel would be of very great assistance to farmers who drive small engines in connection with farming operations, such as chaff-cutting, and so forth. I believe it will no more interfere with the great interest with which the honourable member for Newcastle is concerned-the ooal deposits of Newcastle-tha n - with the man in the moon. All these are things which we require to assist us in our manufactures, in keeping us up to date, and in enabling us to march abreast of the times. We must take advantage of every modern improvement and invention, and it will be a suicidal policy for this committee to hold out for the very high rate of duty which Ministers persuaded us to adopt on a previous occasion. It does not appear to be a very high duty, but in proportion to the value of the material, it is a very serious tax. The Prime Minister, when approached at home on the subject of the duty upon this liquid fuel, and asked to allow it to come in free in the interests ""of mining investors in 1 Western Australia and elsewhere, made the most absurd reply that I ever heard upon this question. He is reported to have said that to persist in what was proposed would be to set the coal-miners against the goldminers. I do not think that in this matter we have anvthins to do with either coalminers or gold-miners, but with the' whole body of the people of this Commonwealth, who are interested in steam, in manufactures, and in enabling the Commonwealth to produce as cheaply as possible all that she requires.. I repeat that it will be suicidal for this committee, by holding out for the excessive duty proposed, to shut out this liquid fuel, which, on the best information we possess, is shown to be a coming thing, which must play an important part wherever it is found necessary to raise steam or use steam power. There is nothing in the contention that it is likely to interfere with our coal mines. fuel will be used for raising steam where it will not be raised if we have to depend upon the use of coal. For the reasons I have given I hope the committee will agree to alter its ori<rinal decision and accept the requested amendment of the Senate. In addition to its use as fuel, this material has been used - with very great advantage in some cities of the world for pouring upon the streets, instead of water, for the purpose of laying dust. The experiment in some of the cities of America has been reported upon veiy highly, and for this purpose it is reported to be cheap, expeditious, and efficacious. If we could only obtain the material cheaply enough it could be used for a similar purpose here, when very frequently we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of water. Its advantage in this respect is due to the fact that owing to its natural characteristics it does not evaporate, but is mixed with the material forming the streets. For the reasons I have stated, I hope honourable members will not be induced to impose a duty upon this article, in order to guard against something that will never happen.",43
199,Mr GLYNN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L," I suppose it will be in order for me to move that the motion be amended by the omission of the word "" not,"" and if the amendment should be lost, it will then be competent for any honourable member subsequently to move an alternative amendment. Assuming that that is so, and in order to test the question, I move That the motion be amended by the omission of the word "" not.""",44
200,Mr WATSON,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"I hope we shall come to a vote quickly. Mr Glynn;-Yes ; the matter has been elaborately debated by the honourable member for Robertson, whose speech has been well supplemented by the remarks of the honourable member for South Sydney. I only wish that the honourable member for Newcastle, who is really the cause of all the trouble",44
201,Mr WATKINS,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,I have not spoken.,44
202,Mr GLYNN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"No ; but the honourable member spoke before on this subject. I wish he had been out of the chamber at that time, as we should then have been enabled to get this article admitted free. A mistake was made by the Government originally in putting this on the same line as This kerosene with a duty of 3d. per gallon. When the Treasurer found that he had made a glaring mistake he agreed with me that it should be made free. Then the honourable member who represents the coal-fields district of Newcastle arrived, and sat near the right honourable gentleman for some time. There was a sudden change in the Treasurer's opinion; and I can only surmise that it was due to the vicinity of the honourable member for Newcastle. If the honourable member had not entered the chamber at the time this article would have been free of duty. I should be sorry to characterize the fears of the honourable member for Newcastle as absurd, but he is certainly displaying an extraordinary degree of nervousness. In 1900 the total output of coal and lignite was 750,000,000 tons, and the quantity available for export 180,000,000 tons, whereas the total output of solar oil and liquid fuel was only 20,000,000 tons, of which only 5,000,000 was available for export. Although I know that in some of the Great Eastern Company's locomotives oil is used as fuel without the admixture of coal, I have seen it stated in a publication called Petroiewn that very good results have been obtained by mixing the oil with coal. Therefore the use of oil, by increasing the efficacy of coal, is likely to increase its consumption. I hope that the honourable member for Newcastle will help us to secure the reduction of this duty.",44
203,Mr WATKINS,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,We compromised last time.,45
204,Mr GLYNN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"No; we were absolutely beaten in the attempt to secure as a compromise the reduction of the duty to \A. per gallon. The present rate of duty, £d. per gallon, is equivalent to 33 per cent., so that a duty of £d. would be equivalent to 16£ per cent., and I am informed that the oil cannot be imported under a higher rate of duty than 10 per cent, ad valorem.",45
205,Mr BROW N,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L," It cannot be contended that this duty is necessary to encourage the local production of these oils, because we have no oil mines within the Commonwealth, so far as our present information goes. But the objection appears to have been raised that solar and residual oil is likely to compete in public favour as a fuel with coal, and that to protect the coal mining industry we should legislate against the importation of liquid fuel. Prom the inquiries which I have made, the fear that the importation of liquid fuel will reduce the consumption of coal appears to be groundless. The honourable member .for Newcastle will remember that when we were both members of the State Parliament a leading politician there opposed the construction of the electric tram which now runs down George street, upon the ground that it would take away employment from the 'buses, and injure the farming community by reducing the quantity of horse feed required in the metropolis. Electric trams have now, however, been laid in George, Pitt, and Castlereagh streets, and the system has been extended to many of the suburbs; but, so far as I can gather, the consumption of horse-feed in Sydney is larger today than it was before electric trams were known there. Similarly, I think it will be found that the introduction of liquid oil will bring about an increased consumption of coal, and thus materially assist the coal mining industry. I understand that this oil is very suitable as a fuel in remote places where coal, because of the cost of transport, cannot be used, and where wood i is scarce. In my own electorate, and in other parts of the inland districts of New South Wales, machinery is largely used for pumping water from wells, tanks, and rivers, and to do other farjn and station work. It would be impossible to use coal to generate the power required, and oil engines are therefore generally employed, because of. their simplicity and cheapness in working.",45
206,Mr WATKINS,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,But the oil which is now under discussion is not being used there.,45
207,Mr BROWN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"I am informed that it can and will be used. If machinery is to be used for the development of farming, grazing, and mining in remote districts, it can be used only where cheap fuel is obtainable. In most places, coal would be altogether too expensive a fuel, and, therefore, if no other fuel could be obtained, machinery would not be used there. But if a cheaper fuel can be obtained, the assistance which will begiven to the development of these industries by the use' of machineiy will indirectly lead to a very large consumption of coal in various manufacturing processes in places where it can be profitably used - In this connection, I might instance the history of the Cobar copper mine, where originally they employed wood for smelting purposes, but the process was so expensive that they had to suspend operations. W it h the extension of the railway to Cobar, however, they were able to obtain coke, and to carry on their operations profitably, the matter which was made locally being sent to Lithgow for further treatment. Although a comparatively small quantity of coal is used at Cobar, the various processes connected with the refining of the ore, which are carried out in other places, requires the use of a very large quantity of coal, and in the same way the development of mining, pastoral, and agricultural industries by the aid of machinery will increase the consumption of coal. An article, which appeared in the Melbourne Age last Tuesday, shows that, whereas the consumption of oil in California np to June, four years ago, was about 1,000 gallons per annum, it has now increased to 1,000,000 gallons per annum, and the honourable member for West Sydney pointed out that by the use of oil on their roadways they are able to control the dust fiend. If it were possible to keep down the dust is cities like Melbourne ancl Sydney, business people would effect a great saving, and all who live or are employed in them would be greatly convenienced. The protectionists have accepted duties of 15 per cent, as providing reasonable protection to many of the main lines of industry, such as the manufacture of machinery, and I think, therefore, that 15 per cent, would be a very fair rate to impose on these oils, even from a protective point of view. As they are so largely used to promote the infant industries of our back country, I should like to see them introduced free of duty, but under no circumstances should the duty be more than about 15 per cent. S'ir WILLIAM MCMILLAN (Went- Lyne, Sir W. J. worth) - I understand that there is a great deal of difference between solar oil ancl residual oil, and that whilst the former commodity would not be much affected by this duty, residual oil would be entirely excluded from our markets. I do not think that the Government desire to impose a prohibitive duty, and perhaps when it is represented to them that the present duty would have the effect of shutting out residual oil, they will agree to meet the Senate to the extent of exempting residual oil.",45
208,Mr WATKINS,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,It would be far less objectionable to admit solar oil free than to place residual oil on the list of exemptions.,46
209,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,SOUTH AUSTRALIANDRIL L,"Not even protective duties can alter the ordinances of the Almighty, and we cannot expect petroleum springs to well up out of the ground simply because we impose a duty. If the amendment is defeated, the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr. Glynn, might test the feeling of the committee with reference to exempting residual oil only.

Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN (Melbourne) - I am under the impression that residual oil is not liquid fuel, although the discussion has been conducted on the assumption that it is. The oil used for liquid fuel purposes is the crude product of the wells before it is subjected to the refining process. Residual oil is used for gas-making purposes, and large quantities are utilized by the M e t r o p o l it a n Gas Company of Melbourne. I k n o w that liquid f u e l is the o i l as it comes from the wells in Borneo or Russia.

Item 87, Cement, Portland, Plaster of Paris, and other like preparations liaving magnesia or sulphate of lime as a basis, also gypsum, not pared, per cwt. !)d. Request - That the duty be reduced to (id. per cwt. Sir GEOBGE TUBNEB , - ! m o v e That the amendment requested be not made. The original proposal of the Government - was that the duty upon this item should be ls. per cwt., but without a division the committee adopted a rate of 9d. per cwt. We are now asked to reduce that to 6d. per cwt. That the present duty is not a prohibitive one is evidenced by the fact, that during the past six months we have collected £20,000 from this source, or at the rate of £40,000 per annum. If the reduction requested be made, unless there is a much larger importation, we shall sustain a loss of revenue of at least £13,000 a year. Cement is now ""being manufactured in most of the States, and I am informed that in Queensland the industry is rapidly expanding. Moreover in connection with an article of this sort we must realise that our manufacturers can only command the Australian market, whilst those of Europe are able to send their surplus stocks here, and to sell them at a very low rate indeed. In this connection I am sorry to say that the Metropolitan Board of Works have recently accepted a tender for a considerable quantity of German cement at a price which shows that the contract must. have been cut very fine indeed.",47
214,Mr WATSON,PAIRS,"There is only a difference of 2d. per barrel between the prices. Sir GEOBGE. TURNER - But a contract was let a few weeks ago at a much lower rate. I repeat that cement is being produced very largely in the different States, and in view of the conditions under which our manufacturers labour as compared with those of other countries who are able to send their surplus stocks here, and to sacrifice them, we should be acting very unwisely if we reduced the duty at present operating. Indeed, I am very doubtful whether we did not go too far in agreeing to a reduction from Is. to 9d. per cwt.",48
215,Mr CONROY,PAIRS," Of course the Treasurer forgot to remind the committee that cement is very largely used in the erection of dwelling houses, and that by increasing the duty upon it, and thus lessening the number of houses to be built, we shall be adding to the number of people who preare forced to herd together'in single rooms. Thus the illiteracy of the masses will be increased, and they will be more likely to fall in with protectionist view's, seeing that they will be unable to distinguish between right and wrong. Having supplied the Treasurer's omission, I shall now resume unseat. Sir MALCOLM. MCEACHARN (Melbourne) - I feel that the committee would do wrong to concur in the request of the Senate. On a previous occasion I went veiy fully into the figures relating to this item, and the position is even worse now than it was then. We have here a state of trade which is certain to revive the old system, and should that happen steamers and sailing vessels would be only too glad to take cement as ballast. The volumeof trade is not going to be nearly as great as it has been, so that freights will be reduced, competition increased, and the difference in favour of the local manufacturer consequently lessened.

219,Sir GEORGETURNER,PAIRS,"U n d e r the 15 T a r if f as it was f r a m ed by the committee cameosand precious stones unset were allowed to come in free. There are practical objections to acceding to the request of the Senate. AYES. I think that while some cameos and precious stones would pay d u t y , a large number would be introduced in a small compass, and so the honest trader, who would be will in g to pay the d u t y , would be placed at a great disadvantage. The imposition of a d u t y would also have a serious effect on Tellers. the manufacturing jewellery business here, because-jewellery made up with precious stones, and unset precious - stones, would NOES. come in at practically the same rate. We kno w that the value of the made-up article, as a rule, is very l it t l e more t h a n the value of the jewels it contains. I think it would be unwise to impose a d u t y Tellers. which it would be very difficul t indeed to collect; which would cause a great amount of fraud, and which would act injuriously to one of our industries. Under these circumstances, I move- . Tliat the amendment requested be not made.",49
220,Mr CONROY,PAIRS," T agree with the statement of the Treasurer that however advisable it might be, it is impossible to get the duty which ought to be collected on these articles. At the time when we were dealing with the item of jewellery, I pointed out that a duty of 25 per cent, was far too high. It has been pointed out to me by men who are .carrying on large jewellery establishments, that it is possible for a person to pack in a very small compass from £4,000 to £5,000 worth of jewellery.",50
221,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,PAIRS,"The Senate silver"" does not request an alteration of the duty on jewellery.",50
222,Mr CONROY,PAIRS,"Unfortunately the Senate does not. I am sorry that we did not lower the duty from 25 to 12 or 10 Item 110, Boots and shoes per cent., because at that rate it does not pay a man to smuggle. When it is remembered how easy it is for a man to introduce cent. a large quantity of jewellery in a carpet bag, it will be seen how utterly impossible it is to collect the higher rate of 25 per cent. I have not the slightest doubt that the eflect of fixing the duty on some classes of jewellery as high as we did has been to encourage smuggling, and so deprive the Commonwealth of considerable revenue. It must be apparent to every one that a man could land in a small handbag all the cameos and precious stones which were wanted. Under the most rigid system of Customs supervision we could have, i would be impossible to collect a duty such articles-. Therefore it is one of those cases in which, for practical reasons, must refuse to accept the amendment reby quested by the Senate. Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN (Melbourne) - I think that the Senate made a mistake in regard to this duty, and that the misunderstanding arose owing to the action of an honourable senator who asked those in the trade whether anything could be done for them by imposing, a duty. It was suggested that a duty npon cut opals might assist the trade. The honourable senator made a mistake, and I hope and believe that the Senate will be prepared to agree to what we propose now to do. I have a petition-of course, it is too late present it now-signe d by 100 persons i the trade, urging that the Government should be supported in their action. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has a petition signed by 200 workmen, request-, ing the committee to disagree with the Senate's proposal. Motion agreed to. Item 115.

Bequest - That the duty be reduced to 20 per",50
223,Sir GEORGE TURNER,PAIRS,"Honourable members will recollect that we had a veiy long discussion with regard to the proposed composite rates on this item, and that we ultimately decided that a duty of 30 per cent, should be imposed. Wc are now requested to reduce the rate to 20 per cent. I am afraid that a misunderstanding arose in another place in regard to this particular line, because we find that they determined that six of the lines should stand at 30 per cent., and passed a request that t only one should be reduced to 20 per cent. on The revenue received from boots in this particular division is about £70,000 per we annum, and of that amount it is estimated some that one-fourth, and by others that one-half, is obtained from men's boots which are affected by this proposal. Thus a considerable amount is involved. We have to remember that if we reduce the duty our markets will be practically thrown open to the American boot manufacturers, while we shall have but very little chance of competing with them in their own markets. The material used, such as glace kid, and certain other articles, is also dutiable to some extent. In these circumstances, I move That the amendment requested be not made.",50
224,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,PAIRS," I do not understand what actun ated the Senate in refraining from touching the other lines of boots. Although we 150S8 Customs [REPRESENTATIVES.] have allowed a duty of 30 per cent, to be imposed on men's hats, there is some distinction between the manufacture of men's hats in which machinery is involved, and the manufacture of boots.",50
225,Mr MAUGER,PAIRS,Surely the manufacture of boots requires the use of machinery.,51
226,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,PAIRS,"The Ports manufacture of boots is not so complicated as is the manufacture of hats. I do not want to go into what has already been said on this question, but I think that when the matter was last before us, it was clearly proved that the manufacture of boots in Sydney had increased by leaps and bounds without any duty, and that at the introduction of the Tariff the industry in Sydney was not only a very large one,' but that one or two boot factories there were rather an improvement upon anything to be found in Melbourne. No doubt when high protective duties are imposed an industry is increased and forced, but very much to the detriment of the interest of consumers I shall have to divide the committee on this motion.",51
227,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,PAIRS," duced. In requesting the committee to agree to this motion the Treasurer stated that a mistake had been made by the Senate. I think that the mistake made by it was in failing to request an all-round reduction to 20 per cent. It is all very well for the right honourable gentleman to talk of protecting industries, but in New South Wales we have succeeded without any protection in establishing the industry. The output tliere is greater than in Melbourne, where, in some cases, the boot manufacturers have worked under protective duties ranging as high as 100 per cent. The price of boots has been raised to a considerable extent in New South Wales since the imposition of the duty.",51
228,Mr MAUGER,PAIRS,But what about the quality ?,51
229,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,PAIRS,"The honourable member is always talking of quality. I remember that upon a certain occasion a pair of boots was produced in this chamber, the soles of which consisted, for the most part, of cardboard. They had been purchased in a boot shop in Melbourne, and no doubt were sold cheaply under the protective system. It would be much better for the purchaser to be able to obtain a good pair of boots. Tariff Bill.",51
230,Mr MAUGER,PAIRS,They were purchased in Sydney.,51
231,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,PAIRS,"I a m coming to that matter. The following night another pair of boots was exhibited, which, it was said, had come from a certain firm in Sydney. The honourable member for Melbourne told me that they were made by the Sydney Co-operative Boot Company ",51
232,Mr MAUGER,PAIRS,I - have a sworn affidavit to that effect.,51
233,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,PAIRS,"I caused the matter to be investigated, and a gentleman who took the trouble to inquire into it on my behalf received a letter stating that the Co-operative Boot Company-whic h consists of a body of workmen-neve r turned out a boot at the price quoted. They sent him a pair of boots sold at 5s. 3d. or 5s. 6d., which they said was the cheapest made by them. Those boots were very different from the pair exhibited by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. It seems to me that - the pair exhibited by my honourable friend opposite could not have been obtained from Sydney and shown here on the night following that upon which the first pair was pro",51
234,Mr MAUGER,PAIRS,The boots were bought three months before.,51
235,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,PAIRS,Imagin e a pair of boots of that description being held for three months. If the honourable member had examined the boots he would have seen that they were never made to sell. If they were they were certainly a disgrace to the maker.,51
236,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,PAIRS,They were made in Victoria.,51
237,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,PAIRS,"Of course. I believe they were made for the occasion in order to help. the Government to carry the duty proposed by them. Although the Victorian manufacturers have had their own market secured to them, and the markets of New South Wales open to their goods, the boot manufacturers of New South Wales have been able without any protection to turn out a cheaper and a better class of boots, and to manufacture them in greater numbers. I think the honourable member for Melbourne Ports must admit that to impose such a heavy duty as that proposed by the Government will be to inflict a great hardship on the general body of the people. Only a few evenings ago an honourable member sitting on the Government side of the House told me that since the imposition of the duty he had been called upon to pay 5s. 6d. per pair more for his boots than he had previously paid for them in Sydney. I admit that the Senate has not gone far enough. If I had my way I should make all boots free. ""When we had free boots in New South Wales they were cheap.",51
238,Mr MAUGER,PAIRS,Mad e of brown paper!,52
239,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAIRS,I went through a factory the other .day and was told by the manager that he sent nearly all his boots to Melbourne.,52
240,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,PAIRS,"No doubt all the boot manufacturers will have to go New South Wales. They will be able to produce better boots in Sydney than they can do here, judging by the class of machithan nery that the manufacturers of Sydney have been using, as compared with that employed in Victoria. Good machinery has been shut out of Victoria, owing to the-heavy duties, with the result that the people cannot afford to buy the best class. If the cement industry established in my own electorate had been started after the introduction of the Tariff, and if the duty originally proposed by Government had been passed, it would have cost those engaged in that iudustry over £15,000 for duty on the machinery required to commence operations. I raise my protest against the Government proposal. I knowitis useless to do so at the presenttime, bnt I hope that the time will come when people will have an opportunity of speaking on the question. I believe that this policy which has been adopted, contrary to the Maitland speech, will work seriously against the best interests of the Commonwealth, and I enter my protest against the iniquities of the Government.",52
241,Mr MAUGER,PAIRS," I desire to state with reference to the boot exhibited that Mr A . E. Pizzey has sworn an affirmation to the effect that he bought it in George-street, Sydney, at the Co-operatry tive Boot Shop. He gives the date, and honourable friends opposite can see the affirThe mation. I can add that the magistrate, before whom the affirmation was sworn, Mr John MCMahon, J.P., of Brunswickmight street, Fitzroy. Under the' circumstances, for honourable members to say that the was not bought in Sydney is only beating the air.",52
242,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,PAIRS,The Co-operative Boot Company say that they never turned out a boot like it .,52
243,Mr CONROY,PAIRS," This matter has not yet been discussed from the point of view of revenue, and it must not be forgotten that by imposing a duty of 30 per cent, we are depriving the Commonwealth of a tremendous amount of reveuue, because that duty is almost prohibitive. This view of the question is one which should in fluence honourable members coming from the smaller States, because in so far as their supplies are drawn from Melbourne and Sydney, the people 'of the smaller States will have to bear this taxation, while their States will lose the revenue. to I think I am well within the mark when I say that a 15 per cent, duty will return from £100,000 to £120,000 more revenue a 30 per cent, duty, and that is a very large sum to vote away in a light-hearted manner. It cannot be said ""that this duty is proposed solely for protective purposes, because, as has been well shown, New South Wales, without a duty at all, had on'y 500 less hands employed in the boot trade than Victoria, and even that difference was steadily diminishing. The reason the for that was that the industry there was conducted upon solid lines, and the manufacturer was not drawing from anybody any .more than he was entitled to as the reward of his skill and industry. In Victoria the position was totally different. In that State the manufacturer was hedged round the by a ring fence of protective duties, and was drawing money from the rest of the people. It must be remembered that the people of New South Wales constitute one-third of the population of Australia, ancl I ask honourable members opposite whether they really think that it is fair that a 30 per cent, duty should suddenly be imposed upon so large a secI tion of the people of the Commonwealth * We are now a Federation, and, whatever our individual opinions may be, we ought not to to force them upon large sections of the my population who do not agree with them. request of the Senate in this instance, that the duty should be reduced to 20 per is cent., is one which I think this committee well agree to. Ministers have referred to the fact that upon similar lines, in boot connection with which in our opinion the duties ought also to have been reduced, no request for a reduction of duty has been made by the Senate. But they will remember that that is due to the absolute j departure from election pledges of one honourable senator, who has since become rather renowned in South Austraha.",52
244,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,The honourable learned member is out of order.,53
245,Sir JOHN QUICK,PAIRS,"This is very unfair. ""What would the honourable and learned member think if members of the Senate ""re30 ferred in that way to individual members this House?",53
246,Mr CONROY,PAIRS,"I shall say, at all events, that tliere has been a departure from election pledges in the other Chamber, and that some honourable senators did vote as they should. I refer honourable members to the discussion which took place at a recent meeting of shareholders in Wallaroo and Moonta Copper Company.",53
247,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,I insist that the honourable and learned member shall not make any reference to members of the Senate.,53
248,Mr CONROY,PAIRS,"Without making any references to the Senate, I will say that reference to the report of the last dispute amongst the shareholders in the Wallaroo and Moonta Copper Mine will supply a very further anxiety. good reason why the Senate has not requested us to reduce all these duties to per cent.",53

250,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,PAIRS,The honorcourage and learned member is defying the Chair.,53

252,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,PAIRS,I am preof pared to say that the honourable and learned member persistently defies the Chair.,53
253,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"I must ask the honourable and learned member to observe the standing orders, which absolutely that no allusion shall be made to the actions of the Senate.",53
254,Mr CONROY,PAIRS,"It is rather difficult me to say that I was not alluding to the tions of a senator, but at the particular ment when you called me to order. I was aling luding to the action of a particular sharetion holder in the Wallaroo, and Moonta copper mines. I am surprised that the honourable - member for Melbourne-who , I understand, is not interested in the company-shoul d prepared t i battle in his behalf.",53
255,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,I hope that the honourable and learned member will not and commit the offence again.,53
256,Mr CONROY,PAIRS,"I was pointing out that we are sacrificing from £100,000 to £120,000 of revenue, and that a duty of per cent, is altogether too high. Fortuof nately another election will come along shortly, and if it were not imminent I believe there would be a revolution, because the people will not submit to increased taxation of this kind. It is idle to say that it is for the benefit of the public, benot cause one body of manufacturers in New South Wales has shown that they are able to do without this duty. I enter my prothe test against the motion, and I hope the requested amendment will be carried. I have been very much pained to learn from the Minister for Trade and Customs, that there is no likelihood of the Senate insisting upon any of the requested amendments with which we do not agree. If a there is anything in that statement, we shall observe the course of the honourable senator to whom I have referred with",53
257,Mr BROWN,PAIRS," Wit h the 20 exception possibly of the duty upon fuel oil, this line represents the high water of protection as favoured by the Government. Though the duty of 30 per cent, to here proposed is not intended particularly for revenue, but to some extent to disimportation in the interests of local manufacturers, I notice from the return submitted by the Treasurer giving the amount of revenue collected - under the Tariff, from the 9th October to 30th June, that on this line of boots and shoes a revenue £17,950 was collected in New South Wales, £7,538 in Victoria, £7,190 in Queensland, £3,950 in South Australia, £11,309 in Western Australia, £1,447 in Tasmania, or a total revenue insist of £49,384 for all the Commonwealth. This revenue has been derived not merely from New South Wales, where there was for formerly no duty, but very largely from acVictoria, where we were told the boot inmodustry has been built up under the fostercare of a protectionist Tariff to a posiof almost absolute perfection. I regret that the Senate, instead of confining its request to men's sizes above 5, did not ask us to review the whole duty, but, no doubt, be a large part of the revenue which has been received from this duty has been paid upon importations of men's boots. That is cert a into' be the case in connection with Western Australian revenue. Seeing t l i at the w o r k in g classes are not able to purchase best make of boots, and, therefore, require more boots than other people, I think cent."" we should not do a n y t h in g to increase the prices which they have to pay, but while I should lik e to see the d u t y made s t ill I feel bound to support the request Senate.

259,Mr GB EDWARDS,PAIRS,"South Sydney). - It seems to me that instead of leaving it to be defined by departmental by-laws what description of material is to be exempt from d u t y as stay-paper and stay-cloth, we should insert a definition in the Tariff. I have had some experience of the delays and inconvenience caused by this practice of in terpreting the T a r if f by departmental by-laws. I have been informed by an importer that he has a large q u a n t it y of this material now upon the water, but when it arrives here, if these departmental by-laws are no t framed - anc l they are not l i k e l y to be-h e will have to pay d u t y upon it , against the evident wish of the committee.

We decided that the six different groups of vehicles dealt with in this d i v i sion should be subject to a d u t y of 25 per cent. The Senate have reduced the d u t y to 20 per cent, in three instances, ancl have allowed the d u t y to remain at 25 per cent, in the others, but I can see no reason why t wo differen t rates of d u t y should be adopted. If the d u t y had been reduced in all cases to 20 per cent., we m i g h t have been able to discuss the matter. As the Senate appear to have been very evenly divided, and as the d u t y is one which will afford protection to an important in d u s try , employing a large number of skilled artisans, I think we should adhere to our original decision.",55
262,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,PAIRS," The f a c t that the Senate did not do its d u t y completely should not deter us from complying with their request, so far as they have proceeded in the r i g h t direction. The principa l reason urged for the reduction of the d u t y was that the i m p o r t charges upon such b u l k y articles as vehicles are so h i g h as to afford sufficient natural protection to the local manufacturers with o u t any d u t y . Certainly such a high d u t y as 25 per cent, is not required, because if the natural protection is added the advantage to the local manufacturers will amount to 50 or 100 per cent, a d valorem. In New South Wales we have been able to manufacture buggies ancl other classes of vehicles in nearly all the small country towns with o u t the aid of any d u t y whatever, and we should not now retain a d u t y which would be practically prohibitive of imports.

I say that the proposal of the Government constitutes air outrage. In the first place, we have no right to impose any duty upon the painter's tools of trade, and in the second there is no justification for levying proportionately a higher duty upon them than has been imposed upon hundreds of other articles.

268,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,PAIRS,"Yes ; when the matter was previously under consideration I received shoals of letters in regard to it . I claim that the Tariff ought at least to be equitable. We ought not to deal harshly with one class and lenientlv with another. There ought to be some principle of equality _ permeating it. In other words, there should be equality of sacrifice as well as equality of privilege. I shall certainly divide the committee upon this question.",56
269,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PAIRS,"Robertson) This is an item which was not thoroughly discussed when it was previously before the committee, and I think that upon the occasion in question something was said by the Minister to the effect that perhaps justice would be done in another place. Working painters have assured me that the class of brush which they require to do their best work is not and cannot be made in Australia.",56
270,Mr MAUGEK,PAIRS,The Painters' Society of Victoria have petitioned this Chamber to the very opposite effect.,56
271,Mr HENRYAVILLIS,PAIRS,"I was also assured by Mr Houston, a wholesale importer in Sydney, that the best class of brush, is not manufactured within the Commonwealth. I would further point out that, as a class, painters are very poorly paid. I do not know of any trade the members of which receive such small wages. Their employment is intermittent, and yet it is now proposed to make them pay 3s. 6d. for their brushes by the imposition of an excessive duty.",56
272,Mr KINGSTON,PAIRS,But the entire cost of an article does not represent the duty upon it.,57
273,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PAIRS,"At any rate, the proposed duty constitutes a heavy tax upon the working man. By its imposition we shall not assist the blind of the community, because these articlescannot be manufactured within the Commonwealth.",57
274,Mr MAUGER,PAIRS,"Melbourne Ports) Notwithstanding the taunts of the acting leader of the Opposition, I think that I know the sentiments of the journeymen painters upon this question quite as well as he does.",57
275,Sir AVILLIAM MCMILLAN,PAIRS,Who the honourable member did not 1,57
276,Mr MAUGER,PAIRS,"The honourable member said that he doubted my statement upon the subject. He can accept it or not, just as he.chooses. I am perfectly certain that the journeymen painters, who are using Victorian-made brushes, stated, in meeting assembled, that-they are quite equal to any articles that are imported.",57
277,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,PAIRS,Do they constitute the whole of Australia ?,57
278,Mr MAUGER,PAIRS,"I think that they know more about this matter than does the honourable member. Probably in Sydney they do not manufacture brushes equal in quality to those produced in Victoria. In this State, however, we have the testimony of the wholesale men, of the vendors, and of the journeymen painters that the locally-made brushes are equal to anything that is imported. I am aware that years ago theyentertained the silly prejudice of my honourable friend. poor struggling painters, about whom he is so uneasy, have not entered any protest against the imposition of the duty.",57
279,Sir AVILLIAM MCMILLAN,PAIRS,The able member's little Pedlington does not constitute the whole of Australia.,57
280,Mr MAUGER,PAIRS,"No ; but these painters are as good workmen as are the journeymen painters of New South Wales, and are thoroughly familiar with the qualities of Victorian brushware. They wish.to obtain locally everything which can be advantageously produced, and that is a proper sentiment to encourage.",57
281,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAIRS,"Parramatta The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has again given evidence that he has a knowledge of everything under the sun, from a pin to a mighty steam hammer. Nothing, comes amiss to him. He knows everybody's business, what the ledgers of private individuals contain, and is, apparently acquainted with everything that has happened from the beginning of time.",57
282,Mr MCCAY,PAIRS,Ye t the honourable member is not grateful.,57
283,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAIRS,The honourable member does not know how grateful I am.,57
284,Mr KINGSTON,PAIRS,It would be much better if the honourable member would tell us what the Opposition knows.,57
285,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAIRS,"We do not know anything, but the honourable member for said that Melbourne Ports is a perfect walking encylopajdia. He always uses the expression, ""-We know,"" as if "" We, us, and company "" were the embodiment of Victoria. I wish to tell him what the painters of New South Wales say in this connection. They declare that these brushes should be placed upon the free list. I think ihat we should exempt the painter's tools of trade from duty, just as we have exempted those of almost every other occupation. Why should we single out the painter for exceptional treatment? Surely if it is a good thing to put the tools - of trade of the mechanic, the mason, and the carpenter upon the free list, it is equally good to admit the painter's tools of trade free. Why is this distinction made ? Is it more difficult to manufacture painters' brushes than it is to produce other tools of trade ? We have been told by the Treasurer that the action of the Government is prompted by consideration and pity for the blind of Australia. I have an idea, howThe ever, that we can find better occupations for : the blind of the community, and something-' more suited to their unhappy condition, than is the manufacture of brushware. honor",57
286,Mr CROUCH,PAIRS,AVha t is it?,57
287,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAIRS,"If the honourable and learned member-will go to any of the blind institutionsand inquire, he will discover that there are plenty of other occupations in which they engage.",57
288,Mr CROUCH,PAIRS,They are employed largely in the manufacture of brushware.,57
289,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAIRS,"If the honourable and learned member will permit me to know one little thing-and that of a negative character- I would say that they are not largely engaged in the manufacture of painters brushware. They produce plenty 1 other articles which it suits them to very much better. There is absolutely nothing in the statement that the prowhen posed duty is required in the interests of the blind of Australia. But even if such action were of material consequence to that afflicted class I still hold, that painters should not be singled out for special taxation, even in so good a cause. If we must give consideration to the blind, let the tax be distributed over the whole of the industrial enterprises of the country. do not know why the Senate allowed this duty to remain even at 20 per cent. I think that their request, to impose that rate upon the tools of trade of the painters should be scouted. The other Chamber ought to have trade, endeavoured to place these articles upon the trades :free list. There is absolutely no reason why the painter should be subjected to special taxation as compared with other artisans, and, for that reason, the least we can do is to agree to the moderate request of the other Chamber.  trust that the Government will accede to £\ the request of the Senate. A few minutes ago the Minister for Trade and Customs interjected that the proposed duty did amount to the whole of the 3s. 6d. which charged for the class of brushware required by painters. Prom his manner one would think that a brush would last a painter for a long time. I venture to say that if the Minister were engaged in casual he would complain very bitterly of the present duty. I would further remind the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that he does not know all the working men in the world. Quite a number of painters in South Australia have complained to me of this very heavy dnty. A painter's brush has a very short life, and very often he has to purchase two or three in a month. Moreover the work of these men' is intermittent, dangerous, and unhealthy. Indeed, there is no body of tradesmen which, has to submit to more year, broken time than have the painters. The action of the Government in refusing to accept a reduction in this duty is simply monstrous. The least they could do is approve of the request of the Senate. "" Mr SYDNEY SMITH (Macquarie) A - few minutes ago the honourable membrushware ber for Melbourne Ports stated that painters had made no protest against 42 u 2 of the imposition of this duty. I rememmake ber having brought this matter before the committee upon a previous occasion, the Government deliberately promised me that they would grant a recommittal. But-throug h a misunderstanding, I admit - the promise was not kept, and so we were the not able to discuss the question again. Some time ago a deputation of painters waited upon me in the precincts of this Chamber, and after they had submitted a sample of brushes I asked them to set forth in a letter I the information which they had conveyed to me. I received a letter in these termsWe, the Master Painters' Guild of Viotoria, respectfully submit to your uotice the following list of brushware, which are our everyday tools of and which we contend should be free from duty to place us on a similar footing to other Ground brushes, 6""and 8 ounces. Sash tools, Nos. 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Distemper, 2 tie 8, 10, 12 ounces. Copper bound distemper, 8, 10, 12 ounces,.. '.Kalsomine brushes, Nos. S, 7, and 0. Paperhanging brushes, 8, .10 and .12 inches. Varnish brushes, 4 and 6"" ounces. A painter uses brushware to the value of £7 per year. The duty on this at present amounts to 16s. 9d., showing the disadvantages we labour under compared with other trades. The tools of ' trade in the hat industry, not which has the advantage of a heavy prois tective duty, have been made free. The tools of trade in nearly every protected industrjr in Victoria, like their machineiy, have been, placed on the free list. But in the case of painter's brushes the annual tax per head painting amounts to £ 1 16s. 9d.",57
290,Mr KINGSTON,PAIRS,"How do they make out that a duty of 25 per cent, on £ 7 worth of brushes per annum comes to £ 1 16s. 9d?",58
291,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,PAIRS,"It ill becomes the Minister to take exception to a difference of ls. 9d. in a statement of this kind by a gentleman who possibly may not be sowell up in figures as he is. The writer goes on to sayPainter's brushware to about the value of £5,000 was imported to this State during lastnotwithstanding these high rates. This in sufficient proof of the necessity of having these brushes made free. To do a-first-classjob we must have these imported brushes at any cost. The letter is signed, on behalf of the to Master Painters' Guild, by Mr J. MCDougall as president. The Minister has admitted that the duty on a painter's would amount to nearly £ 1 16s. the 9d. per annum. Why should the painters' - tools of trade be taxed when the tools of trade of the protected industries of Victoria are allowed to come in free ?",58
292,Mr MAUGER,PAIRS,That is not correct.,59
293,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,PAIRS,"The honourable member knows that in the boot making industry, which is heavily protected, in some cases to the extent of 100 per cent., all tools of trade are allowed to come in free. Mr MAU G KR-That is not correct.",59
294,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,PAIRS,"All the tools of trade which the honourable member could think of were placed on the free l i if any have been omitted, it is a wonder that he has not asked that they should be included. Nearly all the tools of trade which are required by the protected induslines, tries of Victoria in the shape of machinery are free",59
295,Mr MAUGER,PAIRS,Not nearly all.,59
296,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,PAIRS,"Sevent y or per cent, of them are free. When we asked for a concession to our great primary ducers-the miners and the agriculturistsi the honourable member said "" No,"" and now, when we ask for a concession to the workpaint ing painters, who use these brushes, we are met with a refusal.",59
297,Mr MAUGER,PAIRS,Workin g painters do not want them.,59
298,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,PAIRS,"If painters are - called upon to do any work, the necessary brushes here, they must get them where, they can. The writer of letter says that the brushware which - quired to do first-class work cannot - chased in Victoria, and the proof that i - cannot be obtained here is found in the that painters' brushware to about the - of £5,000 was imported into Victoria last year. It is not the workers of New Wales, but the workers of Victoria, who have .asked me to propose that painters' brushware be placed on the free list. I have placed their representations before the committee, because I believe that a gross injustice is being done to a large body of deserving men.",59
299,Sir GEORGE TURNER,PAIRS,"Thehonorabl e use. member for Macquarie has told us that used. there has been a large importation of brushes into Victoria, but if he knew anything the Victorian Tariff he would know that follows :brushwarp was a very large item, including iin immense number of brushes altogether dissimilar from thosewhichhehas mentioned, and even the writer of the letter he read only specified a very few articles which thinks ought to be free, or, if not free, character: not dutiable at u heavy rate. The honourable member has also made a great song about a number of articles which are used in various trades having' been made free. He forgets that we have made the others free, because they are not being manufactured here. Mr SYDNEY SMIT.IT - Thes e brushes are not being made here.",59
300,Sir GEORGE TURNER,PAIRS,"The honourable member asks why we should impose revenue duties on articles which are the s t; and tools of trade of our workmen, and he would lead us to believe that we cannot make painters' brushes. If he had suggested a reduction in regard to two or three I could have understood his attitude, but his proposal is that the reduction should apply to every line. Painters' brushes are used very largely by the MelSO bourne Tramway and Omnibus Company, and a certificate has been given to a Vicprotorian manufacturing firm by the assistant manager, in which he savsI am pleased to be able to assure you that the brushes we obtained from your good selves, and which we have been using now continuously for u good many years are, in our opinion, of excellent material and workmanship.

They are, for the great majority of works, quite equal to the imported brushes which I formerly used, and a better brush could not be desired.",59
301,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,PAIRS,They do that tliey are quite equal to the imported brushes for all purposes.,60
302,Sir GEORGE TURNER,PAIRS,"Messrs.Delve s and Co., of Ballarat, have given this firm a certificate of the same kind, whilst similar letters have been received from a number of other persons whose names are given in the Hansard report of the debate in another place in which these letters were quoted. Messrs Groth and Co., of Sydney, who will probably be known to honourable members from New South Wales, have given large orders for paint brushes to be manufactured here, and Messrs Gilkes, Masse}', and Co., of 262 George-street, who are apparently well known in Sydney, sent the following letter to a Victorian firm:Please forward us twelve dozen 5-in. tin whitewash brushes, as last (branded "" Tudor""). They appear to think that the name ""Tudor "" is a very good one, and that it enables them to sell their brushes. Whether they are sold as being of colonial or German make I cannot say. What do the workers say in regard to this duty ? The secretary of the Painters, Paperhangers, and Decorators Society of Melbourne, writes as follows :I am instructed, by resolution of my society, to inform you that, as practical users of colonial paint brushes for many years, we are quite satisfied with them, as we consider them equal to the imported article. We tlierefore hope that you will be successful in your endeavour to retain the reasonable measure of protection passed by the House of Representatives. The Secretary of the Victorian Coachmakers' Society, whose members have to do very fine work, wrote as follows to a Victorian firm :I am instructed to inform you that my society, ut its meeting ori the fith February, carried the following resolution :- "" That we approve of the Government proposal of 25 per cent, on brushware, as it will protect au industry in which .the articles manufactured locally are giving general satisfaction, both as to quality and price."" Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN. - That pro quo.",60
303,Sir GEORGE TURNER,PAIRS,"All these commembers munications were quoted in another place. They show very clearly that the Victorianmade article is a first-class one; but simply, because ofone or two particular brushes, in regard to which some one has written to my honourable friend, we are asked to reduce the rate for the whole line. It is peculiar that although the ranks of the Opposition contain three or four honourable not saymembers from Victoria who hold free-trade views, not one of them was asked to bring this inatterbefore the committee. The request was made to an honourable member from New South Wales. Of course honourable members from that State have a perfect right to bring the question forward, and I do not object. It is clear that those who sell brushes in New South Wales are very anxious to obtain the Victorian-made article, and that the manufacturer's name should not appeal' upon it . This is a case in which we should afford a reasonable amount of protection. T spoke veiy briefly when introducing this request, and I should not have risen again but for the remarks made by the honourable member for Macquarie. The honourable member .made so much of the matter that I felt that in the interests of those engaged in the industry I should place these facts before the committee.",60
304,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PAIRS,A r e the Sydney orders of recent date ?,60
305,Sir GEORGE TURNER,PAIRS,Yes. The Victorian manufacturers are receiving so many orders from' Sydney that their men are compelled to work overtime in order to keep up with the demand ,60
306,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,PAIRS,I thought these brushes were made by the blind.,60
307,Sir GEORGE TURNER,PAIRS,"I do nof know that they make paint brushes, but they make other kinds, and I see no reason why we should not give a reasonable amount of protection. I fail to see that a duty of 25 per cent, is unreasonable, and in the circumstances I hope that the committee will stand by their previous determination. Mr G. B. EDAVARDS (South Sydney). - All that the Treasurer has said does not do away with the fact that it is proposed to inflict a glaring injustice upon one class. Seven columns of the names of tools of trade of various manufacturers and workis a quid men appear on the list of special exemptions, and, on examining them closely, honourable will see that the painting trade is the only one which has been omitted. As we have exempted every other tool of trade used in the Commonwealth, it is idle for the Treasurer or the Minister for Trade and Customs to tell us that the fact that these brushes are made here is a warranty for imposing a duty upon them. There should be no distinction made if we are going to deal justly, and as the request involves only a inatter of 5 per cent., it seems to me that the Government are adopting an extraordinary position in fighting for the retention of the duty in the interests of a few brushmakers, as compared with the whole of the people engaged in the painting industry. If , as they say, the brush-making industry is so successful that those engaged in it are compelled to work night and day in order to keep up with the demand, surely a difference of 5'per cent, cannot ruin those engaged in it ? Although the honourable member for Melbourne Ports-wh o sometimes stands here as the representative of, and pleader for, the bone and sinew of the country-say s he represents the painters, I tell him that he does not. Painters in other States have told me that they feel this duty. If any one tells me that a painter does not think it unjust that his tools of trade should be taxed to the extent of 20 per cent., while those used by other workmen, including even those of the plasterers--whos e tools are small-ar e allowed to come in scot-free, he cannot know anything about human nature. There is not a single point of justice in the Government proposal. It will not stand, and I ;am surprised to see men in responsible positions pleading for this signal injustice to an important craft. T t has been said that the committee has only been approached in regard to this question by the master painters. Who approached this committee with regard to the 101 duties that have been placed on the Tariff? Who approached the committee with regard to boots ? Who approached the committee in regard to caps and hats'?",60
308,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,The honourable member is out of order in referring to those matters.,61
309,Mr GB EDWARDS,PAIRS,"My excuse for being out of order, Mr Chairman, is that you allowed a dozen honourable members who spoke before me to be out of order.",61
310,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"The honourable member is in error in making any such statement. I have asked every honourable memberto keep to the question before the Chair, and I now ask the honourable member for South Sydney to do so.",61
311,Mr GB EDWARDS,PAIRS,"You may have asked them to do so, but they have not done it, and I am only replying to statements made by honourable members who have not kept to the motion before the Chair. You, sir, know as well as I do that there is no member of the committee more amenable to remarks from the Chair than I am, and I say the discussion has wandered away from the question before. I shall only say now that it seems to me to be an extraordinary thing that this proposal should be made in the interest of what must be a twopennyhalfpenny industry. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports shakes his head, but I can refer him to an industry in connection with which £2,000,000 worth of stuff has gone in and come out of a factory in a year, and yet all these industries are taxed right through for the purpose of supporting these twopenny-halfpenny industries in Victoria. Why should we tax the whole country to uphold one or two factories here? We are told that the brushmakers here are working night and day to execute their orders, and under the circumstances this proposal is only a greasing of the fatted sow. I say this is a scandal and an injustice, and I protest against such a signal injustice as - a proposal to tax the tools of trade of one class of workmen when we have exempted those of every other class of workman, and the machine tools used in connection with every manufacture in the Commonwealth.",61
312,Mr BATCHELOR,PAIRS,"South Australia) A most extraordinary heat seems to have been generated over this difference between 20 and 25 per cent, on the small portion of brushware included in this item. I was disposed to vote with honourable members opposite, as it seemed to me rather anomalous that the tools of trade of painters and paperhangers should alone be taxed to the extent of 25 per cent., but after hearing the resolutions that have been carried by the Painters' Society, by the workmen and master painters - as-well, I am inclined to alter my opinion.",61
313,Mr SPENCE,PAIRS,They were only praising ; the brushes manufactured here.,61
314,Mr BATCHELOR,PAIRS,"The honourable member is quite mistaken. I listened attentively to what was said, and the resolution quoted not only praised the locallymade brushes, but also requested that the duty on brushware should not be lowered. We find that the coach painters are also doing the same thing. I suppose reason is that they believe that the effect the duty will enable them to get good material made within the State in which they live; and they consider, as I do, that that will be for the benefit of the comtrue. munity generally. Under these circumstances, I am not prepared to go against wishes of the men engaged in the inwhen dustry.",61
315,Mr CONROY,PAIRS," A duty of 25 per cent, is a charge of 5s. in the and we have now a statement from the Treasurer that so far as the painters are concerned they must pay this 5s. in the on their tools of trade, because in his another firm. opinion is. in the £ 1 , the duty which the Senate requests us tofix,is too low a Surely that is a statement which the painters throughout Australia ought to take notice of ? It shows how little the interests of that class are considered by the Government. to The Government propose to take 5s. in the £ 1 from men like these in order that they hand it over to some syndicate in connection with something else which they possibly favours. I suppose that next week we shall know how much is to be taken from the people to hand over to a particular syndiby cate. There is no use in addressing, reasonknow able arguments to persons who are without knowledge, and who are unable to undercome stand arguments founded upon reason. The fact that there is a science of political duties. economy is, apparently, unknown to honourable members on the other side. The Minister for Trade and Customs could not think of allowing liquid fuel to be admitted free because it would interfere with the mines. The right honourable gentleman, he could, would stop the sun shining that tions. there might be perpetual winter,- and that employment might be given to men in getto do so. ting coal out of mines. All this shows the curse of having had a legal Ministry at head of affairs in dealing with the Tariff. is the worse thing that could happen to any community.",62

317,Mr CONROY,PAIRS,"I am pointing out it is a great misfortune that in connection with this Tariff Ministers should set themtlie selves up here as advertisers for a particular firm or firms they know.

329,Mr BROWN,PAIRS," I gathered from the remarks of the Treasurer that the manufacture of brushes has reached such a stage of perfection in Victoria that the local manufacturers are able not only to supply local requirements but also to supply to a considerable extent the requirements of the whole of the Commonwealth. Though the manufacture of brushware been brought to such perfection here there is still a considerable importation into Victoria. I find that for the eight months dealt with in the return submitted by the Treasurer, the revenue derived in Victoria from these duties amounted to no less than £4,328. Possibly that revenue is derived from the class of brushes which the Senate wish to have exempted from duty.",63
330,Sir GEORGE TURNER,PAIRS,"No ; a different class of brushes altogether; hair-brushes, tooth-brushes, and brushes that are not made here.",63
331,Mr BROWN,PAIRS,"I can quite understand that whitewash brushes and other rough brushes could be readily made in all the States, but there may be considerable difficulty in the manufacture of the finer class of brushes, .and upon these a more reasonable duty, such as that requested by the Senate, might be imposed. New South Wales has not previously had the benefit of a protective Tariff, and, according to the theory of the protectionists, the brush-making industry cannot have been developed to any great extent in that State. AVe might expect, therefore, that the importations into New South Wales would be very much greater than the importations into Victoria; but that is not the case. Although the Tariff in this respect is designed for purposes of protection, it produces a considerable amount of revenue, and, according to the return to which I have already referred, the revenue from the whole of the Commonwealth under this item amounts to £15,937. Naturally, those who have to pay the duty are desirous of some relief, and I am not prepared to say that it falls most heavily upon ordinary painters ; but the return shows that a large importation is taking place,' despite the dimensions and perfections of the brush-making industry in going A^ictoria. Prom the evidence adduced I am disposed to support the requested amendment.",63
332,Mr DEAKIN,PAIRS,"I beg to submit that the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Parramatta is not in order. What we are/authorized by the Constitution to do is to make any of the omissions or amendments requested, with or without modification. AVhat is the principle underlying the honourable member's amendment? If it be competent for us to ignore what we ourselves have done, and what the other Chamber has done in this Bill, by reducing a has duty without any limitations, it must also be competent for us to ignore it . by increasing a duty to any extent. For instance, we sent up a proposal to fix this duty at 25 per cent. The Senate requests that an amendment be made reducing the duty to 20 per cent. According to the interpretation of the section in the Constitution involved in the amendment now proposed, we should be able to say-""AV e shall rebuff you by making it 30 per cent, or 35 per cent, instead of 25 per cent."" I think that illustration puts the position as well as any argument I could use. 'What the Constitution means is, simply, that this House may, if it thinks fit, make any of such omissions or amendments with or without modification. In this instance, the Senate have requested us to amend an item by reducing the duty from 25 to 20 per cent. AVe may make that amendment or we may make it with any modification, by reducing the duty to any rate between 25 and 20 per cent. But it is only within those limits that we can act. We are estopped from increasing the duty by our own original proposal, and from decreasing it by the request of the Senate. Tf we went beyond those bounds we should not be making the requested amendment with a modification ; we should be ignoring the Senate's request, and making an altogether new proposal. If the contention of the honourable member were correct, we should have this extraordinary position : that whereas, if the Senate exercised the right which it has in regard to certain kinds of legislation to make amendments, we should, in dealing with the measure afterwards, be confined to the scope of those amendments, where the Senate, having no right of amendment, but simply a right to make requests, we should be allowed to substitute altogether new proposals. The object of the .procedure in which we are now engaged is to enable the two Chambers to draw nearer together ; but if the interpretation of the honourable member were adopted, it might be a means of pushing them further apart. I venture to submit that the honourable member's proposal is not an amendment with a modification, but something which, going behind the former decisions of the House of Representatives and beyond the request of the Senate, it is not competent for us to consider.",63
333,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,PAIRS,"I think it would be well for the honourable member to withdraw the amendment. To my mind the contention of the Attorney-General is a perfectly sound one. If the case were otherwise, it would be possible, in dealing with the requests of the Senate, up anew the whole of the questions dealt with by the items to which they refer.",64
334,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAIRS,"The Attorney-Genequested ral has put only one part of the case. I divided. take it that the section of the Constitution means that we may treat the Senate's requests as a whole, if we choose, instead of dealing with them individually, as in the present instance. Suppose the Senate requested the reduction of the duty upon certain articles, and wished to have the duty upon other articles intimately lated with them increased, surely it would Crouch, R. A. be permissible for the House to deal with Deakin, A. the two requests together, and to harmonize Fysh, Sir P. O. the Tariff accordingly ?",64
335,Mr DEAKIN,PAIRS,"I a l m it that it may be Kennedy, T. necessary to consider the bearing of one Kingston, C. C. item upon another, but contend that the case put by the honourable member does not affect my position, which is, that if the Senate requests a reduction, we can agree to that reduction or offer a smaller reduction, or stand by our original decision, but cannot increase the duty. To make an entirely new proposal is not to make an amendment with a modification.",64
336,Sir JOHN QUICK,PAIRS,"I think that the position of the Attorney-General is unanswerable, and that our action is confined between the previous determination of this House and the request of the Senate. We cannot increase the duty to which we have agreed, and we cannot decrease it below the rate suggested by the Senate. The honourable member's proposal is not a modification of the Senate's request; it is a new proposal.",64
337,Mr MCCAY,PAIRS,"The actual wording of the Constitution isThe House of .Representatives may, if it thinks fit, make any of such omissions or amendments with or without modification. We are, therefore, specifically limited to the consideration of each request as it stands alone, and the contention of the honourable member for Parramatta that we are at liberty to deal with the requests as a whole, with a view to harmonizing the Tariff, is not sustained by the Constitution. The Attorney-General's position, that our action is confined between the rate of duty originally proposed ancl that requested by the Senate, is I think, correct.",64

339,Mr BATCHELOR,PAIRS,"South Australia) As a matter of personal explanation I desire to say that I had intended to vote on the other side, but neglected to cross the floor of the chamber in time. Item 132. Brushware, viz. . . n.e.i., ad valorem., 26 per cent. Request - That the duty be reduced to. 20 per cent.

340,Sir GEORGE TURNER,PAIRS,"I m o v e That the amendment requested be not made.

Motion (by Sir GEORGE TURNER) agreed That the amendment requested be made. Item 136. Explosives, viz. . . - Powder , sporting, free. Request - That the article be made dutiable at 10 per cent.",65
342,Sir GEORGE TURNER,PAIRS,"This is a proposal to make dutiable an article' which the committee declared should be admitted free. I , therefore, move That the amendment requested be not made. Motion agreed to. Item 137. Photographic dry plates, sensitized films and paper, ad valorem, 15 per cent. Request - That "" sensitized films and paper"" be added to the special exemptions.",65
343,Sir GEORGE TURNER,PAIRS,"I m o v e That the amendment requested be not made. A considerable sum of money has been expended in securing the necessary machinery for making sensitized films and paper within the Commonwealth. It is the desire of a large number of photographers who use these materials that they should be made within the Commonwealth, because they are thus enabled to procure it fresh and of good quality. They consider that the com. . modities should be made here, and that they should be dutiable. Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN (Melbourne) - If this motion is put.to the vote I shall have to support the Government, although when the matter was previously before the committee, I advocated the free admission of these 'articles. I was then acting undera misapprehension, and, instead of advocating the free admission of sensitized films, I should have sought to exempt from duty albumenized paper, which I believe is sensitized here. I believe that we should inflict .great injury upon an industry in which a large sum of money has been invested if we acceded to the request of the Senate. Motion agreed to. Item 137. Special exemptions. Request - That prepared plates for engravers and lithographers be added to the special tions. Motion (by Sir GEORGE TURNER) toThat the amendment requested be made. Miscellaneous - Specia l exemptions - Article imported by and for the official Governor General or States Governors. Request - That the special .exemption be omitted.",65
344,Sir GEORGE TURNER,PAIRS,"I m o v e That the amendment requested be not made. The general practice has been to permit of the free introduction of articles for official use, and I think it would be unwise for us to depart from the custom that has been followed for many years. Mr G. B. ED WARDS (South Sydney). - For some years past there has been a growing disposition on the part of the States Governments to keep correct books of account between the various departments, and that is all that is required in conthis nexion - with the matter under consideration. It seems to me that it would be wise to end. charge duty upon all goods imported for the official use of the Governor General or the States Governors, and, if necessary, crease their salaries to a corresponding degree. I am quite in accord with the quest of the Senate, and fail necessity for exempting these articles from duty. Motion agreed to. Miscellaneous -'Specia l exemptions - Scientifi c instruments and apparatus imported by and for use in universities, colleges, or public hospitals.

Miscellaneous - Specia l exemptions - Surgica l and dental instruments and appliances (not being furniture), viz., amputating, cupping, dissecting, examining, ear, eye, mouth, nose, throat, midwifery, also operating, veterinary. Request - That the word "" optical"" be inserted after the word ""surgical.""",66
345,Sir GEORGE TURNER,PAIRS,"I move That the amendment requested be not made. I would point out to the committee that uncier the Tariff in its present form surgical instruments for dealing with the eye are exempt from duty. The Senate has requested that we should insert the word "" optical, ""which, however, might be held to include eye-glasses, spectacles, and a variety of articles which we do not desire to adexempmit free. I think that the wording of the exemption in its present form is ample agreed to cover all that is required. Motion agreed to. Request - That in regard to all items consisting s of more than one division, each subdivision shall use of the be lettered alphabetically.",66
346,Sir GEORGE TURNER,PAIRS,"I am glad to say that the Government are thoroughly in accord with the last request of the Senate, and I therefore move That the amendment requested be made. Motion agreed to.",66
347,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,PAIRS," I think that we may congratulate ourselves upon now liaving completed our consideration of the Tariff. Whether we can congratulate ourselves upon the work that has been done, or look to future results of that work without some amount of trepidation, I do not know. At any rate, so far as honourable members upon side of the Chamber are concerned, they are very glad that their labours are at an",66
348,Mr KINGSTON,PAIRS,"I can assure honourable members opposite that we share in the to insentiments which have been expressed by the acting leader of the Opposition, and I retrust that the work performed will be for to see any the good of all. I move That the date of any of these amendments shall be the date of its being made in the Bill by the House of Representatives. Motion agreed to. Resolutions reported. ADJOURNMENT. THE "" DRAYTON GRANGE "" COMMISSION RECRUITING INMILITARY FORCES-CUS TOMS ADMINISTRATION. Motion (by Mr DEAKIN) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",66
349,Mr CONROY,PAIRS," I notice that today the Executive Council appointed a commission to inquire into the accuracy of the statements which have been made rewarding the condition of the transport Drayton Grange. AVhilst I was perfectly willing that such a commission should be appointed, I regret to leam that it consists of Members of this Parliament. I do not object to its personnel, but I do think that it is not a good thing for us to initiate the practice of constituting commissions from amongst politicians. There is a clanger that in future it may be regarded as a precedent, ancl that the party in power may use it to make purely political appointments. We do not desire anything of that sort. Of course, all Australia is interested in the present inquiry, and I think therefore, it would have been wise to appoint men who were more in the nature of judges, and who would be free from any suspicion of political bias. I admit that in this case no such suspicion can arise, as the members constituting the board of inquiry have been selected from all sides of the Parliament. I merely wish to protest against commissions being appointed from ainonget politicians unless they are called upon to deal absolutely with n political question, and we must not forget that perhaps the administration of the Defence department may be called in question.",66
350,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAIRS," I wish to draw the attention of the Acting Prime Minister to the fact that I recently addressed two letters to the Minister for Trade and Customs, of which I have received no acknowledgment. This practice of leaving communications unanswered is not peculiar to the Customs department; it applies to some other departments. I trust, therefore, that the Acting Prime Minister will take steps to remedy it. It would not hurt the departments to acknowledge communications which are forwarded to them. I am aware that in some of them printed forms are kept for acknowledging the receipt of correspondence, so that the services of. a boy only are required to address the envelopes. But when honourable members do not know where their communications have gone, they are naturally led to believe that the department is not conducted upon business lines.",67
351,Mr MCCAY,PAIRS," I am sorry that the Acting Minister for Defence is absent, but perhaps the Attorney-General will be good enough to take a mental note of my complaint. In the forces of the Commonwealth for some months past the maintenance of the strength of the various corps has been prevented by the issue of an order, at the instance of the Government, which prohibits them from recruiting. I think that no one will question the aecuracy of my surmise when I say that no essential changes in the organization of the forces are likely to occur during the present year, and if the practice of prohibiting the maintenance of the existing strength of the various units be continued for a few months longer, the forces will get into such a depleted condition that at a later stage practically double work will be involved in their reorganization. On a previous occasion, I brought this matter before the House, and the Minister directed that the practice of recruiting should be permitted. But on the very day of his departure from the Commonwealth, the Government issued instructions that the system should be discontinued, and with most ludicrous results. This is a matter of considerable gravity. If the Govermnent do not wish io cripple the forces of the Commonwealth for several years, they will remove the embargo of which I complain. I am quite satisfied that the military authorities cannot have advised the Government to continue that embargo, and if it is continued they will have the satisfaction of knowing that they are seriously interfering with the efficiency of the forces in every part of the Commonwealth. It is a question of starving the maintenance allowance of the forces, and if any money is saved it is saved in an illegitimate way. The removal of the embargo does not involve the passing of the amount for expenditure in the coming year. But it does involve the maintenance of proper efficiency in the troops. I happen to know that more than oue commanding oflicer has said officially that he will not be responsible for the continued efliciency of his corps, unless he is allowed to recoup the inevitable drainage of the men away from his command. The policy has been to keep men passing through the ranks. To have men going out ancl none coining in is most ridiculous, and I cannot understand how the Government permit it to continue.",67
352,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,PAIRS,"Macquarie) I understand that it is the intention of the Government tomorrow merely to propose the second reading of the Post and Telegraph Rates Bill, and then to ask the House to adjourn. I have brought several matters under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs, and I shall be glad if he can acquaint me with the departmental decisions before I leave Melbourne tomorrow. In one case some delay is alleged to have taken place in the settlement of a dispute with regard to some tanners' machinery. Inanother case, Messrs. Vale and Son, of Auburn, near Sydney, have been trying to obtain a decision from the department with regard to certain goods alleged to be dutiable. Like others in the trade, they are anxious to ascertain whether the goods are dutiable or not in order that they may be able to act in a business-like way. The Minister knows that whenever a dispute arises in regard to certain items in the Tariff it is impossible to do any business, because, until it is known whether the goods are dutiable, a price cannot be fixed. While a disputed matter is unsettled it causes considerable trouble and inconvenience to the firms who are concerned. I shall be very glad if the Minister can give me some information about the two cases I have mentioned. Mr G. B. EDWAR DS (South Sydney). - It would require some hours to discuss the many difficulties which have arisen since the Tariff was introduced; but, amongst others, I might instance the fact that we cannot get any settlement of the question of the drawbacks on sugar. I have brought it before the Minister several times, both privately and publicly, but we cannot get a decision. Apart from that matter, I hear of all kinds of difficulties which are experienced by commercial men. The other day, I was told by a gentleman, who was perfectly prepared to pay any duty which might be demanded undeithe law, that he had to submit to his goods being put into a bond, at his expense for cartage and rent, pending the ability of the department to pass the entry which he presented in Sydney. It really calls for an inquiry by the Minister. It is a disability which ought not to be allowed to exist. It is imposing extra taxation on the traders of the community. I desire to ascertain from the Acting Prime Minister how far the Government have secured the co-operation of the Imperial authorities in the proposed inquiry concerning the treatment of the troops on the Drayton Grctnr/e. When I first heard of the episode, it seemed to me that we had no real effective power of holding an inquiry, and that the Imperial authorities ought to be represented on the Royal commission, otherwise the inquiry might end in. smoke. I do not quite agree with the strictures of the honourable and learned member for Werriwa that the appointments - politica l appointments as he called them - ar e ill-advised.",67
353,Mr CONROY,PAIRS,I said that with personnel of the Royal commission I did quarrel.,68
354,Mr GB EDWARDS,PAIRS,"The Government have picked out two honourable members in whose report the House will have the utmost confidence. Probably they are the two best men who could have been selected for the purpose from both sides of the Chamber. I do not believe that auy injuiy is likely to result from the selection of members of the House to make an inquiry of this sort. I think that they are well qualified and able to conduct an inquiry, and, providing that the Ministry show the tact and discretion which have been displayed in selecting from each side an honourable member who has the confidence of the whole House, we need not fear the result of the inquiry which is demanded.",68
355,Mr COXROY,PAIRS,Supposing we have to attack the Defence department on account of their report 1,68
356,Mr GB EDWARDS,PAIRS,"I do not think we shall, because both sides are well represented. But I consider it is important to secure the co-operation of the Imperial authorities. The men were under the I m perial Army Act and regulations up to the point at which they were discharged, and, if we do not secure the co-operation of the Imperial authorities, the inquiry is likely to end in a fiasco. That we should endeavour to avoid, because, undoubtedly, there seems to have been grave mismanagement or maladministration.",68
357,Mr KINGSTO N,PAIRS, Honor able members are no doubt aware that there is a very considerable strain on the Customs department.,68
358,Mr GB EDWARDS,PAIRS,It has existed for some time.,68
359,Mr KINGSTON,PAIRS,"No doubt; but it will disappear shortly, owing to the completion of our labours in connection with the Tariff. Apart from the difficult work ih connection with the initiation of one uniform system for six different States, the fact that the House has been in session for over a year has prevented that Ministerial attention being given to departmental matters, without great difficulty, which ordinarily could be given with ease. No doubt there has been a great strain upon the officers. Last Friday, for example, I was without the services of both the Comptroller-General and the Collector of Custhe toms in Victoria. Mr Stephens was not able to return last Monday to his work; but I regret to say that the Comptroller General, Dr Wollaston, will probably have to apply for leave-which , of course, if applied for will be granted-and that a prolonged absence on his part may be necessary. I do not think that any effort is being spared by the ofBcers to copewith the exceptional circumstances. As to the complaint made by the honourable member for Parramatta that certain letters have not been replied to, all that I have to say is that I took those letters as appertaining more particularly to myself. I thought that it would be considered better if the matter were attended to ancl the complaint remedied rather than that the honourable meinber should be troubled with a formal acknowledgment?",68
360,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAIRS,The complaint relates not only to the department of Trade and Customs.,69
361,Mr KINGSTON,PAIRS,"In view of the relations which exist between Ministers and other honourable members, I did not consider that honourable members were likely to make a point of the matter to which the honourable member for Parramatta has referred, if attention were paid to their requests. As to the matter to which the honourable member for Macquarie called my attention, and which was referred to by the honourable member for Parramatta last Thursday-in regard to a question affecting the Custom-office- I have only to say that it was put right before midday on Friday. Unfortunately, I did not have an opportunity of informing them that their wishes had been complied with, before they left for Sydney on Friday, but no doubt they are perfectly satisfied that what they required has been clone. Every attention is also being paid to the other questions. As to what has fallen from the honourable member for South Sydney, I really believe that he is mistaken in saying that owing to the plethora of work at the Customs department certain goods were put into bond, instead of the entries being accepted at once. honourable member will let me have for my official information all the facts relating to the complaint, it will be looked into. I am very sanguine that the authorities in New South Wales would not' have permitted anything of the sort, although I have no doubt that a report setting out the particulars stated by the honourable member was made to him. I venture to say that when the true facts are placed before him, they will be shown to bear a very different complexion. I have no doubt that if such a thing had taken place, it would have been reported to head-quarters. Mr G. 13. EDWARDS - I am assured by a personal friend of the truth, of the statement.",69
362,Mr KINGSTON,PAIRS,"We shall look into the inatter, and I hope that when it is explained the honourable member will find cause to withdraw the charge he has made against the Customs authorities. Instructions have been issued that in all cases of disputes as to duty, a deposit of the duty shall be accepted, and that the owners of the goods shall be allowed to have them. The question of drawbacks is a very troublesome one, and we have been compelled to consider it very carefully. I have come to the conclusion-and I am supported by the result of official analyses-that in some cases the State has been got at. I allude especially to a case in Tasmania, in - winch an official analysis disclosed that while we were allowing drawback at the rate of 50 per cent, on sugar, the quantity of sugar contained in the jam was really not more than 36 per cent.",69
363,Mr GB EDWARDS,PAIRS,The Government can guard against that.,69
364,Mr KINGSTON,PAIRS,"We have first to ascertain the facts, and we propose to guard against such a thing., When we looked into the question again, the analyst reported that better results had been obtained from a different sample which had been submitted to him. I am sure I have the honourable member's sympathy in my desire to protect the revenue.",69
365,Mr GB EDWARDS,PAIRS,The right honourable gentleman has; but I have not his sympathy.,69
366,Mr KINGSTON,PAIRS,I tliink we shall be able to arrange the matter.,69
367,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PAIRS,Will the Government give them interest?,69
368,Mr KINGSTON,PAIRS,"We will give them. If the- everything to which they are entitled. I think we shall be. able to arrange so that proper drawback, will be allowed while the revenue of the Commonwealth will be protected.",69
369,Mr DEAKIN,PAIRS," In regard to the question of commissions, I have only to say that as their objects differ immensely, their character should also differ. The case to which reference has been made is one in which it - appeared to the Government that the kind of elements we combined by appointing some honourable. members, as well as professional men, who haye been chosen to constitute the commission, was ' the best that could be obtained. I admit that in some cases it would be desirable to have a commission consisting of men removed entirely from military or political influence.",69
370,Mr CONROY,PAIRS,Supposing the department is proved to be at fault t,70
371,Mr DIS AKIN,PAIRS,"In that case the department will receive an exposure as thorough as is required. The matter of recruiting to which attention has been called is very important. Inquiries will be made to discover the reason for the course adopted, which I feel sure was taken on the advice of the general officer commanding. W it h regard to the Imperial commission, of course there would .heevery desire to obtain the very valuable assistance which such U commission could render, but we must first deal without loss of time with the Australian incidents-the accident that happened at Albany, and in the case of the Norfolk, that which occurred at Adelaide. These, perhaps, were the main causesof the loss of several lives. We do not need any Imperial commission to deal with them, but there may be other questions upon which the findings of an Imperial commission would. be very valuable, i Question so resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.47 p.m. Defence",70
