2,Mr WALKER,Unknown,"--I That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work w-s referred to the Parliamentary Standing CommIttee on Public Works and on which the tee has duly reported to Parliament: Refurbishment of the Australian Embassy, Washington. This proposal was referred to the Parliaand mentary Standing Committee on Public Works on 29 June 1995, and the committee reported back to this parliament. I had the pleasure recently of visiting Washington and attending at the Australian chancery which, course, is the show place for our country the United States of America. There is probyou ably no more important chancery and it is vital, for the interest of Australia, that we well presented there. It is an old is not old in the heritage sense, but it was built some time ago and I am afraid to to admit that it does not meet the high standceilings, ards that I think are required of that important building. I had long discussions at the time with Don Russell, our ambassador in Washingcutting, ton--one of the finest representatives, I add, this country has ever had to that country. He certainly has done a great deal for Australia's interests there while serving in chancery. No doubt he will be doing a great deal more for Australia's interests when he comes back to Australia. He is one of the finest representatives I have known in my long political history in Australia and I think he has done this country proud. Getting back to the motion main elements of the proposed works are: the demolition of the existing spiral staircase the construction of a new stair, and the instalYou lation of a lift from level one, which is the ground floor, to level two for public and disabled access. One of the great problems with the design of this building is that it presents very badly to the public who walk straight in the door. The ambassador was very determined to use the haIl space there, which COMMITTEES is theatrette space in the front of the building and which is very useful and very attractive. The whole effect is ruined by the existing staircase which, I might add, does not assist disabled access. So it is vital that we do move: something about this staircase. We have for some time had architects seeking an aesthetic solution to the problem which and I am very pleased to say, having had a commitlook at the plans, that such a solution has been found. At the same time, the public will be able to get access to the library facilities other facilities on the first floor. Disabled people, more importantly, will be able to get has duly access to those facilities. The second element of the proposed works is the refurbishment of the core areas. Embasof sies these days are very crowded indeed. As in you travel through the Washington embassy find a great deal of congestion, particularly in the area where military attaches are. A be lot of refurbishment is required. This will be building. It done pursuant to this motion. The third element is the complete refurbishhave ment of all seven floors, including new office petitions, carpet, lighting, power and air conditioning. Many of the decisions that were made when this embassy Dr was built were obviously based on cost because some of the ceilings, floor might space and petitioning certainly would not meet Australian building standards. It has been necessary to refurbish them-to take out that those particular ceilings and replace them with ones that meet modern building standards so that the building, for the benefit of its workers, can meet modern occupational health and safety standards. Also, I would specifically mention the building's power and air conditioning with which, apparently, there was a at hand, the lot of trouble. The next item is the instaIlation of a sprinand kler system from levels one through to seven. could not imagine a modern Australian building not having a sprinkler system for fire safety. But, unfortunately, here we have our leading embassy in the world with no proper sprinkler system, so that is being installed. There is the replacement of the perimeter induction units with a new perimeter heating system and the installation of stair pressurisation to both fire-escape stairs. Washington gets pretty hot in the summer and there is the need for an adequate air conditioning system there. This installation of pressurisation associated with the fire-escape stairs is vital to maintaining a decent air conditioning system. It is also proposed to upgrade the communications centres for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Defence. There has been some joint use of those facilities, and the conditions in which the workers in the communications sections are working are very crowded and quite unsatisfactory. This upgrade will be welcomed by them. I always feel for people in our embassies who work in communications centres. They are very claustrophobic places indeed. They are high security areas, of course, and they are not easy places to work in. The upgrading here will be very useful for those people. The next item is the provision of a modem data and communications network throughout the building, something which is vital these days; and, finally, physical security works. Embassies these days are more and more concerned-unfortunately-wi th securi ty matters, and Washington, unfortunately, is no exception. So the physical security works need to be upgraded. The interior of the chancery has not had a major refurbishment since being constructed in 1969. The building is magnificently located in Washington but the structure itself has many deficiencies. It certainly lacks that suitable fire protection and fire egress about which I was talking earlier. Major building services have reached the end of their design life and they do require replacement. The office layouts are very inefficient. The provision for current and future technology is quite inadequate, and the physical security protection is also deficient. The total estimated cost for the works at November 1994 prices is $16 million. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works is probably the hardest working committee-and I do not give them enough praise, I suspect. They put many motions through this House, causing them to work night and day. Certainly the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), their chairman... never stops working and never stops inspecting these public works and making very intelligent and creative comments about them. I think we should praise the committee here today. They have made the following conclusions in regard to this report. Firstly, there is a need for a complete refurbishment of the Australian embassy building in Washington. This is necessary to ensure protection of the Commonwealth's investment in one of Australia's more significant overseas missions and to provide accommodation for staff which meets current standards. Secondly, it has been recommended that the Overseas Property Group continue to consult staff, the community and the Public Sector Union during the refurbishment program to ensure minimal disruption and inconvenience to staff and other users of the building. This will be a staged renovation. Of course, it is very expensive to have to find alternative accommodation in Washington while these buildings are being refurbished. It will be a staged floor-by-floor sort of arrangement. It is important that the union and the staff be consulted about the disruption and the inconvenience that will necessarily occur. Thirdly, the committee recommends that the Overseas Property Group, a unit of DAS, undertake an energy audit of the Washington embassy building following 12 months occupation of the refurbished building. Each time the Public Works Committee considers a new public works these energy issues are now carefully addressed and thought through to see that the design and construction meets the world leading standards in terms of energy saving. This has occurred on this occasion. The committee also recommends the refurbishment at the $16 million figure at November 1995 prices. I note again the committee's recommendation that an energy audit for the Washington building be undertaken after 12 months of occupation. My department has agreed to undertake that review as it is part of the department's policy anyway, in Australia at least, and I think it should be part of our policy for overseas projects. The Overseas Property Group will continually consult the community and the Public Sector Union during the documentation and refurbishment. The program for the refurbishment will be undertaken over a 24-month period commencing on level seven and progressing down the building at a rate of approximately a floor every three months. The project delivery will entail calling tenders for work packages following full working documentation using a construction manager. An Australian based project manager will be posted to Washington for the duration of the works to oversee construction and to enable full-time consultation to continue between staff admission, contractors, consultants and the Overseas Property Group. I apologise to the House for spending a bit of time on this motion. It is a very important embassy and I think it is vital that it be properly discussed in this parliament. I thank the committee again for its report, and I commend the motion to the House.",11
3,Mr CONNOLLY,Unknown,"Bradfield) (9.42 a.m.)Naturally the opposition does not oppose the proposal to refurbish the Australian embassy in Washington. I recall well in my very late days in the foreign service and my very early days in parliament the transfer process between the old building and what was then the new building, which was commenced, as I recall, in 1969. In the Washington context, it was regarded as a great step forward in terms of Australian representation as well as being a very modem building at the time. However, with the passage of time, it is quite obvious that the fire protection and various other aspects of the current building are inadequate and therefore they do have to be brought up to date. The amount of $16 million, on the face of it, does seem to be a lot of money. I have not the slightest doubt that it will not come in finally at $16 million. It will probably be something well in excess of $20 million. Nevertheless, if Australia is going to have representation in what in fact is the 'New Rome', then it must be structurally adequate. I have always been somewhat critical of the fact that so much of the inner courtyard of the building, which is used for trade and other displays and so forth, is, to a very large degree, useless space or unused space for much of the time. It is fully air conditioned at no doubt considerable cost. I have always felt that the office staff who work in the embassy are working under pretty substandard conditions. Consequently, while this is an expensive project, it is one which clearly has to be undertaken in the interests of Australia's capacity to be well represented in Washington. I should take this opportunity to place on record my concern, and no doubt that of my colleagues, at the recent remarks of the outgoing ambassador to Washington, Dr Don Russell. They were of a highly political and sensitive nature and quite clearly were not appropriate for a person in his office. He should not involve himself in political controversy at home while he is still representing Australia abroad. We are in no sense unhappy at the decision to bring him back. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",13
4,Mr WALKER,Unknown,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of a new Chancery, Geneva. This proposal was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works on 13 September 1995. The committee has now duly reported back to the parliament. The main elements of the proposed work are: the construction of a three-storey purpose-built chancery and a two-storey annex for lease to the New Zealand permanent mission, the construction of a conference centre, staff and visitor car parking, associated site works, services and landscaping. The total estimated cost for the works at December 1994 prices is $22.446 million. It is proposed to call select tenders and a single contract will for the construction of the building and the fit-out works. Subject to parliamentary approval, tenders will be invited in mid-1996 with all project works expected to be completed by January 1999. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works has made certain recommendations in its report. The Australian chancery in Geneva comprises leased premises which are deficient in access, services, layout and space. This lease will expire in March 1999 and will not be renewed. There is a need for a new chancery building to be constructed for Australia's permanent missions in Geneva. The location and design of the new chancery are suitable. The concept of shared facilities with nations such as New Zealand could be extended to other projects when opportunities arise. There is an urgent need for a review of residential accommodation in Geneva. The review should examine ways in which the high recurrent expenditure for leased residential accommodation could be reduced. The review should also include an assessment of the costs and benefits associated with the acquisition or new construction of official residences and Australia based staff accommodation. The consultations with the Community and Public Sector Union should continue during the detailed design of the proposed development. The committee also recommends the construction of a new Australian chancery in Geneva at an estimated cost of $22.446 million at December 1994 prices. I commend to the House the innovative method by which this project will be financed. The new chancery will be provided using developer finance under deferred payment arrangements. Annual payments by the Commonwealth equivalent to the annual rental costs will be made to the financier over 20 years. This enables Australia to gain a valuable new asset on a budget neutral basis. We would have paid the same amount in rent, with the development finance being the responsibility of the financier. I note the committee's recommendations regarding the concept of shared facilities with be let nations such as New Zealand and the committee's view that it could be extended to other countries in future projects. I advise the House that this concept is already a matter of policy within my department. In the Overseas Property Group, opportunities for shared facilities with marker missions are thoroughly investigated for all new work proposals. My department has also taken note of the committee's recommendations to review residential accommodation in Geneva. The Overseas Property Group will investigate and report back to the PWC on this issue as soon as possible. I thank the committee for its report and I commend the motion to the House.",13
5,Mr CONNOLLY,Unknown,"Bradfield) (9.49 a.m.)I shall be mercifully brief on this point. The opposition does not oppose the proposition. Geneva is one of the most expensive cities in the world and in diplomatic terms it is one of the most active because it is through that office that much of our United Nations activity, especially with the UN agencies which are based in Switzerland, is conducted. I take up the point made by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) regarding the sharing of the facilities with other like-minded states. We are pleased that this is a government policy. I have been aware for some time that that is the case. There are obviously from time to time opportunities for Australia to develop projects in concert with countries such as Canada and New Zealand in particular, and perhaps on occasions other nations. The advantage of doing that is self evident. If it is possible, for example, to buy a free-standing building and each of one of, say, three countries is able to take an adequate allocation of space in that building, and have common services such as security and so forth provided, there are obviously advantages to everybody, and certainly significant advantages to the Australian taxpayer. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",14
6,Mr WALKER,Unknown,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of facilities for I Field Hospital, Holsworthy, NSW. The 1 Field Hospital at Holsworthy is an integrated General Reserve-Regular Army hospital which deploys to provide medical support to the army in the field during operations or training activities and recently supported the United Nations operations in Rwanda. When not deployed, the I Field Hospital will provide health care services to service personnel in the south-west Sydney region. The existing facilities at Inglebum are old and dysfunctional and there is a need for modem purpose-built facilities. The proposed site is on Defence property in close proximity to the largest concentration of support personnel. The Public Works Committee tabled its report on 24 October 1995 recommending the project at an estimated cost of $21.754 million. In its report the committee recommended that the Department of Defence advise the committee of the results of a study being undertaken of training and sporting injuries in the Australian Defence Force which require medical treatment, to which the Department of Defence provided the following response: The Department of Defence confirms that a study is in progress of training and sporting injuries in the Australian Defence Force which require medical treatment. The study has been undertaken by the Surgeon-General to the Australian Defence Force. The Committee will be advised of the results of the study. I think that is a very important development because I have personal knowledge of the injuries that occur, particularly with new recruits in the Defence Force who are put into very vigorous training programs. Leg injuries, particularly broken legs, are very common in those recruits and I am glad that the Department of Defence is looking at that particular issue. If approved, this project will commence in January 1996 with an estimated completion date of December 1997. I would like to thank the committee for its report and I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",15
7,Mr WALKER,Unknown,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Provision of living-in accommodation at HMAS Harman, ACT. This proposal involves the provision of an increase in the current living accommodation on the base for 232 personnel to a total of 428 personnel and to replace existing unsuitable and substandard accommodation for 54 personnel. Proposed accommodation will provide a level of amenity consistent with community expectations. This increase in living-in accommodation will require a corresponding increase in messing facilities and car parking, and a new gymnasium to replace current substandard facilities which are beyond their economical life and unsuitable for extension to meet additional demand. The Public Works Committee tabled its report on 24 October 1995, recommending the project at an estimated outtum cost of $18.3 million. In their report the committee also raised the usual issues. The Department of Defence has noted all of the committee's recommendations and proposes the following actions in respect of them. Firstly, the scope of the work will be extended to provide a new formal entrance to the base should sufficient funds be available within the present project budget. Secondly, the use of Harman as a triservice centre for living-in accommodation is one of a range of options currently under consideration for the provision of single accommodation for defence personnel in the Canberra area. Thirdly, Defence has initiated discussions with ACT Electricity and Water to review the possible use of grey water for irrigation of large scale landscape areas off site, such as playing fields. While large scale irrigation is outside the scope of the present project, tenderers for the present works will be encouraged to consider the reuse of waste water in developing cost effective proposals for the project. Again, the committee is very environmentally concerned, and I commend them for these constructive and innovative ideas that they have put back to departments. The next point from the committee that the department answered is that expressions of interest for the accommodation component of the project have been invited and submissions of alternatives by respondents have been encouraged. If approved, the first stage of the project is scheduled to start in January 1996 and will continue until late 1997. I would like to thank the committee for their report. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",15
8,Mr WALKER,Unknown,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Development of Ready Reserve (49th Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment and 6th Brigade Administrative Support Battalion) working accommodation, Enoggera, Qld. The ready reserve was established at government direction in 1992 to increase Australia's Defence Force capability to deploy trained personnel in shorter time scales than general reserve elements. This proposal will provide functional working accommodation for the ready reserve at Enoggera in Brisbane, replacing temporary and inappropriate accommodation and thus enhancing command and control, training and operational readiness. This requirement has been generated as a result of the introduction of a new capability for which there are not adequate facilities. The Public Works Committee tabled their report on 24 October 1995, recommending the project and an estimated out-tum cost of $21.3 million. In their report the committee also raised an issue requiring the Department of Defence to undertake as soon as possible an energy audit to assess the efficiency of the existing energy management systems at Enoggera barracks. The committee is ever vigilant about these environmental and energy saving issues. The committee further requires the Department of Defence to make available to the committee the consultant's examination of energy consumption costs for this project to which the Department of Defence has provided the following responses. The energy management system installed at GalIipoli Barracks, Enoggera, in 1990 has achieved on average a reduction in electricity charges of about $6,000 a month. During this time, there has been continual development of the barracks which has increased the electrical load accordingly. New buildings are installed with electrical equipment which is connected with the energy management system. Noting that the design for the ready reserve facilities is preliminary, energy consumption costs can be analysed during design development with a view to maximising the efficiencies. Defence will forward this report on this of the examination to the committee. The committee's vigilance is already paying off, because $6,000 for one facility multiplied around the country is a huge saving to the taxpayers of Australia, to our environment and to the greenhouse gas effect. If approved, it is anticipated that construction will commence in early 1996 and be completed late in 1997. I would like to thank the committee for its report, and I commend the motion to the House. It truly is a fine committee. Question resolved in the affirmative. Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee Report  Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee's report incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Human rights and progress towards democracy in Burma, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.  draw the attention of the House to the quotation at the beginning of the report: We give express charge that in our marches through the country there be nothing compelled from the villages, nothing taken but paid for, none of the people upbraided or abused in disdainful language; for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom, the gentler gamester is the soonest winner. That quote is from Shakespeare and is entirely appropriate. This inquiry is the result of long standing concern on the part of the Australian Parliament for the oppression of the Burmese people. This oppression manifested itself in the massacres which occurred in 1988. However, Burma's isolation has meant that, unlike the Tiananmen Square massacre, the world has only become slowly aware of the regime's brutal response to demands for democratisation. The failure to hand over power to the party which resoundingly won the election of 1990 and the arrest of over 80 of the successful candidates have outraged democracies around the world. Since then the SLORC has equivocated, procrastinated and obfuscated. It was the Burmese ambassador's justification of the regime which led the Australian Senate to refer the matter of human rights and progress towards democracy to the committee on 2 March 1994. The conclusion of this inquiry is that human rights continue to be grossly abused in Burma and there is no tangible progress towards democracy. Minimal changes have been made only in response to massive international pressure or at strategic times, just prior to a vote at the UN or an ASEAN ministerial meeting where Burma is seeking acceptance. Most changes have been superficial rather than structural, temporary rather than permanent. Aung San Suu Kyi, whose detention was a blatant political act and of doubtful legality according to internationally accepted standards of law, was released in July this year in just such circumstances: just prior to the ASEAN ministerial meeting and the meeting of the General Assembly. Gross abuses continue as I speak. The SLORC conscripts labour on a massive scale to work on infrastructure projects or to act as porters for the army. Villagers are threatened and beaten. They are forced to work excessive hours under military supervision. There is little food and no pay. Money is demanded under the guise of payment for equipment or taxes. Those who are willing or unable to continue have been beaten or shot. The rape of women is commonplace. No soldiers have been brought to account for the killing of civilians, whether forced labourers, porters or political dissidents. Equal disregard is paid to citizens' rights to their homes. The committee has heard of the forced relocation of villages in the way of tourist developments, gas pipelines or railway developments. There is no consultation, no notice given of the move and no compensation paid. Houses and whole villages have been burnt down. On the borders, the drug trade and the trafficking of women, girls and young men are a corrupting and debilitating influence on government, on the army and on the health and welfare of ordinary people. These illegal trades also have a distorting effect on the economy. Moreover, any opposition to these practices has been met with spurious charges under executive decrees or vague legislation dealing with national security. Critics have been intimidated, spied upon, detained or tortured. Normal rights to free speech, a free press and freedom to associate are denied to the Burmese. Those changes that have occurred-the release of some political detainees, the abolition of military tribunals and the opening of the economyhave not addressed the core issues of accountability and democratic reform. The government of Burma, the SLORC, has variously denied that there is any abuse, complained about foreign interference in their internal affairs or pleaded special circumstances and cultural differences. The committee rejects these arguments. It takes the view that human rights are universal, applying to all people at all times. Burma, as a member of the United Nations, has obligations to uphold the universally defined standards of human rights. The mass of Burmese peopleover 80 per cent of them-have resoundingly rejected the SLORC. Furthermore, where domestic governments such as Burma do not respect the will of their people or protect the rights of their citizens-or worse, where governments abuse their citizens-it is the right of the international community to seek to intervene to protect them. The committee also believes that this inquiry has revealed the need for democratic political processes and the rule of law, interpreted by an independent judiciary, as the only reliable way of protecting rights and promoting development and security. It is the absence of accountability which makes governments corrupt and oppressive. Democracy, therefore, is not a luxury; it is essential. Burma's record clearly illustrates the interconnectedness of human rights, political democracy, peace, security and development. If minority rights had been respected in Burma and minorities included in the political processes, 40 years of war and the outflow of hundreds of thousands of refugees might have been avoided. The committee believes the key to change in Burma rests with the continuing efforts of those powers in the United Nations which have supported the many consensus resolutions on Burma. There should be no move to trade with or invest in Burma until there are substantial moves towards political reformthe release of all political prisoners, an forced labour and the establishment of genuine negotiations with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD. There should be restraint on investment by the multilateral financial institutions until these benchmarks are met. There should be a more constructive role from the ASEAN nations. The ASEAN nations are Burma's close neighbours and therefore they have the greatest interest in seeing a free, stable and secure Burma. Moreover, although it is yet to utilise it in this way, the ASEAN forum is an ideal place for the promotion of orderly regional development. There should also be continuing assistance to refugees along the borders until such time as they can return safely to a democratised Burma. I have come late into this inquiry as chairman. I would like to acknowledge the chairmanship of former Senator Steve Loosley and the small band of subcommittee members dedicated to human rights who have enabled the change to be seamless and whose efforts are reflected in this report. I give thanks to the staff of the secretariat for their work in the preparation of this report-Ms Alison Carson, who brings order to a subcommittee that asserts its democratic right not to be always orderly, and our secretary, Ms Margaret Swieringa, whose sure-footed knowledge gently guides the committee and whose work in human rights enhances the reputation of this parliament. There is a dissenting report. I always have a conflict between wanting to correct the errors in a dissenting report versus giving it undue prominence, but I have opted to try to correct the dissenting report, which was submitted by Senator Dee Margetts, who is not a member of the subcommittee and whose views do not appear to be influenced by the evidence or the deliberations of the subcommittee. In part, it is not in fact a dissent at all from the committee's conclusions or recommendations but a repetition of what the committee has already said. For example, recommendation 2, 'That the Australian government ""hold the line"" on the benchmarks and not resume ministerial contact' - that is, not make official visits to Burma-'until significant progress is end to made on the benchmarks,' is both current government policy and the conclusion that the committee has come to in endorsing the benchmarks and urging that no further concessions be made to the SLORC until the benchmarks are met. Senator Margetts recommends that the government develop a code of conduct for Australian business. This is already recommended by the committee in recommendation 30(b )(iii). On the other hand, Senator Margetts recommends to the government things they are already doing-for example, recommendation 1 of the dissent, which is that any ministerial contact be limited to multilateral fora outside Burma. Ministerial contact is already limited to this, and the committee has not suggested any change the current practice. On the country economic brief of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Margetts criticises the lack of human rights assessment in the brief and argues against an 'ingenuous' defence of the brief a purely economic document. The comprofile mittee's report already does this at paragraph 6.66 and at no time seeks to defend the brief in terms of its limited intention. Most disturbing of all is the suggestion recommendation 4 that the Australian government recognise Daw Aung San Suu Kyi as the rightful leader of democratic Burma. San Suu Kyi is the General Secretary of NLD. Dr Sein Win is the Prime Minister, in exile, of the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma. Finally, Senator Margetts opposes the committee's recommendations that, at all opportunities, the international community ASEAN members in particular press the Burma's SLORC towards political reform. She says: . . . the intemational community should take its lead from Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and not move to greater levels of dialogue than she is willing engage in herself. This is a meaningless recommendation and a complete misunderstanding of the position Aung San Suu Kyi, who since her release been willing and offering to dialogue with the SLORC on constitutional matters. So far, SLORC have refused to include in any substantial talks on political reform. is vital that the rest of the international community press the SLORC to include her as soon as possible. Senator Margetts fuses dialogue-pressure and criticism-an essential aspect of trying to shift the SLORC, with engagement-a process of recognition trade and investment as a means of bringing about economic driven change. The commitconflict tee endorses the first but rejects the second. I commend this report to the House.",16
9,Mr CONNOLLY,Unknown,"by leavereform Although I have not been a member of the inquiry into Burma by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I want to make some brief references. to As no other members of the opposition are present in the chamber to speak on this matter, I thought I should not let the opportunity pass. Many members on both sides of this chamber have been concerned for many years about the situation that has developed as in Burma. We are well aware of the high and the publicity surrounding Aung San Suu Kyi' s arrest and the events that have followed since her successful election win some years ago which was denied her by the SLORC when the military dictatorship conin tinued to exercise authority. I recall visiting Burma back in 1970-71 and Aung meeting then a former prime minister of the Burma who was also under house arrest. As has been pointed out correctly in this report, sadly Burma doe:.; have a long history of authoritarian rule and isolation from international contact and international scrutiny. Ever since the end of the Second World and War there have been constant incidents along borders involving the hill tribes and the communities in that area which, for one reason or another, have felt themselves to be isolated and ignored by the central administrato tion in Rangoon. But the principal point, I think, which this report correctly points out, is that, in terms of political reform, it must of remain a central objective of Australia's has foreign policy towards Burma that some engage in a reform takes place. Much pressure has been exerted in recent years not only on Burma directly but also on her the nations of ASEAN which have in a sense It had a somewhat more sympathetic attitude towards Burma. The view of ASEAN has been that Burma is part of the community of conSouth-East Asia and that the best way to solve the problem is to incorporate Burma in ASEAN. Burma is now progressing towards of membership of that organisation. In a sense, this is a typical example of the which takes place and will continue between Australia, as a modem liberal democracy, and our approach to issues of political and human rights in many nations within our region. I am one of those who believe that ultimately the security of this nation is going to heavily depend on our capacity to surround ourselves with countries which accept the principles of democracy and the basic principles of human rights as enshrined in the United Nations' charters. But, clearly, it is going to take some time to reach that stage. There are a number of our neighbours who take the view that internal affairs are not the responsibility of international fora and certainly not the business of their neighbours. So we will have to continue to tread a fairly light path in terms of how we handle these issues. But I urge this parliament, as I shall not be in it indefinitely, to always take the view that nations will support and respect Australia for its integrity and its determination to do what we believe is right. While in diplomacy one is constantly faced by the issue of Realpolitik, the ultimate equation is that the security and safety of humanity will depend on the capacity of all governments to give their peoples a degree of security and respect for the integrity of their activities and their actions towards individuals-which we generally regard as human rights. But, unfortunately, in many parts of the world, and certainly Burma is one of the most notable ones, the conceptions of human rights as we understand them are quite clearly not evident. They have not been evident for a long time and I am not optimistic to believe that that situation will change in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, that is not an excuse for lowering one's objectives, determination and resolve to try to develop a community of nations in the Asia-Pacific region where the conceptions of human rights and the responsibility of governments to their peoples, particularly to the rights of minorities, are respected. On that basis, and on that basis alone, I think this report is a very useful contribution to this continuing debate. I would like to make another point and to put it forward as a suggestion, which I note is not in the report. I have read reports that there has been some tenuous connection in recent times between the government of Myanmar-or Burma, now that it has changed its name-and the secretariat of the Commonwealth of Nations. I find this an interesting prospect, because Burma is the only former British colony in our part of the world which is not a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. While the prospects may be somewhat dim at this stage, nevertheless, I hold out the hope that if there is one thing the Commonwealth of Nations has successfully achieved in its long and fairly illustrious history-as we have seen in the case of South Africa-it is the capacity of that organisation to gamer significant international support through the United Nations and elsewhere directly in achieving those fundamental human rights of which I speak. Therefore I take the view that, if there is anything that can be done to involve Burma in the Commonwealth of Nations, that may well be a step in the right direction and one which the Australian government should pursue.",19
10,Mr HOLLIS,Unknown,"by leave-In this month's issue of the Australian Way, the magazine of Qantas, there is an article entitled 'The Land of the Gold Pagodas' - a very sympathetic and flattering portrayal of Burma. And, as we thumb through the many glossy magazines today, we come across articles extolling the charms and the beauty of Burma, usually accompanied by glossy photographs. Next year is the Year of Tourism in Burma and people from throughout the world will be enticed to visit this beautiful but tragic country. But beneath the beauty of the gold pagodas lies a frighteningly brutal regime and, as has been so adequately outlined by the chairman, Burma has been gripped with terror and frightening brutality for many years. The land, far from being a paradise, is a country where people's human rights and dignity are trampled under with jackboot, ruthless organisation. Let us hear nothing from the apologists. We heard some during the hearing saying that things are improving, there are administrative efficiencies, but these people never explained why the rightful ruler was under house arrest for so long, why basic democratic freedoms were abolished and why people disappeared. The concept of human rights represents not simply a moral imperative, although it rests upon the inherent dignity of human beings; it is driven by a pragmatic recognition that the abuse of human rights retards development by causing instability and insecurity, oppression, rebellion, war and the outflow of refugees. Such consequences affect the vital interests of neighbouring countries and entitle them to scrutinise the policies of other governments as far as those policies affect the human rights of their citizens. Let us also hear nothing from those businesses which want to enforce and make their profits from the blood of the innocent Burmese people. Let us not hear the nonsense that politics and business should be separated. They cannot and will not be separated. The chairman has outlined the view of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on trade and investment with Burma. Let me say life has been cheap in Burma-nasty, brutish and, far too often, short. If we are truly international citizens, we must not close our eyes and look away from the brutality that is Burma today. Human rights are the rights we have because we are human beings. They do not belong to us because we are Australian or, indeed, Burmese, Chinese or American, and therefore they cannot be modified or coloured by our nationality, our historical experience or our culture. Any Australians who visit Burma, be they former prime ministers or backpackers, are supporting an evil, brutal regime. As we have rightly loudly condemned the French for their arrogant behaviour in the Pacific, so must we continue to loudly raise the issues of Burma. If the Burmese are serious about tourism, let us or those who go there visit some of the border camps. Let them talk to the military and let the Burmese explain the disappearances and the brutality. The gap between the statements made by various representatives of the Burmese government and the actual conditions of life for ordinary Burmese people appears to be very wide-very wide indeed. For the most part, the worse conditions are not matters that can be attributed to poverty or levels of development or different Asian values. They are often attributable to government policy or to the direct actions of the government or individual military commanders. They result from a lack of accountability. Where there is no domestic accountability, then the only possibility for the protection of people who are abused by their government is through the international system, flawed as it might be. Human rights are denied in Burma. Any progress towards democracy is very slow and it is a tragedy in today's world, where so much has been achieved in so many ways, that so little progress has been made towards the protection of basic human rights in so many parts of the world, especially Burma. I agree with the comments made by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) who said that many of the neighbours of Burma regard it as an Asian concept and feel that we should not interfere. I take the view that, like apartheid, there is a growing body of international customary law that says some things are above domestic concerns. As apartheid was regarded as above article 2.4 of the UN charter and became a concern for the international community, so indeed should the denial of human rights be a matter of concern for the whole international community. Workers in Burma do not have basic labour rights. Despite the ratification of the ILO conventions, there is no freedom of association, no right to strike, no functioning trade unions and no right to bargain on wages. The international trade union movement always lists Burma as one of the countries in which child labour is endemic, and that matter has also been raised in this House over recent months. The government sets wages unilaterally in the public sector, while private sector wages are set by the market. Wage increases continued to lag far behind inflation. I am particularly concerned about the ILO conventions concerning seafarers. In 1993 complaints were made to the ILO by the International Transport Federation about the contracts and conditions of 30,000 Burmese seamen. The nature of seafaring has changed and labourers have been brought from many other countries. All seamen come under the control of the government's employment control division for seamen. They are required to sign contracts which state that the seamen will not contact the International Transport Federation. More specifically, the !LO committee on freedom of association heard a series of cases of the alleged abuse and intimidation by the Burmese government of Burmese seamen serving on foreign ships flying flags of convenience. In the period between 1987 and 1993, while in ports in the United States, Germany, Sweden and Australia, the seamen had complained about very poor conditions and underpayment. The response of the government of Burma involved revocation of registration, confiscation of passports, threats of imprisonment, threats against families and possibly kidnapping. One case of particular significance for Australia concerned the interception in 1993 of 11 Burmese seamen by the Burmese authorities in the transit lounge at Singapore airport and their forcible repatriation to Burma. It was claimed in the Singapore parliament by the home affairs minister that, in response to a request from the Burmese embassy, on behalf of the Burmese foreign ministry and the Star Corporation Shipping Company, the first secretary of the Burmese embassy had persuaded the Qantas airport duty manager to assist him to seize the passports of the 11 seamen and hold them until their departure to Rangoon. These seamen have disappeared. This action is a disgrace for Qantas, and Australia should be ashamed to have been associated with this action. I would like to pay tribute to the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for  late stage but who has carried on the strong traditions of the previous chairman, former Senator Loosley, who brought a particular skill to the foreign affairs and defence committee and a particular sympathy and feeling for human rights. I know that that is a feeling which the current chairman will carry on. The report makes very sobering reading, and I believe it is necessary reading for every Australian. I pay tribute also to the secretariat staff, particularly Alison Carson and Margaret Swieringa. I congratulate Margaret Swieringa on the dedication that she brings and the work that she puts into this committee. I do not know anyone in this parliament who has a deeper concern about the denial of human rights. In conclusion, I want to make one or two comments about the dissenting report. It is very difficult when you are talking about human rights, the denial of human rights and the denial of democracy to criticise someone who puts in a dissenting report. Nevertheless, I do not deny anyone on any committee the right to put in a dissenting report. What annoys me is the fact that committee members spend hours and hours travelling around the country and taking evidence from all over Australia in an attempt to reach consensus. I know former Senator Loosley was also very concerned about this matter. Whenever we organised the final draft of a report, he always had the ability-as does the current chairman-to bring consensus. Of course, no report ever brought down in parliament, when we have opposition, government and independent members on a committee, involves no compromise. At times we all have to compromise. We do not get everything we want. But it would be better to be able to stand up in this parliament and bring down a report which has the backing of all members of a committee. Every committee to do with foreign affairs, defence and trade that I have served on with Senator Margetts has had a dissenting report from her-and she is always wrong. She did not attend the committee hearings. She did not sit through any of the report draftings. This dissenting report lowers the value of the majority report. I have great respect for Senator Margetts-I like her personally-but sometimes people in this parliament try to be purer than the pure. We all aspire to certain things. Sanctimonious statements are often wrong or not well researched. This dissenting report is not as bad as some; nevertheless, I often wonder why there is a need for these dissenting reports. If people are so interested, why do they not attend when we are working through the matter or come to the hearings? Having said that, I commend this report to the House. People should read the dissenting report and make of it what they will. This is an important report. I think we first brought this down at the time the member for Bradfield was on the committee. I think it is a sobering report that should be read by every member of this parliament. It will, I believe, cause them to pause and think. If anyone is planning to visit Burma in the Year of Tourism in Burma, I really do think they should think again.",20
11,Mr LES SCOTT,Unknown,"by leave-I think the importance of this report is shown by those who have spoken on this side, my good friend the member for Chifley (Mr Price) and my good friend the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). They chair two of the other big committees in the parliament. As you are well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, I chair the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The Joint Committee of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the Joint Committee on Public Works, which the member for Throsby chairs, and the committee I chair, the Public Accounts Committee, are the three big committees in this parliament. That the three of us are actually commenting on this report here this morning, in support of the chairman, the member for Chifley, I think shows the importance of this report. The report itself covers a whole range of things in relation to human rights and the progress towards democracy in Burma. I wish to comment that it is very relevant to this report-last month I was on a parliamentary delegation to Thailand, as part of a bilateral visit to Thailand and the IPO conference in Singapore, which was chaired by the Deputy Speaker, Mr Jenkins. The deputy chair of that delegation was the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur). It was a very interesting opportunity for us to see what is actually going on in Thailand. We took the opportunity, when we were at Mae Sot in the north, to visit a refugee camp on the Thai-Burma border. That visit is very relevant to this particular report. That was one of the things the Deputy Speaker particularly wanted us to do. It was a very important occasion for us, as sad as looking at such an area like that is. This camp had some 6,000 occupants. People had been there for 11 years. Naturally enough, there were a lot of young children there. They had obviously been born there in the time their parents had been there. It was a very staggering experience for us to witness that. When you go on these parliamentary delegations, you often hear the silence from your colleagues as you leave. That spells out just how moved we felt about this great tragedy on the border. I understand that on the Thai-Burma border there are some 90,000 refugees, often called displaced people. Similarly, on the Burma-Bangladesh side there are something like 250,000 displaced people. If we compare the numbers of refugees in those situations with the numbers of refugees who are arriving in boats here on our shores in Australia, we have to wonder when a lot of the reaction from Australians is, Turn them around and send them back.' When we consider the problem that Thailand is facing with those sorts of numbers of people on their border, I think the sorts of difficulties that some of these countries face really come home to us. In this particular report there are many references to the government of Thailand and the work they are doing. I would like to record my appreciation for the support we had when we were there. The cooperation we had, enabling us to go to this camp, was pretty important. To the credit of the Thai government, they were very cooperative and gave us every assistance we needed. They are doing a lot of good work in assisting those people in those unfortunate situations, and I think it should be acknowledged. The report talks about the Australian government urging the government of Thailand to take certain steps-and I think it is important for us to do that. But this is not just a problem for Thailand; it is a problem for the whole world. I think that is where the responsibility lies when we see those sorts of difficulties. There are other references here that I also wish to pick up. One is the problem, particularly in Thailand and Burma, of the HIVAIDS virus and the work that Australia's aid program, AusAID, is doing. I would compliment our people who are working in Thailand, particularly those with AusAID. I would also compliment the NGOs where AusAID is also involved in Burma. They are doing a tremendous job under extremely difficult circumstances. It is certainly a process of education. There is no doubt about that. Many people are trying to assist in overcoming that major international health problem. I also express my appreciation for the cooperation being extended from a lot of other similar organisations to our people with AusAID. We also had the opportunity to discuss these issues with a British woman in that area. I think this report is very timely, following on from our visit there. Whilst I have been on this committee only since 6 June-interestingly enough, I have just taken note of the date here-I felt it important that, when this report came before the committee, I take the opportunity to make mention to the committee of our recent parliamentary trip there. Of course, the report on that trip has not yet been finalised, but it will be tabled at a later date. I am sure that report will make interesting reading compared with what has been highlighted in this report. I too would compliment the staff of the committee-as have the member for Chifley and the member for Throsby--on the work they have done in putting this together. It just shows, once again, the high quality of staff we have on our committees in this parliament. I think it is something we should always take the opportunity to thank them for. They put a tremendous effort into the committee work, and that is very important. To the member for Chifley, the chairman of the committee, I would also offer my compliments. You have only been chairing the committee for a short time, but I recognise, as has the member for Throsby, the hard work you have put into getting across the issues here. The report is a great compliment to you and the entire committee who participated in its preparation. I am pleased to have had the opportunity to rise today in support of this report and to highlight some of the experiences I have seen for myself and the great work that needs to be done in this area. Finally, I mention the ASEAN nations. When we were in Singapore, we had the opportunity of speaking with people from the ASEAN countries. As an observer delegation there, we had the appropriate dialogue session with those people. Breaking down those barriers, with us being more and more heavily involved in Asia, really is important. I think this report highlights many of those areas where we need to be involved. Once again, I compliment the committee on the report.  That the House take note of the paper. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. Public Accounts Committee Reports",23
12,Mr LES SCOTT,Unknown,On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts I present the committee's reports entitled Report 339-Annual report of activities 199495 and Report 340-Cash matters: Cash management in the Commonwealth. Ordered that the reports be printed.,24
13,Mr LES SCOTT,Unknown,"by leave-These two reports have been tabled together. I have notes on both of them, so I will deal with them separately. Some of my other colleagues will wish to comment on them as well. I am pleased to have the opportunity to present Report 339-Annual report of activities 199495 on behalf of the members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. It has been a particularly busy year. This report, which is the 339th tabled by the committee since 1951, presents an overview of the committee's activities for the last financial year. The committee began the practice of presenting annual reports to parliament in 1976. The committee's decision to prepare annual reports was explained in the 1979 annual report in the following terms: In reporting this way to Parliament, the Committee has recognised its responsibility as a statutory body to report on its activities. This Committee has always taken the view that bodies established by the Parliament should report to the Parliament and has been in the vanguard of encouraging increased standards and regularity in reporting. This statement is as valid today as it was in 1979. The last year has been particularly busy for the committee. During the period, it tabled 'seven reports, which was two more than in the previous financial year. The most significant of the reports tabled was report 331, which contains results of the committee's review of the package of the three bills intended to replace the Audit Act 190 I and the committee's consideration of the government's proposal to establish an audit committee of parliament. Report 331 contained 39 recommendations to further enhance this package. The committee was gratified to see that the government adopted the vast majority of those recommendations. I will comment further on that report in my statement here today. Members will know that, some 13 months after the tabling of the committee's report, the three bills and the motion to establish an audit committee are still being debated in the parliament. The contentious issues remain the Auditor-General's mandate to conduct performance audits in government business enterprises, the extent of the parliament's involvement in the appointment process for Auditors-General, the most appropriate form for an audit committee and certain provisions relating to the disclosure of sensitive informaas tion. The committee remains of the view that the recommendations in report 331 on these matters are sensible and constructive solutions which ought to be taken up. The parliament has before it a rare opportunity to modernise the Commonwealth's financial management and accountability framework. If we do not reach agreement on the outstanding matters in the next two weeks and enact legislation before the end of this session of parliament, the opportunity will pass, and pass very sadly I would suggest. This would be a great tragedy and, because of the upcoming election and the priorities of a new government coming in, particularly with the new budget timetable, the reforms contained in the bills will go unmade until at least July 1997. There are already a lot of aspects that depend very much on this legislation, particularly when it comes to the FMA and the CAC bills. A delay of this magnitude will be to the detriment of good management in the Commonwealth. I take this opportunity to urge all parties to look very closely at the hard work that has gone into that particular report. That report came out of the committee's report 296 back in 1989. It has taken some considerable time to even get it before this place, let alone trying to get it through the Senate. I think it would be a great tragedy if we failed to get that through in this parliament because of its magnitude-the importance of modernising our legislation to bring things up to the mark. I hope all parties involved will take this opportunity to move progressively with that. Whatever the eventual outcome of the debates in the Senate and the House, the committee considers that its review demonstrates that parliamentary committees can make valuable and timely contributions to the legislative process and help ensure that legislation is of the highest quality. Other committees of this parliament are now having more of an input into legislation and the opportunity to review it. Many bipartisan views have come back, and that has been a great strength to this parliament. The fact that the government has moved in that direction and encouraged and supported it will be seen an important development in this parliament when one goes through the history books in years to come. During the year the committee also tabled report 336 entitled Public business in the public interest. That was an inquiry into commercialisation in the Commonwealth public sector, which is a very important subject. In this major report the committee concluded that commercialisation and corporatisation have led to major improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness with which Commonwealth agencies provide goods and services. However, the committee found that commercialisation has not been without its cost and, in some cases, the transition could have been managed better. Of course, it is the role of the committee to highlight any deficiencies that we see. We hope that our reports can only improve the way departments operate-in particular, commercialisation in this case. Other reports tabled during the year covered a diverse range of topics, including the use of the Australian government credit card by Commonwealth agencies. This was a particularly interesting subject. I suggest that our report has shown up a lot of deficiencies in the way we were doing things with credit cards. I know that the Department of Finance in particular has picked up on some of those issues to improve things. Interestingly enough, when we visited New Zealand we found that our work in that report had spread over there. When we were there we were asked to speak to some people on the subject. Obviously that is something that flows across the Tasman to other jurisdictions. The committee was able to play an important part in assisting in that area. Another important report of the committee concerned the sale of Aussat and best practice for the sale of Commonwealth assets. A further report related to the construction and acquisition of six new Collins class submarines for the Royal Australian Navy, which is a major project. Because of that we need to watch it very closely. The Department of Defence is doing that as well and ensuring that the project is completed. The overall cost of the project is quite outstanding and we certainly need an ongoing brief to look at it. The committee was also active during the year with several ongoing and new inquiries. These included inquiries into the administration of Commonwealth-state agreements for specific purpose payments. That is another very interesting area. A report on cash management in the public sector has been tabled today. We also looked at accrual reporting, whole of government reporting and fiscal responsibility legislation. It was only this morning that the committee was working on that and took the opportunity to have an international link-up with Washington DC. We spoke to some of our American friends on the impact in that area. It was a very successful operation and obviously was a first for one of the parliamentary committees. I hope that other committees can take up that opportunity in the future. I know that the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who chairs the Standing Committee on Procedure and is a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, is interested in how we can best use the new technology in expanding our operations. The reports of some of these inquiries have been tabled and it is planned to table reports on the remainder of the inquiries before the end of the session. It depends on how hard the committee works the chairman. We will see how we go. A major highlight of the committee's year, as I mentioned before, was a visit to New Zealand as part of the committee exchange program established by the Australian and New Zealand parliaments. The centrepiece of the visit was a meeting between the committee delegation and the New Zealand parliament's equivalent of the JCPA-the Finance and Expenditure Committee. The meeting provided the delegation with an overseas perspective on some common issues facing the two committees. The discussion revolved around the role of committees in the New Zealand parliament, New Zealand's experience of public sector reforms and the relationship between parliaments and their auditors-general. That was a particularly interesting discussion in New Zealand. While in New Zealand the committee delegation also met with a number of other individuals and organisations. I mentioned earlier that we spoke to people about credit cards. The New Zealanders were particularly interested in the work we had done in that area. The purpose of these additional meetings was to gain a New Zealand perspective on some of the issues facing the JCPA's inquiries in Australia. I think we both benefited from that mutual exchange. Some people from New Zealand had been to Australia before and we had the opportunity to renew friendships. With this report I was pleased to have the opportunity to discuss issues of mutual interest with our counterparts on the New Zealand Finance and Expenditure Committee. Also, a great number of public and private sector representatives were invaluable in assisting the ongoing inquiry. The committee was also involved in a watching brief over the tax bill improvement project. That is a task the committee will be continuing through 1995-96. It comes out of the committee's previous report on the Australian Taxation Office. It is something of great importance to this parliament and the whole nation. Brian Nolan, who is leading the tax bill improvement project, should be congratulated on the work that he and his committee have taken on. It is a very challenging task for anyone. The commitment that Brian has put into it is amazing because it is not an easy task by any means. I congratulate him on his efforts and the way he keeps his cool with all his critics. I am proud of the committee's achievements over the past 12 months. I thank my colleagues on the committee for their unstinting efforts and active involvement in the committee's activities. Their work over the last 12 months has more than upheld the JCPA's tradition of helping to keep the executive accountable to parliament, which is an important role of the committee. I now tum to report No. 340, Cash management in the Commonwealth. It is a pleasure, on behalf of the committee, to table that report this morning. This was another very important issue for the committee to pick up on and I would like to make a few comments about it. This report is a result of the committee's review of two Auditor-General's reports presented to the parliament-Audit Report No. 22 1993-94, Efficiency audit: Cash management in Commonwealth government departments and Audit Report No. 10 1994-95, Efficiency audit: Cash management in Commonwealth government departments. Both audit reports resulted from the same performance audit, the first being an interim report and the second being the final report. The committee's decision to review these reports was influenced by the same reasons which caused the Auditor-General to conduct the audit: first, the Commonwealth manages huge amounts of cash each year; secondly, any improvements in cash management practice would potentially result in substantial dollar savings, which is something all members of parliament and the general public are very conscious of. In a nutshell, good cash management endeavours to match patterns of expenditure with patterns of revenue. In the Commonwealth, responsibility for this task is shared between individual agencies, which deliver programs or collect revenues, and the central economic agencies, being the Department of Finance and Treasury, which are involved in forecasting overall cash needs and engaging in short-term cash borrowings when cash holdings are predicted to be insufficient to cover forthcoming payments. When short-term borrowings are made, the Commonwealth incurs an interest expense known as public debt interest expenditure. In recent years, transactions to fund public debt interest expenditure have been the single biggest source of real growth in Commonwealth outlays. For example, the budget papers for 1995-96 show that, while public debt interest expenditure is expected to decline in future years, the past two years have seen such expenditure grow from $6.65 billion to $10.08 billion. At a strategic level, good cash management involves the prompt banking of Commonwealth revenues and the development of payment schedules which recognise opportunity costs and revenue peaks. The scale of the task is immense. In 1995-96, Commonwealth revenue is expected to total $110 billion while outlays are expected to amount to $122 billion. Figures like that merely confirm that there is a need to pay special attention to cash management. On the revenue side, it is important that the Australian Taxation Office and the other revenue agencies have sophisticated systems in place to quickly process and bank incoming receipts, which in peak periods can amount to more than $1 billion per day. With the $110 billion revenue for 1995-96 that I mentioned before, it would be obvious that there would be those peaks. It is very important that we use every avenue available to ensure that those receipts are banked and processed very quickly. I believe very strongly in the new technologies that are available, particularly in the banking sector, and we should really capitalise on those to pick up on that very important issue. On the expenditure side, Commonwealth agencies need to pay far more attention than they have in the past to making payments in a way which not only meets the Commonwealth's program objectives but at the same time protects the Commonwealth's financial interests. This is true both of the Commonwealth's own purpose outlays and of the Commonwealth's payments to the states, which in 1995-96 were estimated to be $34.2 billion or a little less than one-third of the total outlays. They are the payments that go to the states every year. It is very important that we think about that in terms of cash flows. The committee's current inquiry into the administration of specific purpose payments to the states-which I mentioned earlier when tabling the Annual report of activities-has drawn particular attention to the significant cash management implications of specific purpose payments. There is ample evidence, for example, that by making specific purpose payments before they are needed for program purposes the states are able to invest the money and make significant interest windfalls. That might not necessarily be a problem, and I am sure the states think it is a good move. But, in effect, this is a form of hidden subsidy to the states. It is an issue I expect the committee to return to in the report of its SPP inquiry, which will be tabled before the end of the current parliamentary session. That is an important thing to dwell on. That interest windfall comes to the states. But why? This is why we need to look at the cash flow. It does not only refer to the states; it refers any particular area. Another issue which is crucial for effective cash management is the need to accurately forecast cash flows. It is this activity which enables the containment of public debt interest expenditure. The committee has recommended the establishment of a series of cash forecasting benchmarks based on national and international best practice in both the public and private sectors. Treasury should also routinely monitor and evaluate its cash forecasting performance against these best practice benchmarks. There are also a great number of agency level functions which can have a marked aggregated impact across the Commonwealth, and they need to be addressed as well. These agency level functions include: negotiation of prepayment terms, particularly for specific purpose payments to the states and territories; invoicing promptly for goods and services sold; expediting collection of amounts due; purchasing goods or services later without jeopardising program objectives; negotiating more favourable purchase payment terms; reducing the amount of inventory held; spreading payment terms; and paying invoices only when they fall due. On that last point, I am well aware that it was often argued the other way-that the Commonwealth, and the states for that matter, were not always paying their invoices on time. Not paying them early can also have an adverse effect. There needs to be that balance. The private sector used to often complain that the Commonwealth did not always pay its invoices on time. So you need to make sure that it is a two-way game. The key message of course is that all agencies have a role in maximising the Commonwealth's cash management outcomes. Only efficient and effective management of these day-today functions by departments will achieve the levels of cash balances necessary to minimise borrowing and, subsequently, the net public debt interest cost to the Commonwealth. Commonwealth agencies maintain over 2,000 bank accounts, and it was of great concern to the committee that the Australian to National Audit Office had discovered that several agencies were unaware of the number of accounts they maintained. It is an essential discipline, of course, that proper bank accounts and records be maintained. To do otherwise is an indication of extreme laxity on the part of agency managers and exposes Commonwealth funds to significant risks. It is important in all of these areas that we minimise that risk. In considering how cash management might be improved across all Commonwealth agencies, the committee came to the view that the potential for savings, the number of issues involved in good cash management and the absence of any whole of government monitoring or analysis pointed to the need for increased central focus in the Commonwealth, at least in the short term. Accordingly, the committee recommends in report 340 that Finance should playa more prominent role in providing guidance for line agencies as well as in the monitoring, analysis and reporting of cash management performance on a Commonwealth-wide basis. The central focus on cash management recommended in the report could result in Finance performing a corporate Treasury function for the Commonwealth. One of the issues to emerge during the committee's review was whether or not the group of accounts maintained by the Commonwealth at the Reserve Bank of Australia and used for targeting of cash balances was the most appropriate. Evidence provided to the committee suggested that, in practice, the target group of accounts has already been expanded by Treasury to include the overdraft group. As this wider group is the one which is used by the Reserve Bank to calculate the Commonwealth's interest bill, it seems logical to the committee that the target group should be formally expanded. An associated and perhaps more important issue is the level of balances in these target accounts. The government decided in 1989 that the average cumulative balances in the target accounts should be maintained in the $0 to $300 million range. The committee believes that there is now scope to further refine this target range-towards the lower end, of course-thus providing additional savings. The committee recommends that Finance and Treasury should discuss and agree on optimal cash balances or, alternatively, that the issue be resolved by a review process. Of course the initiative taken in 1989 was right, and the Department of Finance has been doing a lot of good work in this area. That leads me to the final issue in this report which I wish to address. In the audit reports the Auditor-General pointed to areas where better cooperation between Finance and Treasury could result in an improved cash management performance. Report 340 looks in more depth at the relationship between these two key central agencies. The report reflects the concerns of committee members that a number of important issues which appear to have been under discussion or review for some years have yet to be satisfactorily resolved. Better cooperation and communication between Finance and Treasury could have seen a number of these issues resolved some time ago, with consequent benefit to the Commonwealth. Whilst both the committee and the Auditor-General acknowledge that there has been improvement in the working relationship between Finance and Treasury since the audit began, the committee believes there is scope for further cooperation. I think we would all acknowledge that in any area there is always the opportunity for us to do things better. I very much appreciate the efforts of the Department of Finance, particularly the cooperation and assistance we have had from it on not only this occasion but many others. Given the range and significant nature of the issues requiring resolution, the committee recommends that the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) should commission a high-level review of cash management in the Commonwealth. The review team should have a chairman from the private sector with expertise in corporate treasury functions. I believe that is particularly important, and I will come back to the reason why in a moment. It should consist of senior representatives from the Department of Finance and the Treasury; it is obviously logical to have those departments involved, seeing as they are the ones that deliver the services. It should include a senior representative from the Australian National Audit Office as a member of the review team or as an observer; it is essential that we include the Australian National Audit Office in anything like this. It would need to focus on the cash management issues which remain unresolved, and report within six months of being established-it only stands to reason that we need to report back on those as soon as possible. The committee believes that such an externally led review would enable a fresh perspective to be brought to the issues-a perspective unencumbered by interagency sensitivities. This is an important recommendation dealing with an important issue. The size of the Commonwealth's public debt interest bill and the potential savings which could flow from better case management are too big to ignore. I personally believe that this recommendation is the key to the whole question. You would be aware that from my background in the banking industry I have some interest in what cash flows are all about. Anyone in business would understand that if you do not control your cash flow you will have to pay unnecessary interest. If anyone in business, not only in the banking industry, has an overdraft and is not getting their payments in on time or promptly they will have to pay unnecessary interest. That is very relevant to this question. Anyone in business knows the importance of promptly making the outward payments. It is important to get someone in from the private sector with a wide depth of knowledge and experience. There are lots of those senior people around, and I think they could offer great assistance. A lot of the former chief executives from the banking industry, which I mentioned I came from, would always have known, particularly from the involvement of any bank employee, of the need to ensure that those cash flows are maintained. Overnight cash balances are very important to any industry, and it is always very relevant that the banks ensure that they use their money to the greatest benefit of their shareholders-and they still do, of course. We need someone from the private sector to lead that review. There are certainly many people who come to mind-although I will not name them in this place in case I create some problems for them-in the major corporate areas who could offer that sort of expertise in order to assist the Department of Finance and the Treasury as to how we can better manage these things. I am not saying that the Department of Finance is not doing a good job. It has put a lot of effort into this, but there are always better ways to do things. That is what the committee is aiming for in this proposal. The points we have made in this report are raised in the interests of better government. They pick up a lot of the things that the Auditor-General highlighted in both his reports. They will ensure that we have better cash management and reduce the public debt interest bill. There is no way we will ever get completely away from the public debt interest bill, because there are government programs that have to be met on a day-today basis, let alone those that occur on a one-off basis. But it is incumbent on all departments-such as the Department of Employment, Education and Training, with its labour market programs-to ensure there is a cash flow and that they are not making payments before they are due. They should make progress payments, just as anyone in any business would make such payments, rather than paying everything up front. I am aware that in some agencies that does happen. It is something that all departments need to look at. As I said, this is a very important report. I hope it will receive serious consideration by the government. It comes back to the size of the government's public debt interest bill and the potential savings that could flow from better cash management. Those are the important areas that we highlighted. In conclusion, I express our thanks to those people who contributed to the report by preparing submissions and giving evidence at the public hearings. I thank the staff of the secretariat who, as I mentioned earlier, have made such an important contribution. I particularly thank Wayne Harrison, who was with us for this report. He brought a wealth of knowledge to the committee and helped us tremendously, as did the whole secretariat, as usual. We are very fortunate in this parliament in the quality of staff on the various committees. I thank them, along with my colleagues, who have worked so hard on this report. I look forward to their helping me finish the rest of our reports before the end of this parliament. I commend both reports to the House.",24
14,Mr VAILE,Unknown,"by leave-I want to make a very short comment about both these reports. I refer first to the annual report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. I suppose it is important at this stage in the life of the 37th parliament that we recognise some of the work that the JCPA has done in the last 2Vz or so years and the direction in which the inquiries have taken our committee. Certainly, as a new member of parliament since 1993, I have been interested in the focus that has been taken by the committee on public policy matters, such as commercialisation and privatisation, and the accountability and transparency of what the Commonwealth is doing. A lot of our reports in that period which appear in the annual report revolve around those topics. I suppose it goes without saying that a lot of the reports and the inquiries that are undertaken by the Public Accounts Committee are done off the back of reports from the Auditor General. I think it is important that that be recognised-that we see a very important and continuing role for the Public Accounts Committee to continually review the Auditor General's reports. When different agencies and departments have had their activities looked at by the Auditor-General's staffwhether it be performance audits or otherwise-they should be aware that those Auditor-General's reports are going to be scrutinised by a committee of the parliament. I think that in itself goes to some of the points that the chairman, the member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), made with regard to report 340. I want to comment on just a couple of areas in the annual report. As part of preparing this annual report we had the opportunity during the year to do an advisory report on the Financial Management and Accountability Bill, the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill and, most importantly, the Auditor-General Bill. These bills flowed out of an earlier report that was done by a previous public accounts committee. There were recommendations with regard to the position of the Auditor-General as an officer of the parliament, the make-up of the audit committee and that function being taken by the Public Accounts Committee. I think those recommendations are still being kicked around in the Senate. I would certainly like to see that resolved as per the recommendations that were made by the Public Accounts Committee. Bear in mind that, apart from one very early report, the report called An assessment of tax: a report on an inquiry into the Australian Taxation Office, none of the reports that have been tabled and printed by the Public Accounts Committee has contained a dissenting report. In relation to those bills that were referred to the committee by the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), we made a number of recommendations and certainly hope those points of dispute get resolved in the Senate for the betterment of the Commonwealth, as it were. Probably the major inquiry that was undertaken by the Public Accounts Committee during the life of the 37th parliament ended in report 336, Public business in the public interest. That was an inquiry into commercialisation in the Commonwealth public sector with a particular focus on the Federal Airports Corporation and the Civil Aviation Authority, as it was. I suppose with the advantage of hindsight we realise we may have been able to extend that inquiry and add to it another element, privatisation, which would have made it certainly very interesting. As I say, the inquiry was conducted at a time when the government was making, on an ongoing basis, some very important decisions about public assets in Australia. It gave the members on the committee a great insight into the focus for the future. At the moment the work in progress may be wound up by the end of the 37th parliament or it may have to be carried over to the 38th parliament. A couple of very important inquiries are being undertaken at the moment. The first one is the inquiry into accrual reporting and accounting by Commonwealth agencies. It is incredibly important to the future of the Commonwealth, how our agencies conduct their financial affairs and how they report their financial affairs in a far more transparent way. The chairman, in his address, gave a reasonable amount of praise to the Department of Finance in a number of areas. My personal view in this particular area is that the Department of Finance could be taking a much quicker and more aggressive approach to the implementation of accrual accounting, reporting and budgeting. Until such time as this gets implemented in the Commonwealth-the states are leading us in this regard-we will not be able to establish properly transparent accounting practices. One of the other inquiries that are moving towards finalisation is the inquiry into fiscal responsibility legislation and the implementation of whole of government reporting. Obviously, that is intrinsically linked to the inquiry into accrual accounting and reporting. Again, some interesting evidence with regard to fiscal responsibility legislation has been received by the committee from different non-government organisations as well as people from our own Commonwealth departments. As well, we have had evidence from a former minister for finance from New Zealand, where they have introduced fiscal responsibility legislation and balanced budget legislation-<:ertainly an area that the Commonwealth should be looking to for the future. In closing my comments on the annual report, it is very important that the parliament and the people of Australia recognise the importance of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and the work that it does. Certainly I look forward, if possible, to continuing my involvement on that committee in the 38th parliament, whether that be at the end of this year or next year. I would like to make a couple of brief comments on report 340, on cash matters. That was also an interesting inquiry, precipitated by a couple of reports from the Auditor General-Audit Report No. 22 and Audit Report No. 10. We had the opportunity of getting a briefing from the newly appointed Auditor-General, who was a senior officer with the Department of Finance. He flagged to the committee the importance of improving the Commonwealth's cash management procedures in a number of areas. So the committee undertook this inquiry, and it certainly has uncovered some areas of deficiency where there is room for great improvement. As the chairman and previous speaker, the member for Oxley, highlighted to the House, a lot of the things we uncovered that were not being done happen as a matter of course in private enterprise. In a private corporation, their treasury cannot afford not to have control of inflows and outflows. They have to have a daily finger on the pulse in relation to what money is coming in and what money is going out, what the interest rates are and what the overdraft interest is. There seems to be a bit of a gap, as far as communication is concerned, between the key departments-Finance and Treasury-in this regard. There is certainly room for improvement in that area. In relation to the main revenue collector for the Commonwealth, the Australian Taxation Office, there is room for improvement in the procedures that are implemented by the tax office-the way they collect the revenue for the Commonwealth and the way they bank it. So this report is very important in that regard. I think the chairman in his speech referred to specific purpose payments to the states. We are still in the process of finalising an inquiry into Commonwealth-state agreements. It might just highlight the fact that maybe the state bureaucrats-in the way they handle and manage the cash being paid by way of specific purpose payments from the Commonwealth to the states-are a bit smarter than ours, because they get the interest and the Commonwealth does not. As the chairman highlighted, how that money is paid over is another area we should certainly be looking at in that report-whether it is in a lump sum going to the states and then they spend it over the ensuing 12 months or it is just paid through on a needs basis. I want to reinforce the recommendations in report 340, Cash matters: Cash management in the Commonwealth, that there is a lot of room for improvement. It was indicated to us in evidence in the inquiry that there is the possibility of savings in the Commonwealth of $300 million by better cash management practices. People out there in voter land probably think that this is an insignificant matter, but it is not insignificant. Three hundred million dollars worth of taxpayers' money could be much better spent in some other area of greater need. I commend this report to the House, as well as the annual report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. Certainly I would like to recognise the work that has been done over the last couple of years, and particularly with these reports, by Grant Harrison and the secretariat of the Public Accounts Committee. They in no small way put up with the members of the Public Accounts Committee and their strange habits, particularly in trying to organise meetings all over Australia and making sure there are quorums when we are always tearing back to our electorates. They have done it well and I commend Grant and his team. We have made some significant progress as far as the titles of our reports are concerned. The next stage is to do something about the colours of these reports. I commend the reports to the House.",30
15,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"by leave-I am pleased to have the opportunity as a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts to make a contribution to the consideration of both the annual report of the work of the committee over the last financial year and report No. 340 which deals with cash management in the Commonwealth. First, I must emphasise the importance of the Public Accounts Committee not only to the parliament but, I believe, to the whole of the national community. To a very large extent I suppose we have a financial watchdog responsibility. As part of that particular responsibility, the Public Accounts Committee from time to time undertakes various reports into the way in which the public sector government agency accounts are held and the way in which the government generally conducts its financial affairs in the interests the Australian community. It is interesting, though, that it took 13 years before the first Commonwealth parliament established the first joint committee of public accounts. It was established in 1913. It is also interesting that in 1931, during the trough of the Depression when the pressure on governments in relation to financial issues would have been so much greater and more intense and when one would imagine that the need for a public accounts committee would have been so much greater, as an economy measure the old public accounts committee then was disbanded. This current Public Accounts Committee stems from legislation which was enacted in 1951 and it is particularly significant that it is a statutory committee; it is a committee required by statute to be established. Short of withdrawing that legislation, there is no way in which any government can avoid appointing a public accounts committee-a joint committee consisting of members of this House and of senators and a bipartisan committee. In that context, I pay credit to all of the members of the Public Accounts Committee. As the chairman confirmed, and as the chairman encourages, the committee operates in a bipartisan way, as it should. The responsibilities of political parties in government to the national community, let alone their direct responsibilities to the parliament, should insist that they collectively give their attention and concern to the effective conduct of the financial affairs-the recording, accounting and reporting of all of the financial affairs-of governments, and they have done that. I also pay special tribute to the chairman of the committee, the member for Oxley. Les Scott has an extensive background in banking and, of course, it is that expertise and experience that has made it possible for him to be such an effective chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. But, without seeking to embarrass my friend and colleague, I must say that it is very much part of the personality of Les Scott that he has been able, with the great support he and all of us have had from the secretariat, to ensure that the Public of Accounts Committee works so effectively. As you and I both know, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, when people from different political parties get together we are not unlikely to see clashes and tension and to anticipate and see difficulties. Mr Charles-The tories?",33
16,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"One of my friends on the opposition side interjects; yes, of course, among the tories themselves. We understand how very difficult sometimes tories can make our public responsibilities, our pursuit and fulfilment of those public responsibilities. But, as a result of the chairmanship of the member for Oxley, we have been able to work, I believe, very well together. That was confirmed by the comments made by a member of the National Party of Australia who preceded me in this debate, the New South Wales member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), who is also a member of the Public Accounts Committee. While I am at this point, I want to pay a very special tribute and give a very special credit to what I believe is one of the most effective, dedicated, competent and hard working secretariats. It is under the leadership of Grant Harrison. Grant, together with the chairman, has the responsibility of coordinating the inquiry program and making sure that it all slots together and that the resources available-both within the secretariat and among the members and senators on the committee-are most effectively utilised. Grant has done that very well indeed. He is the secretary, the coordinator, of a very good team of people. Mr Wayne Harrison is here as well. He was the inquiry manager of report 340 which, as I indicated, together with the annual report, we are in the process of considering now. Mr Wayne Harrison was seconded from the Department of Administrative Services from May of this year. Mr Wayne Harrison was not only the inquiry manager for report 340 but also a participant in the Commonwealth government's executive development scheme. We also have in the advisers' box at present Dr John Carter and Ms Laraine Brennan, representing their colleagues in the secretariat. report. I am pleased that these representatives of the secretariat are here. As I said, they represent a good team. I support absolutely the comments that were made by the chairman in connection with the extent to which we depend upon them. They are always very gracious about it. They sometimes credit us for more than we have actually been responsible for. They do that very graciously because, in the end, we are the ones who have to carry the can; we are the ones who are finally responsible for it. I suppose that, in a sense, Grant and his colleagues are responsible too. Their professional approach to the special responsibilities that they have ensures that they want to do the best they can, and they do that-not only on behalf of the committee but also on behalf of the parliament, the government and the community. They are charged with very special responsibilities and they discharge those responsibilities, I believe, admirably. I also want to mention another matter while we are dealing with the annual report. It would not be possible to complete the program of work, which is so very well reflected in that annual report, if it were not for the witnesses who, often at very great difficulty to themselves, make themselves, their time and their talents available to the committee. I refer not only to individuals but also to the organisations which so fulsomely cooperate with the Public Accounts Committee and make it possible for some of their personnel to appear before the committee. That includes organisations in the private sector and governments at state, territory and local level. Without those witnesses, it would not be possible for the inquiries to be properly conducted. As you would know from the type of committee work that you are involved in, Mr Deputy Speaker, the types of submissions that we get contribute greatly to our inquiries into those particular questions. It has also been a very successful exercise to have observers from the Australian National Audit Office and from the Department of Finance sitting in on many of those hearings, particularly when we are taking evidence and giving consideration to the development of the The annual report refers to all the matters that were reported on during the last financial year. It includes report 331 through to report 337. There are any number of things that I would like to say about some of them, but let me refer to the first report-report 331. That was an advisory report on the Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1994, the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1994, and the Auditor-General Bill 1994. We also accommodated within that inquiry a reference which we had earlier undertaken to consider the establishment of an audit committee of the parliament. That legislation itself was designed to upgrade and update the legislative provisions which had previously existed in order to deal with all of those types of national government participation and involvement. To a very large extent, the original legislation had been designed and implemented in a period where the complexity and extent of national government involvement in economic activities was nowhere near what it is at present. I thought it was an excellent inquiry. Not only did I feel it was fruitful for the committee to undertake that but, like so many of the other inquiries we were involved in, I personally enjoyed participating in the development of a report which, clearly, was of significant value to the government in determining its final attitude and position on some of that legislation. Because this committee is a joint one-a bipartisan, cross-party committee-it was possible for those procedures to allow a direct input into government legislation by the parliament. That was not just by the government, not just by caucus committees, not just by the caucus itself and not just by the cabinet, but by the parliament. I think that gives a very special dimension to the nature and the quality, the purposes and the value, of committees of the kind we are referring to. There are, as the report indicates as well, a number of inquiries under way. I will very briefly refer to them. The first I mention is the administration of Commonwealth-state agreements for specific purpose payments. That is of enormous importance in intergovernment relations, in the development of state based programs and in the capacity for the federal government to have some type of input, not only in determining priorities but also participating in the funding of many of those programs, which are so often administered at state level. The second inquiry I mention is that of accrual reporting by Commonwealth agencies. As was indicated, I think by the previous speaker, that inquiry is being conducted and pursued in relation also to the question of the appropriateness of fiscal responsibility legislawhich, tion and the implementation of whole-ofgovernment reporting by the Commonwealth-with those two inquiries as well. The report of the inquiry into cash management in Commonwealth agencies, one of the inquiries active at 30 June this year, is now subject to the tabling motion of the chairman today. In connection with that as well, I make brief mention of a matter which the chairman also alluded to: the way in which these committees are conducted. Members of the Public Accounts Committee were in Parliament House at 8.30 this morning. That is not unusual. I think most members are in this building at 8.30 in the morning. They never leave until some time after 8 o'clock of an evening. That used to be 11 o'clock, as you know. We are now saner and more sensible. We now work more sensible hours. We do not stay here until the middle of the nightnor should we. But members of the Public Accounts Committee were here at 8.30 this morning. The particular reason for that was an audio hook-up with officials from the United States. It was 6.30 p.m. in the United States. It was gracious and kind of those officials in the United States to make themselves available to participate in that audio hook-up. We spoke with a Dr Paul Van de Water. He is assistant director for budget analysis at the Congressional Budget Office in Washington. There was also a Dr Ron Snell, who is the director of the economic and fiscal division of the National Conference of State Legislatures. I think-the chairman will assist me-he was from Denver, Colorado. Dr Van de Water was in Washington. We were here in Canberra, in one of our committee rooms, and we had an audio hook-up which lasted for an hour. We were able to directly question the witnesses about their experiences in relation to fiscal responsibility legislation, accrual accounting and whole of government reporting. They indicated to us that the national government of the United States still operates its accounts on a cash basis. We are moving towards an accrual basis. At that stage Dr Snell, representing the state legislatures, interjected to say that the states are moving more quickly towards accrual accounting to a very large extent, reflects or mirrors what is happening here in Australia. With the advantage of that hook-up we had an opportunity to discuss directly, with people in the largest economy in the world, some of the particular issues with which we are confronted at present. I am sure that the chairman-he nods in agreement--confirms the value of this morning's hook-up. The secretariat also was there, listening in, participating, advising and assisting. Of course, all of the people responsible for the technical side of the hook-up were there. It was quite a remarkable achievement to have a network of communication between one person in Denver, one person in Washington, the members of the Public Accounts Committee and its secretariat. Also, there were three representatives from-I ask the chairman to confirm this-the United States Information Service. Mr Les Scott-Yes, the United States Information Service.",33
17,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"They assisted us admirably in setting this up. It was an interesting innovation. The chairman referred to the fact that some time back the Procedure Committee, of which I am chair, had an inquiry into the use of new technology for the purpose of committee reporting and inquiring. This was the first occasion on which I personally had the opportunity of participating in an arrangement of this kind. The possibilities are very significant. I sometimes-very frequently, let me say-get left behind by the advances in technology. It is good to be brought up to date, as I felt I was this morning. I have referred to the committee having been established initially back in 1913, having been disbanded in 1931 and coming back in 1951. Just as an example of the volume of work undertaken by that committee, during the first 18 years of the first Joint Committee of Public Accounts there were 53 reports produced. That means that, on average, there were three reports per year. From 1951-1 indicate that was the year of the legislation which established the series of public accounts committees which followed-until 1995, the current year, there have been 337. Now we have this one to which we are referring today-No. 340. During those years, 337 or 340 reports were produced over a period of 44 years. That represents almost eight reports per year. Inorder to maximise the benefit of resources available to us, it is necessary from time to time for the Public Accounts Committee to establish sectional committees to deal with specific inquiries. It is always open to other members of the committee to involve themselves in those inquiries of which they may not be a member to the extent that they would wish. That gives plenty of opportunity for members to be involved in the work of the committee as widely as they would wish. In the few minutes I have left I will also refer to this other report: report No. 340 entitled Cash management in the Commonwealth. I think the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), who spoke before me, said it was possible that people may consider members of parliament giving their attention to the question of cash management as a bit of a waste of time-perhaps a little bit of a luxury. Perhaps we should be doing other things with our time. He emphasised the fact that a more effective cash management set of procedures within the national public sector could save the national taxpayers $300 million. That is a lot of bread on the table for my constituents. I would prefer that money back in their pockets than down here in Canberra helping to pay interest on public sector debt which arises at least in part from less than effective management. I am not knocking the Department of Finance or any of the agencies responsible for it. It is important for the parliament, for the government, to ensure that we put into place appropriate arrangements, procedures and structures to ensure that cash management is undertaken properly. Let me emphasise that the $300 million of possible saving is a $300 million interest payment towards a total interest bill for the Commonwealth government sector debt of $10 billion a year. Mr Charles-Shame!",36
18,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"The member of the opposition says, 'Shame!' He does not really mean that. In his more guarded moments he knows that, with a total budget of the Commonwealth government each year of $110 billion for national development and other purposes-there is an obligation on the part of Commonwealth governments to properly manage the financial affairs of the Commonwealth-an interest payment on national government debt is to be expected. But what is not to be expected is that tucked away within that $10 billion is $300 million with which we can effect savings, and we can do it by more effective cash management. The Department of Finance, together with all of the government agencies, is in the process of improving its cash management procedures and processes-putting into place structures that ensure cash management is properly undertaken. On the revenue side, it was brought home to us very forcefully that, at the peak of revenue receipts by the Commonwealth government and its agencies, $1 billion a day-$I,OOO million-<:an be received. If those cash receipts--of course they are effected through banking arrangements-are not managed properly, then the cost of managing them is greater and the possible benefit to the Commonwealth of holding them is less. For that reason, we need to give consideration, as the sectional committee of the Public Accounts Committee did, to that particular question. On the expenditure side, there is a need for all of those government agencies to protect the Commonwealth's financial interest. I emphasise that I do not mean any of those agencies should delay payments to creditors simply to hold the money and get some benefit for the Commonwealth. I do not mean that. The Commonwealth has a responsibility to ensure that its accounts, its debts, are paid and paid promptly. From time to time concern has been expressed by members from both sides of the parliament about particular instances which have been brought to their attention when that has not always happened. We have had private business people out in the community who have been waiting inordinately long for the payment of their accounts. That should not happen. I am not suggesting for a moment anything of that kind when I say that on the expenditure side there is a need to protect the Commonwealth's financial interests. What I mean is that government agencies should ensure that the whole process is conducted properly. As the chairman indicated, special purpose payments that we make available to the states represent a transfer of funds from the Commonwealth government, which raises the taxes, to the states to help fund state programs or to encourage or require the states to modify perhaps their own state based programs to accommodate, quite correctly, priorities of the Commonwealth government. If-and it has happened unquestionably: the sectional committee found this to be sothose special purpose payments are made to the states before the states actually need to spend the money, it means the money is not in our accounts earning interest for national taxpayers. It is in the accounts of the states earning interest for them and representing in effect a hidden subsidy. The states of course welcome that. Why would they not? But it is not something I believe the Commonwealth government should be doing. The Commonwealth government should be protecting its own accounts, protecting its own revenue, protecting its national taxpayers. That was one of the things referred to in the inquiry and the report into cash management. I repeat some of the comments that were made by the chairman in connection with the recommendations of the committee. He said that one of the primary recommendations from that committee in connection with the more effective management of cash by the Commonwealth was that there should be established a series of cash forecasting benchmarks based on national and international best practice in both the public and private sectors-that is, at the Commonwealth government level, in the whole process of managing cash receipts and meeting expenditures, we should be adopting the best practice that exists. When we talk about responsible government, to a large extent that is what it is all about. We have a responsibility to the national community and national taxpayers to manage their money, to manage their cash. The chairman also emphasised that another very important recommendation contained in the report was that the Department of Finance play a more prominent role in providing guidance for line agencies-all of those government departments and all the sectors of those government departments-in the monitoring, analysis and reporting of cash management. That is the second of what I consider to be two primary recommendations of that report. I conclude on the note on which I opened in indicating my own personal appreciation of those people on both sides of the parliament and from both chambers of the parliament with whom we all work in the Public Accounts Committee for the commitment, the dedication and the effort that they bring to that work. It is of national importance. They fulfil it well and they fulfil it under the leadership, the management and the chairmanship of Les Scott, the member for Oxley in Queensland. As I said, he is a man who has brought all the experience from banking that he had been able to accumulate before entering this parliament. He is the sort of fellow that parliaments need. He is the sort of fellow that we appreciate and welcome on this side. I am glad that his commitment is to the government, to the Labor Party and to the labour movement. Because of his background in banking he has been able to fulfil a very important role. I have enjoyed working with him. He is a good and close colleague. I also refer again to the admirable assistance, support, guidance and effort that we get from very professional people under Grant Harrison in the secretariat. Without their assistance, support, guidance and advice we simply would not be able to carry out our task.",36
19,Mr CONNOLLY,Unknown,"by leaveAs a former chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I compliment the present chairman, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) and all members of the committee on the excellent work which they have conducted in the last financial year. I notice that they have had seven reports, which is a commendable number to have completed and tabled in the House. The honourable member for Charlton made some interesting historical observations which I would like to allude to briefly. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts was one of the earliest statutory committees of the parliament. Interestingly enough, during the Depression it was wiped out as a cost saving measure. Subsequently it was reinstituted by Professor Bland and has had a substantial record of achievement over the years. I had the honour to chair the committee from 1975 through to 1983. On the question of the number of reports that we tabled in that period, I think there were 130. The production of reports is an area of substantial importance and I am delighted that the concept introduced in my period of tabling annual reports has been continued through the years. I hope that part of the ongoing program of the committee will be the biennial federalstate Public Accounts Committee conferences. We established that mechanism because we found that the level of public accounts activity at the state level was, to say the least, very unsatisfactory . I recall distinctly at our very first meeting in Sydney that the then Treasurer of New South Wales, Mr Renshaw, actually said on the record, 'We don't need a public accounts committee because our Treasury does the most wonderful work possible.' The Treasury officers present were smirking at this but the rest of us were, to say the least, somewhat upset because we saw it from a different point of view. As has just been pointed out by the member for Charlton, through investigations into the cash management of the Commonwealth-the subject of the 340th report tabled here today-it is perfectly obvious that the financial relationship between the Commonwealth and the states needs to be constantly under review. I believe that the Public Accounts Committee is the place in which to do that. I congratulate the chairman, the members of the committee and especially the secretariatwithout which the committee simply would not function-on the fact that they have conducted themselves, once again, in an outstanding way. They have set an extraordinarily high standard of achievement throughout the Commonwealth in the review of public administration through the bodies of the parliament. I hope that the work of the committee will continue. NA Suspension of Standing Order 143",38
20,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"I move: That standing order 143 (questions to other Members) be suspended for the remainder of this period of sittings. Standing order 143 is a little used standing order--or was, until very recently-that refers to the capacity of members of parliament to question people other than ministers in the course of question time. It was first put in place back in about 1903, at a time when a substantial proportion of the business of the House was done by private members. In the much more informal setting that existed then, party allegiances were very fluid, government majorities were virtually non-existent, and a considerable amount of government legislation was handled through private members' processes. At that time ministers were not the only ones accountable in government. Clearly, when bills took months to go through parliament, when issues of the day in relation to those bills changed it was important to have the capacity to get up in the chamber and question a member of the parliament about what they had in mind with a bill that was before the House, which was supported by the government and which was of vital significance to the nation with a complex set of clauses in it. That situation has disappeared and, as it has done so, so has the use of standing order 143. When I first came to this place the only occasion I can recollect its being used was when the then member for Lilley had a private member's bill before the House and the then Leader of the Opposition, Bill Hayden, stood up and asked her a question about it. The question was permitted but it went only to the issue of the timing of the introduction of that bill, not to a discussion of its content. In my memory this particular clause never has been used to question not a bill before the House but a motion moved by a member of However, parliament in private member's time. Clearly, it is a situation where a motion has been questioned. On this particular occasion it was a question to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), but it is then quite clearly open to members of parliament on a contemporary interpretation of the standing order to spend the entirety of question time standing up and asking each other questions about their various motions on the Notice Paper. So the use of the standing order essentially to question bills has now gone well beyond that. The potential for it to go further than that is now enormous. Let us compare this situation with the situation in 1903. We now have in place committees-which in those days they did not have in parliament. There is now a vast array of committee chairmen and deputy chairmen around the House, all usually with business before the House-matters that have been referred to them by the House, matters that they themselves are referring back to the House and reports that they are producing. On contemporary interpretations of standing order 143, they are all capable of being questioned in the House on the matters that are before them. We have also instituted a new institution of parliamentary secretaries. Actually, that is not so new. They did exist for a very brief period when members of the Liberal and National parties were in office. Clearly, under interpretations of standing order 143 they are now capable of being questioned as to their activities as parliamentary secretaries in so far as they might well relate to affairs in the chamber. So well and truly the genie is out of the bottle on this issue. The tradition of question time is that of being a point in time where the government is held to accountability. Questions asked of ministers could be rendered in these circumstances a complete farce. It is also obvious that, in the interpretation of standing order 143 on the last two occasions that it has been used, it was very restrictive. It goes simply to a question of the narrow element of it in terms of timing and procedure. If you look at the House of Representatives Practice, you would think that the area was very narrow indeed. It states: if the answer to such a question would require the Member to anticipate what he or she might say in the second reading speechclearly they do not actually anticipate questions going on notices of motionthe question is anticipating debate and is therefore out of order. I presume a similar interpretation might have applied to a question that refers not to a bill but to a notice of motion before the House. The House of Representatives Practice continues: A question asking when the bill will be introduced, whether the bill has been drafted, or whether the questioner could see a copy of the bill would be in order. A question of a wider scope has been allowed to a Member in charge of a bill actually before the House. For example, a Member who had already made his second reading speech was permitted to explain the meaning of a clause of his bill. Clearly, however, the way in which that has been utilised, that quite narrow set of interpretations over the last few months has been broadened out quite considerably, and a deal more is permitted in discussion of it. In those circumstances, we could obviously have the ludicrous situation applying of everybody getting up and asking each other questions in this place. Mr MCGauran-That is a complete straw man.",39
21,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"No, it isn't because that is exactly what happened in this place. We are now in a situation where this standing order requires a great deal of review. Mr MCGauran-This is no review; it is its abolition.",40
22,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"It is not its abolition. I have already spoken to the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Procedure, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown). I have indicated to him that I intend to write to the Procedure Committee for them to review the application of standing order 143 in the light of the changed circumstances-with the existence now of committee chairmen; with the existence now of parliamentary secretaries; with the precedents that have been set on the last couple of occasions which have gone well beyond a request for a simple explanation of a particular clause into a capacity for, effectively, a wholesale debate on the intention of the bill; given what was not anticipated though is permitted, and that is you go simply beyond discussing a bilI but discussing a notice of motion before the House. The standing order should also be looked at it in the light of whether that constitutes an appropriate aspect of question time. We should also look at whether or not, if it is the genuine desire of members that they have an opportunity to question each other on matters before the House, a question time for members might not be made available. That would be a very useful thing for the committee to look at. If members have a desire for the opportunity to question each other on private legislation that they have put before the House, or on notices of motion that they have put before the House, then the Procedure Committee could well look at that and we could look at the possibility of setting aside 45 minutes a week for precisely that sort of activity. It is not the intention of the government to eliminate this standing order. It is the intention of the government to modernise it so that it relates to contemporary parliamentary practice instead of 1903 parliamentary practice. The chairman will receive a letter from me shortly that will confirm what I have already discussed with him verbally on this matter and should provide an opportunity for all members of parliament to have an input, including an input into the notion of whether or not there ought to be a members' question time in the course of a parliamentary week. In recent times we have dramatically expanded the capacity of private members to initiate activity in this chamber. The opportunity was at one stage given on Thursdays but it is now given on Mondays. I do not see any problem with expanding the opportunity if we can work out some way of doing it sensibly-with a 45-minute period for members to ask questions, for example, if that is what is desired. That is something that the committee ought to take a look at. In the interim this standing order is being used in ways in which it has certainly not been used in the living memory of any member of this chamber and in a way which has probably not been used at any time since its application in 1903. It is important that question time maintain its essential character as a time related to holding the government accountable. The fact that the opposition is unsuccessful in holding the government accountable does not diminish the theory of what the exercise is supposed to be but merely the opposition's capacities in that regard. It cannot be said for one minute that the opposition is not being well treated in interpretations of what is in order in the asking of questions these days. It has been treated very generously by successive speakers since we have been in office-on what, if you look through standing orders on questions at question time, is a very restrictive set of rules about the ways in which questions may be asked. They have been very broadly expanded, effectively, in interpretation, over the last seven or eight years or so, very much to the advantage of the opposition. Therefore, the fact that the opposition finds it difficult to hold us accountable, with all those added advantages, speaks more of them than it does of us. My suggestion to the House is that at this point we should suspend the application of this matter until the Procedure Committee has had an opportunity to give it detailed consideration and to recommend reforms accordingly. Mr Liebennan- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is an unusual point of order, but I am sure that the Leader of the House, in the spirit of going back to 1903, will be interested in it. Having heard the proposal of the Leader of the House, I have formed the view that he is saying that the government thinks that the standing order has been abused and is not being used in the interests of the parliament or the operation of members' interests. That is an inference that should not be allowed. In fact, I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to rule that the proposal is out of order. Because of the way in which the Leader of the House has explained the motivation behind it, it is an inference that should not be permitted to be on the record. The motion should be rejected for that reason.",40
23,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Nehl)There is no point of order. I call the member for Moore.,41
24,Mr FILING,Unknown,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I riseMr MCGauran- Mr Deputy Speaker, did you give the call to the member for Moore?",41
25,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"I did give the call to the member for Moore. Mr MCGauran-1 think the opposition would be more entitled to answer this matter before the member for Moore, who will have a chance to speak later in the debate.",41
26,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"I accept the validity of the argument but you need to be faster on your feet. I gave the call to the member for Moore. Mr MCGauran- Mr Deputy Speaker, I was on my feet. You missed my standing here. I find it amazing that you would give the call to an Independent ahead of the 76 members of the Liberal and National parties.",41
27,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,I gave the call to the member of this House whom I saw on his feet at the time. The honourable member for Moore has the call.,41
28,Mr FILING,Unknown,"I would like to express my concern at what the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) is proposing by way of this motion. As an Independent member of the House, I would certainly oppose any further restrictions on the method in which question time is conducted. I was interested in the comments of the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman). Having looked at the House of Representatives Practice in relation to standing order 143, the Speaker of this place has in fact been correctly interpreting the questions asked on two occasions by my colleague the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), using standing order 143. In fact, as the Leader of the House well knows, if one were to read the House of Representatives Practice one would know that the interpretation of standing order 143 has been traditionally of the most narrow scope possible. As the Leader of the House would well know, from his experience as a long standing member of this place, the narrow scope of standing order 143 was nonetheless wide enough to allow the two questions by the member for Warringah to the Leader of the Opposition, seeking responses in relation to motions on the Notice Paper in his name. I have previously been a member of the Standing Committee on Procedure-a very important committee of this House. Having participated in the last but one report, which gave rise to the changes to question time in which we saw the introduction of rosters for ministers, I have to express some very serious concerns about this suspension of standing order 143 until the Procedure Committee has reported. This is rather like putting the horse before the cart. Why does the government not wait until the Procedure Committee has had an opportunity to examine this proposal before it takes what is in fact presumptory action, and suspend what is, and will hopefully remain in the future, a perfectly reasonable and usable form of this House, to inquire of members about the progress or stewardship of their particular motions or private members' bills on the Notice Paper? As an Independent member, I believe this proposal by the Leader of the House on behalf of the government places a further restriction on the opportunity for members to properly question not only ministers of the government but also those responsible for introducing private members' bills or motions on to the Notice Paper. I notice that the chairman of the Procedure Committee, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) is present. He is a man who, I believe, has acted in a fair way in his stewardship of that committee. I can only urge him to use whatever influence he has, as a former minister in the Hawke government, to try to get the government to change what is basically a further restriction on question time that is being proposed by way of this motion. We are seeing in essence the government responding in a ham-fisted way to a particular form of the House. It is arguable that the Leader of the House, when he tried to catch his leader short footed on Monday, failed tactically and is now suffering the embarrassment of that particular tactical failure. We know that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was sitting behind you thinking we were referring to item No. 10 on the Notice Paper when in fact it was No. 11. The fact that the Prime Minister was on the wrong foot is obviously a matter for him to resolve and of course a matter for you and him to resolve jointly in relation to your government's strategy. Let us not use that particular failure on Monday as a reason for then ham-fistedly ironing out one of the most important opportunities, albeit on a narrow basis, for members to ask pertinent questions of those who have the stewardship of private members' bills or motions on the Notice Paper. The government has said to us that it has extended opportunities for private members to participate in debates and to introduce matters into the House. But, in real terms, the government is encroaching more and more upon the sovereignty of parliament and of course is using executive power to basically crush whatever opportunity we have to express in this place the will of our constituents. In the end, it is our constituents' interests that are being crushed here. Constituents may want to know about matters contained in a private member's bill or a motion on the Notice Paper currently, and we are now prevented from dealing with them. We are prevented from asking questions. As I said earlier, you made basically a tactical failure on Monday-and it has become an embarrassment to the governmentto overturn a standing order that has been available to members in this place since the tum of the century. That is an absolute disgrace. As a member of this place and on behalf of my constituents I would like to say that, quite frankly, I find this another further restriction on my ability to properly represent their interests. All I can do is reiterate what I said earlier: I urge people like the honourable member for Charlton, the Chairman of the Procedure Committee, and his colleague the honourable  there and is also a member of the committee, to try to convince the government that this draconian response to their failure on Monday ought to be reversed, that standing order 143 should be allowed to stay as it is and that they should wait until the Procedure Committee has at least had an opportunity to hear from members, individually or collectively, as to their attitude about this particular standing order and report back. I always thought of the Leader of the House as an advocate for parliamentary democracy, as an advocate for private members' interests. This latest response, in a chain of responses making restrictions and further encroachments on the rights of individual members; is unfortunately another reflection on the government's interest in reducing further the sovereign interests and rights of members in the parliament and of course the encroachment of the executive vis-a-vis the parliament.",41
29,Mr MCGAURAN,Unknown,"The opposition will fiercely resist this assault on the rights and responsibilities of members on both sides of the House. We do not accept for a moment the very lame, even timid, uncharacteristically, defence by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) of this draconian measure. I wish the Leader of the House were more honest and, rather than trying to construct this phoney explanation for the government's manoeuvring in suspending standing order 143, he were at least as blatant as one of his predecessors, Mick Young, who said in the mid-1980s, and those who were here will never forget this, 'We've got the numbers in this House and we will use them as we see fit to our advantage.' Consequently, we now know that the government is just brutally exercising its majority to overturn a verj important standing order. Only slightly less contemptible than the act of suspending standing order 143 was the Leader of the House's attempt to justify it. Let us look at his arguments. He started off by conceding that standing order 143 was a little used standing order. Perfectly true. There has been no abuse of standing order 143. It is just that the government fears that that could be the case. Then of course the Leader of the House went on some historical journey to say that when the standing order was established in 1903 it was a much different parliament: it was a much more informal setting; government majorities were more shaky; bills took months and months; the party system was not so rigid; and there was a greater number of Independents. That situation ended 55 or 60 years ago. That situation did not continue on past the early 1930s. So the justification now for overturning this right of members to question other members besides ministers on the basis that it is outdated is a complete nonsense. The setting that the minister paints ended more than 60 years ago; but consecutive parliaments, and governments for that matter, have retained the need for standing order 143. Remember, we have invoked 143 to question the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) but twice--on only two occasions. How does that justify the government's now truncating of members' individual rights? Let's not put up with this phoney suspension of 143. To all intents and purposes you have abolished it until the next election, and there is the key to it. You are referring off to the Procedure Committee a review. You hold out the promise of a 45-minutes-a-week question time for members; but, of course, not before the next election. That is the key to this whole thing. The fact is that the government lives in fear of the Leader of the Opposition and will even go to the extent of abolishing a standing order that has existed since 1903 to protect itself. The Leader of the House claimed that the genie was out of the bottle. The genie is out of the bottle simply because the opposition used standing order 143 on but two occasions to question the Leader of the Opposition during question time. The Leader of the House then goes on to say that question time would be rendered a complete farce. If it becomes a farce, we will be the first to join with the government in finding away, for the good of the parliament, to stop any exploitation of 143. But it is not a farce; it is simply that you are worried we will use standing order 143 between now and the next election. Remember, after today there are but two more sitting weeks to question the Leader of the Opposition. Members of the public would want to know why standing order 143 is being abolished simply because the opposition has used it on two occasions. Let me read out standing order 143. It reads: Questions may be put to a Member, not being a Minister or an Assistant Minister, relating to any bill, motion, or other public matter connected with the business of the House, of which the Member has charge. Members of the public, to whom we are accountable, would believe that was a very sensible and necessary standing order for the good working of parliament. Where is this history of abuse? Where is this farce that the Leader of the House draws on to justify the government's actions? Now the Leader of the House says that he wants to modernise standing order 143. How do you modify something as plain and unambiguous a right that is conferred on members of this House? Of course, nothing will happen before the next election. It has just been shunted to one side to die a natural death in the committee, for this government's horizons extend only to the next election. After that they will worry about it, from the ranks of opposition. But, for the moment, they want to buy themselves time and to gag the Leader of the Opposition. To finish off the hyperbole of the Leader of the House: he tried to justify the abolition of standing order 143 on the basis that the government wants question time to retain its essential character. What is its essential character? The abuse of question time by government ministers has become entrenched. Question time has been completely and utterly distorted by the Labor Party against all of the workings, history and conventions of this place. Now the average time to answer a question is 5.1 minutes. During the Whitlam years it was three minutes. During the Fraser years it was less than four minutes. In the Hawke years it was an average of four minutes. The Fraser years had an average of 2.9 minutes. So the essential character of question time that the Leader of the House refers to needs to be changed and the abolition of standing order 143 will not improve the situation at all. This is an act of desperation on the part of the government. It shows that the government knows, as does the general electorate, that the Leader of the Opposition well and truly has the Prime Minister's measure. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) cannot compete with the opposition when there is a level playing field, so he is simply shutting down the game. This action is unprecedented and everybody must understand this. This provision has been exercised in the House ever since 1903 and never before-not even in the depths of the low standing of the Whitlam years-has there been an attempt to suspend this standing order. Out of sheer political expediency the government draws on its numbers to close down the only avenue by which members can ask other private members questions about matters for which they have charge. It is a long-held convention and practice in this House that private members' business is sacrosanct. There is very limited time available to private members or the scope for them to pursue issues which are of interest to their constituents. This curtails that very basic right. The government is overturning a longheld convention. The real motive, of course, in suspending standing order 143 is that the government has been embarrassed by the Leader of the Opposition's exposure during question time of, firstly, its incompetence and hypocrisy over the third runway issue and, secondly, its blatant disregard of proper ministerial standards of conduct. They are the two issues which members of the opposition, more particularly the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), have asked the Leader of the Opposition to address. The public would want those two issues to be pursued; instead the government gags debate and controls it by use of its majority numbers. We have aired those two very important issues: the government's incompetence over the third runway issue and its blatant disregard of ministerial standards. Why shouldn't those matters be pursued by way of standing order 143? The government is happy to use question time-the Leader of the House reminds us of its essential character-to dish out abuse and invective, but as soon as the opposition turns the table on it and uses an established form of the House to take the government on on its dismal record it squirms in embarrassment. It then comes up with the brilliant idea, 'We will abolish standing order 143 to further cement our defensive position.' We know the government has manipulated and distorted question time for its own grubby and base political purposes. It has imposed a question time roster. The Prime Minister and his underperforming ministers tum up on only two of the four parliamentary sitting days every week.",43
30,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,How many?,45
31,Mr MCGAURAN,Unknown,"They are required to attend only two out of four, as the member for Fisher would know only too well. The Prime Minister, for example, attended parliament to answer questions on only 19 of the 39 sitting days in the first half-year. Nineteen out of 39 sitting days-a strike rate of less than 50 per cent. This is a drop-off from 1994, when he turned up for 40 of the 68 sitting days. So 1994 was a good year, for which we are supposed to be very grateful. The truth is the government is completely manipulating question time. It rescheduled question time, of course, put it beyond 2 o'clock to 3 o'clock to avoid live TV coverage, so that it could hide and shield from the public the Prime Minister's hectoring and arrogant style, which is a certain vote loser. The combined effect of these moves is to deprive the opposition of the chance to fully pursue a topical issue of the day, to shelter incompetent ministers from scrutiny, to reduce accountability and to deny the public its right to be properly informed about the happenings of the House. The government has abused question time through its refusal to give relevant answers to the opposition and its tendency to give long diatribes through dorothy dixers. It has used question time to give de facto ministerial statements and has therefore denied the opposition the right to make a formal statement in reply. During the Fraser years, an average of 77 ministerial statements were made per year. Under Labor that figure has dropped to 30. Why should they bother with ministerial statements, thereby giving the minister's opposite number a platform on which to respond, when they can use question time for these long monologues that often go over 10 minutes? As a result, this parliament is reduced to the farce that the Leader of the House makes out that standing order 143 will lead to. Forget about it ever leading to a farce; you have turned the workings of the parliament into a complete farce. The Prime Minister has debased parliamentary standards through his abuse of procedures and his vile and undignified language. He has no respect for proper parliamentary procedures. The latest example is his complete distortion of the sub judice principle when he quoted verbatim from transcripts of the Marks royal commission and put interpretations on that evidence and remarks made before the commission. This motion seeks to stifle a legitimate recourse for the opposition to expose incompetence and hypocrisy by the government. It is yet another example of the contempt of the Prime Minister for the parliament. Who do you think gave the Leader of the Opposition his riding orders? Who would have called him in and said, 'Stop any more questions from the member for Warringah and/or anyone else from the opposition to the Leader of the Opposition'? It would have been the Prime Minister himself. This has his fingerprints all over it, and it is a harbinger of things to come. We can certainly expect more moves to gag and guillotine debates in the run-up to the next election. By this unprecedented action, the government deserves the strongest condemnation. Hence, I move: That all words after that be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: The House condemns the Government for its unprecedented attack on the rights of all Members and calls upon the Prime Minister to restore respect for Parliament and the practices of the House by upholding and maintaining standing orders and by setting a personal example of dignified leadership. The government stands condemned for its move to abolish-let us not pretend it is a suspension-standing order 143. Mr Charles-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",45
32,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"After that diatribe by the member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran), could I introduce a little bit of balance and sanity into the debate. ",46
33,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"And, as my colleague the member for Chifley interjects, a little bit of dignity. There was a lot of rhetoric involved with the comments that were made by the member for Gippsland, and that is understandable. They have attempted to make some running on this question but not very successfully. The abuse that he directed to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was most inappropriate and unnecessary and certainly could not be justified by any measure. When the member for Moore (Mr Filing) was speaking, he referred to the standing orders having been in existence since the tum of the century. I think someone else mentioned 1903, and that is possible. But, as the Leader of the House and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) quite correctly indicated, certainly during my time and his time in this place that standing order was invoked on only one occasion prior to the present time. That was when the then Leader of the Opposition, Bill Hayden, directed a question to Mrs Elaine Darling, who was then the member for Lilley, in connection with a private member's bill that she had before the parliament. To my knowledge, it has not been otherwise used, until more recently. I have no objection to-nor, I assure members of the opposition, does anyone on this side of the chamber-nor any concern about members of the opposition properly exercising their rights, responsibilities and duties to constituents, the parliament and the parliamentary institution; that is, to act as a vigorous and an effective opposition. That is how this government has acted, and it continues to operate as a vigorous and effective government. The concern on the part of the opposition is whether there are ample opportunities for the opposition to question and challenge the government. I draw the attention of the House and the wider community to some of the provisions which already exist. If the opposition were to manage its affairs more effectively and more efficiently, it would utilise some of these provisions which already exist more effectively and more efficiently. First of all, in connection with legislation which passes through this parliament the opposition has the opportunity to oppose it, to amend it, to seek to reject it, to challenge it and to take it out into the community. One of the great benefits of the types of circumstances we enjoy in Australia is that we live in a vigorous democracy. I would hope everyone in this parliament and in this chamber would endorse that. So the opposition can do that as far as legislation is concerned. The opposition can also move for a suspension of standing orders if they wish to bring on a matter which is important to them. That provision exists within the standing orders. Why, then, has it not been used? Why does the opposition not recognise that? That is an opportunity for all of those purposes for which, I believe, standing order 143 has started to be misused. Let us all be perfectly clear about it: standing order 143 was never intended to be used in the way in which it is being used at present. The Leader of the House, the Deputy Prime Minister, said that the government would be seeking to suspend the operation of standing order 143. Let me make this point as clearly and as vigorously as I can: the government has the power to abandon that standing order forthwith. I appreciate the fact that the Deputy Prime Minister quite properly came to me, as chairman of the Procedure Committee, and indicated that it was the intention of the government to suspend this standing order their and to make a referenc- to the Procedure Committee. I have the assurance of the Deputy Prime Minister that that reference will be wide. It will not in any way attempt to restrict the Procedure Committee in dealing properly with this question, to make sure that whatever concerns may be expressed by the opposition can be adequately accommodated-in just the same way as the legitimate and proper concerns of the government. So there are those two ways. There is also the existence of the matter of public importance. Every day that this parliament sits, generally members of the opposition and, very infrequently, members of the government have an opportunity to raise a matter of public importance and have that debated. It is not just on days when the Senate is being broadcast; it is also on days when this chamber is being broadcast. So if there are any people out in the community who want to hear those issues, they can tune in and hear them directly. We have the grievance debate. There is also private members' time when members of this parliament can get up and, in 10 minutes, take the opportunity to raise issues which are of concern to them, either individually or collectively. We also have the adjournment debate. Every night that this parliament sits, all members of the parliament have an opportunity to seek to attract the attention of the Speaker in order to get five minutes in which, again, they can raise any of the issues they want to pursue. We have questions on notice. Let me also emphasise that, as a result of recommendations by the Procedure Committee and decisions by this government, provisions to ensure that questions on notice will be answered more promptly and more adequately have been put into place. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would know, if any members of this parliament genuinely want to seek information, genuinely want to challenge ministers and genuinely want to challenge the government, they also have the opportunity to do that through questions on notice which go into the Notice Paper. That Notice Paper is available for the observation of the media, and for the observation of anyone who wants access to it. This is a vigorous democracy with a wellinformed public-a very well-informed public, an alert public, an astute public, a receptive public. We have a very vigorous media, the fourth estate, in Australia. There are no restrictions on it, apart from the normal it. restrictions of libel and slander, to which the editorial columns and articles of every issue of every newspaper, magazine and journal in Australia will attest. We have a vigorous democracy, supported strongly by the media. We also have doorstops. Most of us were probably doorstopped this morning, with the media coming out and seeking our responses. Members of parliament have an opportunity then to respond publicly to those issues. If the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) wants to call a media conference, depending upon the issue and the media's time and responsiveness, at any time during the day he can attract around to any committee room members of the media. He will then have an opportunity to say anything that he wants to, to raise any issue. Let me emphasise: there is no need-no need-for question time to be used in the way in which an attempt is being made to utilise it understanding order 143; that is, where there are questions being directed by members of the opposition to the Leader of the Opposition simply because he chose to establish the base for those questions by putting some motions on notice. I believe that the procedure which the Leader of the House, the Deputy Prime Minister, has adopted is perfectly proper. He has respected the forms and institutions of the House. He has referred the matter to me and indicated that it will be a suspension and not an abandonment. The Procedure Committee now will have the opportunity to examine all of the alternatives-and, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that is a cross-party committee. Let me say this: there are only two weeks of sitting left this year. As a result of the suspension and consideration by the committee, it should be possible for us to consider this matter and come back and have for the rest of the yearincluding the lead-up to the election, whenever that might be next year, which time is so critical to the opposition-a new standing order in place which will make it possible then for us more effectively to achieve the objectives that were originally intended understanding order 143 but which, quite clearly, at the present time are not being achieved by",46
34,Mr CHARLES,Unknown,"La Trobe) (12.38 p.m.)The motion before the House, which has been moved by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley), is all about retribution-retribution because the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) stood here in the parliament the other day and absolutely demolished the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), all this occurring after a tactic which was supposed to make the Leader of the Opposition look silly. Well, I tell you what, Mr Deputy Speaker: this retribution tactic is an absolute nonsense. This parliament, its mores, heritage and conventions are once more under attack by a Labor government that simply does not care about tradition, which does not care about the operation of the parliament. I have said in this place many times that it seems to me, in recent years, this House is losing not only its character but also its ability to deal with the issues with which it should deal. It is becoming simply a mechanism for government to ramrod its legislation and its agenda through a formal procedure in order to get it off to the Senate and try to convince senators to pass its legislation. The government does not care about members participating in the democratic process. The House is no longer a House of Representatives; it is a House of government. And this draconian motion is just one more step to remove from us the heritage and tradition of this place that give members the opportunity to represent their constituents, to act in the best interests of their political party and to make a real contribution to the debate about life in this country. Removing this opportunity is truly draconian. I wish the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) had been in this House in 1991. I had before the House at the time a private member's bill which dealt with the Industrial Relations Act. That bill was intended to remove section 299(1)(d)(ii) of the Industrial Relations Act, which was in fact a punitive section which said, in effect, you cannot say anything derogatory about the Industrial Relations Commission or a member of the commission or you pay a fine or you go to gaol or both. At that time there was before the High Court a case brought by the Industrial Relations Commission against Nationwide News. Maxwell Newton, now departed, had written an article in the Australian attacking the commission and likening the commissioners to commissars. The commission was pretty unhappy with that so it proposed to fine Nationwide News or send Maxwell Newton to gaol-one or the other. I said it was a denial of freedom of the press and a denial of freedom of speech. I could well have used the member for Warringah to ask me a question during question time which would have given some national prominence to the issue.",47
35,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,You could have.,48
36,Mr CHARLES,Unknown,"I could have. I did not realise that opportunity existed. The member for Warringah was not a member of this parliament. So I did not take that opportunity. I point out to the House that the High Court of this nation, in examining the issue of Maxwell Newton calling the Industrial Relations Commission commissars, found that it was undemocratic and that my bill was right. The High Court said my bill should have been accepted. The government, in its arrogant way, ignored my private member's bill, brought in its own bill, rammed it through the House and it was never heard of again. That was the end of it. That fixed section 299(l)(d)(ii) well and truly. It fixed it, but what we did not have was proper national attention on the issue. The fact is that use of standing order 143 by a member, the member for Warringah or any other member, to ask me a question about that issue could have well helped put that issue on the national agenda and focused attention on the government and its failure to properly use the mores of the House to proceed with business. It was my private member's bill. It was my idea. I wrote the bill. I tabled the bill and attempted to get it debated, but the government is not interested in private members' business. The government simply wipes the issues from the paper as soon as they have been debated or perhaps they are simply left to lapse and the government gets on with ramrodding legislation through this place. There is no evidence whatsoever, as is put forward by the Deputy Prime Minister, that there has been any abuse by private members of this standing order 143, that all of a sudden all time. we might spend our time during question time asking members of the parliament questions because of notices of motion that are on Notice Paper. What it is all about is the fact that use of standing order 143 on two occasions in recent times has allowed the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) to stand on his feet at this dispatch box in front of this microphone and speak to this parliament and speak to the people of this nation. The government does not like that because the Prime Minister is coming off second best and he keeps going down in the polls and the Leader of the Opposition keeps going up. I tell you what: it is not making him happy. So once again we have another privilege of this parliament taken away. We talk about taking this issue to the Procedure Committee of this House. I was on the Procedure Committee briefly. The member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) talks about what a wonderful job it does. But it has shoved question time to 3 o'clock away from 2 o'clock, there is a roster system for ministers so the front bench is half empty every day, and the Prime Minister comes in twice a week, if he is well enough to join us on those two days. The only reason he comes in at all is that if he did not the press would say in the end that he has probably died. You are taking away our privileges. What this Procedure Committee has done to us is not fair. You made all these wonderful recommendations and the Prime Minister told the Leader of the House and Deputy Prime Minister what to do and he did it. Today is one more instance where, regardless of the view of members of this place, we are going to be steamrolled by the Prime Minister. He sits in his office and tells the deputy what to do. The deputy comes in and introduces the motion, ramrods it through the House and we are finished. So much for democracy. This is all about retribution. It is all about straw men. It is hypothetical. There is no substance to the motion whatsoever. I tell you what: if members of the government come in and vote against the amendment which I have just seconded, it will be the greatest hypocrisy of Mr ABBOTI' (Warringah) (12.46 p.m.)-It has taken the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) 36 hours to summon up the courage to come into this House and trample on its democratic rights. What we are seeing today is a small but very significant attack on the privileges of this parliament and the democratic traditions of this country. For 93 years, standing order 143 has sat in the democratic procedures of this House and now it is being snuffed out because it suits the political convenience of this government. The Deputy Prime Minister claimed that this standing order had never been used to do anything other than address questions to a member about a bill. That is not true. In 1951, a question was allowed to the Leader of the Opposition about whether the party agreed with a speech by a Labor senator. In 1953, a question was allowed to the Leader of the Opposition about his authority to instruct matters concerning statements. In 1968, another question was allowed to the Leader of the Opposition about the policy of the Labor Party. On 53 separate occasions at least, this standing order has been used to allow members other than ministers to answer questions. You have to ask: why is this happening? Why is the parliament debating the Deputy Prime Minister's motion? Because members opposite, listening to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), have seen into the future. They have seen what it will be like after the next election and they can't take it. Members opposite can dish it out but they can't take it. What has been happening is that this government has abused and corrupted question time. This government has used question time, which is supposed to be an opportunity for ministers to tell the truth about the government, to tell lies about the opposition. As soon as the Leader of the Opposition stands up to exercise his rights under the all democratic procedures of this parliament and his rights understanding order 143, which has been part of the traditions of this place for 93 years, what happens? The jackboot of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) comes down upon the parliament and the Leader of the Opposition's right to speak in question time is ripped away. Don't members opposite understand that democracy requires debate, and debate requires two sides? What this government is prepared to accept is nothing but a one-sided debate. In question time at the moment the opposition gets to ask seven questions and the government gets to make 14 speeches. We weren't asking very much. We weren't asking to take away all of those 14 speeches that the government gets to make. We were saying that just one of those speeches should be made by the Leader of the Opposition-just one small period of question time should be given to him to reply to the lies that are so consistently told by this government. We are not asking for much. Even that little which we are asking for has been taken away from us. This government has a very clear attitude the parliament. It wants to treat this parliament as a cipher. The Prime Minister believes that every parliament should be like the Reichstag was in the 1930s. The Prime Minister believes that every parliament should be like the Supreme Soviet was in the days of the old Soviet Union. The Prime Minister wants a tame cat parliament. I have to say that this motion is about nothing save the Prime Minister's desire to crush all possible forms of dissent. They talk about new procedures. The new procedures that they are talking about are for after the election. We are talking about before the election. They do not care what happens after the election because after the election, for most of the people opposite, there it will end. We have heard the Deputy Prime Minister's voice but it is the Prime Minister's will that we are feeling in this chamber today. This motion of the Deputy Prime Minister is all about revealing the Prime Minister's contempt for the parliament as an institution. We know, because the Prime Minister has told us, that he believes question time is a privilege extended by the executive. Even the privileges that they have extended are now being further reduced. We know that the Prime Minister regards senators as swill. Now he is treating members of the House of Representatives with the same contempt. We know that this motion is all about the viciousness of this Prime Minister towards anyone who does not agree with him. We have heard the Prime Minister's viciousness towards Dr Mahathir, towards Nobby Clark, towards the superannuation industry, towards the Marks royal commission. This Prime Minister has gone feral. We have a feral Prime Minister an- this motion is all about his hatred for anyone who does not agree with him. This Prime Minister's attitude towards all opportunities of dissent is like King Herod's attitude to the firstborn children of Israel-he stamps them out at every opportunity. This Prime Minister has a complete contempt for the truth. This Prime Minister's attitude to the truth is like the attitude of Dracula to a to wooden stake. This Prime Minister would not know the truth if he fell over it. I am delighted that the government is supporting truth in advertising legislation. It means that the Prime Minister will never be able to appear in any of the government's advertising. The government's television advertising will be reduced to the level of silent movies. This motion is a disgrace. It shows complete contempt for this parliament. It shows contempt for democracy. It shows complete contempt for the Australian people. I am just very disappointed that there are not more people present in this House to listen to the obsequies being spoken over democracy in Australia. Motion (by Mr Beazley) agreed to: That the question be now put. Amendment negatived. Original question put: That the motion (Mr Beazley's) be agreed to. The House divided.

37,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"by leave-On Tuesday, United Nations Day, I spoke to a commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the signing of the charter of the United Nations about the importance of the United Nations to Australia and our role in it. I also spoke about a major step in Australia's disarmament policies. I believe the issues raised are relevant to all the honourable members who sit in this House. When the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Dr Boutros Boutros Ghali, visited Australia in April to take part in a conference on global cultural diversity, he said to me that he judged countries not so much by their size and GDP, which one would tend to think was the normal yardstick of his measure, but rather by their ideas and their commitment and the impact and the difference that they make. By the Secretary-General's measure, Australia has made a disproportionately large contribution to the work of the United Nations. This has come in the work done by men and women like Dr Evatt and Jessie Street during the creation of the body, through the work over the years of Australian peacekeepers who have served with great courage and distinction in Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and the Caribbean, through our aid and refugee workers, our diplomats working on disarmament, our health experts dealing with smallpox or AIDS, our contribution to the spread of human rights. And it has come, particularly in recent years in the area of arms control and disarmament where we have played an important role in areas like the creation of the Treaty of Rarotonga, support for the indefinite extension of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the agreement to ban chemical weapons. Above all else, the people who drafted the charter of the United Nations 50 years ago, who had just experienced a global conflictthe most destructive in all of human historywere motivated by the desire to rid the world of the scourge of war. But their hopes were almost immediately crushed with the coming of the Cold War. For the first time, the international community had to contemplate the possibility that another world war would destroy our civilisation. In all the debate and anger over the past months about the French government's decision to resume nuclear testing in the South Pacific, there is one point which consistently recurs in our thinking about this issue. I have made that point publicly. It is that, however strong our opposition to them, those tests at Mururoa, and China's continued testing, are not themselves the core of the problem. They are instead a symptom of the problem-the . deeper and more troubling problem, of course, being the problems of nuclear weapons in the world. The reason we have seen such a huge outpouring of public concern about the French tests, not only in this region where they are being held but also in Europe and Japan and elsewhere, has been a feeling that we have been cheated-robbed of the chance of a world free of nuclear weapons. With the end of the Cold War, we all breathed more easily. We allowed ourselves to think that the nuclear threat, the nightmare of two generations, had finally passed. The thought of nuclear weapons and nuclear war faded from our minds. But the reality has not faded. Fifty thousand nuclear warheads remain in the arsenals of the five declared nuclear powers. And it is no less real and frightening that others-not just the so-called threshold states of India, Pakistan and Israel but others like Iraq-wait and work to acquire nuclear weapons. The French decision to resume testingannounced within weeks of the indefinite renewal of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty-was an outrage and a folly. It has produced an entirely understandable wave of anger around the world. But we may yet be able to derive something positive from it because it has jolted us back to the reality of nuclear weapons in the world. I now feel a growing certainty that some great good might yet be got out of the present bitterness if we make this the moment to take on the challenge of nuclear weapons. I believe we can tum the global outrage at French and Chinese testing into something broader and more ambitious-I mean the creation of a world totally free of nuclear weapons. This has often been talked about in the past, of course. It is a goal which has been forcefully articulated by Professor Joseph Rotblat, who won this year's Nobel Peace Prize. It has long been an aim of Australian policy. However, to most people, including me, it has always seemed an unachievable ambition, at least in our own lifetimes. The strategic uncertainties and deep political suspicions of the Cold War would surely have made this goal impossible . But that world has now changed. We still have conflict, of course. We still have competing national interests. But the strategic framework in which nations operate has changed profoundly and I believe it is now possible to contemplate getting a concrete program to achieve a nuclear weapons free world because the truth is that the sort of world we now have, with nuclear powers committed to reducing their arsenals and unlikely to use their weapons offensively, will not continue forever. We can be certain of this. Unless we take action now, the nuclear competition that characterised most of the second half of this century will very likely return-and probably in a much more unstable and multipolar form. The world must extricate itself from the circular argument that we need nuclear weapons because we have nuclear weapons. The nuclear powers cannot be excluded from this: they must understand that the most likely threats to their own security lie in the proliferation of the very weapons that they hold. This is a point we have made often about the French tests and the way they cut across the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the most important arms control treaty ever negotiated within the UN system. I notice that the former French President Giscard d'Estaing made a similar point in an article in the French press on 12 October. He said that 'the increase in the number of states, be they big or small, who manage to develop nuclear weapons, now constitutes for France a threat just as serious, if not more serious, than that of a strategic strike decided by one of the rare countries with nuclear weaponry'. I believe that a world free of nuclear weapons is now attainable. It can be done and it will be in the best security interests of Australia and our allies and friends if we do it. As we saw in the Gulf War, new technology has given weaponry an accuracy that substitutes precision for brute explosive force, and with far less risk to civilians than those from nuclear weapons. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, we have also seen how real is the potential for catastrophic nuclear accidents. The government believes the time has come for more determined movement towards the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. There is no magic wand we can wave to make this happen. As with the long negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament to get rid of chemical weapons, ultimate success may be decades away. And getting there involves security issues of the greatest complexity and profundity . We do not minimise the difficulties or the dangers. Success depends ultimately on having the will as well as the ambition. The chemical weapons convention has shown that where there is a will there is a way to put the genie back in the bottle. We proved it was possible to rid the world of a whole class of weapons of mass destruction. And the verification problems for a total ban on nuclear weapons should be easier to solve than those for a ban on chemical weapons. A key building block for a nuclear weapons free world is already in place with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, article VI of which commits the nuclear weapon states to 'pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament'. But this generalised statement of principle is not nearly enough. What we need now is action to achieve the abolition of all nuclear weapons. These are the next steps the government has in mind. In our own region we want an end to nuclear testing by France and the closure of the Mururoa test site. For nearly 50 years-since the beginning of the nuclear weapons erathe Pacific has been used as a testing ground. The Americans began testing in the Pacific in 1946 and continued until 1962; the French are still testing in French Polynesia; and the Menzies coalition government approved British testing in Australia between 1952 and 1963. In 1983, the Australian government-this Labor government-set the objective of ridding the region of testing and began its campaign to declare a South Pacific nuclearfree zone. With the announcement on 20 October by France, the United Kingdom and the United States that they would sign the protocols of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty in the first half of 1996, we can say that we are on the point of achieving our objective and ending a dark period of the region's history. The government's deep regret, of course, is that France is not drawing the logical conclusion from its intention to sign the South Pacific nuclear-free zone protocols and ending its tests now-as we urge it to do. We also want the nuclear weapons states to support the African Nuclear Weapon Free Zone Treaty, which is being presented to the current session of the General Assembly, as well as the South-East Asian nuclear weapon free zone, which is nearing completion. We believe that progress towards a nuclear weapons free world would be given a major boost through the creation of linkages between the existing or potential nuclear weapons free zones in the South Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Indian Ocean, which already cover most of the Southern Hemisphere. Globally, the most immediate priority has to be the conclusion of a genuinely comprehensive test ban treaty by mid-1996, followed by its early entry into force. Australia, together with Mexico and New Zealand, is presenting a resolution to the current session of the General Assembly to entrench this deadline. In Geneva, Australia has been consulting closely with key countries on ways to expedite the comprehensive test ban treaty negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament to take advantage of this opportunity. Over the next few months, the government will be devoting substantial resources-as we did for the chemical weapons convention-to doing what we can to help bring this about. Next, we want to see the immediate start and early conclusion of negotiations on a convention to ban the production of fissile material for weapons purposes-the so-called 'cut-off convention. And we want to see the development of a regime requiring all states to declare and account for their present stocks of fissile material, as another necessary prelude to the elimination of nuclear weapons. We want to encourage the strengthening of international safeguards, in particular by building up the International Atomic Energy Agency's ability to detect illegal undeclared nuclear facilities. We want universal membership of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, particularly by the nuclear threshold states of India, Israel and Pakistan. But, as I said earlier, Australia is determinnot ed to pursue the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. We want the nuclear weapons states to carry out their commitment to the elimination of their nuclear stockpiles by adopting a systematic process to achieve that result. The next steps towards this are the adherence by the United States and Russia to the destruction timetable under START, and further nuclear reduction agreements between the United States and Russia, with the earliest possible involvement of the United Kingdom, France and China. We acknowledge the need, as we always have, for a system of stable deterrence to be maintained while the reduction and eventual elimination of nuclear weapons is being achieved. All these elements constitute a program which will set norms for international behaviour, establish new international legal obligations and further develop international control mechanisms which will serve as an essential framework for the safe and secure elimination of nuclear weapons. I am writing to other heads of government who share Australia's concerns, suggesting that we look at the means by which we can advance the cause of a nuclear weapons free world. I hope a new coalition of international interests will emerge from these consultations. As its contribution to this, the government will establish a group of knowledgeable and imaginative individuals from around the world. In a major series of meetings in Australia, this group will be tasked to produce a report to be submitted to the next United Nations General Assembly and to the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. The group will examine the problems of security in a nuclear weapons free world and suggest practical steps towards that goal, including ways of dealing with stability and security in the transitional period. Next week, the International Court of Justice will be hearing a case referred to it by the United Nations General Assembly, asking it to give an advisory judgment on the legality of the use and threat of use of nuclear weapons. We believe, and will argue before the court, that it would be best for the court to make a judgment-the legality of nuclear weapons is a different matter, of course, from their utility or strategic value or even their morality. A judgment by the court that the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is legal, even if only in some limited circumstances, runs the profound risk of achieving precisely the opposite of what those seeking the court's opinions want-namely, the encouragement of others who want to join the nuclear club. Even a judgment that nuclear weapons use or threat is illegal-unless very carefully framed to deal with how that conclusion might be put into practical effect-would likely be ignored by the nuclear powers and as a result serve no purpose other than to weaken the standing of the court itself. The government has now decided, however, that Australia will also argue to the court that if, despite the good reasons for not making a decision, the court is minded to make a decision in this case, it should decide in favour of the illegality of those weapons. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, will travel to The Hague to present this case on the government's behalf on 30 October. We are not naive about our role in this enterprise to make the world free of nuclear weapons. We are a nation of only medium size and weight in the world, and we are not a nuclear power. On the other hand, we are skilled at multilateral diplomacy and have demonstrated on issues like the peace process in Cambodia, APEC, the chemical weapons convention, the protection of Antarctica as a wilderness reserve and the campaign against apartheid that we have the energy and ideas and the capacity to create coalitions with others, to make a real difference in the world. With the same energy we gave to those projects we are now committing ourselves to the goal of a nuclear free world. Reflecting on the history of nuclear strategy, the American writer Fred Kaplan says that nuclear strategies were contrived to disguise the real nature of the nuclear bomb. It is, he writes, 'a device of sheer mayhem, a weapon whose cataclysmic powers no-one really had the faintest idea of how to control. The nuclear strategists had come to impose order-but in the end chaos still prevailed'. I suppose we could say chaos, in this respect, has always prevailed. The world has a chance just now to find a way out of the chaos. The chance, though, will not last long. We can help the world to grasp it. We might even be able to show the way. At the beginning of the United Nations' second 50 years, there could be no better way for us to show our commitment to the ideals which motivated the men and women who drew up the charter than by working, like them, to tum a noble idea into a concrete and enduring reality. Mr Speaker, the thrust of this statement was given by me to a 50th anniversary commemoration of the adoption of the United Nations charter here in Canberra two days ago. In the public debate which has followed, the federal opposition has accused the government, and me, of mounting a political stunt. That is all there was to it. From them there was no agreement or disagreement; no debate over the comprehensive test ban treaty or the prospects for a cut-off convention; nothing about linkages between nuclear-free zones; no analysis of proliferation problems; and no advice on how the policy might be managed. From them there was nothing-a statement without substance from an opposition without substance. The opposition is led by a person who has been on the wrong side of every international issue since he entered parliament, which is quite a remarkable record. He opposed economic sanctions against South Africa and claimed that the future of that country lay with Chief Buthelezi rather than the ANC. He opposed the South Pacific nuclear-free zone as a complete fantasy concept. He urged support for Ronald Reagan's Star Wars program. He believed that Gorbachev was part of a subtle plot to catch the West unawares, and he believes we need security from Asia rather than security with Asia. Mr Speaker, one welcomes any support from the coalition for anything that we are doing on this side of the House but, the way they are talking, you would think that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and his shadow foreign affairs spokesman, the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), had been leading Palm Sunday rallies arm in arm with Tom Uren for years now. Mr Downer-That is devastating!",51
38,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"I was truly startled when the member for Mayo ascribed the vision of a world without nuclear weapons in his speech yesterday to Sir Robert Menzies; Sir Robert Menzies, of all people! Sir Robert Menzies is the source of inspiration for much of the opposition's thinking on policy matters, but to suggest that the man who gave the British the testing rights to Maralinga is now a saint in the anti-nuclear pantheon quite takes one's breath away.",55
39,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,Did you oppose it? Mr Downer-Did you oppose it?,56
40,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"Menzies was, of course, a legendary Cold War warrior who let the British test and not clean up the place. The only thing I would say to the opposition is: do him a favour and leave him alone. Invoking his work here would only embarrass him. The important thing is that the opposition has shown that it is irrelevant to this policy debate about a world without nuclear weapons. It had the opportunity in the parliament yesterday to endorse what the government was doing, as it has had in every other major policy debate over the last 20 years. It has decided not to do that and, as with the chemical weapons convention, as with the South Pacific nuclear-free zone, as with Antarctica, as with APEC, the government will soldier on, but we will soldier on in one of the greatest causes of all, and that is to finally clean the world of these shocking weapons which have presented a tyranny to two generations of the world. We want to take this historical opportunity to start the beginning of the end, to put these weapons asunder so that no longer in the future will the world ever be threatened and vandalised by their existence. I present the following paper: Australia and a world without nuclear weaponsMinisterial Statement, 26 October 1995. Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: . That the House take note of the paper. Motion (by Mr Beazley)-by leaveagreed to: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition speaking for a period not ing 21 minutes.",56
41,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"After what happened about half an hour ago, I am amazed that the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) has allowed me to speak. I start my response to what the Prime Minister and member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) has said by remarking that, until the last three or four minutes of his speech, it had been a speech that was remarkably free of partisan political point scoring, remarkably free of political vitriol",56
42,Mr KEATING,Unknown,As you were yesterday!,56
43,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"And, until the last three or four minutes, an opportunity for the House, in a relatively bipartisan fashion",56
44,Mr KEATING,Unknown,What-after yesterday!,56
45,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"to address an issue which is of profound importance to all generations of Australians, to address an issue over which no side of politics has any kind of moral monopoly, despite the protestations of some of those who sit opposite-an issue which over the years both sides of politics have demonstrated a commitment to. The Prime Minister chose, in the last three or four minutes of his remarks, to call attention to some of my attitudes on foreign affairs. This Prime Minister-my Labor opponent-is the man who in 1979 said, 'Who cares about Afghanistan?' So, if you start reminding people of what they have said in the past, I might remind the House that in 1979 the member for Blaxland was so unconcerned about the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan as to dismiss with that kind of dismissive remark the approach taken to impose sanctions against the Soviet Union because of the invasion of Afghanistan. The truth is that Australia became a major signatory to the major international instrument held up by the Prime Minister in his speech as being the driving force towards the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons-in other words, the nuclear non-proliferation treaty-because of the action of the Gorton coalition government in 1970, which was 25 years ago. I totally endorse what my colleague said yesterday. All he said was that the claim that exceedthe current Prime Minister discovered revulsion to nuclear weapons three days ago-as he would have the Australian public believeis a completely false claim. We are not suggesting for a moment that the Labor Party has not been opposed to nuclear weapons for decades; we are not railingMr Knott interjecting",56
46,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The member for Gilmore has already been cautioned.,57
47,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"We are not arguing that the Labor Party has not had a genuine opposition to the proliferation of nuclear weapons over the past 30 or 40 years. What we are arguing against is this absolutely dishonest attempt by the Prime Minister to write everybody else out of the debate of the last 30 or 40 years. Just as the Prime Minister would have the Australian public believe that he discovered Asia, as he frequently would, he would now have the Australian public believe that he discovered a revulsion for nuclear weapons. The truth is that, on both sides of politics, there has been a revulsion for nuclear weapons. I say to the Prime Minister that he does immense harm to the cause that he seeks to promulgate by carrying on with that sort of nonsense.",57
48,Mr KEATING,Unknown,You humbug!,57
49,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,The more that you call me a humbug,57
50,Mr KEATING,Unknown,You are a humbug!,57
51,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"There he goes. In typical Keating fashion, he runs out when there is a bit of heat. He cannot stand a little bit of heat. When I got the written text, I said to the member of my staff who handed me the Prime Minister's statement, 'What is it like? How many bucketings of the opposition are there?' She said, 'None.' I said, 'Well, that's a change. Maybe we can have an intelligent, level-headed bipartisan debate on an issue that all Australians care about.' That is what I want to do. I was absolutely determined to come into the parliament and to give the Prime Minister credit for what was in the written statement. There was really no notice of that ridiculous end that he put on the statement. This man really is addicted to vitriol. He is absolutely hooked on the habit. No matter what the issue is-no matter how important the issue is-he really just cannot help himself. The idea that he could rise above some kind of political tirade, actually forebear and pass up the opportunity was really just too much for him. So not only did he add some kind of snide reference to the Menzies coalition government's agreeing to British nuclear tests in the 1950s-it would be interesting to know what the Australian Labor Party said about those tests at the time-but also he could not resist adding more at the end. Let me just say very clearly and deliberately, on behalf of the opposition, that the goals of a nuclear-free world are goals with which the Liberal and National parties completely associate themselves. Despite the nattering interjections of those opposite, it has been the goal of governments representing both sides of Australian politics over the last 40 years to rid this world of nuclear weapons. The idea that Paul Keating, or anybody on the Labor side of politics, has some kind of dignified moral monopoly on the high ground on this issue is absolutely ridiculous. I would like to remind the House of a remark that was made by Dr Keith Suter, the President of the Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of Sydney. I do not think he will be given first class honours in Star Wars research while he holds that particular position. In today's Age, he says 'Paul Keating expressed little interest in this issue'a nuclear-free world-and his change of heart is a 'remarkable turnaround'. That is from an acknowledged expert on peace studies. I remember that in 1984 there was a ruckus in the Labor Party about the MX missile splash-down facilities that the Hawke government had agreed to give to the United States. And there was a revolt against that from the left wing-but not from Paul Keating. I do not remember Paul Keating being arm in arm with Tom Uren in 1985 when the Labor Party withdrew permission for the Americans to have splash-down facilities in Australian territorial waters. In fact Paul Keating urged Bob Hawke to take a very right-wing position on that particular issue. Far from being arm in arm with Tom Uren, he was arm in arm with Ronald Reagan. On that particular issue he was probably a bit closer to the truth, but that was before he was Prime Minister and before he was trying to parade his peace credentials around Australia. He could not have given a damn about South-East Asia before he became Prime Minister. He flew over it with contempt as he raced towards the shopping malls of Paris-we all know that. He could not have cared less. I listened to all of those debates between Paul Keating and John Hewson and Tim Fischer about Asia. Hewson and Fischer have forgotten more about Asia than Keating has learnt in the whole of the time that he has been in parliament. Once again, he is a poseur when it comes to international relations. Through his behaviour in the last few minutes of that speech, he squandered an ideal opportunity for this parliament to express calm bipartisan support for something that all Australians are interested in. As for his ridicule of the behaviour of the Reagan administration, President Reagan, be it remembered, went to the Reykjavik Summit with Mikhail Gorbachev in 1986 and declared his commitment to ridding the world of nuclear weapons. It is my view-and the view of many who have studied the history of that period-that if it had not have been for the action taken by Reagan and Weinberger in the mid-1980s, you would never have had the ultimate disintegration of the Soviet Union, an event that has done more to bring about the chink of light that the Prime Minister is now talking about than any other development in foreign affairs since the end of World War II. If you understand history, do not dump on the role played by people like Reagan and Weinberger in the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Far from those who supported those policies in the 1980s being proved wrong, they have in fact been proved right. The fact that there is now an opportunity, of which the Prime Minister speaks, is as much due to what they did as to anything that has been done by those who sit opposite. I return to some of the calmer things I had intended to say when I read the text. The Prime Minister is never what he seems: he comes in here in statesmanlike mode, with the tie in place, the posed dignity and the dropped voice; his followers are all behind him, and we are treated to a morally unctuous lecture, 'We in the Labor Party are the only people who care that people shouldn't be destroyed in a nuclear holocaust.' What a moral nerve you lot have to suggest that you are the only people in Australian politics who have any interest in the preservation of peace and stability! As my colleague the member for Mayo (Mr Downer) said yesterday, the goal of a nuclearfree world - as been shared across the political divide in Australia for about 30 years. The idea that it has only been in the last three or four days is ridiculous. All that the Prime Minister has done over the last three days is to recommit the Keating government to what has been a bipartisan constant of Australian politics for the last 30 years. That is all he has done. He has not struck out and embraced any new initiative; he has not peeled the scales away from the eyes of Australians; he has not unlocked us into some new understanding. All he has done has been to recommit his government to something that successive governments, be it the Menzies, Holt, Gorton, MCMahon, Whitlam, Fraser or Hawke governments-all of themMr Knott-You're kidding. Mr HOWARD Oh, it is getting too much-he's back. Good, I am very, very pleased to hear that.",57
52,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,I warn the member for Gilmore.,58
53,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"Don't warn him, Mr Deputy Speaker. Take pity on him. Let me just remind the House that the very treaty that the Prime Minister said was at the cornerstone of all that is good and holy in this debatethe nuclear non-proliferation treaty-says that it is to facilitate: . . . the cessation of the manufacture of nuclear weapons, the liquidation of all their existing stockpiles, and the elimination from national arsenals of nuclear weapons and the means of their delivery. That nuclear non-proliferation treaty came into being in 197O-not three days ago-:-and Australia became a signatory to that treaty in 1970. John Gorton was the Liberal Prime Minister of Australia in 1970. Mr Kerr interjecting",58
54,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"I think the member for Blaxland had entered parliament a few months earlier. I do not think he made any speeches about nuclear non-proliferation, any more than he made speeches about engagement with Asia. He made speeches about all sorts of other things-and that was his right-but he should not now try to rewrite history and give us moral lectures. We get this retrospective moral unction from the Prime Minister where he is always talking about reaching back, but he is reaching back to rewrite the pages of Australian history. Nothing could distort Australian history more than to suggest that the members of the opposition have only discovered a revulsion for nuclear weapons over the last three days. I am perfectly happy to accept that all the members of the Australian Labor Party are genuine in their desire to have a world free of nuclear weapons. I am perfectly happy to accept that most of them have had that view for many years. I simply say to the members of the Labor Party who sit opposite that they should accept that we on this side of the House have that same fervour, and have also felt that fervour for many years. Members opposite seem to have the idea that, somehow or other, like a repugnance towards racism, when it comes to nuclear weapons issues moral purity is something they have exclusively, just as they claim to have it in relation to other issues as well. This great weakness in their approach to politics. This issue of a nuclear-free world ought to be bipartisan. If the Prime Minister had not introduced that very sour, discordant, meanspirited, characteristic note towards the end of his speech, we may have come out of this debate as a group of people with a little more dignity. We may have made a greater impact. We may have impressed younger generations of Australians a little more. A great biblical injunction says that, as you sow, so shall you reap. The Prime Minister has sown discord and disharmony. He has introduced a sour note and resorted to this stultifying moral unction for which he is well known. It is not surprising that people will defend their contribution to the same cause over a very long periodMr Kerr interjecting",59
55,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"The Minister for Justice, who is at the table, can interject as much as he likes, but the whole tone of this debate was destroyed by the Prime Minister in the last three minutes of his address. The truth of the matter is that we on this side of the House are utterly and totally committed to the goal of a nuclear-free world. For the sake of ourselves, our children and future generations, however difficult it may be to obtain, we would all like nuclear weapons to be eliminated from the face of the earth. In the course of his speech, the Prime Minister acknowledged that, as a result of the end of the Cold War, we now live in an inherently less stable world environment so far as nuclear weapons are concerned. That is a very interesting admission. It is a little at odds with some of the things he has been saying about my foreign policy remarks over the past few weeks. However, along with the Prime Minister, I find the attitude of the French towards nuclear tests in the Pacific to be not only insensitive, but also, as the Prime Minister said, an act of complete folly. I find something Augustinian in the decision of the French to sign the protocols of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty after they have completed their tests. It is very much a question of 'Lord, make me pure, but not just yet.' I do not think the French comis a mitment, in those terms and in that context, is a very impressive commitment. And I agree very much with the Prime Minister on this point, that it does not do anything to assuage the sense of hostility and the sense of rejection that is felt across party lines, across generational lines-across all lines-in Australia towards what the French have done. The truth is that the world has changed utterly since the end of the Cold War. Before the Cold War ended, people had a different view about many of the things that bear upon this debate now. But I think all Australians, and people all around the world, felt that the end of the Cold War offered a new hope and a new opportunity for a world that, for almost two generations, had lived under the threat of nuclear annihilation. It is a sense of outrage and indignation that the French tests have generated-not only in the Australian community but around the world-that that new dawn following the end of the Cold War might be threatened that has led to such a widespread and spontaneous protest. In conclusion, on behalf of the opposition I want to say that, first and most importantly, we support utterly and without reservation any reasonable measures taken by this government to achieve the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. The second point I would make is that that has been a goal of successive Australian governments, of all political persuasions, for at least 25 or 30 years. not a sudden discovery of the Keating government. It is not a sudden discovery of this Prime Minister. It has been a goal attested to by the leaders of this country, from Sir Robert Menzies through to Paul Keating, over a very long period of time. So, with those qualifications and in that context, the opposition welcomes the statement of the Prime Minister. I think the written statement delivered to me was infinitely more appropriate for the occasion and infinitely more deserving of the almost unstinting bipartisan response that this kind of statement would have received. I have to say that it was a pity the occasion was not matched by the contribution of the leader of this country. It was an occasion to put party politics aside. It was an occasion to rise above the political point scoring which is a compulsive element of the man's character. It was an occasion that, once again, he failed to match. Debate (on motion by Mr Elliott) adjourned. Report of the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing: Government Response",59
56,Mr KERR,Unknown,"by leave-The Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing was established by resolution of the Senate on 2 September 1993. On 27 October 1993 the Senate referred to the committee for inquiry and report the Whistleblowers Protection Bill 1993, a private senator's biIl. The committee received 125 submissions and 12 supplementary submissions. In addition to a number of written responses to evidence and submissions, it took oral evidence at public hearings over seven days in November 1993 and in January and March 1994. The report of the committee was tabled in the Senate on 30 August 1994. An interim government response was tabled on 29 November 1994. The interim response stated that the government would endeavour to present a comprehensive response in February 1995. However, the government's response was deferred to await the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on It is Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the protection of confidential and third party information, the report of the commission of inquiry into the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the government response to the Public Service Act Review Group. I wish to express my thanks to the committee for its efforts. The subject of whistleblowing has been increasingly an issue on the national agenda. It is likely that the committee's report signifies the beginning of a new attitude to the general subject of whistleblowing. That state of affairs is consistent with the now well-established philosophy of this government to develop modem, responsible managerial practices in public administration which serve as a guide to the whole community. The government has decided to give in principle approval to the development of whistleblower legislation that will strengthen the position of public-spirited citizens within our modem managerial framework. First, however, I will briefly outline to you several matters which are relevant to whistleblowing. There are two reports that have a direct bearing on both the protection and disclosure of information and Public Service administration-the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report on the protection of confidential and third party information, and the report of the Public Service Act Review Group. These reports raise issues of direct relevance to any proposed whistleblowing scheme and it is appropriate to consider the detail of a whistleblowing scheme in the light of the recommendations contained within these reports. I also note that the public report of the commission of inquiry into the Australian Secret Intelligence Service supported the Gibbs committee's recommendations on the protection of whistleblowers. The government considers whistleblowing legislation to be an integral part of its response to the recommendations of the Samuels commission. In addition, the guidelines on official conduct of Commonwealth public servants, a revised edition of which was issued in March 1995, have been amended to explain how a disclosure of information can be made under existing laws and the protection that is currently available to whistleblowers. It should also be noted that the Financial Management and Accountability Bill will give responsibility to managers for identifying and responding to instances of maladministration. At the conclusion of my statement. I will present the government's detailed response to the committee's recommendations and, while that response indicates that the government's course of action on the issue of whistleblowing, I believe a short statement to explain what the government's proposed whistleblowing scheme is about is appropriate. The government understands the term whistleblowing to refer to the disclosure, in the public interest, of information which indicates wrongdoing. The public interest is in the fair and independent investigation of such allegations of wrongdoing, and the protection of a whistleblower from recrimination in the course of his or her employment following his or her disclosure of information. The government intends to introduce into parliament legislation for the protection of whistleblowers and the investigation of their allegations. In the Commonwealth sphere whistleblowing is hindered by provisions of the Crimes Act 1914 prohibiting the disclosure of official information. In December 1991 the Gibbs committee, in its review of Commonwealth criminal law, made certain recommendations for the reform of the laws on the disclosure of official information. The public report of the commission of inquiry into the Australian Secret Intelligence Service also recommended the introduction of whistleblowing legislation. It will be appropriate to introduce laws on whistleblowing, both as part of the government's implementation of the Gibbs committee's recommendations and as a part of the government's response to the recommendations of the Samuels committee of inquiry into ASIS. The scheme will be based upon a two-stage process-whistleblowing disclosure within a department or agency and then to an independent agency. This process is identical to the basis of the committee's proposed scheme and parallels arrangements that have been successful in other contexts, such as police complaints. The legislation will apply to Commonwealth officers and contractors. It will encourage them to use internal reporting mechanisms in the first instance in the form of an officer authorised to receive whistleblowing disclosures. The legislation will also provide for the use of existing independent reporting agencies-the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, the IGIS-to ensure that disclosures are received and investigated. The government anticipates that access to the MPRA will ensure that whistleblowers who are Commonwealth officers are protected from retaliation in the course of their employment. Government contractors and their employees will receive similar protection from recrimination by Commonwealth officers through the Commonwealth Ombudsman or the IGIS, as appropriate. Consequential amendments will be made to the relevant legislation to ensure that these independent agencies have the jurisdiction and powers appropriate to ensuring that the objectives of the proposed whistleblowing scheme are achieved. The committee emphasised that potential whistleblowers need to be reassured that their disclosures will be fully and properly investigated by an appropriate independent agency that is accountable for its activities. The Commonwealth Ombudsman will be required to oversee the operation of the whistleblowing scheme and prepare information for inclusion in his or her annual report. The IGIS will oversee the operation of the whistleblowing scheme in the intelligence and security agencies. The government proposes that an authorised officer who represents the internal reporting mechanism will be required to notify the Ombudsman of receipt of the whistleblower's complaint. The Ombudsman will have certain discretionary powers which may be exercised over the authorised officer's investigation of the disclosure. The authorised officer's decision to investigate the matter, or not, or to refer the matter to the Ombudsman or IGIS for investigation, or the result of the investigation, will be communicated to the whistleblower. If the whistleblower is dissatisfied with the authorised officer's decision not to investigate, or with the result of the investigation, the whistleblower can take the matter to the Ombudsman or the IGIS. The Ombudsman or IGIS will have a range of powers to investigate a whistleblower's allegations, including the power to refuse to do so. They will also have the power to refer the matter to any other appropriate agency, such as the Auditor General or the Privacy Commissioner, to be dealt with as that agency sees fit. The government does not consider it appropriate for a whistleblower to make public disclosures, either before using the whistleblower scheme or before a final determination has been made on the allegations. Whistleblowing allegations are serious matters requiring careful investigation. The information available to a whistleblower may not be complete, nor is the whistleblower usually in a position to make an independent assessment of the public interest considerations. The Ombudsman and the IGIS, on the other hand, are disinterested third parties who have powers and expertise to conduct full investigations to assess the allegations in their full context and to make judgments about the action required. Both the Ombudsman and the IGIS have the public interest as their primary concern. The public interest in creating a whistleblowing scheme is in the fair and independent investigation of allegations made by whistleblowers. Public disclosures may impair any investigation into the allegation. Whistleblowers who publicly disclose material after an investigation is complete will need to ensure that any such disclosure does not breach existing secrecy and privacy laws or the limits of their authorisation to disclose information. The Ombudsman will have a discretion to make public statements about whistleblowing matters as appropriate. The Ombudsman will also include information about whistleblowing in his or her annual report. Existing powers to make special reports to the Prime Minister or parliament by the Ombudsman or the MPRA will apply to the whistleblowing matters. The government has given detailed consideration to all of the committee's recommendations and acknowledges the substantial assistance it has obtained from the committee's report in formulating the first scheme for the protection of whistleblowers and the investigation of their allegations at the Commonwealth level. I present the following papers: Report of the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing: Government Response Report of the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest: Government Response-Ministerial Statement, 26 October 1995. Motion (by Mr Elliott) proposed: That the House take note of the papers.",60
57,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"Berowra) (1.54 p.m.)First, let me canvass a couple of matters relating to the way in which this matter has been dealt with. The government has finally seen fit to produce a response to the report of the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing. The terms of reference for the committee were set on 2 September 1993 with the committee reporting in August 1994. It is now October 1995 and, of course, it is at this time that the government has finally seen fit to produce its response. I am told that the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) did advise that it would not be possible to meet normal reporting commitments to the parliament. He said that he proposed to have a response after the Christmas break, in early 1995, so it was almost eight months ago that one might have expected such a response. I am not aware of any further reports to the parliament indicating that there were reasons for delay, other than the comments now that the government deferred responding to that committee report to await a report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the protection of confidential and third-party information, the report of the inquiry of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, and the government's response to the Public Service Act Review Group. It is amazing, when a Senate committee puts in as much work as was put into this report, and particularly given the commitment of my colleague Senator Jocelyn Newman to this particular cause which led to the setting up of this Senate select committee whose report the government is responding to, that, when the government deems it appropriate to bring a response forward, it does so largely without notice. It certainly did not see fit to provide a copy to Senator Newman, who was the chair of the committee.",62
58,Mr KERR,Unknown,Of course I did.,63
59,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,Presumably at the same time as I received a copy to respond to.,63
60,Mr KERR,Unknown,No. Before that.,63
61,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,How long? The advice I have is that Senator Newman does not have an opportunity to respond to this report because she had commitments in Tasmania and that she was not advised that the government response would be tabled.,63
62,Mr KERR,Unknown,A copy was provided. Your understanding is incorrect.,63
63,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"That is the understanding I have, and I have some notes from Senator Newman that I saw and so became aware that this matter was being dealt with. We also have no indication as to what the government sees as an appropriate program to implement its response. I just draw attention to the question that was being asked by my colleague the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) as to when we might see some legislation to give effect to the government's acceptance of certain recommendations and the government's response. It also needs to be understood that in this matter the government has not adopted all of the committee's recommendations. The response is, in a sense, quite limited. The Senate committee inquiry into whistleblowing was a landmark. It highlighted the important role that whistleblowers could play in ensuring open and accountable government. It also revealed the enormous personal and professional sacrifices that many whistleblowers have made in doing what they believe was the right thing, that is, exposing corruption, waste, inefficiency or dangerous practices. The life of a whistleblower can be a very lonely one. I think the Senate committee took some evidence in relation to that. It takes enormous courage for a person to take on an organisation, particularly one with which they have been associated, be it a company or a large government department. There is not much in the way of rewards for whistleblowers. I suppose they might be able, if they wrote books or something of this nature, to get some royalties. But the only real reward is being able to live with an honest conscience and the slight hope that their decision to blow the whistle may lead to a change for the better or that they are doing the organisation they work for a favour. The reality, which was borne out in the Senate committee inquiry, is that many whistleblowers are ostracised or punished for their public-spirited actions. Some organisations, including government departments and private businesses, can make the life of a whistleblower pure hell. They can be subjected to total isolation in the workplace, they can be assigned meaningless work tasks, they can have to endure verbal and physical abuse and they can have their sanity questioned. I know, from personal friends who have been at the wrong end, I suppose, of companies that have been concerned about information which they were aware of and concerned about, that it can pose long-term jeopardy in employment terms for people who have been involved in private sector areas where these matters might be raised. Under the enormous pressure, the health of a whistleblower can suffer dramatically. Indeed, a person who sets out to do the right thing can be met with such a vindictive and unrelenting response that the end result can be very severe psychological stress. It is said that it is a vicious cycle. The whistleblower is psychologically worn down and forced into a defensive position, leading to a decline in their performance and relationships with colleagues, giving the organisation ultimately an opportunity to sack that person for what they see as being inadequate performance. Whistleblowers are often made an example of, and usually for the worse. Instead of being rewarded and acknowledged for their publicspirited work in bringing forward information, they are frequently punished. Such treatment, of course, sends a clear message to other would be whistleblowers. One of the reasons that this committee report came forward was to give people who take a public-spirited approach to these matters a way of being able to deal with them, and to protect them. It is in that context that I want to address the way in which the government has responded to the committee's report. The government has not adopted all of the committee's recommendations. In fact, it seems to me that the principal recommendations have been largely avoided. I will draw attention in the first instance to the first and second series of recommendations. The first dealt with the need for a national education campaign. The committee recommended: · . . in order to enhance the campaign's acceptance and likelihood of success, strong public statements of support should be given at the political, senior management and union level. I suspect that as you read the response of the minister today you would hardly say that it is a glowing endorsement of whistleblowing. In fact, in its response the government says: · .. as the proposed whistleblowing scheme will be a strengthening of existing policy, it will not be necessary to engage in a national education campaign. It goes on to say: The new legislative regime will be publicised by the Government and will become a part of existing information campaigns. The committee went on to recommend: · .. the proposed national education campaign should involve recent developments in ethics and accountability as a base from which to emphasise, in positive terms for the organisation and ultimately the public interest, the benefits of reporting wrongdoing ... The government says that it still does not consider that a national education campaign is necessary on that matter. It is interesting that the government takes this approach in a matter of this sort, yet when the matter involves citizenship the government thinks it necessary to have an education campaign which, over some 3Y2 years, is going to involve $17 million of taxpayers' money. One ought not to be surprised that money can be found, and in very large leaks, if it suits the government's purpose, but if matters of a different character are involved quite a different approach is taken. The principal recommendation developed by the committee was for a public interest disclosures agency, and it set out a very detailed proposed legislative regime for such an agency. The government's response has been to reject that. It has said in its response that it is not accepted. The government believes that the existing agencies-the Ombudsman, the Merit Protection and Review Agency and IGIS-will be the appropriate independent organisations upon which the government's proposed scheme will be based. The government goes to the point of even emphasising at the end of its response: The Government does not accept that a Public Interest Disclosures Board is necessary. The committee believed that a public interest disclosures agency and the provisions of supporting legislation should be given the widest coverage constitutionally possible, but the government takes the view that it should not extend to the private sector. The government also has significant reservations about including government business enterprises in the proposed scheme, although it says that it will be considered after the government has responded to the report of the Administrative Review Council on related matters. The recommendations went on to cover academic institutions. The government makes it very clear that it is limited to Commonwealth officers and contractors and that any whistleblowing schemes in academic institutions are matters for those bodies themselves to consider. Similarly, in relation to the health care industry, it takes the view that the scheme should not be extended to that area. It takes the view in relation to banking, and the Reserve Bank in particular, that it ought not to cover that area. The government does not accept either of the recommendations. It does not consider it appropriate to amend the charter of the Reserve Bank. I suppose what it is saying is that if there were a cosy deal between the Prime Minister and the Governor of the Reserve Bank which somebody was able to blow the whistle on, legislation ought not run to protecting people involved in that situation or for any investigation of it. It deals with the Australian Federal Police. The committee recommended that the Australian Federal Police be covered by whistleblower protection legislation, yet the government takes the view that protection for whistleblowers and for independent investigation of their allegations is already in place in the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act. I guess it takes the view that all the arrangements are adequate, even while some officers and former officers of the Australian Federal Police have been the subject of quite significant criticism in the Wood royal commission in New South Wales. The government looks at the recommendation dealing with the matters that might be covered. The committee took the view that illegality, infringement of the law, fraudulent and corrupt conduct, as well as substantial misconduct, mismanagement, maladministration, gross and substantial waste of public funds and resources, endangering public health and safety, and danger to the environment ought to be matters to be covered. Yet we have outlined in the scheme that the government intends the Ombudsman should administer that certain limited categories of wrongdoing will be the subject of review-in other words, an indictable offence against the law of a state or territory. So it is not ty, it is not infringement of the law, fraudulent or corrupt conduct, but it now has to be an indictable offence. What we are saying to people is that they have to form almost a legal judgment in relation to these matters before they can raise them in the context of the government's proposed legislation. That will have to be formed by the person before they can deal with the matter. It does go on to deal with gross mismanagement, gross waste of funds, a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety or danger to the environment. I think the only one there that is clearly covered is danger to the environment, amongst those matters that have been picked up by the committee-in other words, that had not been subject to a qualification. I think it needs to be understood that the government has decided that whistleblowing issues should be addressed through existing agencies. It has certainly brought forward a response which has largely left to one side the committee's scheme that was proposed and a much more limited arrangement has been substituted by the government as a response to the committee's report. Obviously, we will be giving further consideration to these matters. The way in which the government has dealt with this matter needs to be seen as a step in the right direction, but one in which, I suggest, looking at the report that the government had before it, a great deal more could have been done.",63
64,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,I call the minister.,65
65,Mr KERR,Unknown,"Thank you, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER Mrs Sullivan-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: is the minister, by receiving the call now, dosing the debate?",65
66,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"He has not moved the motion yet. But, to answer your question, I know you desire to speak in this debate. The agreement between the Leader of the House and the Manager of Opposition Business was that there would be only one opposition speaker. The member for Berowra has spoken. The normal call will now go to illegalithe government side-the minister. Mrs Sullivan-With indulgence, can I say that it is up to the minister. I was unaware that this was being tabled and unaware of the contents until I sat here and listened to it. It was my intention to speak only very briefly, for a couple of minutes. I understand that the debate could go on after the minister finishes, if that agreement might be extended.",65
67,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,My understanding is that the minister is about to move for the adjournment of the debate.,66
68,Mr KERR,Unknown,"I do. I wish no discourtesy, but there was an understanding. I move: That the debate be adjourned. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA AMENDMENT (CARER PENSION AND OTHER MEASURES) ACT 1995 Cognate bill: SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' NA AMENDMENT BILL 1995 Second Reading Debate resumed from 25 October, on motion by Mrs Crosio: That the bill be now read a second time.",66
69,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,"In resuming this debate this afternoon on this social security and veteran's affairs legislation, I first wish to respond to some of the comments that the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), the shadow minister for social security, made in his contribution to the debate yesterday afternoon. It will come as no surprise to the House that the honourable member for Berowra once more moved his regular amendment to the second reading motion, which he has done on every single occasion that we have had social security legislation before this House. He has moved that all words after 'That' be omitted and then put forward a motion condemning the government for all sorts of sins and evil practices that we are alleged to have undertaken. It is becoming a very boring practice by the shadow minister and, unfortunately, it has absolutely no credibility. When one listens to what the honourable member for Berowra had to say in response to this enormous package of amendments which will significantly improve the social security benefits of hundreds of thousands of Australian citizens, we find the regular trotting out of all sorts of condemnations for every possible savings measure that the government introduces in this legislation. Of course, any benefit that we actually provide is never seen as good enough and it has never gone far enough. Throughout his contribution to this debate yesterday afternoon he constantly used the term 'mean-spirited'. It becomes a bit of a broken record when we hear the honourable member for Berowra speak on social security legislation, because he constantly attacks the government on its program on social security, yet never once does he actually enunciate a clearly stated opposition policy platform on social security. When one examines all of the commitments, promises and shady innuendo that the shadow minister puts forward as the opposition's position on social security, one starts to get a very interesting picture of the way in which the opposition is treating this very important issue. One has to understand that social security benefits touch the lives of the vast majority of Australians. Social security benefits go to things such as family payments, unemployment benefits and age pensions-a whole host of benefits that probably touch almost 75 or 80 per cent of Australian families. Yet we never actually hear any substance from the opposition about what it would do. We have had all sorts of promises from the opposition on things. It is on the record that the honourable member for Berowra goes around to pensioner groups saying, 'Yes, we would do all of these wonderful things if we were in power.' He has now been going around the community promising a universal pension, when he knows that that is an unachievable aim. He realises that such an offer would cost some $5 billion to the Commonwealth taxpayer. Yet he is going around suggesting that if they got into power that would be something they would be looking at and they would give the pension to everybody, regardless of their assets. The shadow minister has made all sorts of other promises about what he would do for the guardians allowance and for various groups in the community. When you actually add up all of the costs of these tions and all of the criticisms and condemnations he makes about the government, you find that the opposition would have to spend several billion dollars more on social security than we currently spend. That stands in stark contrast with the aim and ambition of the opposition. If they are going to achieve some of their other commitments that they have made in policy pronouncements in and outside this place, they will have to make savings of around $9 billion to $12 billion a year from social security. Mr Ronaldson-I can feel a scare campaign coming on, Garrie.",66
70,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,"I am accused of running a scare campaign. The opposition would be able to counter that scare campaign if they started taking the people of Australia into their trust and told them what they have planned. If members of the opposition do not want a scare campaign, they should start telling people what their policies will be. What do they have to hide? We hear that they do not want to tell their policies because that dreadful Labor Party will start telling people what they might mean and that they do not want to start exposing themselves to scrutiny by the media or by the constituents because they might find out what awful things they are going to do to them. Members of the opposition are upset because they announced Fightback about 18 months before the last election and we had the dreadful hide to tell the is what Fightback actually meant. So the opposition have said, 'Oh, we can't do that now. This time we are not going to tell the people of Australia what our policies are.' They do not want people to know what is behind those policies. They do not want to expose themselves to scrutiny, so they are not going to tell anybody in Australia what they are going to do. They will just spring all their policies on them a couple of weeks prior to the election so nobody will have any chance to scrutinise what impact they might have on families, the unemployed, age pensioners, veterans, other beneficiaries or the whole community, depending on what the policy little sugges- package will be. Members of the opposition do not want to tell anybody these policies because they might be exposed once more, yet they will go around the community and make all sorts of shady little promises and suggest all sorts of things like they are listening to people and know what their needs are. Yet, in reality, their basic, principal position that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) set out in his so-called headland statements he made in the last few months was a promise of smaller government, leaner government, and less taxation. The Leader of the Opposition says he is going to achieve smaller government. Look at what the Labor Party has achieved. We have got the smallest bite on the nation's purse of any government in the last 50 years. If the Leader of the Opposition is going to make government leaner and meaner-the emphasis being on 'meaner' when it comes to the opposition-he will have to massively slash expenditure. How will he slash expenditure? In the Commonwealth budget, one-third of all expenditure is in the social security portfolio. Another quarter of all expenditure is on health and community services. Those two portfolios touch the lives of every single Australian. They spend over 50 per cent of the Commonwealth's budget. The next area is in higher education, training, jobs and labour market programs. That is probably another 15 per cent of the Commonwealth budget. So those are the three big ticket items of federal people of Austral- expenditure.",67
71,Mr KERR,Unknown,He could take it out of defence.,67
72,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,"He would find taking it out of defence difficult, I would suggest. If he does, he is going to have another group of the constituency very angry with him about that as well. Those three big ticket items that touch the lives of every single Australiansocial security, health and community services, and education-are what we spend 65 to 70 per cent of the Commonwealth's budget on. This coalition, which advocates leaner, meaner government, goes around the community promising the world to everybody without any specifics, without any policy package, without any detail. The shadow minister for social security got up in this parliament last night and claimed how dreadful and mean-spirited members of the Labor Party are for making a savings measure of $3 million or $4 millioncounterbalanced, could I say, with benefits of $60 million or $70 million that are contained in the various amendments in the package we are debating today. This is from the meanspirited, horrible Labor Party that we are, yet the opposition has to save $9 billion to $12 billion. We are extending benefits to a range of people and improving benefits for a range of people.",67
73,Mr KERR,Unknown,"We're a great government. Mr GffiSON-We are a great government. We have done outstanding things in social security and in targeting benefits to the community. But every time we do it, it is not enough! We are accused of being meanspirited. Let's start having some reality debate. Let's start having some specifics. What has the opposition got to hide? What is their secret agenda to attack the welfare of Australian families? When are they going to start being honest with the people of Australia and give us some detail? If they think they can go to this next election hiding all of their evil agenda behind their cloaks and hoping that they will fool the people of Australia, I am afraid they have another think coming. The people of Australia are much wiser and much more sensible than that. They are able to understand that, if the opposition is not prepared to put forward clear and specific policies, they have to look at the opposition's track record. The opposition's track record in the area of social security has been one of slash and bum, of wanting to cut benefits. Let's look at what they did to pensions. In their last period of government pensions fell to an all-time low. When John Howard was Treasurer, the average rate of pensions was only 22.7 per cent of average weekly earnings. Under a Labor government, we have consistently increased those pensions and got the value of pensions back up to over 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. We have continued to improve benefits to pensioners. If the opposition is not prepared to come forward with some details and some specifics about what they will do in social security or in any other portfolio area, we will have to be reliant on looking back on their track record and looking back on their previous policy pronouncements, such as in Fightback. We have to make the judgment that they will again be a slash and bum administration for the families of Australia and that they will cause havoc to social security recipientssome 80 per cent of Australian families, across the community. The opposition shadow spokesperson on social security made a number of comments. He claimed that he had very little notice of this legislation. It was introduced into the House some eight or nine days before we had to start debating it. He criticised the government for not giving pensioners and the rest of the community enough knowledge about this. in this That argument falls on very stony ground when you realise that almost every part of this bill is a budget measure. It was announced in this House as part of the budget. The opposition has had since May to read about what the government intended to do in these social security measures. It is absolutely false to accuse the government of not having told social security recipients about these measures. I have here a copy of a Department of Social Security letter sent in May to all age pensioners about the changes to deeming rules, which we are talking about in this legislation. I have here a copy of Age Pension News of June, which again sets out all the information about the budget measures that we are debating in this House today. So there has been ample opportunity for pensioners and other social security recipients around Australia to know about these clauses and to consider them. In fact, the overwhelming response from the aged community and from the social welfare community has been one of commendation and congratulations to the government for the measures that we have contained in this legislation. These are clearly pieces of legislation that will benefit social security recipients. They are supported by the aged community and by the social welfare community. So the mean-spiritedness in this debate all exists in the opposition's mind. It does not reflect the accurate situation with regard to this legislation. We also had the opposition getting up on its hind legs and complaining about our position with Meridian Investment Trust. The shadow minister for social security claimed once more that our decision was mean-spirited. Let's look at what the government has announced with Meridian Investment Trust. We have decided that the government will extend the deeming measure. In reality, we have created a situation of providing a virtual lump sum to the people who are members of Meridian Investment Trust. We will be making an ex gratia payment, calculated using the five and seven per cent deeming rates in line with the extended deeming provisions that will come into operation in July. This payment will be calculated as soon as possible and backdated to the next pension day. This means that we are providing the full benefit to those people and they will not be suffering as a result of the collapse of Estate Mortgage. We have taken into account their needs and given them a complete benefit. Again, the shadow minister claimed that this was being meanspirited in dealing with these things. There are a number of very positive measures in this bill. The most important one is the deeming on financial investments. The new measures that we are putting in place are a reflection of the major recommendation of the inquiry that was established by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) and which resulted in the report Targeting for equity. It supported a broader deeming approach to investments as fairer and simpler. The federal government has agreed to extend deeming to financial investments, and this includes all bank, building society and credit union accounts; cash, term deposits, friendly society bonds and other managed investments; and shares, loans and debentures. But the measures will not affect the family home; car; stamp, coin and antique collections; life insurance policies; and farms, holiday homes and other real estate. From July next year, the old rules about measuring the various capital growth and investment growth on those investments will no longer apply. All the financial investments will be assessed under the one set of rules. The lower deeming rate of five per cent will apply to the first $30,000 of financial investments for single pensioners and the first $50,000 for couples. A higher rate of seven per cent will apply to the value of financial investments over these amounts. Those deeming amounts have been set at a very conservative and quite an achievable level. The government has given some 15 months notice of these changes to enable pensioners to have plenty of time to make whatever arrangements are required to change their investments so that they are able to achieve those investment rules. We have also introduced a major expansion in the financial investment advisory service for pensioners to assist them in doing that. We have not just changed the rules and left people to their own devices. We have also provided some significant additional free advice from the department to assist them to make whatever changes might be required. We have given them 15 months notice that these changes will occur. We have also said that, if they have to change their investment from one form to another in that period, they will not be penalised at all. Any capital growth they have that is measured in that time will not be taken into account. We have made the rules as reasonable and as fair as possible. The pensioner and aged communities in Australia have welcomed these changes and said that they are very progressive, fair and reasonable. They are all delighted. But the shadow minister criticises us and attacks us, saying that we are doing it too quickly. That is absolute bunkum. If he dares to actually consult with the aged community, which I know he is not prepared to do, he will find that they support the changes. We have made a number of other changes. This legislation provides some significant improvements to carers' benefits. They have been broadly welcomed by the carer community. They have received quite significant support. There is a whole range of amendments contained in one of the bills that we are debating today which will make a significant contribution to supporting the caring role of families, especially as our population ages. The amendments recognise that many people who need full-time care often prefer to be cared for at home or in familiar surroundings. The changes brought forward in this legislation recognise that the people who perform the role of carer need financial support arrangements which are as flexible as possible. The government has listened carefully to the concerns raised by carer organisations and the International Year of the Family Council. The changes mean that people receiving care will no longer have to get a pension in order for their carer to qualify for the carer pension. From March next year, as long as their family income is less than $61,000 and their assets are worth less than half a million dollars, they will be able to have someone on a carer pension to look after them. These limits will rise in line with the basic family payment income and assets test. A number of other changes which have been introduced have been broadly welcomed by the carer community. I add that there is a clause not appearing in this bill. It has been taken out as a result of this government listening to the community and, particularly, listening to the backbench on this side of the House.",68
74,Mr KERR,Unknown,"A lot of work that you put in, too. Mr GmSON-Thank you. There was a lot of work put in by both me and the caucus community services committee. That change is to the wives pension. Earlier this year, the government introduced a measure that said that there will no longer be wives pensions granted to women aged under 40 whose partners are on some age pension benefit. But a number of people already on the wives pension were going to be taken off. We felt that it was unfair to take people off a benefit they were already receiving, so that particular clause has now been removed. I congratulate the minister and the cabinet for having the understanding and the compassion and for listening to the community and responding by taking this clause out of the bill. There is another major change to the legislation, relating to the mature age allowance, which we have now called the Maggie Deahm amendment. She will be coming into the House to outline the improvements in that area. I congratulate the member for Macquarie for the work she did in achieving that change. All in all, this is a very comprehensive package of improvements for social security recipients. (Time expired)",70
75,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,"I get sick and tired of hearing government members criticise the opposition for failing to have disclosed all of our policies for the next election, which could well be up to six months away. If honourable members opposite had a reasonable memory, they would know that in the Australian political tradition political parties usually announce their policies some six weeks prior to the actual election date, at the commencement of the formal campaign period. There are, of course, occasions when political parties differ from this arrangement, but the standard practice has been that parties announce their policies at the commencement of the election campaign. One only has to go back to the time prior to the election of 1983 to appreciate that the Labor Party did not release its policy until the election was actually called. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), who in a very short space of time will be the Prime Minister of this nation, has made a series of headland speeches in which he has outlined the general policy thrust and direction of the coalition. In effect, he has been indicating what we stand for, and I believe this is well recognised in the Australian community. It is very clear that this government is absolutely desperate. It is absolutely terrified of being tossed from office at the next election. That is why it is urging us constantly to release our policy proposals precipitately. I make a pledge to the Australian people. At the time of the next election, the coalition's policies will be clearly on the table. They will be open for full scrutiny and we are quite happy to be judged on our policies. We will, however, release our policies at an appropriate time, prior to the election. There is no question of our going into the election without policies. We will have policies. They will be firm, decisive policies. Those policies will be a recipe for the recovery of this nation. Of course, the Labor Party over the last 13 years has a sad and sorry history in government. It has presided over the widening of the gap between rich and poor in this nation. The government will be absolutely thrashed at the next election because of its failure to deal with the major problems confronting Australia. We have perhaps two million people unable to find adequate work. We have 800,000 people unable to find a job. Yet this government has masqueraded as the champion of the underprivileged. It is a fraud and it will be rejected as such at the next election. The bills we are discussing today are the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill and Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1995. As has been indicated by the shadow minister, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), this legislation has been rush-d into the House, obviously with a view to clearing the decks for the next election. Indeed, the government has introduced this legislation, which, we admit, includes partly budget measures but also non-budget measures. There are changes to what the government outlined at the time of the budget. When one looks at the two bills and the explanatory memoranda resulting from those bills, we see a total of 741 pages. Yet on these very major bills the government is permitting the Australian community very little debate. With bills and explanatory memoranda of 741 pages, what the government is doing with the introduction of this legislation is treating the parliament like a sausage machine; it is not letting the legislation lie on the table clearly for full debate in the Australian community. Thus my colleague the shadow minister has indicated that the coalition will be moving an amendment to the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 which is in the following form: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Government should be condemned for: (1) its cavalier treatment of the House by providing only 8 days between the introduction of the Bill and its second reading debate to enable consideration of the detailed provisions of complex legislation contained in the Bill; (2) its failure to draft the Bill to include detail as to the timing and regularity of valuation of financial investments under the extended deeming rules introduced in Schedule 1 of the Bill; (3) failing to advise Australians adequately that it estimates that the extended deeming rules will result in 207,000 pensioners suffering a decrease in their pension if they do not rearrange their assets to meet or exceed the deeming rates; (4) its failure to adequately assist investors of the Meridian Investment Trust who have been disadvantaged by the unrealised capital gains provisions currently contained in Part 3.10 of the Social Security Act, and (5) failing to address the potentially adverse impact of the extended deeming rules on the holders of investments in friendly societies"". It is clear that an election is just around the comer. It is also clear from public indications that the coalition has made that we are prepared to stand up in this place and in the Australian community to give support to investors in the Meridian Investment Trust. We find that the government belatedly is trying to do something for those people who were disadvantaged as a result of the collapse of Estate Mortgage. What the government is doing is not enough, but certainly it is a step in the right direction. It is obvious that the government has been sorely embarrassed into responding to the plight of the Meridian Investment unit holders. Of course, as I have said, we were going to publicly, in this place, expose the government for what it was. The government's response, in our view, is inadequate. All the government seeks to do is to make provision for an ex gratia payment. As the honourable member for Berowra has said, this is a meanspirited response and, in my view, it is totally inadequate. Unlike other holders of saved investment, Estate Mortgage unit holders will be deemed to have earned income of either five per cent or seven per cent on their investment. The opposition has proposed that these investments would have been entirely exempt until July next year when the new deeming arrangements would commence for all investments, including those now regarded as saved investments. The government has done a backflip in relation to the investment holders in the Meridian Investment Trust. It is not too late for the government to adopt the proposal as suggested by the opposition. I can see that the honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) has come into the chamber. I would ask that she consider adopting the proposals which have been put forward by the honourable member for Berowra. The bills before the chamber at the moment were provided to the coalition only just over a week ago. As I have pointed out, they are very lengthy bills. When one looks at the total number of pages in the bills and explanatory memoranda, it is very clear that eight days is simply not an adequate time in which to digest the complexity of them. I think the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) pointed out that these were budget measures. They are certainly partly budget measures. But the opposition must look closely at the fine print of any legislation because, in many cases, the devil is in the detail. The government is introducing more than 40 amendments to the act, and we believe that these amendments should be subjected to the closest of parliamentary scrutiny. I do understand that part of the reason for the delay in the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill was the fact that the government needed to have it reprinted at public expense to remove the measure announced in the budget, to remove women under the age of 40 from the wives pension. The government announced that certain law changes would be made in the budget and the government has now done a backflip. Clearly, people in Australia, before they know what the budget is ultimately going to mean, must look at the detail of legislation passed through this House because quite often what becomes law is very substantially different from what is initially proposed by the government. We are also concerned about the area of valuation of investments. The government has argued the new deeming rules are attractive because they will create certainty. Payments will not move up and down depending on the value of their investments. But no provision has been made in the bill to determine how often the assets of a person are to be valued. At present, people are required to notify the department each time the value of their assets changes and their pension will be adjusted accordingly. There is a penalty involved if a person fails to advise the department of a change which leads to a debt due. People will be in the same uncertain position under the new rules as they were under the previous unrealised capital gains tax provisions. Apparently, the department aims to achieve a system which is administratively workable and is the least demanding method on the recipients as possible. The system in the form it is to take must be enshrined in the act. We believe the matter should be referred to the Senate Community Affairs Committee to consider the issue of appropriate timing and regularity of valuation and, if possible, amendments should be made to incorporate an appropriate scheme. It could provide for valuation at the election of beneficiaries if no scheme is outlined by the government. In relation to budget savings, we notice the government has lauded the new system as being advantageous to recipients, but the Labor government has estimated it will result in savings of $62.58 million in 1996-97 and $65.02 million in 1997-98. The government has estimated that 270,000 pensioners and part pensioners will see a decrease in the pension if they do not rearrange their assets to meet or exceed the deeming rates. Pensioners or part pensioners who lose their pension will also lose their fringe benefit entitlements arising from concession cards. Given the drop in interest rates and the way in which many pensioners and retirees have been so affected adversely by those drops in interest rates, it is very clear that many of them depend on the fringe benefit entitlements and on the concession cards. The government itself estimates that 120,000 people will see an increase in their pension on average of only about $4 a week. One does not have to go to many department stores or supermarkets to realise that $4 does not go very far. It ought to be recognised that this bill and these changes are an initiative of the Labor government. I hope that at the next election people will remember this fact. Even if people are only first affected in July 1996, after the election, after there has been a change of governmentMs Deahm-Dream on.",70
76,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,You won't be here next year and I wish you a long and happy retirement. Ms Deahm-I'll be here.,73
77,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,"No, you won't. You'll be gone with half the government benches. We wish you all a long and happy retirement. We wish them well, but we know they have no future in this place. Mr Deputy Speaker Les Scott, you might be here because you have a very big margin, but you are one of the few who could be. Then again, even you might not be here because the people of Queensland are obviously very opposed to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). If you look at every opinion poll, you will find in Queensland the Prime Minister has an approval rating in the 20s. While there is a possibility-I suggest that it is not a high possibility-that you will be here, I suggest that you enjoy your limited time left in the chair during the dying days of this parliament. The point I was making, though, is that, even if people are only affected in July 1996, it is very important to remember that these changes, if implemented, will be a legacy of the Keating Labor government. I pointed out the situation of those investors in the Meridian Investment Trust. The government was initially going to leave those people high and dry. Those people lost a lot of money. I think every member in the Commonwealth parliament would have received representations from investors who lost money with Estate Mortgage. I think it was terrible that the government, in its initial legislation, was in effect laughing in the faces of these people, many of whom lost their entire retirement nest egg because of the collapse of Estate Mortgage. The shadow minister for social security stood up in the parliament and said that the coalition would publicly take a very strong stand to achieve justice for investors in the Meridian Investment Trust. The government initially intended to reject the amendment and treat investors in the Meridian Investment Trust like dirt. I am pleased that the government is going to make some improvement, but regrettably the government is simply going to make an ex gratia payment. It is going to be mean-spirited and is not going to give the investors in the Meridian Investment Trust the treatment they should receive. The coalition proposed that these investments would have been entirely exempt until July next year when the new deeming arrangements would commence for all investments, including those now regarded as saved investments. Ms Deahm interjecting",73
78,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,"It is not too late for you to change your mind. You have done one backflip. You are prepared to go some small distance to assist investors in the Meridian Investment Trust. I hope you will join us because this would be an excellent opportunity for bipartisanship. It would be an excellent opportunity for you to show that you are prepared to join with the coalition in making positive changes to legislation which would bring fairness and equity to so many Australians who, through no fault of their own, have been disadvantaged as a result of the problems with Estate Mortgage. Considerable concerns have been expressed, particularly by members of the Australian Friendly Societies Association, about changes made in the area of friendly society bonds. Members and senators on this side of the parliament, and I suspect those opposite, have received representations from the peak friendly societies organisation and maybe from individual members of those friendly societies. The Australian Friendly Societies Association has asserted that provision should be made to treat tax prepaid investments, such as friendly society bonds, differently from products on which tax is not prepaid but the investor pays tax at their own marginal tax rate. The association argues that returns from prepaid tax products will necessarily be lower than those available to non-pre-tax paid investments as the tax has been paid prior to the distribution to the investor. The Australian Friendly Societies Association has argued that they will be unfairly prejudiced under the new rules as they do not have the ability returns equal to or more than the deeming rates of five and seven per cent. It is interesting to note that there are bers and associations throughout Australia, but there are many in the state of Victoria. There are approximately 400,000 pensioners with total investments of $2.8 billion. The association has made a number of alternative suggestions which could solve the problem which the government's legislation is going to create. Those suggestions include the possibility of introducing a differential deeming rate for pre-tax paid investments which take account of the fact that tax has been paid prior to distribution to the investor; the pensioner being able to remain in the bond and being assessed on realisation-that is, maintaining the current practice-and amending division 8A of the Income Tax Assessment Act to enable friendly societies to provide income stream products which allow pensioners to switch to the product without tax penalty. It has been suggested that there should be a full assessment of the merits of the representations and indeed whether the deeming rules should be changed, whether the tax legislation should be amended, or whether no changes should be made. We believe these are matters which should also be considered by the Senate Community Affairs Committee. One is given only 20 minutes to speak on legislation in this place. The government has brought in two very large bills. It has given the parliament only eight days to peruse the draft of the legislation. Yet we find there are going to be amendments to the drafts as printed. It is clear that the government is seeking to pump this legislation through the parliament as quickly as possible. I get sick and tired of hearing members opposite suggest that they somehow are the repository of care and concern for the underprivileged. We have only to look at the appalling record of this government in increasing the inequities in Australia to appreciate that when people like the honourable member for Moreton claim that the government is the party of the battlers they are entirely out of order. The opposition is prepared to stand up for all Australians, to deliver including the Aussie battler. Over the last 13 years there have been five federal elections and the Labor Party has been memreturned on every occasion. The government has been prepared to lie, rob and cheat its way into office. This government is prepared to say absolutely anything to gain the support of the people. Prior to the last election the Prime Minister, not expecting that he would be returned to office, made an enormous number of promises which he and the government had absolutely no intention of keeping. We also found that they sought to misrepresent the very detailed policies released at that time by the coalition. We have a situation now where we are in the run-up to the next election. It might well be held on 2, 9 or 16 December. It might well be held some time in February, March, April or May. The Prime Minister is desperately looking for an opportunity to go to the people with a chance of success. But with the appalling record of this government it is very clear that this government will be swept from office whenever the election is called. While we do not really care when it is held, we invite the Prime Minister to go to the Governor General. We want an election now. (Time expired)",73
79,Ms DEAHM,Unknown,"It has been fascinating listening to the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) in this debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill 1995 and its cognate bill. I would like to assure him that I will be here after the next election. People have put money on it. Mr O'Keefe-Hear, hear!",74
80,Ms DEAHM,Unknown,"I think the member for Burke might be one of those who has taken a bet on it in my favour. I want to speak about the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, and I will be doing so in two parts. It is a great pleasure to speak on this because it contains measures introduced by the budget earlier this year. The opposition have known about them since that time, so I do not know why they are whingeing now about suddenly having to debate them. It also brings in other measures which are basically revisions of existing measures and legislation. They show that this government is very good at listening to people-listening to those who receive social security benefits, to those who care for them, and to those out in the community who have brought to us, as their local members, and to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), matters that need changing. One of those changes-I thank my friend and colleague the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) for his kind words, saying that this is another Deahm amendment-resulted from a committee that I chaired. That committee was itself a result of the government's move to equalise eligibility for the age pension. As we know, the pension age for women will be changed to 65, to be phased in over 20 years. While the opposition castigated us for that move, in their promises before the last election they were also going to bring in this change, but phased in over 10 years, which would have created more hardship for a lot more women. Nevertheless, any sort of change like this affects a wide number of people. I suspect that in the future most women will have superannuation and will not be needing a pension. The women who will actually have to wait until 65 for an age pension are younger women now who have become used to equal pay and equal opportunity-although this benefit is not by any means fully available to all women-but accept the fact that if they want to be treated equally they have to accept the equal pension age. But there were a lot of women in their midto late 50s who saw this as a problemwomen who were ill, women who were hanging on, waiting to retire because they were, frankly, exhausted, and women whose marriages had broken up and have had to go out to work later in life. There was a raft of bill circumstances. A lot of those women came to see me, and as a result of membersparticularly the women in the governmenttalking to the minister about this the minister decided to set up a committee which would consult with the unions and other groups to see what could be done to phase in that change for those women. I am flattered that the minister asked me to chair that committee. We asked for and received a number of submissions from a number of groups-pensioner groups, the Council on the Ageing, the Older Women's Network, various other groups, and trade unions. As a result, we now have the changes in the mature age allowance, which is one of the cornerstones of this bill. The mature age allowance, as most people would know, was brought in in March 1994, and it had a June 1996 sunset clause. It was brought in as an interim measure to assist older, long-term unemployed people. Those are people who are aged 60 and over but who are below the pension age. At that stage it was only men, because at that stage 60 was the cut-off time for women. Those people faced particular disadvantage because if they had been made redundant or they had lost their job for some reason it was very difficult to find another job at the age of 60 or over. So we brought in the mature age allowance, which gave them pension rates and benefits. But we have found that longer term unemployed people will not suddenly phase out at June 1996. This measure was a means of helping those women who were going to be disadvantaged when they turned 60. So the new measures brought in in this bill are, first of all, to remove the sunset clause of June 1996. Also to be removed is the requirement that the recipient be registered with the CES for the previous 12 months. The payment will now be moved to the allowance system. An entitlement will be assessed under the allowance income and assets test rather than under the pension income and assets test. Also, applicants will be required to establish that they have been receiving an income support payment and have no recent work experience. For the purposes of this bill, the definition of no recent work experience is that they have not been employed for more than 20 hours a week for a total of 13 weeks in the previous 12 months. The current requirement that a person must have been in receipt of income support for at least 12 months will be reduced to nine months, and that must be nine months on some sort of income support-such as jobsearch allowance or newstart allowance. They will also be removed from the nonactivity tested payment. I am referring, for instance, to people on carer pensions, disability support pensions and parenting allowance. They did not have to be on jobsearch allowance; they could be on one of those other benefits. Those people will now be eligible for the mature age allowance. A lot of those women will have already been on a carer's pension, looking after a husband or a child who was disabled or ill. They will now be able to move across to the mature age allowance. I have a lot more to say on a lot of other issues, but I will end on that. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA Public Accounts Committee",75

NA Economy Reports Mr HOWARD-My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Now that inflation has jumped to a five-year high, average mortgage payments are 50 per cent higher under your and government, our current account deficit is the worse in the Western world, unemployment is stuck at over eight per cent and youth unemployment is at 27 per cent, why should Australians not feel that they have enjoyed only five minutes of economic sunshine?",76
82,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"Because we are now in the 17th consecutive quarter of growth. I do not know how many five minutes there might be in 17 quarters of growth. God knows what the multiple might be. It is the longest period of growth since the Second World War. The economy has been growing at about twice the rate it grew, on average, during the period of coalition government when the questioner was Treasurer. All of that makes an enormous difference to the state of prosperity in Australia, to the state of wealth and to the state of employment, and that is why the all-ordinaries index is at 2150-when I inherited the mantle of Treasurer from him it was at 455 or 456-and why we have had the largest fall in unemployment in 12 months since we have been keeping the records. This is reflected in the 670,000 jobs since the last election, and if anyone of us had got up and said in March 1993 that we would have the better part of 700,000 jobs between this election and the next one you would have heard the cat calls, the laughter and the charge of 'liar!' which they throw around now all the time. Mr Downer-Because you are a liar.",76

84,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The member for Mayo!,77
85,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"We know how you were born-with a silver cutlery service in your mouth, but it did not do you any good. Mr Downer-You can talk about that with your record!",77
86,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The member for Mayo! Don't be provoked.,77
87,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"All hallmarked, of course. Mr Downer-Living in Woollahra.",77
88,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"Only with a 'Liverpool' inventory mark, not with 'London'. I do not think he could actually afford that. All of this growth has meant that the Australian economy today has been on the top of the indicators list, the indicesMr Downer-Warren Anderson could tell us.",77
89,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I warn the member for Mayo.,77
90,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"in all of these things for years and years. As a consequence, all of the indicators-whether they be the Economist magazine or whatever-have had Australia on the top. The underlying rate of inflation on the Treasury's index is 3.1 per cent. Could you imagine the glee that the member for Bennelong would have had if he had had the inflation rate anywhere near three per cent? He just had it for a short moment under 10 per cent. For a short moment, in the seven years they were in office, it was under 10 per cent. Remember what he said in one of his headland speeches: The coalition endorses the adoption by the bankthat is the Reserve Bankof an objective for maintaining underlying inflation. So it is the underlying inflation rate he has acknowledged that matters, and it is at 3.1 per cent. In other words, it is that area which the Reserve Bank and the government have sought to achieve. The other thing is that they have been crying crocodile tears for weeks about wages. They said, 'Under the government there has been real wage reduction.' That, of course, is completely untrue. Real wages have risenMr Costello-No, it is true.",77
91,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"It is a fact. It is no good prattling rubbish. Real wages have risen by 7.2 per cent since 1983. Go and look at the Statistician's report. What we see with average weekly ordinary time earnings at the level they are now at, around five per cent, with the inflation rate underlying it at around three per cent, is very strong growth in real incomes. So all the Australian working people out there-the battlers, as you condescendingly call them-picked up a two per cent real increase in incomes over the past year. The Leader of the Opposition ought to make his mind up about this. He should say whether he is in favour of people getting wage increases-and if they are not going to get them in this sort of economy, when are they ever going to get them? He should make his mind up about whether he thinks that is a good thing. If he thinks it is a good thing, why prattle on about the inflation rate and make the link to wages? Much of the increase in the inflation rate comes from state government and Commonwealth government charges. Mr Costello-And your taxes.",77
92,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"And taxes, and it has come from the increase in interest rates which is picked up in the register of the CPI. As the Treasurer said quite eloquently yesterday, these things are recorded first, before the impact of those interest rates and fiscal policy get the desired slowing and the lower inflation in the economy. The Australian economy is growing very nicely at between 3112 and four per cent. It has got inflation, in underlying terms, at around three per cent. We have had huge employment growth. We have had a quarter of the jobs this year go to long-term unemployed. Unemployment, particularly amongst young people, is down significantly on what it has been as a proportion of that group of people, or of the total cohort of 16to 19-year-olds, from when the Leader of the Opposition was last in office. I do not know what produced that flurry in the question. With every bad number, he jumps on it, he is so excited. Every number which he thinks is bad for the economy he thinks is good for him. It reminds me of that interview he did in New York in the 1980s, ensconced in some hotel, when he said, very sagely and wisely, no doubt in Menzian tones again, 'The times will suit me.' That is, bad news for Australia equals good news for John Howard. The thing is that it is good news for Australia and that won't be good news for him. Taxation",78
93,Mr CHYNOWETH,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. It concerns reports today of a proposal to strip the Commonwealth of 80 per cent of taxation and channel it directly to the states and territories. Opposition members-Ha, hal",78
94,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! Those on my left! The member for Dunkley has the call.,78
95,Mr CHYNOWETH,Unknown,"This suggestion came from Jeff Kennett, so it is laughable. What would be the implications of implementing such a proposal? Is it the intention of the government to take up that proposal?",78
96,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"I made the point in the House a few days ago that what the coalition have in mind is putting the Commonwealth's income tax powers across to the states, to have state income taxes. Let me again refer to the quotations by the shadow Treasurer in an article: The Deputy Opposition Leader and shadow treasurer, Peter Costello, describes Commonwealth/state financial relations as ""an important issue that has to be addressed"". He says states' reliance on Commonwealth grants, so-called vertical fiscal imbalance, is ""something we will be dealing with in our first term"". I repeat, 'something we will be dealing with in our first term'. TIle smother which Mr Costello then raced to publish-that was his denial-said, 'No, I was only interested in a fixed share of Commonwealth income tax.' A fixed share of Commonwealth income tax only exacerbates the so-called vertical fiscal imbalance, because a fixed share of Commonwealth income tax is still a financial assistance grant. It is a bag of money with 'financial assistance grants' written on it. In fact, under his formula, it would be a bigger bag of money. So the vertical fiscal imbalance is exacerbated. There can be no repair of the supposed imbalance without giving the states more powers to raise their own revenue. That is the definition of it. Those who argue that the imbalance exists say that the states spend more money than they raise and to remove the imbalance you have to let the states raise more money. Giving them a larger share of Commonwealth income tax does not let them raise more money in their own right at all; it just gives them more Commonwealth money and more financial assistance grants. It exacerbates vertical fiscal imbalance. When the shadow Treasurer said 'an important issue to be addressed and something we will be dealing with', he meant giving the states tax powers. That is what he meant; it is the only thing he could have meant. We find out today that Access Economics has done a very big study for the conservative states, which includes a state consumption tax. When the article said that other tax options include a state based consumption tax, the journalist who wrote it was right. Here is Access Economics now doing the states' work. We saw Mr Kennett yesterday belling the cat further, saying, 'Not only should the Commonwealth get out of these things, but we should have 80 per cent of the funds.' He said that the Commonwealth should go back to national priorities such as telecommunications, the air force and defence-in other words, out of social spending, out of health and out of education. This is the same Premier who has taken $280 million out of Victorian hospitals. These are the same people who, when they have the powers, diminish what they will spend on them. What they want to do-this is the whole conservative agenda-is rob the Commonwealth of money and keep it out of functions and put the functions back to the states. Mr Kennett said that the remaining 80 per cent would go to the states and to the people of the states who generate the wealth. It is not the people of the states; it is the people of Australia who generate the wealth. This is one century on from Federation.",78
97,Mr TUCKEY,Unknown,What was Goss saying a while ago? Goss was saying the same thing.,79
98,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I warn the member for O'Connor.,79
99,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"We can have a debate in this country that would fracture the national economy and take the powers and give them back to the states to end up with six fractured state economies in a nation of 18 million people. We are a nation of 18 million people sharing a border with nobody, inside an island continent where we have a national economy and they want to give it back to these six states as six little micro-economies in order advance the conservative agenda so that a national Labor government cannot advance such things as Medicare, high completion rates in secondary schools, equality of opportunity in higher education or vocational education or adequate support for the aged in pensions or support for families with child care. So a Labor government cannot do those things, the agenda goes and they will hand it back to the states. Make no doubt about it; it was not a surprising thing that Mr Kennett came out and said that because the shadow Treasurer said he had consulted him. The journalist said that he had discussions with all the conservative state governments. If he has had discussions with Mr Kennett, was it a surprise that Mr Kennett said, 'Look, we should have 80 per cent of the revenue'? He said, 'The Commonwealth should only be back to these few core functions with 20 per cent.' Isn't it a surprise to find that Access Economics is out there doing its work for the conservative states on a state based consumption tax? The article says no. I have seen a lot of things written over my time in here. This is written by a journalist with quotations from the shadow Treasurer. The opposition technique is to say lies. Is the journalist a liar and without credibility? Is the article without credibility? Did he deny the quotes? How could a fixed share of Commonwealth income tax do anything about vertical fiscal imbalance where the very essence of the imbalance is an absence of taxing powers in the hands of the states? Let there be no doubt about it: a coalition government under John Howard will have state income taxes and state consumption taxes. They cannot touch a consumption tax at the federal level; they have had their fingers burned with that. So they are saying, 'Leave it to the states.' They have what they regard as the conservative treasury officers in Access Economics out there putting together a study-not for them, they will say; it is for the conservative states-about a state consumption tax. That is what the agenda will be: to state income taxes and a state consumption tax. No amount of ducking and weaving by the shadow Treasurer will relieve him of the fact that no bag of Commonwealth financial assistance grants, no matter how big or how small, will affect vertical fiscal imbalance whatsoever. The only thing that can affect it will be further tax powers to the states, which the opposition intends to give them.",79
100,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I ask the Prime Minister: why does he continue to cover up his economic failure by trying to con Australians with politically inspired definitions?

112,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"There was never any problem with discerning what the rate was when the Leader of the Opposition was Economy around as Treasurer-it always had a '10' in front of it.

But in the end the inflation rateMr Atkinson- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. It relates to standing order 145 and the dazzling of words. I suspect that, if the Prime Minister got back to the question rather than trying to dazzle us with words, we might get somewhere.",80

118,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! The member for O'Connor, I remind you of standing order 58. Resume your seat.",80
119,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"The inflation rate came out at 10 per cent every month for the seven years that those opposite were last in office, and here is the underlying rate at 3.1 per cent. There he is in his speech saying: The coalition endorses the adoption by the bank of the objective of maintaining underlying inflation. In other words, he acknowledges that certain elements of the consumer price index are given to some distortions in certain circumstances and the underlying rate is a closer measure of the inflation performance of the country. All that I and I think the Treasurer did yesterday was say that there were a couple of features there that will not be there next time. That was all. One of them that the Treasurer mentioned was, for instance, that the NRMA had been handing back $300 million of rebates in the system. There are other features. For instance, there is the rise in the Commonwealth's sales tax on motor vehicles which is going to happen only once. I was making the point not to say that the underlying rate is not the underlying rate, but to indicate why it was at 3.1 per cent and not under three per cent-I would have thought an entirely legitimate thing to do. Opposition members-Ha, hal",80
120,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"It will do you clowns no comfort in the end. You can laugh and giggle your way through this. But, in the end, the moment of truth comes out when they get to those stubby pencils and the ballot box. They will say, 'Can we vote for this crowd with no policies? Can we vote for this group that has got no idea about how to run the country and that has got no policies other than the draconian policies they've had back over a decade or so? Will we take a chance on them?' Answer: no. That is what happened in 1993 and that is what is going to happen again. Interest Rates",81
121,Mr CLEELAND,Unknown,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen reports that the cost of servicing a mortgage has risen by 50 per cent since 1983? What is the Treasurer's response to these claims?,81
122,Mr WILLIS,Unknown,"I have heard such claims made several times by the Leader of the Opposition, including in this question time. Of course, this comparison by the Leader of the Opposition is a completely false one. Perhaps the starting point for consideration of it is that we should always remember-when we hear comments from the Leader of the Opposition about interest rates and about mortgage repayments-that when he was Treasurer he left this country in a recession with interest rates higher than they are at the present time, when the economy has been growing for over four years. So, in a recession, he had higher interest rates than we have in a growth economy. That is the record of the Leader of the Opposition in terms of interest rates. In terms of this issue about a 50 per cent increase in mortgage repayments, what is involved in this is a totally dubious and artificial comparison of average monthly mortgage repayments. Apparently what the Leader of the Opposition has done has been to take the average home loan in 1983, adjust it for inflation, apply an interest rate of 12.5 per cent to obtain an estimate of the monthly repayments on that loan in today's dollars and then compare that figure with how much monthly repayments would be on an average loan this year if the interest rate on that loan was 10.5 per cent, the current bank and building society rate. Then of course he throws in some considerable rounding up for good measure. This is a totally shonky exercise. It is shonky for a number of reasons. Firstly, there is the use of the 12.5 per cent mortgage rate in 1983. This was a figure that was available on a very limited basis. Perhaps we should bear in mind that, just before that last election, it was cut. That is interesting! Just before that last election, he cut the interest rate from 13.5 per cent to 12.5 per cent. But, even at that 12.5 per cent rate, it was a rate which was available on a very limited basis. Because it was a highly regulated number, banks were unwilling to lend too much on that. After a certain level, you had to go and cocktail it up with other personal loans, or higher interest rate loans of one sort or another, or go to building societies or other sources of finance-all more costly. So the real mortgage rate was well above 12.5 per cent. The building society rate in March 1983 was 13.9 per cent, which is a better indicator of what the market rates were than the 12.5 per cent figure. Obviously, at that point, you are looking at a considerable increase over the interest rate of 12.5 per cent. But bear in mind also that, since that period, we have had a process of much higher loans evaluations being granted by home finance bodies. This is partly because low income earners, who normally have very small deposits, are more involved in housing these days. They could not get into housing back in those regulated days in large part because they could never get enough deposit. So they were locked out of the system-a point that was actually acknowledged by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in a rare moment of revealing the truth of the past. Talking to a CEDA conference in July 1994, he said: Under the system of credit controls that prevailedthat is back in 1983banks refused to lend to borrowers who did not have a record of saving with them, and refused to lend to borrowers who could not offer generous security against their loans. This made it harder for the lower income groups to compete for housing finance against the middle-income groups, and forced them to seek out housing finance through alternative and more costly forms of finance. So the Deputy Leader of the Opposition acknowledged that low income earners were largely locked out of the system and therefore could not get into a system of home finance, except at very costly rates of interest. Housing finance is much more widely available. Low income people can get loans at substantial loan to valuation, and that brings them a chance of becoming home owners. The average new home loan in 1983 as a percentage of the average house price was 50 per cent, and today it is 63 per cent. So that shows that the average loan to valuation has considerably increased. In other words, mortgages are bigger because the loans are bigger because you can get a larger proportion of the home price of a loan. There is also the fact, as we all know, that home loans are increasingly able to be used for other purposes than the actual purchase of the house. Everyone here has seen the Commonwealth Bank advertisements, for instance, with various items piled on top of the house, including a swimming pool and a car. That is because you can these days use your home mortgage to finance aspects of your expenditure other than the house itself. Therefore, home loans become bigger for that purpose. Also, houses today are bigger than they were in 1983. In fact, on average they are 18 per cent bigger. Mr Downer-Yes, Keating's. It is a bit bigger.",81

128,Unknown,Unknown,Government members interjecting,82
129,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The Treasurer is trying to bring his answer to a conclusion. He is not being helped by those on both sides interjecting.,82
130,Mr WILLIS,Unknown,"As I was saying, another reason that mortgages are larger is that people are buying bigger houses. They are also buying better quality houses. We all know that the quality of new houses has improved considerably over the last dozen years-at least for environmental reasons if not for otherMr Downer-Up in Woollahra, you get a really big",82
131,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The member for Mayo has been warned. Just be careful.,82
132,Mr WILLIS,Unknown,"For all of these reasons, we see that it is utterly false to make the kind of comparison which the Leader of the Opposition has made. There are various reasons why home loans are larger today than they were in 1983. The interest rate comparisons that have been used to get up this 50 per cent number are totally false. The bottom line on housing finance is this: the cost of a mortgage is the interest rate. The interest rates today are less than they were in 1983 in a recession. In fact, today you can get interest rates which are well below the 10Y2 per cent rate. You can get mortgage originator rates down to as low as 8.7 per cent compared with the building society rates which were predominantly available at the time when Mr Howard was Treasurer at 13.9 per cent. That is a 37 per cent reduction. That is a much better indication of what is happening to housing finance than this nonsense about a 50 per cent increase in mortgage interest payments. Interest Rates",82
133,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, you said after the May budget this year that it would take pressure off interest rates. On 18 May you said, 'That's having an impact now on variable housing rates; I think for the moment the trend is down.' On 8 October you said, 'You've now got half the market barking about lower interest rates; you've got commentators saying interest rates should fall.'",83

137,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"I made no such promise at all-never. The observations I was making at the time were completely correct. The interest rates have fallen through the period. Long-term interest rates have gone down from 10Y2 per cent to 8Y2 per cent. They have fallen 200 basis points, or haven't you noticed? Mr Costello-What has happened to the housing rate?",83
138,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"Many of the housing rates, both the fixed rates and the variable rates, have come down. That is because of the shift in fiscal policy and the slowing in the economy, which the government sought to induce, from an economy growing at six per cent in the year to September 1994 to an economy growing between 3Y2 per cent to four per cent now-still strong, but sustainable. It is those influences which I think the market has noticed. Also, the capacity to maintain inflation at low levels has induced a better climate altogether. I know that does not suit the shadow Treasurer. He wants to go out and babble every night to a television camera that interest rates are going up. Mr Costello-Are they coming down?",83
139,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"You said this all year: 'Interest rates will be rising; interest rates be rising; interest rates will be rising.' And you were dead wrong. You knew at the time you were saying it that it was an outright lie and that you were frightening people, but you kept on saying it and now you are left without a shred of credibility. They didn't keep on rising. In fact, they have fallen, as I had intimated in the references he made. Medicare: Health Insurance",83
140,Mr MARTYN EVANS,Unknown,My question is directed to the Prime Minister and concerns Australia's health system. What is the level of public support for Medicare? What alternative proposals for the provision of universal health cover have been reported recently? Is it intended to implement any of those proposals?,83
141,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"A recent survey showed that support for Medicare is at the record high of 88 per cent of Australians who were surveyed and asked their view in favour of Medicare. A decade ago, that was 44 per cent. We all know that there is a heavy discount factor in polls, but for a government program to register 88 per cent means that there is a phenomenal level of support for Medicare out there. Mr Howard interjecting",83
142,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"The Leader of the Opposition mutters by way of interjection, apparently disbelieving of that support. He now tells us that we have picked up a new supporter in the Medicare club. He says that it is him, the Leader of the Opposition. It is the same man who described Medicare as a great failure, as an absolute nightmare and as a total disaster. He is part of the team that dismantled the former health insurance system, Medibank, and the same person who was happy to leave two million people without health insurance. I do not know whether he thought they were Australian families or not. He always markets himself as such a family person. He must have thought the two million came from Mars. It is the same person who voted twice in the Australian parliament against universal bulk-billing, the same person who went to the last election, 2Y2 years ago, with yet another will policy to abolish Medicare and the same person who leads the shadow cabinet, 16 of the 19 members of which put together Fightback, which was about dismantling Medicare. Is it unreasonable for me and members the government to disbelieve Mr Howard's so-called change of mind? For John Howard to support Medicare, he would need more than a change of mind; he would need a change of mind and heart and fundamental values. He would need a transplant of proporthe tions which are beyond the reach of both science and credibility. In fact, on this side the House we say that for him to support Medicare he would need more than that; he would need a change of party as well. You need to think back to only the election to see the AMA up there saying that the coalition's policy was music to its ears. Remember that? That was all about supportdenounce ing private health insurance. What we find the moment is that, in the last couple of the private health insurers have now amassed $1.35 billion in reserves. Over the same period, they have increased premiums by per cent. These are the people who need the support by way of premiums to keep the system running as they build up these massive reserves. The Leader of the Opposition says that private health insurers are in such parlous trouble, with reserves of $1.35 billion, that wants to give them another billion dollars way of tax rebates for private health insursays ance. What he really wants to do is support the only part of the medical profession he ever supported; that is, the specialists and people up the top of the system who run private hospitals. He wants to make the transfer from the ordinary members of the public, by way of private health insurance premiums, to the specialists and to the private hospitals of $1 billion. The Leader of the Opposition says that he is in favour of Medicare-but he is not in favour of public health. Mr Speaker, let me just tell you of the conservative governments around Australia. In the last couple of the Commonwealth has paid $800 million to service for them. the states for health and, at the very same time we have given them $800 million, they have withdrawn $700 million from their spending. Jeff Kennett has cut $260 million a year out of of public health, and he plans to close two public hospitals in the Latrobe Valley this year and replace them with a private hospital; Dean Brown in South Australia reduced health expenditure by $35 million last year and plans to cut a further $35 million out in next two years and privatise public hospitals; Mr Groom in Tasmania has privati sed of the Mercy hospital; and Richard Court has an agenda of widespread privatisation of the public health system in Western Australia. On top of that, Mr Kennett in Victoria is even last privati sing ambulance services. The way that Mr Howard can show his support for Medicare and public health is to what the conservative states have at done-to say to Mr Kennett, Mr Brown, Mr years, Groom and Mr Court, 'You shouldn't be taking money out of public hospitals'; to tell them that they should put the $700 million 40 back; and that, when the Commonwealth gives $800 million to public health, it should not be supplanted by a reduction of $700 million from the states. That is what we are seeing from the coalition. When they tell us that this man-he who has called Medicare a great failure, an absolute nightmare and a total disaster, who has he twice voted against bulk-billing and had yet by another policy to abolish Medicare last yearthese things, the answer is: do not believe him! He is no more in favour of has Medicare than the AMA is in favour of Medithe care. He is no more in favour of Medicare in than are the likes of Bruce Shepherd. If, in fact, they were to become the government of Australia, they would knock and destroy Medicare as one of their first acts in office. So let those Australian families he is always addressing out there know that, when they wake up and find that their children sick, if they are not privately insured they will not be covered; if they go to a hospital, likely it will have been privatised; and if they go to an years ambulance service there might not be a This is the sort of support he is likely to give Australian families, just like he has tried to do all the way through the 1980s. All he wants to do is take money off Australian families and give it to doctors, specialists and private hospitals. Do not let anyone believe for a moment that he will keep Medicare; he will junk it in a second.",83
143,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. On 26 June you told the House: The government took discretionary decisions to lift interest rates . . . You said it was 'deliberate'. And you said: The government lifted interest rates late last year or didn't you notice? Since you deliberately put up rates last year, do you have any idea of how to deliberately bring them down now?",85
144,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"I do not think I know where to begin with that question. Is it any wonder that around the business community they say they have no depth over there. Is it any wonder that all the serious business people say, 'Look, you blokes, don't worry, you'll get back. If that other crowd got back, there would be nothing to them; they've got no depth and they've got no quality.' As I have said, Mr Speaker: the new team! Do you remember when the Leader of the Opposition said this a few weeks ago? He said, with all the Menzies intonation he could get up: The real issue is that a new group will run Australinterest is. That is on the rotational basis. They've had five turns; it's now our tum. In the new group is the Leader of the Opposition, the new-he would say-Prime Minister who cannot put his name to one major national initiative in 20 years in office; not one, other than a recession which left 10 per cent unemployment and 10 per cent inflation. Then, of course, there is the new Deputy Prime Minister who, when asked on television about the priorities of a new incoming coalition government, nominated the black spots program. That reminds me. The member for New England said on the weekend he doubted Mr Fischer would be able to win Cabinet debates against Liberal Party ministers. Mr Atkinson-On a point of order, understanding order 145, I wonder whether you could get Colonel Klink to get back to the point of the question. Interest Rates Mr SPEAKER-Order! The Prime Minister was asked a question. He is responding.",85
145,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"The member for New England said: ... but there's a difference between being able to do that and then lead the government as a MCEwen or an Anthony in days gone by, He said, 'Look, you've got to stand for something.' Mr Sinclair said the National Party leadership had yet to develop 'a capacity to prevail in cabinet on issues'. Mr Reith-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: in response to the last point of order put to you, you said that the Prime Minister was responding. I also raise a point of order. It is also understanding order 145-relevance. He may be responding but no-one would know what he is responding to. He is clearly not responding to the question. That of course highlights the government's sensitivity on interest rates, but he ought to answer the question on interest rates. To say that this is somehow related to the question, quite frankly, is stretching what you might consider to be already a wide discretion.",85
146,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The Prime Minister was indeed asked a question on rates. I would invite him to respond.,85
147,Mr KEATING,Unknown,This is a little doozey. I've just got to read it out. He said: It's a long way between getting a few paragraphs in the newspaper and being deputy prime minister. Mr Downer- Mr SPEAKER ,85
148,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! No, no. Just a minute. Before you jump up, I don't know what",85
149,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"I was talking about the new group over there and their depth. That was the depth of the Leader of the National Party. The shadow Treasurer shows his lack of depth by asking: if interest rates have gone up how can they come down? I think that was the sense of it, wasn't it? I do not do him an injustice, do I? No. Then of course there the very new, very new, shadow foreign short-term minister and the exceptionally new shadow minister for industrial relations. Mr Downer-On a point of order, you may, as the Speaker of the House of Repreboard, sentatives, be concerned about the public perceptions of this House, but can I just to you in the context of this point of order that the reason this House becomes is that when a specific question on interest rates is asked-and you asked the Prime Minister to return to the issue of interest rates-he should address the question. He is simply deliberately avoiding doing so. You should, in the interests of this chamber, ensure that he addresses a question which he is embarrassed to address.",85
150,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The honourable and member will resume his seat. Mr Downer-You're too embarrassed to address it.,86
151,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! Resume your seat! The Prime Minister was asked about interest rates and I hope he comes to that.,86
152,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"-I thought he was going to blow me a kiss. Really, where do you get these questions over there? Do you just ask someone on your staff? Maybe you got a steno to put this one together for you. Mr Reith- Mr SPEAKER ",86
153,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The member for Flinders on a further point of order. Mr Reith-I raise it again because it needs to be raised-the Prime Minister is clearly refusing to abide by your direction. It is not much to ask you that you require him when you give a direction to abide by that direction or otherwise sit down. It is as simple as that.,86
154,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The Prime Minister had just started his response. I did say the question was on interest rates. Mr Downer-What? He did not!·,86
155,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"No, in response to your that point of order, the member for Mayo. The Prime Minister was asked a question on interest rates and he is talking on interest rates.",86
156,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"-Now, unlike when the is Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer, rates are set in the marketplace and the cash rate and overnight rate are set by the Reserve Bank in consultation with the government. The Reserve Bank Act obliges the the governor and the Treasurer, who is representing the government, to agree. I say cannot remem.ber one occasion since 1983 when the bank and the government have not so rowdy agreed about these issues. As we see the maintenance of low inflation, as we see the economy slowing, as the demand for funds reflects the sustainability of growth in the economy, then one will see the symbiotic changes in the marketplace which will come from those conditions. At the right too time, in the market's terms, it will make judgments about the long run cost of money the pressure on our savings by borrowings. I do not know whether the opposition have ever thought about the fact that when the economy was growing at six per cent it was growing at a pace which broadly could not be sustained and it had to be slowed. Decent national micro-economic management requires that to be done and it was done. The proof of the pudding is in the national accounts we saw for the last quarter and in the sustainability of low inflation which we saw again yesterday. Industrial Relations: Sick Leave",86
157,Mr NEWELL,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Is the minister aware of the outcome of the appeal to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in the Tweed Valley fruit processors case? If so, can the minister inform the House about the decisions and the government's response?",86
158,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"I am aware of the outcome of the appeal to the full bench of the AIRC in relation to the Tweed Valley fruit processors agreement. This is the agreement the government sought to contest before the full bench and this is the agreement that was so roundly endorsed by the member for Flinders at that time. Indeed, on 2GB on 20 September 1995, he described it as a 'pretty good deal'. He said it was ridiculous that government would intervene. That was pretty contemporaneous. Today the full bench resulted upheld the appeal and quashed the order approving implementation of the agreement. It found that the commissioner had failed apply the no disadvantage test correctly. was the decision of the full bench. In relation to the prospective cashing out sick leave, the commission found that an entitlement to paid sick leave is a community standard dating all the way back to 1922. Mr Costello--Get the Prime Minister back to his place.",86
159,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,He is not interested.,87
160,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The minister will wait for a moment. The Leader of the Opposithis tion and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition! The Minister for Industrial Relations has the call and will be heard.,87
161,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"To quote the full bench: Industrial tribunals have traditionally taken view that sick leave exists to meet the fact that sickness may strike anyone. It is not a right employee gains by virtue of the performance of his got.' duties. The government wholeheartedly agrees with that full bench view . We will never condone the prospective cashing out of sick leave, wherever it might occur. Yet the coalition, particularly the member for Flinders and indeed the Leader of the Opposition, have fulsomely supported the Tweed Valley decision. Even Phil Gude in Victoria said he would not agree to the trading away of sick leave conditions. That is how bad those sitting opposite are. They support the agreement, an agreement which the full bench today found reduced a n.umber of award entitlements, including annual leave loading, smokos, public holidays and meal breaks, and at the same time increased workMinister ing hours from 38 to 40. The full bench found that on the employer's own calculations-Tweed Valley's own calculations-some employees in the first months would be more than 3.5 per cent worse off than under their comprehensive Minister: award. Further, it found that the employer's methodology was deficient, only having in construction and the regard to a limited number of award reductions. Finally, it found that the agreement in a net reduction in wages for some junior employees. So they just about got everyone in this terrific little trimmer that has to been endorsed by those sitting opposite but That today rejected by the full bench. It is not surprising that the Tweed Valley of agreement was found wanting, just as it is not surprising that the coalition supported it because, as we know, they are all about slashing award conditions, and always have been. Today they have gone public and have said that they are in favour of equal pay for work of equal value. They are in support of family leave as well. What a great breakthrough that is. We have waited weeks for latest revelation. 'People are entitled', says the bleeding heart member for Flinders, 'to what they've already got.' He is actually going to say that he is prepared to let them keep equal pay for work of equal value. He is prepared to let them keep their family the leave. How generous can you get? He says, that an 'You can keep some of what you've already But what about the rest of the things that are part of a comprehensive award entitlement? What about sick leave, for instancethe sick leave traded away in Tweed Valley? Thanks to the Tweed Valley case-<:an I conclude by saying-we know that the coalition will not protect people's sick leave. We know it very clearly because they came out and rushed to embrace this agreement. At least, in that respect, it has made it very clear to the electorate that under the Labor Party people have a fundamental, protected right to sick leave but under the coalition there is no such thing. Industrial Relations: Sick Leave",87
162,Mr REITH,Unknown,"My question is directed to the for Industrial Relations, and obviously flows from his last answer. In particular, I refer him to the speech given by the Prime Minister at the opening of Sydney's third 12 runway on 4 November 1994 when he saidin fulsome terms, to use your comment, This third runway is also a major accomplishment most importantlyindustrial relations. Minister, given that the workers on the third runway project enjoyed the 'major accomplishment' of having the same sick leave arrangements as the Tweed Valley workers, will you now either retract the Prime Minister's comments about the third runway or spell out exactly what your position is on sick leave?",87
163,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"With considerable pleasure, because it gives me an opportunity not only to answer the question but also to deal with an untruth-an untruth perpetrated by the member for Flinders at lunchtime today when he said that these arrangements were arrangements that I oversaw in my time; that they were my doing, as New South Wales Minister for Public Works. That is what he said, and he said that it was my award. Mr Reith-It is in the award and it has been for years.",88
164,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"It surely has been for years; there is no doubt about that. Let me tell you how many years it has been there in New South Wales, because today you tried to attribute it to me. That is what you did. I have here the origins-or as near as I can get to the origins-of that provision. It is called the General Construction and Maintenance Civil and Mechanical Engineering State Award before Watson J. on 28 April 1976. Who was in power in New South Wales then? Who was it? Who was in power all through those years that it applied? The point I am making is that the opposition will attempt, quite improperly, to attribute this to us. Mr Reith-And you have endorsed it.",88
165,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The honourable member for Flinders has asked his question.,88
166,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"It is a state award. We have a provision that says you cannot undercut an award. We have a no disadvantage test. Let me tell you how it applies because inherent in the member's question is the suggestion that we have endorsed, for federal award employees, this arrangement. As you suggested yesterday in the case of Glebe Island, you have suggested today, in the case of the airport runway project, that that is our doing. That provision applied, in the case of Glebe Island, to 10 per cent of the work force, who were not federal employees. Every single federal employee was guaranteed their sick leave, and no sick leave for the 90 per cent of the workers, federal employees, was traded in. Who, I might ask, was Premier at the time that deal was done in New South Wales? The first one I have just told you about was right back in Eric Willis's day.",88
167,Mr KEATING,Unknown,And who was Premier for those?,88
168,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"I can tell you who it was. It was John Fahey. He, until a short time before this, had been Minister for Industrial Relations. And who is chairman of the company involved? The chairman of the company involved-Baulderstone Homibrook-is Nick Greiner. Opposition members come in here trying to suggest that we have allowed for the undercutting of awards, when the fact is that no federal award employee in those jobs has traded in their entitlements. Only those under state awards who had already lost it under those state awards-state awards that go way back into the eons of time-have seen their sick pay cashed out. Let me say this: I know there are some federal unions which have spoken about the prospect of cashing out these agreements, but it seems to meparticularly in light of the full bench decision today-that that is a practice which should never be condoned. Mr Reith-But Keating has condoned it.",88
169,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"He has not done any such thing, and you know it quite well. The reality is that, under the federal system, everyone is guaranteed their award entitlements and that will continue to be so. Industrial Relations: No Disadvantage Test",88
170,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister, and it is also on the issue of industrial relations. Is the Prime Minister aware of reports today concerning no disadvantage and other provisions in the Industrial Relations Act? What is the government's response to those reports? Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: this is the fifth question from the government inviting ministers to bucket the opposition. If the Leader of the Opposition",88
171,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Resume your seat, there is no point of order. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, may I continue?",89
172,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Resume your seat. There is no point of order! The Prime Minister has the call.,89
173,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"In the new industrial relations framework of enterprise bargaining, the government has made the point that you can have flexibility with no disadvantage to employees, and we have a thing called the no disadvantage test. Opposition members are wriggling around this because they will not guarantee that workers will not be disadvantaged. Mr Reith today floated two more minimum conditions. He adds minimum conditions to try to prove a point. They will not guarantee people, but they have all these conditions, and Mr Reith has added the following conditions. Two days ago he said that there was a current federal award paying $238 a week-well, that was true in 1967. Today's commitment is equal pay for equal work, but that has been in industrial legislation since 1972. They are the two conditions he has added in the last two days. That is pathetic. But, more tellingly, on today's the World Today program, Fran Kelly asked him this question: Mr Reith ... the Coalition always says that people under awards won't be worse off under your. policy . "" 1.7 million people every year either change jobs. re-enter the work force. and negotiating their contract or their salary conditions Can you guarantee that those people will not be worse off ... He said that they: ... should only be able to do so on the basis that there is a minimum set of conditions ... We've outlined a number of them. But she pressed him. She was not going to take that dross for an answer. She asked: But those conditions can't guarantee that people won't be worse off, can they? And he went on to say: . . . we are very keen to ensure . . . that those arrangements are fair and reasonable in all the circumstances . . . So there is no guarantee, but: . . . we are very keen to ensure . . . that those arrangements are fair and reasonable in all the circumstances . . . In other words, we say as the government, 'We will guarantee you won't be worse off with the no disadvantage test: you can have flexibility up and flexibility sideways but not down,' but the coalition only means flexibility down and they will not provide the guarantee. Mr Reith goes around saying, 'I've got all these minimum conditions.' But then we look at how phoney they are, and we have only seen the ones from the last two days. He talks about awards paying $238 a week, which was true nearly 30 years ago, and equal pay for equal work, which has been in legislation since the last Labor government first took office in 1972. That is the sort of sleight of hand opposition members display to this type of question, and the answer is very revealing. They will not guarantee to working Australians that their wages and conditions will not be worse. They say that, if workers lose penalty rates, overtime rates, holiday leave loading and the rest, they will not be worse off! This is why the Leader of the Opposition is so fraudulent in talking about Australian families. He says he believes in families. But he does not believe in income support. He says he believes in families. But he does not believe in decent wages. He says he believes in families. But he does not believe in for the first time. Medicare. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: standing order 142 says that questions may be put to a minister relating to public affairs with which the minister is officially connected. The Prime Minister has been talking for five minutes about opposition policy, not government policy. I invite you to rule that answer out of order.",89
174,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The Prime Minister is entirely in order. I say to the member for WarringahMr Abbott-He is not telling the truth about the government; he is telling lies about the opposition.,90
175,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Resume your seat! The Prime Minister is in order.,90
176,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"You can have a play on words over there about having a no disadvantage test or having a minimum set of conditions, but you will not have the no disadvantage test. You will not guarantee that workers will not be worse off, because you actually mean to make them worse off. This is why the Leader of the Opposition when he says he is in favour of families-as if the rest of us aren't-is not in favour of family support. The thing that supports a family, most obviously, is a decent wage, a decent salary, a decent income. That is the thing which he will not guarantee. Here he is cavilling about wage impacts on the inflation rate when I have made the point today, and the Treasurer did yesterday, that there have been real increases in wages in the last 12 monthsagain. He says he is in favour of families. But he is not in favour of family support. He is in favour of families, but he is not in favour of penalty rates and overtime rates. He is in favour of families, but he is not in favour of them getting a loading when they take their children on annual leave, on their recreation leave. He says he is in favour of families. he is not in favour of the universality of Medicare. He is in favour of only certain kinds of families-rich ones that live in the best parts of Australia. Opposition members-You! You! You!",90
177,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order!,90
178,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"Those are the ones he believes in. I live in the top spot in AustralDid is-the Lodge, Deakin, ACT; the house you want to get, but you are not going to. That is whom they support. They basically support wealthy families. That is all he has ever That is why he is out there supporting private insurance; why he is supporting private health; why he is supporting specialists; why he is supporting private hospitals. But he will not go for public health. He will not support the great majority of Australians who need access to that public health system. Everywhere you look around the country, Liberal governments are privatising hospitals. In Victoria they are now privati sing ambulances. In Ballarat yesterday, where I was, a person died because when they rang for an ambulance there was only one ambulance on duty and it was out doing something else. As a consequence, the person died after waiting 55 minutes instead of the target of eight minutes. The person did not survive the experience. The excesses we are seeing in the states are the very same things that the Leader of the Opposition supports. It is very revealing that, when pressed, 'Do you guarantee that workers will not be worse off?' Mr Reith's response is, 'We are very keen to ensure arrangements are fair and reasonable in all the circumstances.' But if all the circumstances mean that you have a loss of income and your income is not guaranteed, it is bad luck. I have said this many times in this parliament and I will say it again: industrial relations are more than simply about rates of pay and terms and conditions. They are about the sort of society we are, the sort of country we have become and the kind of view we have for one another. Their view is to cut people down, cut the legs from under working people. They hate the sight of working people. They want to cut their wages, cut their terms and conditions of But employment, cut their support under Medicare and, in so doing, fracture the sort of society which Australians have consistently suppored over a long period of time. That is why the industrial relations debate is so significant. Governor General",90
179,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. you attend at Gallipoli for the 80th anniversary along with many, including His Excellency the Governor General? Does the minister believe that the condemnation of the done. cost of sending the Governor General to Gallipoli was justified or not? When you said 'heads will roll' regarding the administrative bungling at Gallipoli, did they? Is it a fact that the only head you have taken aim at is that of your former leader and the current Governor General, Bill Hayden? What new attacks can the Governor General expect following the disclosure of his views on the Keating republic?",90
180,Mr SCIACCA,Unknown,"I do not thank the honourable member for the question because it is a pretty stupid one, really. The fact is I did go to Gallipoli-of course I did-and so did the Governor General. It is not a question that should be put to me. You are just making mischief, and you know you are making mischief. You are not going to get any answer out of me because there is no answer to give. Mr Tim Fischer-Guilty!",91
181,Mr KEATING,Unknown,I will add to the answer. So much for the Leader of the National Party's pious support of veterans and their commitments around parts of the world. He is prepared to score off veterans and their commemorations to make a tawdry political point. Australia Post,91
182,Mr HARRY WOODS,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Would the minister advise the House about the recent performance of Australia Post. Is he aware of proposals to change the regulatory framework for Australia Post? What implications would these changes have for Australia Post's performance, especially in rural and provincial Australia?",91
183,Mr LEE,Unknown,"I am pleased to be able to tell the House that, as the member for Page has indicated, Australia Post has had another excellent year, with a pre-tax profit of more than $330 million, with its revenue up by eight per cent and the number of articles carried up by six per cent. All of this improvement comes at a time when Australia Post has frozen the standard letter rateMr Bruce Scott-You will sell it-just like the Commonwealth Bank. We know what you will do.",91
184,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The minister will wait for a moment. The member for Maranoa is constantly interjecting across the chamber to members. He will sit there or I will invoke the provisions of one of the standing orders that will get that end of the chamber a little quieter.,91
185,Mr LEE,Unknown,"These great results have been achieved at a time when Australia Post has frozen the standard letter rate at 45c from 1992. They have undertaken to keep it frozen until 1997. There are not too many other basic goods and services these days which have their price frozen for five years. In addition, Australia Post is one of the few profitablemail services in the world-no doubt due to the reforms implemented under the Hawke and Keating governments in corporatising and putting Australia Post on a proper business footing. Those on this side of the House would like to commend the board, management and staff of Australia Post for implementing a whole series of changes that have totally turned around the culture at Australia Post. Many members would have seen the new post office shops that have opened in many retail districts in recent days which have changed the way postal services are delivered in this country. The other thing to remember is that this profit and part of the cross-subsidies that go to underlie the community service obligations make sure that post offices that currently run at a loss stay open. The profits and the crosssubsidies make sure that we keep that uniform letter rate across the country. That is an important part of these profits. The problem for me is that there are other proposals around, as the member for Page has indicated. There are proposals that have been around to change the regulatory regime for Australia Post. They come from the Leader of the Opposition. In his second headland speech, he attacked the government for not doing enough in micro-economic reform. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Deputy Prime Minister said earlier today that question time was a time for government ministers to talk about government policy. This minister is about to breach standing order 142. It is clear that he is going to start telling fibs about the opposition. I invite you to rule him out of order and sit him down.",91
186,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! I have said in this place before, as have all Speakers, that there may be contrasts between policies of government and opposition. That is something which will continue, I am sure. I have also said to the member for Warringah that points of order must be taken reasonably and not constantly used as a method of interrupting a minister's flow or a minister's answer. I therefore invoke the provisions of standing order 304A. The honourable member for Warringah is suspended for a period of one hour. The honourable member for Warringah thereupon withdrew from the chamber.",92
187,Mr LEE,Unknown,"What the Leader of the Opposition said in his second headland speech was that the government should have implemented the Industry Commission's recommendations lock, stock and barrel. We have had not just the Leader of the Opposition say that the Industry Commission recommendations should have been implemented, but Senator Alston has been on record as saying that we should take away the protection that is there for Australia Post under the reserve services. The problem is that, if you do what the Leader of the Opposition and Senator Alston recommend and implement the Industry Commission recommendations, you place at risk 1,300 post offices across Australia. The Leader of the Opposition is not interested in this. He does not understand that the position that he was advocating in his second headland speech in Melbourne was that 1,300 licensed post offices around Australia would shut down because today they run at a loss.",92
188,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"Oh, come on.",92
189,Mr LEE,Unknown,He laughs at it. He is not interested in what happens to the people in the bush.,92
190,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,You're a joke.,92
191,Mr LEE,Unknown,"Your policies are a joke, mate. The second thing you place at risk by implementing the Industry Commission report that you endorsed in Melbourne is the uniform letter rate. The Industry Commission make it clear that if you do not have those crosssubsidies and the profitable mail centres within CBDs, you cannot keep the uniform letter rate across the country. I have asked Australia Post for some indicative figures of what would happen if the Leader of the Opposition's policies were implemented and if he did implement the Industry Commission's recommendations. I asked about Bathurst for the member for Calare, given his interest in my answer earlier this week. You would find that a letter sent from Bathurst to Sydney would increase in price from 45c to 68c. For the member for Hinkler, whom we are all very worried about-his margin keeps shrinking as each day goes by-the price of sending a letter from Bundaberg to Thangool would go from 45c to 97c. For all of those National Party members who have people living on rural properties outside the towns, Australia Post say that the real cost of sending those letters is up to $10. You need to retain those cross-subsidies from the profitable urban areas to the bush if you are to make sure that we retain that uniform postage rate. That is why I find it so difficult to understand that the Leader of the National Party has been conned by the Liberals again. How is it that the National Party members have been persuaded that they should be backing this Industry Commission report that means that the people in rural and provincial Australia suffer? That is what I do not understand. We would like every member of the National Party to get up here today and tell us that they support abolishing all of those crosssubsidies and implementing the Industry Commission report that the Leader of the Opposition endorsed in his second headland speech. We want the National Party members to tell us that. We will get the opposition saying that they want to implement the Industry Commission report, but they will give Australia Post a cheque every year to protect those cross-subsidies and those community service obligations. That is the view put around by the member for Mackellar. The point is that that would mean that, in every budget and every time there was an economic statement under a potential Howard government, that protection for the rural and provincial users of Australia Post would be at risk. Every budget they would be shaving back the assistance to the people in the bush. Every budget those post offices would be at risk. Every budget the postage rates for all of those people in the bush would be at risk. That is why those of us on this side of the House are detennined to ensure that people in rural and provincial Australia maintain the postal service they are entitled to. Families: Taxation",92
192,Mr FILING,Unknown,My question is directed to the Prime Minister and it concerns battling families. An incident having occurred in the gallery,93
193,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,There's another independent. The honourable member for Moore has the call. Order! Will the attendants please remove that lady from the gallery.,93
194,Mr FILING,Unknown,"Prime Minister, following yesterday's news that increases in inflation are likely to place upward pressure on mortgage interest rates, and given that new research from the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling at the University of Canberra has shown that 50 per cent of middle-class couples with children now need two incomes to survive and that only 25 per cent survive on one full-time income, will you consider the article by Paul Gray in yesterday's Herald-Sun calling for a fair go for families and support the doubling of the tax-free threshold for single income households with young children, effectively giving battling families a tax-free threshold of up to $1O,800-in other words, allow them to keep more of their hard-earned money to provide a better standard of living for their children?",93
195,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"A change to the tax-free threshold would be one of the most expensive changes in the tax system because it goes to everybody. It goes not simply to the people on low incomes; it goes to the people on the highest incomes. That is why it has always been better and preferable to direct moneys more finely and precisely through payments such as the family allowance supplement or additional family payment by way of family allowances and these sorts of devices, which get the money where it really needs to be. I referred a week ago to that very large and important study, which is in the course of being completed. OECD figures on wage dispersion show Australia being way down the bottom of the table-that is, between the growth of those on the highest income versus those at the lowest. But, when we put the transfer payments into it and we put Medicare into it, it really makes a very large difference, a huge difference, to those people who are on lower incomes. To indiscriminately lay on more money via the tax-free threshold would simply give the people on the highest incomes a tax windfall. The honourable member shakes his head, but that is simply a fact of tax life. How could all taxpayers not benefit from the taxfee threshold if all incomes are subject to it? Of course, they will. That is why the government has, over a very long period, directed money to families through the transfer system. It is why we say the federal opposition, which wants to cut $10,000 million out of outlays, will start cutting into payments to families and payments to schools. Mr Costello-That is a lie.",93
196,Mr KEATING,Unknown,The shadow Treasurer has admitted to giving the states a fixed share of income tax on today's proportions. That will cost $3 billionMr Costello-Another lie.,93
197,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"No; that is the one you put out in your statement the other night saying the fixed share of income tax will go. That is the bit you have already admitted to. The fixed share of income tax is worth $3 billion, so how are you going to pay for the $3 billion without big cuts in government spending? It is those cuts in government spending which will affect Australian families because that is the thing that supports them, which is the point I made earlier. The thing that also supports them is wages. I do not remember the member for Moore ever barracking for decent wages. I do not remember you supporting the award system. I do not remember you ever doing anything but vote with the miserable group opposite against everything we ever brought in here for Australian families. Whether we brought in the family allowance supplement, the additional family payment or any of these things, you voted with your colleagues over thereand you would still be doing it and you would still be putting your hand up for draconian wages policies of the kind we see in Western Australia which would basically cut back the wages of the people you mentioned. Whether people are on middle incomes or low incomes, the wage packet and pay packet are the principal means by which Australians maintain themselves and advance their prosperity. If you are against decent wages or wage increases, you are against their interests. That is what the Liberal Party is: against the interests of Australian working men and women. It has consistently and always held that position. It is why, when we build an important and cogent safety net, it is important to keep it in place and why I have said here that we in this country have come through the middle. Not only have we got strong employment growth but we have got decent wages growth and all the supporting things through such things as the devices I mentioned. Whether it be a generalised child-care rebate, fee relief for child care, Medicare, the additional family payment or the family allowance, these are all the things that make a difference. Broadbrush, thoughtless tax changes of the kind you mention would give advantages to only those on higher incomes-which is what you have always supported. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. SPEAKER'S RULINGS",93
198,Mr REITH,Unknown," Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I appreciate that understanding order 304A a ruling from the Speaker is not open to debate or dissent. I respect that standing order. I do, however, take the opportunity to place on record our view that a member should not be sent out for an hour on the basis of raising a point of order of the nature raised by the member for Warringah. It might be that his misdemeanour was that his point of order repeated an earlier point of order, but the fact of the matter is that the standing orders do not in any way prevent a member continuing to raise a point of order when they believe it is relevant under the standing orders. Therefore, I thought that the point of order was entirely justified. Given the fact that today the government has closed down standing order 143-and I do not redebate that issue-and given the treatment that has been meted out with the heavy use of numbers by the government today, you will understand that we would like to register, and we take the opportunity now to register, our very strong protest.",94
199,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I understand the point made under indulgence by the member for Flinders. He might like to take the opportunity to refresh his memory in respect of a ruling given by the Second Deputy Speaker. I have used that ruling as a basis for the ruling I gave this afternoon. NA Chamber Microphones,94
200,Mrs BISHOP,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I did ask you on a previous occasion about the use of microphones in this chamber. Today we have seen another example of their use. There was one occasion when you had in fact directed the Prime Minister to return to the substance of the question that had been asked. He persisted, flouted your ruling and the microphones remained on. Because of the standing orders, points of order do not go out in a rebroadcast, which is the only time that question time is heard. Furthermore, when the member for Warringah was speaking on his point of order, the microphone was turned off. You did offer to investigate the microphone issue and I do not recollect having had a satisfactory answer back on that point. As a second issue, I would like you to confirm whether or not the ruling you made concerning the member for Warringah being ejected for one hour is that it is not possible to have a point of order raised which is deemed reasonable by you if it is one that has been consistently raised. Does that mean you are putting an arbitrary limit on the number of times a standing order can be used, or do you have a more indiscrete test that we could use?",94
201,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"In respect of the second point, the answer is no. The chair will always adjudicate on the basis of points of order as they are raised. As I said, the reason why I invoked 304A was that, in my view, it interrupted the flow of the minister and in fact was not a reasonable point of order. But it is never the intention of the chair to prevent people from taking legitimate points of order under the standing orders of this place. In terms of the issue of microphones, again I say to the honourable member that the only microphones which are live are the one with the person who has the call and the one here in the Speaker's chair. On occasions, of course, if there is some disturbance in the chamber, if I have given an instruction to somebody to resume their seat, it may take a couple of seconds for the microphones to be deactivated. In the case of the member for Warringah, however, I did ask him to resume his seat. On such an instruction the microphone would have been turned off. In respect of those microphones here at the front, either for the Prime Minister or for the Leader of the Opposition, again the same principle applies and they are in fact turned off. I made inquiries of the Sound and Vision Office, and that is all there is to it. NA",95
202,Mr HOWARD,Unknown," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",95
203,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,95
204,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,I do.,95
205,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Please proceed.,95
206,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), during his last answer said, amongst other things, that I and my colleagues had voted against the supplementary family payment. That is just a complete lie. We in fact invented it. AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORTS",95

NA Economic Management",95
209,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Jenldns)Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The government's pre-occupation with existing Opposition policies which is diverting energy and focus from the provision of good government and economic management. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",96
210,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"Farrer-Leader of the National Party of Australia) (4.27 p.m.)Today was one of those days when the government decided that the opposition had policies as opposed to those days when it attacked us for not having policies. In addition to doing that, it found time to try to cover up some of its activities throughout recent weeks. I want to begin by referring to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca). There it was, loud and clear for everyone to see: this minister was caught red-handed being unable to answer a very simple question, which did come under his portfolio, about the arrangements associated with his visit to Gallipoli. The reason is that he is up to his neck in waging this campaign against His Excellency the Governor General by leaking information to the Telegraph Mirror and setting up this huge article. He has been quoted indirectly as being one of the Labor team who is now very upset with the modus operandi of His Excellency the Governor General. I put it on the record of this House that we live in a robust democracy and that we have a robust Governor General. I expect that in the 1990s he is going to have things to say from time to time. I would say in relation to this falling out between the Labor Party and its former leader that it is there for everybody to see. The minister who leaked in absolute terms was none other than the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who was exposed so loudly and clearly today. Mr Crean-What about your former leader? He got at you.",96
211,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"I welcome the interjection of the minister at the table about a former leader. I just happen to have some notes about what former leaders say about current leaders, including the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Who said that he had erratic behaviour and that everyone is worrying about his judgment? Bob Hawke said that about the Prime Minister, Paul Keating, on page 497 of his memoirs. It gets better. What else did he have to say? On page 498 he described the Prime Minister as vainglorious, arrogant, disloyal and contemptuous. On page 499, he described him as disingenuous, churlish and inaccurate. Then he said, 'He was deliberately lying to me.' These are just some of the accusations made by Bob Hawke. The truth of the matter is: this government has been misleading this country for far too long. Its time is up. Whilst at the United Nations earlier this week the Governor General, because of the badly written speech, was unable to complete the paragraphs relating to French nuclear testing-it is very unfortunate that that was so, and the blame for that rests with Minister Evans-this government has now run out of time with regard to the good governance of this country and with regard to the economic management of this country. I guess that was reflected in many ways in the statistics this country was officially presented with yesterday; that is, the CPI figure of 1.2 per cent, or 5.1 per cent on an annualised basis. What does that mean at family level? What does that mean for the battlers of Bankstown, Bourke, Balranald and beyond? I have done some research into those figures and applied them on a dollar basis. What do I find with those CPI increases in relation to the poorest 20 per the battling families? The past 12 months of inflation have increased their costs by some $25 a week. That works out at some nine per cent. With regard to mortgage, it is more like 50 per cent, as the Leader of the Opposition has said. But the news gets even worse. At the other end of the scale, the increase in household expenditure of the richest families, whose incomes average more than $1,700 a week, - epresents just 2.5 per cent of the family's IOcome. In other words, the battlers get forced further and further behind by the economic mismanagement of this government. Tragically, the gap between rich and poor is getting wider and wider. There is another chilling statistic. I think this statistic is perhaps the most disturbing of the ones that have currency at the moment. In 1995, there are 150,000 more children living in families where neither parent is employed than was the case in 1990. It is little wonder that the retiring president of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, Jim Maher, stood up to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley), eyeball to eyeball, at a recent union conference. I think it is worth quoting the exact words of Jim Maher because I think the parliamentary secretary at the table, the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), probably has a degree of respect for Mr Maher. Maybe he doesn't; he may be part of another faction. I will check with him later. Some of you, somewhere, might just happen to have a bit of respect for Mr Maher. This is what this shop steward happened to say, eyeball to eyeball, to the Deputy Prime Minister: There are many people in Australia today who are suffering, and suffering hard. Families trying to bring up children rear them and education them in the current environment is not easy. They can truly be described as battlers. I would hope for the future !hat the government will, whatever other promises It makes, attempt to look after those genuine families who are struggling today. There it is from their own, in a sense-from their own official family, in a sense. That is a direct highlighting of the plight of the battler, of the increasing gap between rich and poor and of the economic mismanagement of cent of families, this country. The government always tries to cover up that economic mismanagement by focusing on our policies, which will deliver for the battlers, which will begin the huge task of reining in the huge foreign debt, which will genuinely look after the family and bridge the educational gap which is developing in this country, and which will in fact tum around this economy and bring about not five minutes of economic sunshine and not even five months of economic sunshine, but solid, continuing, sustainable growth in this country. Against that, the legacy of mismanagement of Labor, leaving the battlers out of the equation, can best be manifested by looking at some key statistics. Total government revenue has increased by some 30 per cent since Paul Keating became Prime Minister. Over the next three years, government revenue is estimated to increase by a further 21 per cent, with taxation revenue increasing by 23 per cent. Indeed, taxation revenue this financial year is going up by some 8.9 per cent. So we have the taxation revenue increase exceeding the enlarged CPI rate, thus showing what is truly happening to the battlers. And, of course, the Commonwealth government's own debt, excluding the states, has risen by 130 per cent over the period that Keating has simply been Prime Minister as opposed to previously when he was Treasurer. But perhaps it is time to remind the House of a certain event which took place on 15 July 1967.",97
212,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,What was that?,98
213,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"It was a particularly extraordinary event. I know we get lectured on history by the front-bench from time to time, so I have been going back in history too. I have found that, on that particular day, a Mr John MCInnes was carrying out his duties as menswear manager in the Bankstown David Jones store. In fact, I have found that on that particular day history will record that Mr MCInnes sacked one Paul Keating. Why did Mr MCInnes sack Paul Keating? It is on the file. Mr MCInnes described him as: surly, arrogant, rude, unmanageable, could never find him: sacked-and Paul Keating has not changed along the way. Indeed, somewhere in the archives of David Jones there is a file that is marked 'would not re-engage'. If only David Jones had put that in their prospectus last week they would have got twice the take-up rate for their shares. That action of Mr MCInnes all those years ago, I think, was a very early summary of this person who by one method or another is now Prime Minister and on whom the clock is tickingand the clock is ticking very, very fast. Let us tum to the Deputy Prime Minister. Let us show how he exposed what perhaps might be the true agenda of Labor in their lingering weeks and days in government. I refer to the tax agenda of Labor: their fuel excise tax increases, their sales tax increases and their other increases. Members will recall a comment made by the Deputy Prime Minister in the House on Monday when he was asked to rule out tax increases. What did he say? Do you remember what he said? The Deputy Prime Minister, when asked in very clear terms whether he would rule out tax increases, said, 'Why would we do that?' In other words, he said, by implication, 'That is our agenda; there is more to come.' There will be more tax increases under Labor-as demonstrated by the famous Dawkins budget after the last election; as demonstrated by the l-i-e, l-a-w tax cuts lost to this country; as demonstrated especially by what they did with regard to fuel excise tax. The Deputy Prime Minister let the cat out of the bag, let the situation emerge where Labor are fudging again on tax. The electors, and the battlers especially, of this country, and the small business operators of this country, have absolutely every right to be terrified of what is in store for them in the very unlikely event that Labor are returned to government-which they will not be. The people of Australia have had enough. They have seen what has happened with their interest rates. They have seen what has happened with inflation. They have seen what has happened with unemployment. They are getting a little sick and tired of a Prime Minister who comes in and rewrites figure after figure, rewrites and reinterprets and reinvents figure after figure, even when they are official ABS figures. I concede one little thing with regard to our current and terminating Prime Minister-and that is, he is a spin doctor extraordinaire. Whichever way the figures go, he will move to pick out the elements, inject new elements and totally falsify the interpretation. I remember that famous youth unemployment press conference which he gave. It was the one where he decided to do the big U-turn and come into the courtyard smiling. We all were in deep shock, actually: he came smiling to his press conference. He stood in front of the media whom he loves so dearly, the press gallery whom he loves so dearly these daysI mean, there is Margot Kingston over there in Cambridge and elsewhere, missing, and he is still happy and he still put on this great presentation. This was the famous post-Rupert Murdoch 'the economy is a disgrace' press conference. I remember it very well. What happened in the middle of this press conference? Not only did he almost lose his lines completely because his smiles were getting tangled up with the lines-I mean, it was a quite extraordinary press conferencebut, in fact, he invented a youth unemployment figure for which he was roundly chastised because he could not verify it. He decided to arbitrarily reduce youth unemployment from 26.7 per cent to somewhere around nine per cent. He was caught red-handed by the shadow minister; he was caught redhanded by people in ACOSS and people across the board who said, 'This is one lie many; we are not going to cop it.' The Prime Minister has no realisation of what is happening out there in small business. He has no idea of what is happening out there in those areas still affected by horrific drought. He has no idea of what is happening in those sectors still suffering from recession and in the real suburbs, which are a long way from the very cloistered locations to which the Prime Minister goes when visiting capital cities. I have to say to the House that it is about time to bring on an election. It is about time to give the people the right to pass judgment with regard to this shocking record of government. It is about time we had the chance to decide on the fate of this Prime Minister. I am just a bit amused about the matter of leadership being mentioned by the member for Werriwa. I have an old paper here-the Sunday Age, 'MPs plot against Keating' . It is not 1990. It is not 1991. In fact the date is September 1995-only a couple of months ago. I know it is not quite in order to display these papers in the chamber. It is quite embarrassing for members of the government. I say in very loud and clear terms: time is up on this government. The alternative policies, many of which are out, more of which are to come in the form of campaign initiatives, will see you out when we get to the ballot boxes, particularly in the marginal seats. We have reached a stage where this government has run out of steam. This government has run out of time. This government has run out of agendas. It will try a republic statement. It will try a budget. It will try swapping its Deputy Prime Minister and it still will not tum the tide. In respect of this matter of public importance, a man called Jack MCInnes, former David Jones employer, sacked Paul Keating back in 1967. Bob Hawke sacked Paul Keating back in 1991, and the Australian people are waiting to sack Paul Keating-and the sooner the better.",98
214,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"We have a consensus at last. The Leader of the too National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) wants an election. So too does the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). He wants an election for the leadership of the National Party. The Australian newspaper last Saturday states: It's a long way between getting a few paragraphs in the newspaper and being deputy prime minister. I sit in the partyroom and I've never had a conversation-I mean a real conversation-with him ... That is what one unnamed National Party member had to say last Saturday. If it was the hapless member for Hume (Mr Sharp), he should not feel too bad about it. If it was the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), he should not feel too sorry about it. If it was the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) complaining that he has never had a decent conversation with the Leader of the National Party, he is not Robinson Crusoe. No-one has had a real conversation with the Leader of the National Party. No-one can understand a word he says. Listening to him in the debate today was like watching someone baying at the moon. The members of the National Party who are complaining that they have never had a real conversation with the leader of their party should not feel too bad. They should not feel like Robinson Crusoe. The right honourable member for New England got it right when he said-again reported in the Australian last Saturday: They badly need somebody who really still has the faith of God flowing in his blood to occasionally say to them, 'look, you've got to stand for something' and I am just concerned that in those circumstances, the job is going to be tough for someone like Tim . . . It does not get any tougher than having to listen to his presentation to the House today. It does not get any tougher than that. The member for New England, the unsinkable Sinkers, is putting the sinkers, the weights, right on the legs of the Leader of the National Party. He is putting on the ballast; he is putting on the weights. The unsinkable Sinkers knows when there is a leadership challenge in the National Party for the picking. Mr Truss-There is no-one to back you.",99
215,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"Was it the member for Wide Bay that the Australian referred to? Has he never had a real conversation with his leader? He has never had a real conversation because his leader is unreal. Listening to the debate and the presentation of the Leader of the National Party is like watching a dog baying at the moon. If members opposite need proof of that proposition, look at the terms of the matter of public importance submitted to the parliament. The Leader of the National Party is complaining that the government is preoccupied with existing opposition policies. The Leader of the National Party is complaining that the government is scrutinising existing opposition policies. What should we scrutinise if we are not scrutinising existing opposition policies? Should we scrutinise past ones? Is the Leader of the National Party suggesting that the government should go back and scrutinise the policies of Alfred Deakin, George Reid, Stanley Melbourne Bruce, Billy MCMahon or Bob Menzies? It is absurd to criticise a government for scrutinising the existing policies of the opposition. The Leader of the National Party cannot complain about a government that has been forced to campaign against two John Howards. The Leader of the National Party was at it again today. The government says there is one John Howard without policies and there is one John Howard with policies. There are two John Howards. These are the two faces of John Howard-the private face and the public face. It is a long standing Liberal Party tradition. I remember in the early 1970s the public debate in Australia about private Billy and public MCMahon. Billy MCMahon was all over the shop. There was a private Billy who had privately held views and a public MCMahon who put those to the people and the parliament. There is a private John and a public Howard. My proposition is that the Australian people like neither face. They know that private John is unelectable because it is the same private John who endorsed Fightback in 1993, the same private John who supports laissez-faire economics and social policy, with no active role for government and no social safety net. Private John is unelectable. Of course, the public Howard is a total sell-out, a total charade, a total fraud on the people of Australia. The public Howard is pretending to be something that he is not. On television last night I saw news of the latest medical breakthrough. They were able to graft an ear onto the back of a mouse. I think the scientists have missed the real point. The medical marvel has been right here in the House of Representatives, watching the Leader of the Opposition over the past nine months grow a second face right next to the old face. There is the new face of John Howard. There is private John and public Howard. I would have thought that the scientists should be having a good look at the transformation of the Leader of the Opposition over the past nine months. The Leader of the Opposition is now posing as a moderate, a sensitive New Age guy, the sort of guy who eats quiche, the sort of leader who helps little old ladies across the road, the sort of leader who believes in an inclusive society, who is warm, fuzzy and caring. The government knows the truth. The government knows the difference. The government knows, as do the people of Australia, about the two faces of John Howard. I have been sitting here for nine months, along with the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth), the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe) and all government members, watching the second face grow alongside the first face. We know the difference. We know the difference between public Howard circa 1995 and the private John. He is backtracking on industrial relations. He talks about marginal change and inoffensive policies. He is trying to parade an IR conciliator. We know the private John and his views for 20 or 30 years. He believes in individual employment contracts which would rip productivity in the Australian workplace apart. We know the private John who believes in a dog-eat-dog industrial relations environment. We know the private John who endorses a $3 per hour youth wage. We know the difference. We know the two faces of John Howard. We know that the Australian people like neither face. We know the difference between the public Howard circa 1995 opposing a 15 per cent GST, trying to present himself as a low tax man, and the private John who was the strongest possible supporter of the 15 per cent GST in Fightback in 1993. From time to time the truth creeps out of the parliamentary Liberal Party. Just last week we had the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), as the tax spokesperson for the opposition, saying that the GST was a good idea. The Leader of the Opposition in May of this year gave an insight into his private views, saying that he left open the chance of a GST some years in the future. We know the difference between the public Howard in 1995, saying that he is in favour of the retention of Medicare, trying to present himself as the friendly family doctor, and the private John and the views he has had for decades, wanting to rip Medicare apart, as he did when a senior minister in the Fraser government. That was also his policy in 1987. In 1993 he was again wanting to rip apart Medicare and public universal health insurance. We know the difference between the public Howard circa 1995, who says that he is pro family, in favour of family values, and the private John, who believes in a laissez-faire economy-no intervention on the economybut somehow believes in intervention on family policy. This is the same private John who has opposed every wage increase for the past 10 years. He supports the concept of the white picket fence, denying family diversity and choice. This is the same private John who has gone nowhere for 20 years with his policy of as income splitting, unable to fund the huge public cost of $3 billion. We know the difference. We know the two faces of John Howard. That is why we are campaigning against both. There is the private John, the hard-line ideologue, the radical who would rip apart our social fabric, rip into the social safety net. We know the difference between him and the public Howard who is saying that he is a sensitive New Age leader. We know the difference between the public Howard who, on the issue of constitutional reform, says he wants a constitutional convention, he wants to see people's power take hold, and the private John who is British to his bootstraps, who is addicted to the House of Windsor, who is a footman to the monarchy. We know the difference between the public Howard circa 1995, who says he is in favour of a positive outlook on Asian integration, trying to make out he is our Marco Polo into Asia, and the private John who opposes the proportion of Asian immigration, who talks up security risks in our region, who in August refused to meet the political leader of Vietnam. We know the differences. We know the two faces of John Howard. There is the private John who is opposed to the South Pacific nuclear-free zone, who supported Reagan's Star Wars, who thought perestroika was a communist plot. But there is the public Howard who says that he is in favour of the abolition of nuclear weapons. He would have us believe in his public presentation, the new face of the Leader of the Opposition, that he was bringing down the Berlin Wall five years ago. We know the difference between the private John, who endorses the comments of the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) that government and the taxpayer have no role to play when families fall apart. We know the difference between those views and the public Howard-the deceitful, misleading position he is putting to the Australian people, trying to deceive them into believing that he supports the social safety net, trying to present himself as a community worker. For the Leader of the National Party to be talking about family policy, he obviously has not heard the comments of the member for Mackellar, who, on a Queensland radio station, said, 'It is not the responsibility of the taxpayer to pick up the remnants of a family when it breaks up.' Whose responsibility is it? If it is not the responsibility of the taxpayer, who picks up the pieces when families break apart? Is it the street cleaner who literally picks them up off the street in the morning? Is it the garbage man who bundles them together and takes them away? If the government does not do these things, who will? Is the opposition seriously proposing that North Shore matrons at a charity lunch will pick up the pieces and put families back together again, to offer the effective social safety net that only government can provide? These are views endorsed not only by the member for Mackellar, not only by the parliamentary leadership of the opposition, but also by the Lyons Forum-40 members of a far Right group of the opposition-calling for a 'tightening of the social welfare system to remove disincentives to family life'. We know the difference. We know the two faces of John Howard. We know private John and public Howard. From time to time there is a slip; there is an insight into this massive contradiction. This is the John Howard who told the Courier Mail, 'Don't worry about what we say about industrial relations. You all know what I think. It is what I have stood for for years and years.' How true. We do know what the private John thinks. We know what he stood for for years and years. No amount of backpedalling and PR exercises will ever change the fact that there are two faces to the Leader of the Opposition-the private face and the public face. The Australian people, when it comes to the next ballot, will support neither. And why should they? One is unelectable and the other is a malicious fraud. We know what private John thinks and we know what he stood for for years and years. But we also know what he does not stand for. He does not stand for public housing. He does not stand for public health insurance. He does not stand for labour market programs. He does not stand for basic community services. He does not stand for a safety net role to government. He does not support the idea of active government playing an equalising and liberating role in our society. We know him too well, as does the public. They remember 30 years ago the 26-year-old Carrick protege, the hard Right young Liberal hustling around the New South Wales branch. They remember 20 years ago the 36-year-old Fraser government minister, a champion of the hard Right in the parliamentary Liberal Party. They remember 10 years ago the 46-year-old-and let me quote his own words-'most conservative leader in the history of Australian politics'. He was stacking himself up against Joh Bjelke-Petersen. This was designed to outdo Joh! No amount of PR, no amount of backsliding and no amount of covering up formal policy releases will deceive the Australian people. They realise that, in 1995, the 56-year-old John Howard is not a new man. He is the same private John, the same malicious, deceitful private John that they have known for so many years. That, conclusively, will be reflected in the results of the next federal election. The Australian people will never support two faces. They will never support the private face and they will never support the public face of the Leader of the Opposition. One is unelectable-a hard Right ideologue-and the other is trying to deceive the Australian people at his very worse.",100
216,Mr REID,Unknown,"I am pleased to support the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) in the matter of public importance that he has brought before the House today. The Leader of the National Party spoke on behalf of battlers from Bourke and Balranald, and many other places in Australia. I can assure the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), who just made a meagre and shallow contribution to this debate, that no battler in Australia is impressed at all with the manufactured dorothy dix questions used by the government to dominate the time of the House of Representatives. The battlers are concerned with what is happening in the Australian economy. I want to run through a few things that are happening in the Australian economy right at this moment. The reality is that we have rising debt, rising inflation and rising unemployment. We have $180 billion in overseas debt--eight times the level of 1983, when the Hawke-Keating government came to office. Standard and Poor's, the international credit rating agency, numbers Australia as 49th out of 51 countries-49th, one of the worse efforts ever. That has all happened since 1983. Inflation is the highest that it has in five years-up 5.1 per cent. The ABS figures show that food has risen by 4Y2 per cent, housing costs are up by 11 per cent and the cost of servicing home loans is up by 25 per cent. This is what the battlers are worried about. They are not worrying about how you can manufacture some questions about opposition policies. The government's focus should be on the Australian economy. The government has imposed increased sales tax on Australian battlers. Thousands upon thousands of items have increased in price. More pressure is put on interest rates, the CPI figures go up and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) blames one-off factors. What a pathetic response! He does not give any detail-'It is just a one-off factor' - and sees no need to change monetary policy. In today's Financial Review, Tom Burton said, 'Don't believe what Mr Keating says when he says the inflation figures have no implications for interest rates.' Those in the community can see through you now. I can say one thing: the coalition will manage this economy better than you have ever done. You have rising debt, rising inflation and rising unemployment. Let us have a look at the small business scene. This government has a history of failing small business and bankruptcies. You have only to think back to the recession 'we had to have', which was caused by the then Treasurer, now the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). In 1993-94, 14,166 people went bankrupt; the figure in 1994-95 was 14,132. Those figures come from the annual report, tabled just today, of the Inspector-General on the operation of the Bankruptcy Act. Thirty per cent of businesses were included in those bankruptcies, and all we hear from the Prime Minister is that 'they have never had it so good'. In 1994-95 there were 14,132 bankruptcies-30 per cent. One would think that the Prime Minister would understand the plight of people in rural communities. This is where he has totally abrogated his responsibility. I want to tell you about an organisation in my electorate of central Victoria which has had one of the worse droughts in its history. The welfare been organisation-one of six in my electorate-is called Acts-Care Inc. Since 1992 this organisation has provided nearly 5,500 meals, just over 1,000 food parcels and has paid thousands of dollars in emergency relief to help the battlers of Bendigo, Ballarat, Bourke and Balranald. The emergency relief payments were for SEC accounts, gas and fuel and specialist doctors and dentists accounts. Now the association is paying for emergency relief to farmers, such as water for home consumption. I wrote to the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) on this matter and she wrote back. An excuse is always given for why the battlers cannot be helped. The minister stated: Grants under this program are to be used exclusively for the purpose of distributing emergency relief assistance, generally in the form of cash, the provision of a purchase voucher of a fixed value or the payment of an outstanding account on behalf of the client. The stated use of funds by Acts-Care Inc. do not, in the main, satisfy the Emergency Relief guidelines. I have just read out some of the facts of that organisation. It gives emergency relief to thousands of people. Do you think the government will help rural people? Not at all. It will not help rural people. Mr Chynoweth-Why won't we help them?",102
217,Mr REID,Unknown,"Do you know why? Mr Chynoweth-Jeff Kennett, that's why.",104
218,Mr REID,Unknown,"The government will not help them because there are no votes in rural areas for the Labor Party. It is waiting for an election to give you that message. Look at what has happened to the wool industry. Has there been any support or relief from the government to the primary producers after the four-month plunge in prices? 'No, we will just fiddle around at the edges. We are too busy doing dorothy dix questions about the coalition's policies.' It is not getting on and running the country and getting it into the proper economic shape and condition that it should be in. The member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) is in the chamber. He represents the area of central Victoria. During the second worse drought in that area's history there was not one cent of federal government support for those people in rural areas. They had floods one year, a mouse plague the following year and this year the second worse drought in central Victoria's history-and not $1 of help. What happened yesterday? The Prime Minister went to Ballarat. Because there is an election coming on, what did he do? He promised a $7'12 million drought facility, somewhere over near Ballarat. Where was he when the drought was on? These people have had nil income for nearly 12 months. Where was he then? He was not even game to show his face down there. I invited the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins). He would not come. I invited the Prime Minister. He would not come. They are not there to help the battlers. They are interested in getting dorothy dix questions up in this House which attack the coalition's policies. Get on and do the job that you are paid to do. That is what the government's job is about. Mr Ronaldson-John Anderson turned up.",104
219,Mr REID,Unknown,"John Anderson, the shadow minister for primary industry, turned up. He met all the people. But did we see a sign of a government minister? No, and not $1 for Ballarat, not $1 for Bendigo, not $1 for Bourke, in the heart of drought country. Mr O'Keefe interjecting",104
220,Mr REID,Unknown,"What about your constituents? Not $1. In the brief time remaining to me, I come back to the impact of that drought, the impact of the government's policies and their lack of concern about people in rural areas. With regard to the unemployment figures and the impact on rural cities like Bendigo, since 1990 the unemployment figures have doubled. In five years, they have doubled. They have gone from 3,911 people out of work to 7,035 people-exactly double. But all you can do is put up dorothy dix questions about the coalition's policies. I say to you that the battlers of Bendigo, Ballarat and all the other Bs-Bourke, Balranald, Bankstown-are waiting for an opportunity. You should ring the bell and start the contest. We are ready for you. I can tell you that the battlers from all of those areas will give you a very clear message-that your job is to look after the battlers of Australia. (Time expired)",104
221,Mr CHYNOWETH,Unknown,"I notice that the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) is still here. I would like to tell him that he should not get these matters of public importance from John O'Callaghan. If you want Johnno to write your matters of public importance, you really should have another look at it. He does a good job but surely someone on your side could come up with a better matter of public importance than this- 'the preoccupation with existing opposition policies'. We know there are only a couple of them, so we have to concentrate on those. Seeing that there are no opposition policies on the federal scene, let me tell you some of the policies on the state scene. I got a letter from a certain Jeff Kennett MP. He sent this letter to me before the last state election: Dear Chynoweth FamilyThanks Jeff, for doing this; he probably did not realise I was a Labor Party member, but still, he sent it to me. I will read out a little bit from this letter which was sent before the last state election. This is the sort of thing we will see from the Liberal Party during the next federal election. It is already shooting out all these letters. The letter reads: In your heart you really know what this election is all about-Justice and Jobs. Justice and jobs for hard working bread-winners who have been thrown out of work through no fault of their own. The Liberal Party has the policies, the team and the determination to get Victoria moving in the right direction. Note the words 'the right direction'. You have only got to look at the front bench to see the right direction-they are just about all members of the New Right. I think MCGauran is the only one who is not, and he does not know where he is. You have got all those people along there, all extremists, all with extreme views, and this is the sort of letter they will be sending out-'the right direction', 'the right people'. The letter continues: The coalition is determined to restart small and farmsI do not know why he is writing about farms to me in a city electorate; anyway, he was determined to do it to get our children off the dole and into employment, education or training. P.S. Please read the enclosed brochure which has news of a major new initiative which will benefit all Victorians. Regards Jeff I will keep this letter; it is a great letter. We had another one from our local candidate at the time. Let me tell you what the enclosed brochure said and what this great new initiative of the proposed state Liberal government at the time-they were the opposition but they got into government-was all about. The words under its logo read 'Justice and Jobs for Victoria', with the words 'Generating new jobs' on the front. It says that the coalition's new jobs initiative will generate between 30,000 and 40,000 new private sector jobs by June 1994. The new jobs initiative! It is a great scheme. They sent this lovely glossy brochure all over Victoria. Everyone supported it, and they probably got a lot of votes. I will read some of it to you: Private sector employers who take on new employees over and above their Victorian workforce numbers as at 30 June 1992 will receive a cash payment of up to $2,500 per annum for every additional employee. This is a great scheme. I think it was tried by Jimmy Carter. They are saying, 'You take on another employee and we will give you $2,500 for this.' It is a good scheme. I tended to think that it was not bad. However, this was what was given before the election. Mr O'Keefe-You didn't fall for it.",104
222,Mr CHYNOWETH,Unknown,"I did not fall for it, but a lot of people did. This brochure was sent out to a lot of people saying that it would generate work in small business. They said it was great-people will be getting jobs and 30,000 to 40,000 jobs will be created within six months. Let us read what happened after they were elected. The 'Autumn Statement-Treasurer's Speech' of 1993, as business presented by Alan Stockdale, says: ... given the Victorian budgetary outlook, the level of Commonwealth expenditure on employment programs and the general policy stance the Victorian government is taking to improve Victoria's business environment, the Government has decided not to proceed with the intended ""New Jobs"" initiative. This achieves an expenditure saving of $140 million in 1993-94. They sent this 'Justice and Jobs' brochure out, saying that everyone would get a job and that employers would get $2,500 for every extra employee they put on. As soon as they are elected, what do we see? Dr Kemp-The fastest jobs growth in Australia. That's what you saw.",105
223,Mr CHYNOWETH,Unknown,"They said it would achieve an expenditure saving of $140 million. They just did not proceed with itnot $1 of it. When the Liberals and members of the National Party come out in the future with all sorts of glossies like this with their little symbol on them, do not read what is in it. Have a look at what is not in it. Read the fine print. They are very good on the words. It is all the way through here: I will give examples, as I have a copy of their education policy and their state election document. What they have done to the education system in Victoria is a disgrace. We have had some comments before from the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) in relation to how well things are going in Victoria. The shadow minister at the table, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), just said it had the fastest jobs growth in Australia. Let us look at what has happened to tax in Victoria. There was no mention of tax in the 1992 pre-election manifesto. They said taxes would not change. However, a newspaper article, headed 'Victoria's tax bill soars by $2 billion', states: Victorians are paying an additional $2 billion a year in taxes under the Kennett Government. Victoria is the highest-taxed state in the country. Another article states: Victorians are the hardest-hit state and local government taxpayers in the land, forking out $2006 a head,-almost 40 per cent more than Australians. We Victorians are paying 40 per cent more tax than people in other states. Before was elected, there was no mention of tax increases. This is exactly the sort of thing federal opposition will do in the next election campaign. They are trying to introduce a GST by stealth. They say that they are not going to do it, but there have been all sorts noises. John Howard says that any suggestion that he had left the door open for a GST was a 'absolute nonsense'. Can you believe him? members of the opposition ever treasury bench, what would they do? It would not just be a GST that was imposed-taxes everything would go up. We would probably even see what we have had in Victoria-a poll tax. That was a tax on everyone's house in Victoria. The Victorian government used this tax an excuse to raise revenue. People who lived in Toorak or Brighton, where there are million dollar houses, got taxed $100. People in the poorer suburbs of Melbourne or anythey where in the country areas of Victoria also had to pay $100. Was that a fair tax? One hundred dollars is nothing to people who are millionaires. One hundred dollars money to people on the pension or unemployment benefit. We see already that John Howard is trying to distance himself from Jeffrey Kennett. That fact came out recently. Mr Howard has sort of said that he is no friend of Jeffrey. He is at arms-length. However, a couple of months ago a newspaper article reported: The Federal Opposition Leader, Mr John Howard, has told 'The Sunday Age' he wants Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett campaigning at his side in the next federal election. ""I think he's been a very successful, fearless courageous premier,"" ... So there we have it-the Leader of the Opposition is going to have Jeffrey campaigning alongside him. I certainly hope he comes down to Dunkley. He will be very welcome down there. Jeffrey is a great friend of mine. I am quite certain that, without his help, I will some not be elected at the next election. He has given me great help so far, and I expect more from him. I will be using him more, and I Jeffrey will be making this connection. As I said before, with the Liberal Party and the the National Party it is not what they say in these written brochures that they send out, which are all full of lies, of course. It is what they do not say. This is what we have to of watch. They will be trying to introduce a GST. They will be trying to gut Medicare, as they have tried to do before. They will have go at all of the social areas and the social If welfare areas that we support and try to got onto the remove that support. To see that we only have to look at what on the Victorian government have done to the school system down there. They have closed 271 primary schools and they have dismissed 8,200 teachers-not 820 but 8,200, a huge number. That is the sort of thing that they as will be getting support for from the opposition if it ever got into government. I am glad to say it will never get there. I am pleased to inform the Australian people that do not have to worry that John Howard will be dismissed after the next election, because, as soon as one of the coalition's leaders loses, it cuts their throat and dumps is a lot of them straight away.",105
224,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Snow)Order! The di-cussion has concluded. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.3) 1995-96 First Reading Message from the Administrator transmitting particulars of proposed expenditure and recommending appropriation announced. Bill presented by Mr O'Keefe, and read a first time. Second Reading",107
225,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"Burke-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport)(5.19 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1995-96, together with Appropriation Bill (No.4) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2) which I shall introduce shortly, comprise the additional estimates for 1995-96. In these bills, parliament is asked to approprienterprise ate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to the appropriations made for 1995-96 under Appropriation Acts Nos 1 and 2 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act. The additional appropriations in these three bills total some $1,416 million: $836 million is sought in Appropriation Bill (No.3), $577 million in Appropriation Bill (No.4) and $3 million in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2). These amounts are partly offset by savings in the appropriations made by Appropriation Acts Nos 1 and 2 1995-96. Reflecting the government's determination to improve the efficiency of continuing programs, these savings, amounting to $499 million in gross terms, are detailed under the relevant appropriation headings in the document Statement of savings expected in annual appropriations, which has been distributed to honourable members. After allowing for prospective savings, the appropriations sought represent a net incre:lse of $917 million in appropriations for 1995-96, an increase of about 2% per cent on the amounts made available through the annual appropriations at the time of the 1995-96 budget. I tum now to the main areas for which the government seeks additional provisions in Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1995-96 to meet payments for the ordinary annual services of the government. Running costs appropriations provide for the recurrent and minor capital costs of agencies in providing government services. The total supplementation for running costs for all departments and agenciesincluding defence military and civilian personnel-of $433 million represents an increase of 3.5 per cent on the funding for running costs included in Appropriation Act (No. 1). A number of factors contribute to this increase. Although the initial budget figuring made allowance for prospective wage and salary increases, it is not practice to appropriate these amounts at budget time. Funds, comprising more than 60 per cent of the total increase in running costs now being sought, are now required to meet increases resulting from agreements-including the 'foldback' arrangements-and other salary increases. Other major factors affecting running costs estimates include the impact of actual compared with estimated carryovers from 199495, borrowings against the forward estimates and some additional funding for departments associated with workload changes provided for under the running costs arrangements. Gross additional estimates of some $187 million are sought for the defence portfolio in Appropriation Bill (No.3). This figure includes $103 million for running costs, largely to meet increases associated with the second foldback under the APS workplace bargaining agreement 1992-94 and the 1995-96 APS enterprise agreement; $25 million for Voyager compensation, including some slippage in payments initially expected to be made in 1994-95; $46 million for defence facilities, largely attributable to an increased provision for re-configuration of Russell Offices building N annex, Salisbury redevelopment, HMAS Waterhen modernisation, Duntroon redevelopment and the Defence National Storage and Distribution Centre; and $5 million for an operating subsidy for Aerospace Technologies of Australia Aircraft Services Pty Ltd. The increases have been partly offset by reductions elsewhere in the defence appropriations, giving a net increase of some $117 million. In addition, Appropriation Bill (No.3) includes provision for a $22 million grant to the Sydney City Council for the restoration of the Sydney Customs House, reflecting a carry over of unspent funds from 1994-95; $24 million for the care of veterans in non-departpriations mental institutions, reflecting revised estimates based on the full-year experience in 1994-95-particularly for the care of veterans within the private hospital system; $28 million for the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, largely associated with an increase in the payments for the contracted case managers; a further $22 million for the Department of Administrative Services' career transition program reflecting a further downsizing of the Asset Services and Australian Construction Services programs; and $39 million to Australian National for redundancy arrangements associated with the restructure of Australian National following the establishment of the National Rail Corporation, together with supplementation for a cashflow shortfall arising from anticipated implementation of the preferred track access pricing model. The balance of some $184 million in the amount included in Appropriation Bill (No.3) is made up of minor variations across a range of programs in most departments and agencies. These additional appropriations are required to meet undertakings made by the government since the budget, as well as unavoidable cost and price increases and other economic parameter changes, including prices, since the budget was prepared. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Kemp) adjourned. APPROPRIA TION BILL (No.4) 1995-96 First Reading Message from the Administrator transmitting particulars of proposed expenditure and recommending appropriation announced. Bill presented by Mr O'Keefe, and read a first time. Second Reading",107
226,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. In Appropriation Bill (No.4) 1995-96, apprototalling $577 million-additional to those made by Appropriation Act (No.2) 1995-96-are sought for capital works and services; payments to or for the states, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory; advances and loans; and other services. The proposed appropriations are required to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures for which provision was not made in the budget appropriation measures. The additions are necessitated by certain cost and price increases which have occurred since the budget, together with other commitments that have been made by the government. Areas where significant increases are sought over amounts provided in Appropriation Act (No.2) 1995-96 include: a $322 million payment to Qantas under the indemnity granted in respect of disputed withholding tax on certain aircraft financing transactions, in accordance with the arrangements disclosed in the Qantas sale prospectus; $20 million for the supported accommodation assistance program, principally reflecting a carry over from 1994-95 following a delay by New South Wales in signing a new contract with the Commonwealth until after 30 June 1995; a $5 million payment· to the Northern Territory for the provision of water and sewerage facilities for indigenous communities; $6 million for coordinated care trials for people with ongoing and complex health needs in accordance with the decision of the Council of Australian Governments; $25 million for computer equipment for the Department of Social Security, largely as a consequence of bringing forward expenditure from future years to address its IT system requirements; a $7 million payment to New South Wales towards the infrastructure costs associated with the establishment of the Fox Film Studios at the Sydney showground site, as foreshadowed in the Prime Minister's cultural statement in October 1994; $25 million for New South Wales for the development of the new Royal Agricultural Society site at Homebush; $69 million for a loan for a two-year period to Papua New Guinea in the context of economic stabilisation and general reforms under the auspices of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The remaining $98 million included in Appropriation Bill (No.4) comprises minor increases in a number of programs across a range of portfolios. I commend the bill to the House.

228,Mr HORNE,Unknown,I present the 27th report from the Publications Committee sitting in conference with the Publications Committee of the Senate. Copies of the report are being circulated to honourable members in the chamber. Report-by leave-adopted. Privileges Committee Report,109
229,Mr SAWFORD,Unknown,"I present the report from the Committee of Privileges in connection with the matter referred to the committee by the Speaker and endorsed by the House on 22 August 1995: the execution of a search warrant on the electorate office of Mr E.H. Cameron MP, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be printed.",109
230,Mr SA WFORD,Unknown,"by leave-The report I have just presented arose from the execution, by officers of the Australian Federal Police, of a search warrant on the electorate office of the member for Stirling (Mr Cameron) on 26 July. The committee was required to consider whether a contempt had been committed in connection with the execution of the warrant. In the course of its inquiry, the committee was assisted by written submissions from the member for Stirling and from the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. In addition, the member for Stirling appeared before the committee on 21 September. The member for Stirling did not argue that the Australian Federal Police officers involved had acted improperly. The substance of his concern was the disruption caused to his office during the search, the removal of certain information and the effect that the actions had on his ability to perform his duties as a member. The honourable member quoted from statements by citizens expressing concern about the confidentiality of information which might be provided to his office. While the committee appreciates the position in which this matter placed Mr Cameron, it has found that, although the actions complained of amounted to interference in the performance by Mr Cameron of his duties as a member, the interference was not improper interference. Accordingly, the committee has concluded that no contempt was committed by the officers involved. On the general issue, it is no reflection on the Australian Federal Police to note that the present reference has illustrated the extent to which the execution of a search warrant can disrupt the work of an electorate office. The committee acknowledges that there is no parliamentary immunity which would exempt electorate offices from the execution of such search warrants. It recognises, however, that members' electorate offices are vital to the performance of their duties as members and are important to constituents. Members and their assistants are called upon to help in many matters and they come into possession of much confidential and sensitive information. As an interim measure, the committee considers that the proper operation of electorate offices and the assistance and services provided to constituents would justify the negotiation of an understanding which would not impede the operations of the law enforcement authorities between the minister responsible for the Australian Federal Police and the Speaker in respect of search warrants. I emphasise that suchan understanding would not create any immunity for members; it would not seek to change the statutory provisions. But it would enable some ground rules to be agreed, at least in so far as the Australian Federal Police were concerned, so as to recognise the reasonable interests of members and their constituents, particularly in respect of sensitive or confidential information. It could, for example, be agreed that a third party be given custody of documents a member wished to withhold and that such documents could be held pending resolution of the member's claim. The committee therefore recommends that the House request the Speaker to initiate discussions with the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), with the objective of reaching such an understanding. The committee would be very pleased to assist in this process. I repeat: the committee is not seeking an additional privilege or immunity for members in this matter. Rather, it is suggesting that some guidance should be available to assist when these matters arise, to the benefit of constituents, not just members and their assistants.

231,Mrs SULLIVAN,Unknown," Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence, we have lost several minutes of what would normally have been adjournment debate time for, essentially, government business and parliamentary business. In the past, on particular occasions, agreements have been entered into for the suspension of sessional orders to allow the adjournment debate to run for 30 minutes. I wonder whether we can get an indication from the government as to whether they might agree to allow the adjournment debate to take place for 30 minutes today and move the appropriate motion to facilitate it. Mr LEO MCLEA Y (Watson)-Even though, unfortunately, we have taken 10 minutes of what would have been the adjournment, it is the government's intention that we should finish at 6 o'clock. I think that the great majority of members would prefer. NA Motion (by Mr Walker) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Boynelfannum High School",110
232,Mr NEVILLE,Unknown," sioned Good government, we are told, is supposed to reflect the will of the people. Yet some governments just never learn. A case in point is the Queensland Labor government which, local over the past six years, has tried to force will in regard to the necessity and location a proposed high school on the people of a coastal community in central Queensland. Boyne Islandffannum Sands is a rapidly growing urban satellite community just south of Gladstone in my electorate of Hinkler. The community's growth has mirrored the develthe high school. opment of the nearby Boyne Smelter, which is presently undergoing further expansion with the construction of a third potline set to double the plant's aluminium production over the next few years. While this coastal comcomponent munity is part of the greater Gladstone region, it has a lifestyle and quality of life distinctly its own. However, rapid growth has demanded new services. Education, particularly a high school, been a key concern for the BoynefTannum signed parents over recent years. Every school day 500 students from Boyne Island, Tannum Sands, Benaraby and Miriam Vale travel on crowded buses to and from Gladstone at highway speeds along busy industrial corriHamill, dors. In May of this year, just prior to the state election, the then ALP member for Gladstone, Neil Bennett, wrote to all residents promising a high school for BoynefTannum by the beginning of 1997. At last, after six long years, the Goss government reiterated its earlier promise that a high school would be built at BoynefTannum. But, to demonstrate its arrogance again, the debate turned from when to where the school would be builtanother stalling mechanism. The state government prefers the Canoe Point site at Tannum Sands, which was originally purchased for this purpose by the is what education department back in 1979. The Calliope Shire Council, the Capricorn Conservation Council and over 700 local residents who signed a recent petition opposing the Canoe Point, favour two alternative sites in Tannum Sands, known as the Boyne Smelter site and another portion 37 site. In June of this year, a government-commisenvironmental impact study concluded that the development of a school at the Canoe Point site would have 'minor environmental impacts'. The council, conservationists and residents disagreed and criticised the EIS its for its lack of public consultation. Calliope of Shire CEO Graeme Kanofski described the EIS as 'a sham and a deliberate misrepresentation of the facts'. Former Calliope mayor and local Independent MLA for Gladstone, Liz Cunningham, claimed the EIS was merely to confirm the government's preferred site for Council recreation officer Nick Alderson reported that the Canoe Point site with its melaleuca wetlands, mangroves and rainforest was of 'vital importance' and 'an essential of the overall reserve'. Similarly, the Capricorn Conservation Council has expressed its opposition to the Canoe Point site because development there would endanger vegetation unique to the area. If that was has not enough, 762 BoynefTannum residents a petition earlier this month urging the government to consider a site more suitable for a high school than Canoe Point. In a letter to the Calliope council this month, the Minister for Education, David has sought assurances that council will provide services such as roads, water, drainage and sewerage, to the alternative Boyne Smelter site. Council has agreed with Mayor George Creed saying the site is 'less environmentally sensitive', 'more central to the existing and future community' and would have suitable access via future arterial roads yet to be built. I call on the Queensland government to heed the will of the people of Boynerrannum about their preferred siting of a high school. While the Goss government may have inherited the Canoe Point site, it has had six years, three state elections and three education ministers to do something about resolving this issue. There has been obstruction, prevarication and stonewalling. It is time this nonsense stopped. The need is clear. The acceptable site is available. The council has guaranteed services and the people of Boynerrannum deserve equity. There should be no excuse for further delays. Optus Vision: Aerial Cabling",111
233,Mrs EASSON,Unknown,"I rise to speak on the issue of Optus Vision broadband cable network proposal in my electorate of Lowe and the local government area of Drummoyne Council. Drummoyne Council has made a submission to Austel regarding Optus Vision aerial cabling because it believes the carrier has not satisfied the obligaclutter tions under the provisions of the Telecommunications National Code 1994. I endorse its concerns. These concerns relate specifically to the notification process, the level of information provided, the standard of environmental assessment submitted, lack of consideration of alternative cabling methods and non-compliance with its own corporate environmental plan. Drummoyne Council considers this to be a matter of importance and requests that it be addressed immediately as Optus is commencing cable roll out on Tuesday, 31 October. To open up competition to cable TV, Telstra and Optus Vision will be laying cables. Telstra plans to lay 80 per cent of them underground with 20 per cent above ground and Optus is planning to put up aerial cabling, which will include pay TV, local phone calls and eventually an interactive service for personal computers. Optus says that this cable is only 17 millimetres in width-that of a five cent piece-and is placed at least a metre below the regular power lines. Optus says it is for safety of installation and maintenance purposes but I also suspect it is due to interference with electricity. However, at this stage, from the photos that I have seen from Blacktown where the aerial cable has been installed, it is very unsightly. It is black and it appears much thicker than has been indicated. As a result of the lack of information, it was necessary for the Drummoyne Council to go to the Blacktown area and take these photographs. Despite obvious differences in urban form, initial concerns regarding the visual impacts of the cabling have been confirmed. The problems that have arisen include the thickness and colour of the cable being inconsistent with existing cables; the location of cables, over a metre below existing lines, lowering and extending the layer of wires and cable, making it more conspicuous; the visual impact at intersections being particularly intrusive; the connections to individual premises being prominent; and the overall cumulative impact of cabling increasing the visual of the streetscape and being a retrograde step in providing a quality urban environment. Optus maintain that these cables can run safely through trees and therefore they do not need to be trimmed. Optus also claim that they will not install cabling in heritage areas. I also understand that Optus and Telstra will both be paying rent to the electricity companies and that, should an electricity company or council decide to incur the expense and put electric wires underground, Optus are willing to share the expense of going underground instead of using aerial cabling. I realise that people will have an option of phone companies with regular local calls capped at 25c as a maximum, cable TV and other activities. Optus, incidentally, has the Disney channel. But for people who do not wish to take this option up, or even for those who do, it must be done in an aesthetically acceptable way. Underground is expensive and sometimes impractical but, if aerial cabling is to proceed without community outrage, it needs to be thin, discreet cabling, light in colour and closer to. the .existing power lines and therefore less mtrusive. I have spoken this week to Austel, which is considering Drummoyne Council's submission of complaint, and to Telstra, Optus and Drummoyne Council. Optus must be prepared to meet with the council and sort out a workable solution to this problem.",112
234,Mrs SULLIVAN,Unknown,"Moncrieft) (5.47 p.m.)I will detain the House only briefly this evening, but I feel constrained to make a few comments on the subject of this government's attitude on issues of law and order. I am well aware that they are issues that are more commonly identified with state governments. However, the federal government does have a very important role to play in the subject of law and order. I have raised more than one issue under that heading during the term of this parliament and I have never received a word of response from the government. I am very much aware that various government ministers, and probably all of them, who are concerned are acquainted with my views. I was made aware of that last Thursday when, in an interview with the radio program AM, the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) referred to the statements I had made on the Yakuza. These were the speeches and questions that I had raised in this place on that subject but had not directed to him. He was nevertheless aware of them. So I am satisfied that those ministers who have a responsibility for my interest in the Yakuza are aware of my views. I reiterate: none of them has ever responded to the questions I have asked in this place on this matter. This is not the only law and order issue I have raised here. Recently I raised the case of the Department of Social Security refusi.ng to cooperate with law enforcement agencIes which held warrants for the arrest of felons who may be receiving social secUI·-ty. The department will not cooperate wIth law enforcement agencies on making available to those agencies information it has on the whereabouts of those people for whom warrants have been issued. I refer again to the Yakuza because at the end of last week the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) opened a new AFP office on the Gold Coast. He made a speech in which he referred to the Yakuza. He said that one issue which is sometimes given hysterical media treatment is the Yakuza issue. I take issue with the minister. I do not believe the treatment of the Yakuza has ever been hysterical. I believe it has been objective and quite fair. However, Yakuza when governments refuse to take any notice of what is being said and genuine concerns that are being raised, naturally the press are inclined to press the government. Reports of Yakuza visiting casinos in ev-ry capital city in Australia have been appeanng in our newspapers for some years. These reports have been confirmed by the Austr-Ian Federal Police, so the reports are neIther recent nor hysterical. They have been straight out matter of fact. I rise to put on record my concern at the minister's apparent dismissal of the subject of the activities of these people in Australia. There is plenty of evidence that, in their own way, the Yakuza are establishing themselves in Australia, not least through major property purchases. Despite the fact that it was 2'12 years ago that I raised the. matter of t-e ownership of a very expenSIve prope-y 10 Surfers Paradise by the 2IC of the bIggest Yakuza gang in Japan, Masaru Takumi, he still owns that property and he is still the principal director of a company registered on the Australian Stock Exchange. I would not want to be peremptory on these things but I do not think it unreasonable - hat a government have in place some mec-amswhereby people like this can be reqUired, 10 a reasonable time, to divest themselves of that Australian holdings of property and companies because without a doubt that is the foothold that the Yakuza have established wherever they have moved. The government has been warned. It has chosen not to act.

235,Mr CLEELAND,Unknown," dress Last evening, the member for Casey (Mr Halverson) raised matters which concerned me. I would like to thank him for acknowhere-this ledging how widespread concern is in Victoria for the selling off of our public utilities Kennett government. I must say that I was saddened that the member for Casey, a fellow member of parliament for whom I have the sell greatest of respect, has been drawn into this debate which has been raging within my electorate of MCEwen for the past six weeks. I am concerned that he has been misinformed else? by members and supporters of the Liberal Party in MCEwen. Before continuing, I would have liked have tabled several documents but I know that the opposition would refuse me that privilege. Those documents repudiate beyond a shadow of doubt that it was not 'public knowledge' at the time my letter went to the electorate 'that Electricite de France was no dren. longer involved in any negotiations regarding the sale of Eastern Energy or, for that matter, any other energy business in Victoria.' These documents-a copy of my letter to the electorate, a copy of the statement made by Mr Stockdale, the Victorian Treasurer, from AAP dated 12 September 1995, and a nonsense! copy of the Herald Sun article that the member for Casey referred to dated 5 August 1995-indicate quite clearly that it was not 'public knowledge' that Electricite de France was no longer involved in negotiations. point out to you, Mr Speaker, that my letter went out to the electorate 38 days after article appeared in the Herald Sun, and at that time neither the Victorian Treasurer nor French Embassy was denying the involvement of Electricite de France in any bidding proI cess. I also point out that the article in the ald Sun referred to the bidding for United Energy not Eastern Energy, the company the member for Casey mentioned yesterday. I the would also like to inform the House that some 3,500 signatures have been received in my the electorate office. Petitions are still being returned and it is my intention to table a petition at the next sitting of the parliament. That being said, I would now like to adthe issue of the selling off of public utilities by the Kennett government in Victoria. Let there be no misunderstanding is the real issue and it highlights the ideological and philosophical differences by the between me and the Liberal Party and my Liberal Party opponent. The simple fact is that the Liberal and National parties intend to off all of Australia's public utilities, such as electricity, gas, water, Telecom and, without question, Australia Post. Why would you not sell Australia Post, having sold everything That is the philosophy that my Liberal opponent, Mrs Bailey, supports. This is the to same person who, in 1993, saw nothing wrong with taxing food and ripping into wages. This is the same person who supports the Kennett government's attack on ordinary Victorians' access to public hospitals, ambulances and a decent education for their chilWhen I stand up to represent the people who elected me and to oppose the savage impost of charges and taxes they are suffering from under the Liberal and National parties, I am told that these are state issues and that they have nothing to do with me. What Despite personal vilification and personal attacks, I will not be diverted from what are the important issues-issues of public policy and issues which involve ordinary Australians I and ordinary Victorians. My rights as a citizen to comment on matters political are the paramount. Whether those issues are local, state or federal government issues, my right the to comment is paramount. The Liberal and National parties in Victoria do not accept that have that right. They are disappointed, but I will continue to ensure that they remain Herdisappointed because I will not be muzzled by these vicious and untrue personal attacks. Whilst I am prepared to draw attention to difficulties being faced by the residents of the division of MCEwen, my Liberal opponent stands mute. Not a word from her about improving education services. Not a word about improving hospital and ambulance services. Not a word about improving maternal and child-care services in Victoria. Not a word about reducing the savage taxes imposed by Kennett on Victorian families. Not a word about the increase in public foreign debt caused by her friend Jeff Kennett. Not a word of acknowledgment from her on the fact that the Commonwealth government has not borrowed overseas since 1987. No acknowledgment from her that unemployment has fallen as a result of federal Labor policies, despite the 80,000 jobs lost in Victoria as a result of Liberal Party policy. I stand on policy issues, and I will be judged on policy issues. It is a shame that my Liberal opponent, Mrs Fran Bailey, is afraid to debate me on policy matters. Harrison, Ms Helen",114

Congratulations everyone at Pleasant Street Primary School and to everyone in Ballarat. Westjobs",115
237,Ms DEAHM,Unknown,"Macquarie) (5.58 p.m.)What a lovely speech to follow. Unemployment is an issue that we are all concerned about-no more so than in the area I come from, the greater west of Sydney. I wanted to speak tonight about a program called Westjobs, which is an initiative of two area consultative committees in the area-the Central West ACC and the Outer West ACC, and both of them cover parts of my electorate. On 9 October, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) launched Westjobs at a breakfast meeting at the Rooty Hill RSL. The target for the ACCs was to create 4,000 new jobs in the area by the end of November. The figures I got this afternoon show that 2,500 jobs have already been arranged. I am very proud of that. I am very proud of the ACCs and the hard work I would like to personally congratulate the chairman of the Central West ACC, Mr Ross Jones, and the chairman of the Outer West ACC, Mr Jim Bosnjak, for the hard work they and all the members of their committees have put in. Outside their launch they had a West jobs bus. Mr Bosnjak is the owner of Westbus, so obviously he was able to provide this. Last week, after returning from parliament, II formally launched the separate Hawkesbury section of Westjobs in Richmond. It was a very interesting occasion because there were well a number of speakers from a wide range of up community groups. A local councillor, who is a shopkeeper and the president of the teacher Richmond Chamber of Commerce, spoke of her experience of being asked to conduct some classes in retailing at a T AFE college. She went along to the T AFE college thinking, you 'What am I doing here? What do these unemand ployed people want? Why can't they get a to ever job? Why do they need my help?' After the first night she wanted to run away and not come back because these people did not seem to understand what she was on to about. As she got to know these people, she realised that they had had pride in themselves but had lost that through being unemployed and they needed a help up. She has been instrumental in that, and it has been educational for her. We also heard from a trainee who was employed in a traineeship at Richmond TAPE. She talked about her experience of being trained on the job, doing TAFE courses and then being able to go into the work force into a permanent job. A lot of small business people were there, and it is the small business people who will be taking up the challenges under new work opportunities, traineeships and other programs which will eventually result in long-term permanent jobs for these people. We hear a lot from the opposition, particularly from the shadow minister, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), who I am glad to see is in the chamber tonight. He constantly criticises our labour market programs and says they are useless. I have attended a number of graduations under the LEAP program-which is for young people-and this is one of the programs that he says are useless. I made a speech in an adjournment debate some time ago about a graduation in which 11 young people graduated and 10 of them had jobs before they had finished the program. So these are excellent programs that lead into the work force. I read in my local paper this week that the honourable member was in my electorate recently and criticised the federal government for not responding sufficiently in funding an organisation called InteLife. InteLife has been funded under those very same labour market programs that this man criticises. He has got a cheek doing that. I am very proud of my ACCs. I am very proud of the small businesses and other organisations in the greater west of Sydney, and particularly in my electorate, which are willing to take on these young people and other long-term unemployed people to see that they get appropriate training, regain their confidence and are in a position where they can be taken on as long-term employed people. I would like to congratulate everyone concerned in this program. Drought",115
238,Mr COBB,Unknown,"I refer to the last round of the exceptional circumstance drought declarations and welcome the very belated acceptance of the Band C divisions of the Dubbo Rural Lands Protection Board into the drought relief payment scheme, which is something that should have occurred over 12 months ago. However, I must also express my disbelief and extreme frustration that other drought ravaged regions in my electorate have been yet again excluded. I refer specifically to division A of the Nyngan RLPB, which is based on Girilambone and Coolabah, large areas of the Cobar and Wilcannia boards, especially north of the Barrier Highwaythese are very large areas, each of them approximating the size of Tasmania-and certain areas in the Condobolin Rural Land Protection Board. The mechanism that must be followed for areas to qualify for exceptional circumstance assistance is long and tortuous, and it would seem that it is designed to deliberately exclude many very deserving areas. This drought has been going for years now. In New South Wales, where in many instances it has been the worse drought in history, less than five per cent of total farmers are receiving any help at all. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) has to make up his mind whether he wants to help these farmers or not. If he does not want to help them, he should just come out and say so, but he should not pretend that he is helping them and take credit for something that he is not delivering on. To most farmers-in fact, to most people, and I would say to most politicians-the criterion to get into the scheme is a total mystery. If you ring the minister's office for reasoning as to why some of these areas have been left out, either you get fobbed off or they say the reasons are not to be made available or you can only get them through an FOI request. It is all very secretive. Nothing about it is transparent. I know hardly anyone at all who understands the process. The farmers themselves are totally puzzled as to why some properties are in and all the neighbouring properties are out. How can a fence line make a difference, when it is obvious to anyone with half a brain that everybody in these regions is affected equally? The farmers feel totally cheated and forgotten. They feel that they are victims of an inequitable system and they feel abandoned. To my knowledge, the minister for primary industries and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) have yet to set foot on a property in New South Wales on an official drought inspection. We have the minister for primary industries running around making claims that he spent hundreds of millions of dollars, yet he has delivered on only a very small fraction of that. When I ring his office, the only reason I am ever given is that they have had too much rain. What an insult! The worse drought in Australia's history and they are told they have had too much rain. In many instances, a wealth of knowledge by way of submissions has been presented. From Division A of Nyngan, the Rural Lands Protection Board officials, the Department of Agriculture agronomist, the rural counsellors, even the state Department of Agriculture-all recommending that this area be included. The Department of Agriculture has written to the state minister. The state minister has agreed, as I understand it, and has written to the federal minister. The federal minister is still refusing, because of these criteria which noone can understand. Last night a woman from Nymagee rang me. She and her son are trying to run a property. Her husband passed away some time ago. She is living on a war widow's pension. She will strip three bags of wheat this year. The drought is far from broken in these areas. Yet she can get no assistance at all. In Wilcannia, people are desperate. Marie Russell has faxed me a letter. She lost 2,700 sheep last December. It did rain last January-the last time it rained there. They joined their ewes. The ewes have now lambed. Because of the dry conditions, the ewes are walking away from the lambs and the lambs are dying. The river is in waterholes. They have had to pipe water from the river. The tanks are very low. They are running less than half the number of sheep they would normally run. Wilcannia and Tilpa are desperate for help. I have a letter from the Cobar Rural Lands Protection Board, crying out for assistance. They have tried everything they can with this federal minister and he still will not listen to them. I say again: does the minister want to help these farmers or doesn'the? If he says he wants to, let him deliver. Anybody who goes there-he has not been there yet-<:an see that these people need assistance desperately. (Time expired) Economic Management",116

Let me give some of the indicators. On the question of employment growth, Menzies, 2.1 per cent annual average growth; the Keating and Hawke governments, 2.1 per cent-matching what the Liberal Party regard as a golden era on this all-important indicator of employment growth. On inflation-the annual average rate of inflation for the Menzies period, 4.6 per cent; for the current government, little different-5.4 per cent. On the key indicator of GDP annual growth, for the Menzies period-this so-called golden age of economic performance in Australia-2.0 per cent. The figure for the Hawke and Keating governments, 2.1 per cent-better than the golden age, as described by the Liberal Party.

269,Mr GEAR,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: There are approximately 3175 Child Support Agency clients in the electoral division of Grey. This number is made up of approximately 1749 payers and approximately 1426 payees. The figures provided are only approximates as information regarding child support payees and payers is stored by the CSA Computer System against postcodes of the client and not by electoral division. Consequently, there are some difficulties in answering this question as postcodes do not correspond exactly with electoral boundaries and many postcodes will relate to more than one electorate. NA Sim, Mrs Jenni (Question No. 2615) Mr Slipper asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 19 September 1995: Has he received my letters of 23 March 1995 and a subsequent letter of 12 May 1995 on behalf of Mrs Jenni Sim; if so, when will he respond.",143
270,Mr GEAR,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: A number of issues were raised by Mrs Sim in her letter to you. I sought the advice of the Child Support Registrar in relation to the matters raised by Mrs Sim and I forwarded a letter to you on those matters on 17 October 1995. Your representations were also referred to the Minister for Social 1992 Security and the Attorney-General for attention to those matters outside my responsibility for the Child Support Scheme. Medical Practitioners in Australia (Question No. 2617) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 20 September 1995: (1) What was the (a) total number of medical practitioners and (b) number of overseas trained medical practitioners practising in (i) Australia, (ii) each State and Territory, (iii) metropolitan Australia, (iv) the rest of Australia, and (v) the electoral division of Parkes in each year since 1980. (2) What measures is the Government taking to ensure adequate numbers of medical practitioners practise in country areas and with what results.",143
271,Dr LAWRENCE,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The total number of medical practitioners in Australia, as measured by at least one service billed against Medicare, for the year 1994-95 was 39,812. The total number of medical practitioners for each State and Territory for the same year was: NSW13,542; Vic-1O,233; Qld-6,750; SA-3,620; WA-3,687; Tas-987; NT-301; ACT-692. I have provided tables which give a detailed breakdown of the number of medical practitioners with Australian or overseas qualifications and whether practising in metropolitan areas or otherwise to the honourable member, and these are available from the Table Office. It is not possible to give data on the number of medical practitioners before the establishment of Medicare. Therefore, the data begin at the year 1984-85 and provides yearly figures up to 1994-95. I have also provided figures on the number of active medical practitioners in the electoral division of Parkes for the financial years 1984-85, 1989-90 and 1994-95. (2) The National Rural Health Strategy, endorsed by Australian Health Ministers in 1994, provides an agreed national framework for improving access to, and the quality of, health services for people in rural Australia including recruitment and retention of the rural medical work force. The factors affecting recruitment and retention of doctors in rural areas are not simply a result of financial incentives and include professional and family support, appropriate training, relief and adequate facilities and equipment. The Government has introduced the General Practice Strategy which includes initiatives to address some of these factors for GPs-such as the GP Rural Incentives Program ($15.1 million allocated in 1995-96), rural loadings within the Better Practice Program and the Divisions of General Practice Program. Specialist services in rural areas are also receiving attention. The trialling of innovative models for providing specialist services to rural residents is under way. The GP Rural Incentives Program provides grants for relocation of GPs to under-serviced areas, training grants to improve the skills of rural/remote GPs ($4 million available for relocation and training grants) and remote area grants ($2.5 million) to retain GPs in very remote locations. At 5 September 1995, 163 relocation grants, 88 training grants (half of which are also associated with retention grants) and 30 remote area grants have been approved. In addition, the Program provides continuing medical education and locum support grants ($5 million allocated for 1995-96) to support GPs already in rural and remote practice. Rural divisions and rural division coordinating units have used this funding to establish many projects to provide locum and other professional support to rural and remote GPs. Grants for medical undergraduate initiatives have also been made available to encourage students to choose a career in rural medicine (total $2.5 million). Changes have begun in the medical school curriculum to have a greater focus on rural medicine. Assessment and support panels have been established in each State and the Northern Territory to advise on rural and remote areas where there are shortages of GPs and to assist in the implementation of the Program. The panels also provide valuable support function for GPs and their families who are relocating to rural practice as well as those already in rural practice. The panels have representatives from consumer groups, the medical profession and StatelNT and Commonwealth governments. In addition rural divisions coordinating units have been established to provide support to rural divisions and co-ordinate activities at the State level. Computer Usage in Nursing Homes (Question No. 2620) Dr Wooldridge asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 20 September 1995: (1) Did her Department commission a survey in late 1994 of computer usage in nursing homes; if so, (a) what did the survey cost, (b) how many completed responses were received from nursing home proprietors, (c) what proportion of proprietors provided completed responses and (d) will she provide a summary of the survey's findings. (2) What consultations has the Government undertaken with the residential aged care industry about the introduction of online reporting facilities. (3) Is the Government developing online reporting requirements as an alternative to simplifying existing reporting requirements for residential aged care proprietors and managers.",143
272,Dr LAWRENCE,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Department did conduct a survey of computer usage in nursing homes in 1994; (a) the survey was conducted by the Department using in-house resources. The following cost figures are estimates: the cost of printing the survey form was $144; postage costs to mail survey forms was $1712; and the cost of summarising and analysing the survey results was $2530. The total cost of the survey to the Department is therefore estimated at $4386, (b) 1147 completed responses were received, (c) this represents 79% of survey forms dispatched, (d) a summary of survey findings is as follows: Background The survey was designed jointly by staff of the Department of Human Services and Health and Electronic Trading Concepts, with advice from a liaison committee of industry representatives. Surveys were distributed with a covering letter and a stamped, addressed return envelope, on 7 September 1994 with a closing date of 26 September 1994. One thousand four hundred and fifty three surveys were circulated, addressed to all nursing homes on the nursing homes payment system at that date. Response rate One thousand one hundred and forty seven returns were received by the time data entry commenced on 14 October 1994. This represents a response rate of 79%. The lowest response rate was in the Northern Territory with 71 % and the highest in the ACT with 100%. However the numbers in the Territories are very small; if the Territories are excluded the response rate ranged from 76--84%. Using the standard departmental definitions capital cities, rural areas and remote areas, there was a 77% response from homes in capital an 84% response from homes in rural areas and a 77% response from homes in remote areas. The numbers of these latter were of course small-27 responses out of 36 homes. Replies were also fairly evenly distributed sectors as recorded on the nursing homes payment system. Response rate was 86% for religious charitable (C) homes and 85% for Transferred (X) homes (largely comprising religious and homes). Adjusted fee homes (S) had a of 81 %, government homes (G) and private for profit homes (E) each 74%. Although, aside from the Territories, the response rate was fairly even among States for religious and charitable (C and X homes), there are greater differences in response among the private for profit homes which range from a response rate of 57% in Tasmania to 86% in Queensland. There were also large discrepancies in the percentage returns from Government homes (0% in South Australia to 100% in Victoria) but numbers in each case are so small that these discrepancies are not significant. All responses from Government and adjusted fee homes be treated with caution for this reason. Response rates increased with the size of nursing home, although within a limited range-the lowest rate was 78% from homes with 19 beds or less, the highest was 86% from homes of 150 or more. Overall there is no reason to suppose that the responses received were not representative of the nursing home population as a whole. Completion of Departmental forms The first question on the survey asked about the completion of Departmental forms. The aim of this question was to establish which forms were completed in the nursing home itself, which by the head office of an organisation and which by a management company. It was hoped that this would give some indicator of whether electronic commerce would need to be implemented for fifteen hundred individual users in the long run, or for a smaller number who would be undertaking work for the majority of nursing homes. It is clear from the responses to this question that most forms are completed in the nursing home itself. The form which is most likely to be filled at the nursing home is the NH4, Application for Resident Classification, which requires personal knowledge of the resident. The form which is least likely to be completed at the nursing home is the Annual Reconciliation, the NH20. In fact this is the only form of which more are completed outside the nursing home than at the nursing home. This form is complex and is of more likely to require accounting skills. It is therefore the form most likely to be completed by cities, a management company (21%). Nursing homes were asked whether they used paper or computer records to complete Departmental forms, in an attempt to calculate how much transcription for existing records goes on. Responsacross es varied between forms, with computers being used most for the NH20 (46% of respondents), the and NH3 (31 %) and the NH3a (35%). For all other forms, less than 10% of respondents used computer charitable records to complete the forms. response rate Computer, fax and modem use In total 88% of nursing homes who replied have a computer. These are evenly divided among States and Territories, with the Territories at the extremes (100% in the ACT and 80% in the NT). The response rate was highest in WA with 96%. Across sectors, the private-for-profit sector had fewer computers-79% of respondents compared with over 90% in all other sectors. Geographical location the made little difference and nor did bed numbers (responses ranged from 86% in the smallest two bed groupings to 100% in the homes over 150 beds should with an even progression in between). Eighty eight percent of homes had a fax machine. These are not necessarily exactly the same the group as those who have a computer-8l % of homes had both a computer and a fax. Fax ownership was lowest (80% of respondents) in the private beds for profit sector and highest among C homes. Between States (excluding the Territories) it was . highest in New South Wales (96%) and lowest in South Australia (75%). As might be expected, fax use went up steadily on the spectrum State capitalrural-remote and with bed size, although the lowest usage was 80% in beds in the 20-39 grouping. Only 48% of homes had a modem. These were fairly evenly distributed between States except sectors for Tasmania where only 24% of respondents had one, and between sectors except again the lowest response was in the private for profit sector with 39%. Usage was highest in remote areas (59%) and in the largest homes (83% of the homes with more than 150 beds). Overall 47% of homes responding had a computer, a fax and a modem. Of homes which had a computer, the most common form of usage was word processing (91 %), followed by accounts (78%) and payroll (77%). Thirty five percent claimed to use their computer for the management of DHSH funds, but the survey does not enable us to distinguish exactly in what ways. Computer systems Nursing homes who had computers were asked what sort of hardware they had. The majority of homes with a computer used an IBM compatible PC (75%); eleven percent used a mini mainframe and only 2% an Apple Mac. Of those with an IBM compatible PC, the most common software was Windows (63%) followed by DOS (44%). Homes were also asked who developed the software they used: answers to this question were various, including some which indicated that the question has not been understood and many who had developed the system themselves or using other inhouse resources. However a number of organisations-Care Systems, Trimicro, Australian Nursing Home Accounting-were mentioned a number of times. This list has been passed to the consultants to assist in contacts. Homes without computer Homes without a computer were asked whether they had plans to buy one, and whether if the Department offered the facility of electronic data interchange, they would buy one. Of the 93 respondents who did not have a computer, 32% indicated that they planned to buy one (and inspired by the survey, a handful of nursing homes telephoned to ask for advice on doing so!). Twenty nine percent indicated that they would buy if they could engage in electronic claims transfer. Further analysis is required to see to what extent these groups overlap. (2) The Government is not considering online reporting facilities, but is exploring an option of allowing nursing homes to transmit claims information electronically. The Department wrote to peak nursing home industry groups in August 1994 and received nominations for an Industry Liaison Committee on Electronic Commerce. This Committee has met five times to discuss the setting up of a pilot project to facilitate electronic commerce between the Department and nursing homes. The pilot will evaluate the feasibility of transmitting nursing home benefits claims information electronically from the nursing home or management company directly to the Department. (3) Depending on the outcome of the pilot, electronic transmission of claims information and other data will be an alternative available to all nursing home proprietors who wish to participate in the arrangements. Submission of paper claims and applications will be retained as an alternative for all those nursing homes who do not wish to embrace electronic commerce, or who think that electronic commerce is not an economic alternative. At this stage several service providers are indicating strong interest in electronic transmission. This is not, however, seen by the Government as an alternative to continuing to streamline and improve administrative practices which has been a focus of activity for some time, at least since my acceptance of the report of the Nursing Home Consultative Committee, chaired by Sir William Keys. Dental Health Standards: Nursing and Aged Care Homes (Question No. 2621) Dr Wooldridge asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 20 September 1995: (1) Do the outcome standards for nursing homes and aged care hospitals cover the good dental health of residents; if so, (a) what are the terms of the standards, (b) how many breaches of the standards were recorded in 1993-94 and (c) what are the details of the breaches. (2) To what extent is dental care, including the provision and maintenance of denture and preventive dental services, covered by (a) the Care Aggregated Module (CAM) component of Commonwealth grants to nursing homes and (b) personal care subsidies to aged care hostels. (3) If access to comprehensive dental care is not allowed under CAM or personal care subsidies, how are nursing homes and aged care hostels compensated for care-related costs incurred in providing or arranging dental services for their residents.",144
273,Dr LAWRENCE,Unknown,"-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Outcome standards for nursing homes and aged care hostels do cover, on an ongoing basis, the good dental health of residents. (a) Nursing home standard 1.8, ""Oral and Dental Care"" states that a nursing home must enable and assist residents to maintain their oral and dental health. Hostel standards require residents care needs to be identified on entry, and that staff monitor these needs and provide assistance and support as required. (b) Details of specific breaches of standards concerning oral health care are not recorded for nursing homes or hostels. (c) However, the national compliance with standard 1.8 for nursing homes receiving a standards monitoring assessment during the five years up to 1993-94 is as follows: 1989/90-76%; 1990/91-83%; 1991192-89%; 1992/93-94%; 1993/94-96% This table demonstrates the continuous improvement achieved by nursing and personal care staff in meeting oral health care standards since the inception of the Outcome Standards Program. (2)(a) The provision of nursing and personal care within a nursing home includes assistance with oral hygiene, cleaning of dentures and identification of residents oral care needs. Nursing and personal care to residents also includes: assistance to carry out tasks which residents are unable to perfonn adequately themselves, and assistance to residents to access treatment or maintenance programs determined or carried out by health care professionals. The Care Aggregated Module (CAM) component of funding to nursing homes covers the provision of all nursing and personal care tasks including oral care. It also includes training for nursing and personal care staff in oral health care by health care professionals (including dentists, dental therapists or other members of the dental profession). (b) The Schedule of Accommodation and Personal Care Services for hostels, approved by the Minister in April 1992, under Section lOA of the Aged and Disabled Persons Care Act 1954 requires a hostel to provide: ""Personal assistance, including individual attention, individual supervision and physical assistance with bathing, showering or personal hygiene activities"". In practice this requires hostel staff to provide assistance with personal hygiene, including with non-professional oral hygiene (assistance with teeth brushing, cleaning of dentures, etc.) for residents who need it because of a physical disability, and assistance with access to dental health professionals by arranging appointments and transport if required. (3) Access to dental care is allowed under CAM funding, as well as training for nursing and personal care staff who monitor the special needs of all residents on an ongoing basis. The CAM funding component is available to nursing homes for nursing and personal care and related tasks but is not provided for individual treatment or maintenance work carried out by health care professionals. In hostels, any costs incurred in the provision of non-professional oral hygiene or assisting a resident to access a dental health professional would be met from within the hostel's operating income which consists of a Commonwealth subsidy, weekly fees and entry contribution payments. Attention Deficit Disorder (Question No. 2666) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 27 September 1995: (1) Is she able to say how many Australian (a) children and (b) adults receive medication for attention deficit disorder (ADD), including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. (2) Which drugs are used to treat ADD. (3) Is it a fact that some children respond significantly only to Dexamphetarnine and others to Ritalin. (4) Which drugs referred to in part (2) are (a) listed and (b) not listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). (5) Does the listing of some drugs to treat ADD but not others discriminate between users. (6) Did the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee recommend listing of Ritalin on the PBS in August 1994. (7) Have negotiations with the manufacturer or supplier of Ritalin broken down; if so, (a) what are the details and (b) has Ciba-Geigy attempted to resolve the matter by suggesting that Ritalin be listed on the PBS as a second line drug to be subsidised only where it has been detennined that Dexamphetarnine will not work. (8) Is it a fact that many families with children suffering from ADD, including those in difficult financial situations, are paying $70-$80 every three weeks for Ritalin. (9) When will the matter referred to in part (7) be resolved.",146
274,Dr LAWRENCE,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. These details are not available to my Department as it only has access to information regarding the usage of medicines listed on the PBS. Ritalin has not yet been listed. (2) The two stimulant medications used to treat ADD are dexamphetarnine sulfate and methylphenidate hydrochloride (Ritalin). (Other drugs such as antidepressants may also be used.) (3) Yes. The clinical trial evidence presented to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (two trials with small numbers) indicates that most children will respond to both drugs, to benefit from both and some who do not respond to methylphenidate will respond to dexamphetamine and vice versa. (4)(a) dexamphetamine sulfate (b) methylphenidate hydrochloride. (5) One drug is listed under the PBS and the other is not. Listing is dependent on both acceptable effectiveness and value for money being proven for all drugs. (6) Yes. The PBAC recommended PBS listing of methylphenidate hydrochloride tablet 10 mg for use in attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, in accordance with Statefferritory law. However, the recommendation was accompanied by the advice that, based on the clinical evidence available, methylphenidate hydrochloride 10 mg was of similar safety and efficacy to dexamphetamine sulfate 5 mg (and therefore should be listed at a similar price). (7) The sponsor of Ritalin in Australia, CibaGeigy, has not, to date, been prepared to accept the price recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits a few will fail Pricing Authority; (a) based on the advice of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority recommended a price the same as that for dexamphetamine sulfate; (b) the sponsor of Ritalin has proposed that the drug be listed as second line therapy i.e. to be used after dexamphetamine has been tried and not found satisfactory, but the company has not provided data to support this proposal or the price it is requesting. (8) The Pharmacy Guild of Australia price list indicates dispensed prices for 100 Ritalin 10 mg tablets from $55.83 to $68.16. At a dosage of two tablets daily (the dosage range given in the Ritalin product information is 5 mg to 60 mg daily) 100 tablets would last 50 days. (9) I am unable to predict this as it relies on the provision of further clinical evidence from the product's sponsor or acceptance by the sponsor of the price recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority.",147
