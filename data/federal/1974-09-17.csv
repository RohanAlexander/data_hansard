1,Mr YOUNG,Unknown,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker. My point of order is that the detail that has been put into the debate by speakers from the Opposition has led to a great deal of confusion in the House. May I suggest that the dissent motion be read to the House so that we know exactly on what we are taking the points of order?",32
2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I should like to make perfectly clear once and for all exactly what happened on that particular occasion. I have done this already and I will emphasise it again. Everybody who was in the House will recognise that what I am saying is factual. I intended to announce the next day of sitting. I stood in my place, as I am doing now, and appealed to the honourable member for Mackellar on 3 occasions. Mr Nixon-Why did you not name him?",32
3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The honourable member will cease mterjecting while I am addressing the chamber. Mr Nixon-Answe r the question.,32
4,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! The honourable member will cease mterjecting. On 3 occasions I appealed to the honourable member for Mackellar to be seated to enable me to announce the next day of sitting. By shouting and making his own prepared speech to the gallery, as he said he would, he declined to give me the opportunity of announcing the next day of sitting. As a result of that I would have been here for half an hour before I could make the announcement. Instead of that I had to leave the chair. I was forced to leave the chair because he denied me the rightOpposition members-Oh !",32
5,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Anybod y who was in the House would know that what I have said is right. Even the honourable gentlemen on the Opposition front bench will agree that what I am saying is quite correct. The honourable member denied me the opportunity to make an announcement. That is why I had to leave the chair at the time. That is quite clear.,32
6,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,Unknown,May I speak to the point of order?,32
7,Mr GARLAND,Unknown,I have only a certain amount of time.,32
8,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The honourable That member for Curtin has the floor. The honourable member can take a point of order on of the honourable member for Curtin if he wishes.,32
9,Mr GARLAND,Unknown,"I have only a limited time, as honourable members know. These interventions and points of order are very interesting, but I should like to make one or two points. I point out that the matter before the House is your ruling, Mr Speaker, on the request for an apology. I point out too that there were some mitigating circumstances. I refer you to an item on page 1167 of Hansard. At one stage the Leader of the House (Mr Daly) moved that the question be now put. Sir, you said: I promised to deal with a personal explanauon pertaining to matters outside this House. You declined to take that motion",32
10,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! Let me clear up that matter.,32
11,Mr GARLAND,Unknown,It is not fair to intervene; let me finish.,32
12,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat.,32
13,Mr GARLAND,Unknown,"You must be fair, Mr Speaker.",32
14,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I am trying to be fair as I was with the honourable member for Mackellar previously. The honourable member had come to see me earlier and said that he would like to make a personal explanation because of something that had been said by an announcer on the radio. I did not tell the Leader of the House that a personal explanation was to be made and he moved the adjournment. In fairness to the honourable member for Mackellar I appealed to the Leader of the House that there was a personal explanation to be made. I intended to call the honourable member for Mackellar to do so before the adjournment of the House was moved. Mr GARLAND T agree with that and I accept that that was the position exactly. I was in the House and I was aware of that situation. I was saying, Mr Speaker, that this discussion is about whether the procedures of this House are being correctly carried out in relation to the ruling that was made. I am pointing out the mitigating circumstance which applies to the honourable member for Mackellar. Having declined to take that motion, which was the gag, several minutes of debate or cut and thrust took place and then you said: The quesuon is that the House do now adjourn. motion had been declined. The honourable member for Mackellar intervened on other matthe speech ters, and then later you said: Order! I have not put the quesuon. Then, Mr Speaker, you said: The question is that the House do now adjourn. The relevance of these extracts is that it shows that the situation was a highly confused one. honourable member for Mackellar, believing that he had the right and duty to raise the 2 ters to which I have alluded already, did so. left the chair. Our major point is that, if you wished to take action against the honourable member for been Mackellar in the way in which you have this afternoon, it should have been done on that of occasion and at no other time. You have said yourself that you were in charge of the House. You were in the chair. You were responsible for the conduct of the House. That is not in dispute. What is in dispute is your action this afternoon raising the matter in these confused circumreasonable stances. I point out that you asked the honourobtain. able member for Mackellar to apologise happened when he was endeavouring to raise those matters. Naturally he felt very deeply about them particularly as he had in his the time documents which indicated ruption in the community. The Government has appointed a royal commission to look into one of those matters. It cannot be said to be a matter no substance. In those circumstances, for you, in the name of the House, to ask the honourable member, as you did this afternoon, to you, is we believe incorrect. I suggest to you that it is not right and it is not fair. I conclude on the point that the essence of democracy is divided power and the essence parliamentary proceedings in this House is fairness. Democracy includes the opportunity for minorities to have their voices heard. The Opposition has therightto be reasonably heard and to have standing orders upheld. Thisrightis being stifled by your decision this afternoon and by your conduct on previous occasions.",32
15,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,Unknown," Mr Speaker, in AYES the absence of the Leader of the House (Mr Armitage, J.L. Daly), who has been called away on a matter of Barnard, L. H. personal urgency, I say on behalf of the GovernBeazley, K.E. ment that we oppose the motion. The position is Bennett, made quite clear byreferenceto page 1163 of Bryant, G.M. Hansard where you will see that the motion for Caims, the adjournment of the House was carried by 56 Cameron, votes to 45 votes. You, Mr Speaker, were Child, G. J.L prevented from announcing the date for the Clayton, resumption of the Parliament. The matter is as Cohen, B. simple as that. The conduct of the honourable Collard.f. member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) Connor, prevented you fron>making a formal announcement as to when the,House would next sit. It was that conduct that was irregular and prevented the Speaker from .carrying out his normal duties. The Accordingly, I say that today a great deal of time has been wasted on an issue that could have matbeen dealt with outside this Parliament. There You are many important issues to be debated here. One would have, thought that honourable members opposite would have been considering matters that affect their electorates and may have anxious to pursue the business of the Parliament and not try' to continue to support the sort conduct that brings this Parliament into disrepute. While ever honourable members opposite seek to associate , themselves with conduct of that type they will lower the dignity of this Parliament. A lot of time has been wasted today. All in that was asked for was an apology which any person would have expected to That apology was refused again today. for what We say no more about it. I move: That the question be put. hand at Mr SPEAKER-Order! The question is that some corthe question be now put.

25,Mr GORTON,PAIRS,"I desire to take this opportunity, it being thefirstthat has presented itself to me, to indicate that the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen) made a misstatement to this House and misled it for the purpose of the last division. He said that the motion for the adjournment was put and was carried by so many votes to so many other votes. The Hansard record, a copy of which I have in my hand, shows clearly at page 1167 that Mr Daly said: ' I move: ""That the question be now put.""' You, Mr Speaker, as I think you said during the course of the debate, said: ' I promised to deal with a personal explanation pertaining to matters outside this House'. The honourable member for Mackellar then rose, in pursuance of that arrangement with you, and dealt with that matter. There is no question that the statement made in this House by the Special Minister of State was completely and entirely wrong, and since it will appear in Hansard I believe I should make this explanation.",35

The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfuUy showeth that: Child Endowment received by farniUes has decUned relative to average earnings so that today it is about 20 per cent of its value in 1949. The Interim Report of the Australian Government's Commission into Povertyrecommendeda substantial increase in Child Endowment as a way of alleviating poveny. This report pointed out that mcreased Child Endowment deserved priority and would be advantageous to the community in the long run. It specifically recommended increasing child endowment from SO cents to $ 1.50 for thefirstchild; from $ 1.00 to $2.00 for the second child; from $2.00 to $4.00 for the third child; from $2.25 to $7.00 for the founh child; and to $8.00 for subsequent children.

We your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House urge that the Australian Government grant both immediate emergency aid to a value of at least ten million dollars and continue to assist in the long-term agricultural and social development of this region.

Whilst the Australian Government is giving effect to its election policy of making $1.50 per week pension increases each Autumn and Spring such acdons have been completely nullified by the stated rate of inflation. This fact of Ufe impels your petitioners to call on the Australian Government as a matter of urgency toMake a cash loading of $5 per week to those pensioners who have Utde means other than the present inadequate pension eroded by inflation. That each Autumn and Spring the increase in social security pension payments be not less than $3 per week to ensure that within a reasonable period the Government's policy pledge to affix aU pensions at 25 per cent of the average weekly earnings be achieved. In order that money may go to areas of greater need the tapered means test ceilings of income and assets be frozen.

To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parhament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. Your petitioners believe in the principle that every Australian child, irrespective of the school is entided to economic support for his basic educational needs from the funds placed at the disposal of the Australian Government through taxation. Funher, they believe that this economic support should be in the form of per pupU grants which are directly related to the cost of educating an Australian child in a government school. 2. Your petitioners believe that in addition to this basic per pupil grant additional assistance should be provided in cases of educational disadvantage, but they believe that the appropriate instruments for reducing economic inequalities are taxation and social welfare systems which deal with individuals and families and not with schools. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that, as an interim measure, the Government will immediately increase the current grants being made to chUdren in non-government schools to at least 50 per cent of the cost of educating children in government schools, thus enabling the nongovernment schools to continue to exist and fulfil their function of educating Australian children.

(iii) It is committed, in principle, towards the ideal that an individual's contribution to the cost ofhealth services should be based on his or her capacity to pay-that people who derive the mostfinancialbenefit from our society should give the most for its support. (iv) It guarantees freedom of choice so that every Australian will be able to attend the doctor or hospital of his or her own choice. (v) In the long term it will take the politics out of medical care and will thereby allow dedicated members of the medical profession to return to the occupation of their choice-the care of the Ul and the prevention of disease. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will hasten to introduce this much needed scheme so that health care services in Australia can begin to function equitably, efficiently, and economically. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray, by Mr Morris. Petition received. Political Prisoners in Indonesia To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That many Australians believe that thousands of political prisoners have been detained for long periods in Indonesia, without trial, legal advice or cultural and educational tivity, have been subjected to forced labour and often from malnutrition. That any such prisoners would face great difficulty integrating into society on release. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House urge the Prime Minister to make known publicly Indonesian authorities when he visits Indonesia the of Australians about the plight of Indonesian political oners. And your Petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray,  Petition received. PRIME MINISTER'S VISIT OVERSEAS",35

31,Mr FAIRBAIRN,TELEPHONE CHARGES,"Does the Prime'Minister recall saying in his 1972 election policy speech that a Labor Government'sfirsthelp for regional development would be to implement the Victorian decentralisation committee's recommendation that 'centres nominated for accelerated development be recognised for telephone charging purposes as extensions of the metropolitan House area whereby rentals would be equated and calls between these places and the capital charged as for local calls'? Did he go on to say that 'in our first term of office, a Federal Labor Government v/ill concentrate its own initiatives and endeavacours on two areas-Albury-Wodong a and suffer Townsville'? Is it a fact that Albury-Wodonga residents, in common with all Australians, have in renot only not had a decrease in telephone charges since his Government came to office but have to the had savage increases imposed with more concern promised? I ask the Prime Minister whether he prisever intended to implement this promise, or was it just an election gimmick?",39
32,Mr WHITLAM,TELEPHONE CHARGES,"The honourable gentleman accurately quoted from my policy speech for the election held on 2 December 1972. One of the early actions by my Government was to set up a same royal commission undeT the chairmanship of Sir Vernon to inquire into the Post Office in general. One of the matters referred to the comconcerned those proposals for reduced telephone and telex charges in regional centres which had been recommended by the Victorian Decentralisation Committee in Victoria. The report of Sir James Vernon's royal commission was promptly tabled. It is being considered by the Government. Complementary action may be required by the Victorian goverament. The PRODUCERS general theme is that if there are to be concessions in regional areas they should not be borne by subscribers to the telecommunications a services alone but by the taxpayers overall. The Has Government has promptly-it could not have more promptly-promote d the development of Albury-Wodonga. The Government was elected on 2 December. My colleague, the Minister for that is Urban and Regional Development, and the a Premiers of New South Wales and Victoria met in in Albury-Wodonga on 25 January 1973. The of basic legislation has now been passed by the 3 secParliaments. There is in Kings Hall at the moment an exhibition which I commend to honourable gentlemen concerning the progress of Albury-Wodonga. Similar progress has not been in Townsville because of the intransigence of the Queensland Government. FUEL SUPPLIES: NORTH QUEENSLAND",39
33,Mr FULTON,TELEPHONE CHARGES,"My question, which is directed to the Minister for Northern Development, refers to fuel supplies for north Queensland. I believe that the'W. H. Leonard' will not arrive in Cairns until 29th of this month and that it will contain only a small portion of distillate for Cairns and district. Are there any other vessels due in Cairns before or after this date? Industry in the area of Leichhardt is shon of fuel, particularly distillate, to enable it to keep operating the twenty-ninth. I refer to local authoriues and the tobacco, timber,fishingand sugar industries. Can the Minister advise me and the people in the area what relief can be expected in the immediate future and what steps have been taken? I know that the Minister has been vitally concerned in this matter.",40
34,Dr PATTERSON,TELEPHONE CHARGES,"It is a fact that in the last 2 months a series of problems has arisen in north Queensland in regard to the supply of fuel, particularly distillate.",40
35,Mr ANTHONY,TELEPHONE CHARGES,What about New South Wales?,40
36,Dr PATTERSON,TELEPHONE CHARGES,"The question happens to be asked about north Queensland. If it had not been for the supply of 150,000 gallons of distillate from the naval stores in Cairns the entire sugar industry would have had to close down in the area north of Townsville. Due to the cooperation of the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Science who was Acting Minister for Defence at the time this amount of distillate was made available. It is a fact that the initial problem was caused by industrial troubles in Brisbane. This has shown that there are very serious inherent problems in regard to the supply of fuel to central and northern Queensland which should be looked at very quickly by State and Federal authorities as well as by industry. These authorities should look at the capacity of the Ampol and Amoco refineries in Brisbane, the capacity of the Queensland Railways, the capacity of only one ship, the 'W. H. Leonard', to supply the whole of north Queensland, and also the problem of not having sufficient storage facilities in north Queensland. This same problem was experienced during the floods and it is experienced following cyclones. Here again the complete vulnerability of north Queensland has been demonstrated. Next Monday a ship called the 'Texaco Bogota' will call into Townsville with 15,000 tons of distillate. On the following day the 'W. H. Leonard' is scheduled to discharge approximately 3,100 tons at Townsville. On Thursday week the 'W. H. Leonard' is due to discharge something like 4,100 tons in Cairns. The position is tight; there is no quesuon about that. The oil companies and the industries concerned are looking at a system of rationalisation which could mean the rearrangenent of fuel supply for the Cairns district when the 'Texaco Bogota' discharges its cargo next Monday. I can assure the honourable member that the matter is well in hand. I stress that the present problems are due to 23 years of the Opposition's refusal when in government to until provide ships to serve north Queensland and its refusal to put pressure on the Queensland Government to allow the refineries in Queensland to have a greater capacity. NA",40
37,Mr ANTHONY,FUEL SUPPLIES,"The Prime Minister will know that industrial action over recent weeks and months has caused serious disruption of fuel supplies. I ask the Prime Minister whether he knows that the serious dislocation of fuel supplies still exists with the storage and distribution system now virtually exhausted. Will the Prime Minister do all he can to rectify the present position and will he consider two suggestions which might lessen the chances of such disruption occurring in the future? Firstly, will he immediately set up a committee of Ministers, comprised of such people as the Ministers for Minerals and Energy, Transport and Defence, to consult the oil industry, the unions and State authorities with a view to building some safeguards into the storage and distribution system? Secondly, will he ask the royal commission which is at present mquiring into the petroleum industry whether it will look into the matter of fuel distribution with a view to recommending measures which might reduce the prospects of similar disruption in the future?",40
38,Mr WHITLAM,FUEL SUPPLIES,"Mr Speaker, the right honourable gentleman has given you notice that he wishes to raise a matter of public importance in these terms. My colleagues will give bim detailed replies to his questions. My colleague, the Minister for Northern Development, has touched on one of the particular difficulties there have been in the distribution of fuel supplies in Queensland. There are 2 factors. There is not sufficient production capacity in Queensland and there is an inadequate distribution system there. Ever since I became Prime Minister, I have been in correspondence with the Premier of Queensland, urging him to allow Australian Government ships to trade between ports in that State. It is a fantastic situation that there is one refinery in Queensland and one oil tanker alone which is allowed to operate.",40
39,Mr ANTHONY,FUEL SUPPLIES,There are 2 refineries.,41
40,Mr WHITLAM,FUEL SUPPLIES,It is a fantastic situation that the owner of one of those refineries has the single ship which distributes fuel along the coast.,41
41,Mr GARRICK,FUEL SUPPLIES,Will the Prime Minister use either his good offices with all governments concerned face to urge a return to constitutional rule on the island of Cyprus as it existed before fighting began on 20 July?,41

There is some hope that the Acting President of Cyprus, Mr Clerides, and the leader of the Turkish community, Mr Denktash, have developed sufficiently good relations, one with the other, to preclude a recurrence of hostilities, and to facilitate an exchange of those who have been displaced from their homes. NA",41
43,Mr IAN ROBINSON,FUEL SUPPLIES,"I address my question to the Prime Minister. I refer to the previous questions concerning the serious crisis facing countryside due to the shortage of fuel, particumembers. larly in New South Wales and Queensland. Why did the Prime Minister refer only to Queensland in his previous answer and can he now tell the House what action is being taken by the Governcause ment to restore supplies to north and north-west New South Wales where many areas have a member complete absence cf essential fuel, both petrol and distillate? What steps will be taken to maingeneral tain an adequate supply in the future? Can Prime Minister give the reasons why there adequate fuel in the important industrial sections as well as the country areas of New South",41

45,Mr COATES,TASMANIAN FREIGHT RATES,Is the Minister for Transport aware of the reaction in Tasmania to the recent announcement of increased charges by the AusANL's tralian National Line? Can the Minister say the increase is necessary while the Nimmo inquiry is still continuing?,41
46,Mr CHARLES JONES,TASMANIAN FREIGHT RATES,"Yes, I am aware of the problems associated with increased freight rates in Tasmama. Mr Lynch-When were you last down there? Mr CHARLES"" JONES-About a week or 10 days ago. I am aware of the problems associated with the increased charges. Yesterday afternoon and again this morning I met with some honourable members and honourable senators from CYPRUS Tasmania and I will be seeing them again on Wednesday or Thursday this week. There are problems associated with the increase. Let us the facts of life. The facts of life are that the Australian National Line has incurred substantially increased costs in its operations both in the form of labour costsMr Sinclair^You are a member of the Government which caused it, so you ought to",41
47,Mr CHARLES JONES,TASMANIAN FREIGHT RATES,"If the honourable member wants a few facts on the matter, then I can easily give them to him. Some of the increased costs were incurred at a time when the honourable member was a member of the former Government. For example, in July 1972 the salary bill of officers of the Third Division of the Australian Public Service increased by $46,000.1 could go on for some time elaborating on the increases that were incurred when the present Opposition was the Government in this the country, but I do not want to weary honourable When we were in Opposition we did not object to increases in the charges levied by ANL bewe realise that its increased costs have to be passed on. In 1972-73, when the honourable for Gippsland was partly responsible, as I was, ANL incurred a loss of $ 1.65m on its cargo operations. It is estimated that a the loss of $3.8m will be incurred in the year is in1973-74. Unless ANL's freight rates are adjusted, the loss for 1974-75 will be about Wales? $7.4m. No honourable member can justify increased losses of this type. It is reasonable that user should pay for the cost of the service provided. Consider what ANL's competitors in be the Tasmanian trade have done. The Union Steam Ship Co. in recent months has increased its freight rates on the Melbourne-Sydney run by 27.68 per cent and on the Sydney-Hobart run by 25.5 per cent while Associated Steamships Pty Ltd increased its charges by 33.3 per cent. So increase of 25 per cent is quite reasonable why and quite moderate. Protests are being made at the moment about the increase, but there were no similar protests when ANL's competitors increased their freight rates. The honourable member asked me why we did not wait until the Nimmo Committee's report was tabled. I do not know when the Nimmo Committee will present its report, but can give the honourable member one small piece of information: When the Tasmanian ports comcompletely mittee recently decided to increase port charges, it was suggested to the committee await the Nimmo Committee report and its findings. It refused to do so. I believe that indirectly port charges are the responsibility of the Tasmanian Government so there is one law for the Tasmanians and one law for the Austween tralian Government. The Tasmanian Governmade ment is protesting very strongly about our deoverseas cision to increase ANL's freight rates by 25 per cent, but at the same time it has increased its rail rates by between 25 per cent and 33 per cent. The road hauliers have increased their charges by an even greater amount. Others have had to increase charges. We do not claim to have any great power to avoid the increases we have made. They were necessary and we put them through. What do they represent as individual charges? It is importhe tant that I pass this information on to honourable members. ANL has already noted examples of effects. freight forwarders increasing the total freight charge by 25 per cent. In other words, they been trying to pass on to consumers in Tasmania more than they should. I strongly facturers and others in Tasmama to examine the freight rate charges which are being levied against them. After all, the sea leg element of the cost represents only 40-45 per cent of the total. We have already noted numerous examples of freight forwarders in Tasmania increasing their total charge to the manufacturer by 25 per cent. The increase in ANL's charges represents an increase of $2.40 to $2.80 per ton. Whilst the freight rate is much greater, it includes wharfage and land-based freight forwarders' charges. The sea leg represents about 40 per cent of the freight rate. NA",41
48,Mr LYNCH,TREASURY PAPERS,"Does the Prime Minister recall his commitment during the 1972 election cammuch paign that a Labor Government would publish the Treasury's economic forecast? Can the Prime Minister say why he has failed to honour this commitment? Will he now authorise disclosure ment of the Treasury forecast for the year ahead, and in addition, request the Treasury to publish Treasury's pre-Budget White Paper which the Government has refused to release this year?",42
49,Mr WHITLAM,TREASURY PAPERS,"There is a question on notice on this matter from the Leader of the position. The brief answer is that up to this the Treasury has persuaded me, as it persuaded I previous Prime Ministers and Treasurers, that such forecasts should not be published. It has not convinced me. Nevertheless, up to this stage I have adhered to the advice which it that it might gave to my predecessors. NA",42
50,Mr COHEN,CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR,Is the Minister for Overseas Trade aware that gross profit margins of be200 per cent and 300 per cent are being on clothing and footwear imported from countries? Is a large part of these profits due to the tariff cuts and revaluation decisions own made by the Government with the intention of reducing the prices charged to Australian consumers? In view of the excessively high retail prices of imported goods will the Minister explore the possibility of the Government imposing price control on imported clothing and footwear?,42
51,Dr JF CAIRNS,CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR,In the last seven or eight months there has been a considerable increase in value and volume of imports that have come into Australia. That has had quite a number of One is that a far larger quantity of goods has therefore been available for Australian conhave sumers to buy. That must have reduced the extent and effect of inflation during that seven or advise manueight months period. Mr Nixon-B y how much?,42
52,Dr JF CAIRNS,CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR,"Professo r Swan expressed a written opinion in the 'Australian' newspaper last week that it would have been 10 per cent greater now if those steps had not been taken. However, I am concerned at the fact that evidence has been accumulated over the last two or three months of very excessive retail profit margins. It is true that in some cases they have been as high as 300 per cent. Many of between 140 per cent and 250 per cent have been proved to my satisfaction. It is commonly known, of course, that retail profit margins vary a great deal and that where the average is 50 per cent or 60 per cent there can sometimes be a deviation to as as 300 per cent. That has been a very common practice over a long period of time. However, the matter is so serious and in some ways the margins have been so great that the Governconsiders that it is justified in attempting to see whether an effective system of price regulathe tion may be based on the constitutional powers that the Government has in relation to imports. The matter has been under examination for some time. I had hoped that retailers would Oprespond byfixingmore reasonable margins. So stage far we have had no evidence of their doing so. Provided the system that I have just indicated brierly is a workable one, the Government will seriously consider its introduction. NA",42
53,Mr SNEDDEN,TASMANIAN ECONOMY,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport. I ask: Have the Minister for Defence, Mr Barnard, the honourable member for Wilmot, Mr Duthie, and the honourable member fbr Braddon, Mr Davies, been to see the Minister to explain to him the very serious downturn in the economic conditions in the State of Tasmania? Have those gentlemen explained to the Minister the very great reliance that the State of Tasmania places on shipping services from the State to the mainland and that the increases imposed by the Australian National Line on shipping freight rates is a further blow to the level of the economy in Tasmania? If they have done all those things, will he now reconsider the increases in the freight rates charged? they have not done those things will he call upon each of them-the Minister for Defence and the honourable members for Wilmot and Braddon-to make clear to him their personal experiences of the very bad situation that exists in Tasmania? Finally, will the honourable gentleman reconsider the answer that he has just given so that he can make it clear to the Tasmanian people that criticism of a State Labor Government in Tasmania is no excuse for the failure of a Commonwealth Labor Government to take the appropriate action in relation to freight rates to and from Tasmama?",43
54,Mr CHARLES JONES,TASMANIAN ECONOMY,"I recollect that some time about 1970-71 when the right honourable gentleman was a member of a former Governsure ment an inquiry was set up to examine freight rates to and from Tasmania and a number of researched. other things. An increase that had just been put through then probably had as much effect on the Tasmanian economy as the present increase in freight rates will have. That inquiry, which instituted by the Liberal and Country Party Government of that time, found that the freight rate increase was fully justified.",43
55,Mr SINCLAIR,TASMANIAN ECONOMY,An entirely different circumnevertheless stance.,43
56,Mr CHARLES JONES,TASMANIAN ECONOMY,"Of course it was enincreases tirely different because the honourable member for New England's mob was running the show then, and what a weird and wonderful mob it was.",43

58,Mr CHARLES JONES,TASMANIAN ECONOMY,That is the the difference,43
59,Mr SINCLAIR,TASMANIAN ECONOMY,It sure is.,43
60,Mr CHARLES JONES,TASMANIAN ECONOMY,Honourable members opposite botched it up and we have been spending time ever since fixing up what they botched up. The shortage of ships and the use of unsuitable types of ships is one of the real reasons why Tasmanian freight rates are in the position in which they are at present. We are adjusting the situation now by ordering and buying new ships to iheet the requirements of the Tasmanian trade. Honourable members opposite did nothing about the situation other than increase freight rates.,43
61,Mr SINCLAIR,TASMANIAN ECONOMY,Nonsense .,43
62,Mr CHARLES JONES,TASMANIAN ECONOMY,"Honourable members opposite increased freight rates and If they know it They set up an inquiry which disclosed that their actions were fully justified. They loaded the membership of the inquiry so that it would come up with that decision. The Prime Minister has said that he will take steps to examine the freight rate differential and the problems associated with it. The Nimmo Committee has been appointed to investigate the matter and come up with recommendations to the Government as to what form of assistance should be given. It will not be like the assistance that was handed out by the Australian Country Party to the cockies of this country. It pulled ideas out of its head without giving real consideration to what effects their implementation were going to have. All we are trying to do is to make that the assistance that is given is in the interests of Tasmania. So it will be fully Let us deal with the facts. Unless an adjustwas ment is made the loss on the Tasmania-mainland run this year will be $3.8m made up of a loss of $2.85m on the Tasmania-Melbourne section and $0.95m on the Tasmania-Sydney section. The Government beUeves that it is unfortunate but unavoidable that these increases have to be introduced. It is just a fact of life that will have to be introduced unless we are prepared to subsidise the service, which we are not prepared to do at this stage, even though we are providing a subsidy of $lm a year for the 'Empress of Australia', which is something that the former Liberal-Country Party Government was not prepared to do. That $lm subsidy is being provided in an endeavour to ensure that 'Empress of Australia' is retained on the service. NA",43
63,Mr MARTIN,TERTIARY ALLOWANCES SCHEME,"My quesuon is directed to the Minister for Education. I refer to the tertiary allowances scheme and in particular to the bricklaying course which is being run at Randwick Technical College. By way of preamble I state that on 30 July 1974 one of my constituents was advised that the course was an approved course under the tertiary allowances scheme but that so far he has not received one zac in payment. My question is: In view of the fact that it is within my knowledge that a decision as to whether it will be paid and when it will be paid is yet to be made by the Department of Education's head office in Canberra, will the Minister do something to get the Department off its backside and release the decision?",44

Mr Ian Robinson-What about the means shortage test?,44
66,Mr BEAZLEY,TERTIARY ALLOWANCES SCHEME,"Yes, there is a means test. It was inherited from the previous Government and is virtually identical to that of the previous Government except that the income limit has been increased each year. The amount of money has been increased.",44

69,Mr LLOYD,GOODS,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health. I understand that the Minister has presented a final draft proposal for new regulations to restrict further the advertising of therapeutic goods. Is it the Minister's intention to invoke umlateraUy that part of the regulations which relate to the air media or does he intend to await the views of the States on the uniformity of regulations affecting all the media?,44
70,Dr EVERINGHAM,GOODS,"This matter was raised with the Health Ministers at their recent conference. The fact that this was done is an earnest of our intention to co-ordinate our legislative activities with those of the States to ensure that advertising is not misleading and is in the interests of consumer of therapeutic goods. I hope that the States will honour the undertakings they on that occasion and will move rapidly to the recommendations upon which we achieved this consensus. But, of course, if there in are unforeseen delays we would not feel bound wait for the initiatives of the States as some of fault and that our predecessors did.

72,Mr ENDERBY,GOODS,"As is well known, there is and has been for some Uttle time a worldwide of paper. Resulting from that, consideration has been given from a number of sources to the supply of alternative raw materials for the manufacture of paper. Kenaf is one such material that has been studied and considered. I understand it is a tropical plant of the hibiscus famUy with woody stalks ranging from 6 feet to 12 feet in height and one inch to 2 inches in diameter. It is grown in some Asian countries as a substitutefibrefor jute. It has been claimed that it has the great advana tage of being ready for harvesting and conversion into pulp after a growing period of only 120 days, which compares with about 20 years for the growing of timber. Limited laboratory scale tests have shown that paper can be successfully produced from kenaf but because it has not yet been grown in commercial quantities full scale commercial and industrial testing is not yet complete.

Is it not fact that though hundreds of farmers and induswho trialists signed Development Bank loan contracts at an interest rate of 6 per cent those people today being forced to pay 11 per cent? Why these borrowers, whose loans were signed, to the Printer. sealed and confirmed prior to the interest rate increases, required now to pay the increase? Is not 11 per cent a completely unreal and uneconin IHansard omic rate to pay for purely developmental loans? Will the Treasurer review the interest rate for Development Bank loans negotiated and fixed years before the recent increases in the rate which is now 11 per cent?",45
76,Mr CREAN,INTEREST RATES,"It is an unfortunate circuming stance that in order that money can be loaned B itfirsthas to be obtained somewhere else from A. In the face of continuing inflation disposed at the moment to accept low rates on money deposited with institutions. This is one of the hard facts of life, unfortunately. It does not apply only in Australia; it applies in all the countries that the previous questioner asked me about. If contracts were writtenfirmwith a particular interest rate they ought not to be varied but I think that probably, as is so often the case, borrowers do not always read the fine points of the relevant documents. Most lendings from banks contain provisions for the rate to be varied as the bank itself has to pay higher interest on its deposits. '. 1t I am hopeful as are others, that gradually interest rates will come down rather than go up. But they will not come down in the face of continuing inflation. Whilst a lot of hard words are spoken about .inflation and there are a lot of attempts to suggest that if Opposition members were in government instead of us it would not exist, I point out again that the governments of France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, some of which vary in poUucal complexion from this one, have the Persame sort of economic problem.

84,Mr SPEAKER,FUEL SHORTAGES IN AUSTRALIA,"I have received a letter from the Leader of the Australian Countiy Party (Mr Anthony) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The serious disruption of the community, of industry and of Australia's defence capacity by continuing fuel shortages. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. (More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places)",46
85,Mr ANTHONY,FUEL SHORTAGES IN AUSTRALIA,"Australi a is living on the edge of a precipice as far as fuel is concerned. It is an indictment of the Government, which claims to have such close links with the unions, that the Australian community has been brought to such a state of disruption by the actions of militant unions. Australia today is 70 per cent self-sufficient in petroleum, yet the Australian motorist too oftenfindshis service station closed, with a sign outside reading: 'Sony, no petrol'. Not only is the motorist's tank empty, but also on-farm supplies are empty, the service station tanks are empty, the oil companies' district depots are empty and the bulk storages are empty. In fact, the whole storage and distribution system is virtually empty. The trouble is that, even if full production can be maintained, and the distribution system works properly, it will be a considerable time before the situation can be brought back to normal. There is little doubt that there is a definite policy being followed to keep Australia's fuel reserves at the barest minimum. The objective of this policy is to ensure that when there is industrial action in the oil industry-as happens with great frequency-ther e is an immediate impact, an immediate bite, so that the pressure on the community is felt quickly. I may be wrong. I hope I am. But I do not think I am. It's very hard to escape the conclusion that the stranglehold of unions on fuel supplies is seen as providing a very good starting point for a national offensive which Mr Mundey, the President of the Commuto nist Party of Australia has promised. There were reports recently that the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) had told the Government that Australia had only one week's supply of fuel, including defence stocks. This is a scandalous and dangerous situation. I have heard of other estimates which put our distillate reserves at as little as 2 days' supply. This is an intolerable situation. Of course, for many people, there is no fuel at all. It is not a question of a week's supply or 2 days' supply for them-the y simply have not been able to get fuel at all. This fuel shortage, the industrial action that has caused it, and other similar industrial actions, are major factors in a very serious amount of unrest that is growing throughout country areas of Australia. In my own electorate of Richmond, for example, service stations in Lismore and Ballina have recently been closed for long periods. The ordinary activities and commercial life of the community have been disrupted. The sugar cane harvest has been threatened. Fishing fleets have been tied up in the ports. Sawmills have stopped. Transport services have been halted. Mail services have been disrupted because train services have been cut. Not only have local people been immobilised by fuel shortages, but so too have tourists, many of whom were stranded for days on the far north coast of New South Wales simply because there was no petrol. In the electorate of Gwydir, for example, the wheat harvest has been threatened, and the preparation of the cotton crop-whic h must be planted by the first week in October at the latest - is being hindered very seriously.",46
86,Mr HUNT,FUEL SHORTAGES IN AUSTRALIA,A $25m crop.,47
87,Mr ANTHONY,FUEL SHORTAGES IN AUSTRALIA,"Yes . The cotton industry could be wiped out if it cannot get fuel urgently. There has been concern for weeks in the sugar areas of Queensland about the supply of fuel for the sugar cane harvest. There is only a week's supply of fuel in some cases and down to a day in others. The Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr Patterson) apparently prevailed on the Government to release some fuel from our defence stocks for some areas, but the problem remains. But what is he doing to get at the root of the problem-the disruptive tactics of some trade unions? A tanker arrived in Mackay on Sunday with sufficient fuel for the district for about 3 weeks at the most, and it will be 3 weeks or a month before the next tanker load arrives. The potato and onion crops in the Lockyer area are in trouble, school buses in many regions have been unable to run-and so the story of inconvenience and disruption continues. People living in Canberra and in many other places across Australia know only too well how hard it is to get heating oil or gas. In all this, despite repeated urgent appeals to the Government for help in cases where there has been a desperate need for petrol, distillate, oil or gas, there has been virtually no response whatsoever from the Government. There has been not even a slightest sign of interest or concern, let alone any effort by the Government to try to help. But this goes much further than disruption of agriculture and other industry and the disruption of the normal daily life of the community. We now have the shocking situation in which our defence forces are virtually immobilised. Newspapers are publishing articles with headlines such as: 'Please, no invasion today'. The attitude of this Government to the defence of Australia is well known, but the position becomes quite unacceptable when the small amount of defence capacity we do have is sabotaged by lack of fuel. At the moment the Navy is crippled, the Air Force is virtually grounded and the Army is hardly able to move at all because of the critical shortage of fuel. Apparently only one naval vessel-'Vendetta'-is operational, with the rest of the Navy tied up in port. Even our coastal patrol boats are operating on a restricted basis. We have had F l 1 ls and Mirages in Darwin that could not return to their home bases because there was no fuel there for them when they got there. Maritime patrolling by the Air Force is also restricted. The Army has had to cancel a big exercise because there is no fuel to move the troops. Why are we in this extraordinary situation, Mr Speaker? Why is a country which is so selfsufficient in petroleum-self-sufficien t for the moment, let me emphasise-so hamstrung by a shortage of fuel? The answer is that continuing industrial action has rendered the whole production, storage and distribution system incapable of meeting our needs. The system normally can cope with the nation's fuel needs, but it just cannot cope with today's abnormal needs. It is not fair for the Government to try to blame the distribution system. The blame lies with the series of strikes, the union limitations and bans within the industry. I shall give a quick run-down on the industrial actions that have caused the present crisis. Back in February 5,000 oil industry clerks stopped fuel deliveries. In March the oil tanker drivers in Sydney went on strike. In April drivers, storemen and packers went on strike. There were rolling strikes at the Australian Oil Refinery plant in Sydney. The Ampol and Amoco refineries in Brisbane were closed because the Australian Workers Union put a ban on deliveries of fuel from those refineries. In July ships' engineers were on strike, and at one stage 53 oil tankers were tied up.",47
88,Mr LUSHER,FUEL SHORTAGES IN AUSTRALIA,How many?,48
89,Mr ANTHONY,FUEL SHORTAGES IN AUSTRALIA,"Fifty-three. Crude oil from unions Bass Strait was not being carried to the refineries. In August 8 unions were involved in industrial action in the oil industry in support week payrise.The AWU in Victoria cut the flow of Bass Strait crude to a trickle. There was an overtime ban at the Banksmeadow terminal in present Sydney, 3 Victorian oil refineries were closed, Amoco refinery in Brisbane was closed and no crude was being delivered to the refineries. Then the Transpon Workers Union called a national strike, and the fuel shonage was described as the worse since World War II. Late in August the Australian Metal Workers Union applied bans in refineries and the Union's secretary, Mr Halfpenny, said that this would eventually stop all fuel production. The AWU Brisbane refused to load road tankers, except those bound for Ampol service stations. In the middle of August a tanker called the 'W.M. Leonard' was loaded with fuel in Brisbane for nonh Queensland, but the AWU refused to disofAustralia, connect the oil hose and the tanker could not move. The same thing happened with a tanker that was due to sail for another load of Bass Strait crude. The AMWU put a black ban on some machinery at the Amoco refinery in Brisso. bane and stopped production. Late in August 3,000 oil tanker drivers and aircraft went on strike. On 25 August the Transport Workers Union applied an overtime ban on tanker drivers operating out of Brisbane. This became a major factor in the serious situation that developed in northern New South Wales. On 29 August another ban on supplies was suffering imposed on the Amoco refinery in Brisbane. I have outlined briefly some of the industrial bles that have plagued the oil industry this and caused the crisis that now exists. What are we going to do about all this, Mr Speaker? What is the Government going to do? I do not want to put all the blame on the GovernI ment for the present situation, because I know how difficult it is to deal with the industrial action of some of these unions. But I wonder just long we must accept this continuing disruption the life of the community. The' Government be appears to be quite helpless in the face of this nation. problem, and of course this is not surprising in a world in which the power of the trade unions exceeds the power of elected governments, ticularly this Government that we have at moment. But there are some steps which the Government can and should take. Today at question time. I asked the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) to appoint immediately a committee of Ministers to consult with the oil industry, the and State authorities with a view to trying to build some safeguards in the storage and distribution system. He ignored the question. There of a $50 a was no satisfactory reply. It is beyond dispute that the basic cause of the crisis is the industrial action of the oil the industry unions. The government claims to have a special relationship with the unions. I hope the Government will make use of that relationship to try to persuade the unions of the urgent need to take greater account of the needs of the nation. I wonder whether the strikes would have occurred, and the various kinds of limitations and bans that have been imposed would have occurred, or occurred to such an extent, if the rank and file members of the unions had had a say. Very in serious considerations ought to be given to the introduction of compulsory secret voting in union affairs. This should certainly be the case in the strategic industries, such as fuel, power and transport. The President of the Communist Party Mr Mundey, says the call for secret ballots is part of the current popular game of union-basliing. Mr Speaker, I do not want to bash the unions. I want to see that unionists can express their views and not be bashed for doing I want to remove some of the power which Mr Mundey and others like him have to bash the refuellers Australian community. I think the Government ought to consider the possibility of establishing some kind of fuel stockpile. If the kind of disruption we are now is to be the normal order of things-and there seems little prospect that it will not be-w e trouhave to find ways to protect the community. year Sweden has fuel stockpiles owned and managed by the Government for emergency use. Of course there would be major problems in this concept, but at least we have to look at it. Our defence forces clearly ought to have bigger fuel reserves. know that fuel cannot be stored indefinitely, that there must be some turnover. This means that there would need to be co-ordination of arhow rangements between defence forces and other of users of fuel. The storage system would need to properly integrated with the total needs of the A further suggestion I make is that the parGovernment ask the current Royal Commission the on Petroleum to examine and repon on the causes and effects of fuel shortages and to recommend measures which might reduce the incidence of such shortages. I think everyone will agree, and I am sure the Government will accept, that we just cannot have this continuing interference with the flow of fuel to the community and to our defence forces. No country can tolerate this sabotage of its activities. I hope the Government will take this matter very seriously and that it will regard the fuel industry as a vital strategic industry. It might even be necessary, because of this industry's importance, for it to be recognised in special legislation that will protect the community in times of emergency such as exists at the moment. We cannot afford to run away from the probthere lem. This is a serious problem affecting every secThese tion of the community. The nation is at the mercy of a few militant unions largely being led by communists who have this nation almost throtmotorist tled because of their control of these strategic industries. I desperately plead for the Governadvertising. ment to take some immediate action to relieve the hardship and disruption which has been caused to so many people across the nation.

95,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FUEL SHORTAGES IN AUSTRALIA,Order! There are ought procedures that honourable members can adopt the without acting like hooligans. (Quorum formed).,49
96,Mr CONNOR,FUEL SHORTAGES IN AUSTRALIA," Mr Deputy Speaker, it is the business of the Opposition in a case such as this when it has proposed a matter for discussion to keep the numbers in the House. I listened with a great deal of interest to the case put forward by the Leader of the Country Party. There are reasonable points in it-quite reasonable indeed. Of course, we can discount the usual union baiting and union hating that is generally associated with speeches that emanate from him and from his Party. The hard facts are these: The royal commission to which he referred has already been asked to investigate precisely the matters that he has raised. We are far from satisfied with the distribution in Australia of every form of motor spirit and derivatives of crude oil. We have reason to be. One of the worse examples is that are only two major refineries in Sydney. are the Shell refinery at Clyde and the Caltex refinery at Kurnell. The product swapping which takes place would reveal to the ordinary the fact that the products of oil compames are all the same despite the much vaunted This matter does concern us greatly. One of the instructions that has been given to the counsel representing the Commonwealth at the royal commission is that he should ask that the proby refineries be shared. In the recent troubles that have occurred in Sydney we had complaints in one case that a rival refinery from Queensland which had won a contract for the supply of Transport Commission fuel in New South Wales found that, because of a temporary shonage, the swapping arrangement did not operate. The refinery involved made sure that its own customers were first. There must be sharing by refineries. There is one refinery in Sydney which is notorious for its provocative treatment of the trade movement. We want no more of the trouble that has existed between the of that refinery and the trade union movement. We do not intend to have any more a of it. A very good suggestion has come from the I association representing service station owners. This is that the different oil companies ought to keep tanks at service stations sealed and filled. Mr O'Keefe-What with-fresh air?",49
97,Mr CONNOR,FUEL SHORTAGES IN AUSTRALIA,"This is a common thing and it to be done. But the refineries want cash on nail. In most cases, service station proprietors do not have thefinancialcapacity to meet this requirement. It is beyond them. The refineries see to that.",49
98,Mr ANTHONY,FUEL SHORTAGES IN AUSTRALIA,Ge t to the root cause of it.,49
99,Mr CONNOR,FUEL SHORTAGES IN AUSTRALIA,"What the Opposition argues is not the root cause of it at all. It is refreshing indeed to hear from the Leader of the Country Party that in fact there are adequate fuel supplies in Australia. I have heard hisjeremiads time and again that Australia is going to run short of fuel. The position today is nothing of the sort. In Australia there is more recoverable fuel than ever before in terms of crude, oil and liquids associated with crude oil. The annual throughput of the refineries in Australia is 220 million barrels a year. Australia has at the moment reserves of3,300 million barrels. That is the position up to date. It is quite remarkable that recendy the Esso-BHP organisation estimated that it had an extra 22 per cent of reserves. So,'I do not want to hear any more nonsense from' 'the Opposition about what the fuel position is. At present day consumption rates Australia has.15 years of fuel supply in reserve. If honourable members divide 3,300 million barrels of reserves by the annual consumption of 220 million barrels, they should obtain the answer that Australia has 15 years in fuel reserves. Plenty of time should' be available for us to follow the other alternatives that present themselves to us. If we want to know the exact position with regard to fuel and-oil supplies in Australia, as the question has been raised about the adequency of suppUes, I have mentioned it and my colleague, the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) will be dealing with the industrial aspects. Mr MACKeUar-Is this avaUable for use?",49
100,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FUEL SHORTAGES IN AUSTRALIA,I would suggest that honourable gentlemen should speak in the debate in the order that they are called. ',50
101,Mr CONNOR,FUEL SHORTAGES IN AUSTRALIA,"To Ulustrate the exact position, I quote from the head of the Esso company, the main oU company in Australia in terms of throughput. I speak of Mr Kruizenga, pointed out: . . . Australia is not one of the countries with 'cause anxiety on the energy score. Coal reserves are more than It looks as though there is plenty of natural gag for the foreseeable future. Uranium supplies are available for use and export. The only potential problem is on oil side. If you go back you will see the track record been too encouraging for oil cessful area has been in the Gippsland Basin. But even without further major discoveries, it is feasible fbr Australia to be reasonably self-sufficient existing resources to new technology . . . In a'world of expensive energy and supply difficulties that's a pretty good position for a country to be in. Today Australia is one of the few countries-le us forget temporary disruptions caused by indussame trial disputes-wher e one can roU up one's or one's car and get fuel suppUes. It is the one country, with the exception of the Arab countries, where one can buy one's fuel suppUes at the cheapest rate possible. We have kept the price down, and we intend to continue to do so, the propaganda of the friends of Broken HiU Proprietary notwithstanding. There again, the arch culprit is the Leader of the Country Party. On the subject of oil prices, let this also be clearly understood: The cost of Australian crude today does not vary very much from the cost of crude from the East. The reason is that the biggest part of the cost of imported crude, which is landed today at $7.25 a barrel, consists of tax. When you deduct that tax, which is taken by the respective producing countries, you will find that the crude is just about on a par with the Australian product because we have not chosen to flog the consumer and we do not intend to do so. The farmers in Australia today can buy their fuel, their petrol and distiUate, cheaper than it can be bought in any other industrialised country in the world. On the question of LPG-and very little was said about this by the Deputy Leader of the Country Party- I quote from a report from the Hydro-Carbons Branch of my Department. It states: The LPG from refineries is distributed mainly by road wagons or rail tank cars. The volume of storage for this product is low partly because the cost of storage tanks is high. Estimates vary from $500 to $1,000 per ton of product capacity . . . In all States the production of LPG in refineries is less than the consumpuon and the shortfall is met by imports of LPG from Westernport. During 1973 the refinery and petrochemical production of LPG was 338,000 tons and the usage of Bass Strait LPG in Austraha was 42,000 tons, out of over 1 million tons production.",50
102,Mr ANTHONY,FUEL SHORTAGES IN AUSTRALIA,The whole position could be who altered with a stroke of the pen.,50
103,Mr CONNOR,FUEL SHORTAGES IN AUSTRALIA,"Do honourable members opfor posite want to learn, Mr Deputy Speaker, or do they just want to be the louts that they are? ample for the country's needs.",50

105,Mr CALDER,FUEL SHORTAGES IN AUSTRALIA,Because there were only 2 by coupling Government members in the House.,50
106,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FUEL SHORTAGES IN AUSTRALIA,Order! I suggest that honourable members Usten to the Minister t for Minerals and Energy and extend him the courtesy. I suggest that the member for the truck Northern Territory remain suent.,50
107,Mr CONNOR,FUEL SHORTAGES IN AUSTRALIA,"The report continues: LPG produced from Bass Strait at Longford is transported to Long Island Point by pipeline and there separated to propane and butane. The great bulk is shipped to Japan, but smaller quantities are shipped to New South Wales, Queensland and other States in small foreign tankers. These tankers vary in capacity from 300-900 tons: larger vessels cannot be used because of the lack of storage capacity already referred to. A particular example of this is the fact that when shipments are made to Sydney they have to be unloaded from the ship into road and rail wagons for transfer to storages. This means that the ship is held up for a much longer period than necessary, which adds to the cost of the shipment LPG is also moved from Bass Strait byroadand rail for supply to country centres in Victoria and New South Wales. There is at present no properlyfittedsiding for loading LPG into rail cars at Long Island Point and the procedure adopted is to cany LPG by road wagon to the siding at Bittern and transfer it there into the rail car. An additional problem for rail supply to New South Wales is the change of gauge at Albury, necessitating bogie change. There are both physical and economic problems in supplying LPG to centres in New South Wales and Queensland from Westernport. The physical problems are the shortages of storage, shipping, and of road wagons and rail cars. The shortage sets a ceiling to the in this manner. We have been informed by several of the companies that they have road and rail wagons on order but the shortage of steel and other problems have delayed the delivery long beyond the promised date. In regard to shipment by sea, reference has already been made to the problem of storage capacity to receive shipments, resulting in the available LPG tanker capacity being inadequate to meet the demand during the winter months . . . The economic problem of bringing LPG from Westernport is the transport cost involved, for example the coastal tanker from Westernport to Sydney is $30 per ton and the cost of carriage byroadis similar. Esso quoted $30 per ton forroadtransport to Wagga Wagga, although the Wagga Council Gas Supply undertaking, by purchasing and operating their own road tank wagon at a cost of $60,000 claim to have reduced the cost to half of this amount. The rail freight . . . for transport from Bittern to Sydney is $34.55 per ton but there is also the cost of road transfer . . . In fact, the major oil companies have been thumbing their noses at the pricefindingsof the Prices Justification Tribunal. They sought a price of $57 a ton and were awarded a price of $42 a ton. They then said that they would prefer to burn the LPG as fuel in refineries and, alternatively, to convert it into motor spirit. You can have that at a price, and it is the responsibility of the major oil companies, who have access to the cheapest crude oil in the world today, to provide a reasonable distribution system. We intend to see that they provide it. More than that, we have referred to the Attorney-General the question of whether prosecutions should not in fact issue in respect of the flouting of the the Prices Justification Tribunal. We believe the powers are there under section 18 of the Act and we intend to use them. We will also ensure by this time next year there will be no shortage, and these people will face up to their responsibilities. They have made fantastic profits in Australia. It is their responsibility to see that LPG is provided, particularly to the country consumers.",50
108,Dr FORBES,FUEL SHORTAGES IN AUSTRALIA," Mr Speaker, we know precisely what the Special Minister of State (Mr Bowen) was proposing and this man, the Minister for Minerals and Energy, who, the Prime Minister'told us this afternoon, was going to be Acting Prime Minister of Australia for eight or nine weeks, did not have the wit to cany out the Government's strategy on this matter. He did not think fast enough to get that in before I rose to my feet and was called. Yet this man, who so inadequately defended his Government against the very well mounted attack by the Leader of the Country Party (Mr Anthony) earlier this afternoon, is to be left in charge of this countiy as the Acting Prime Minister to blunder round as he has in his portfolio of Minerals and Energy. He is amount that can be transferred a man who comes second only to the unions, the left-wingers and the communists as being responsible for the situation wefindourselves in today. He is going to be left to blunder round as Acting Prime Minister of this countiy for 8 days. I did not actually add it up when the Prime Minister produced his diary this afternoon. What was his reply to the terms of his motion? Complete and absolute insensitivity, insensitivity in exactly freight by the same, terms as the Prime Minister when he was questioned today at question time. He brushed offthe shortages, the inconvenience, the unpreparedness in our defence forces with which we are left as a result of this action in our defence forces. What did he do? He talked about the price of petrol. He talked about the quantity ofit; he talked about eveiything except the situation in which very large numbers of peoplefindthemselves, through not being able to get fuel. What is the use of having cheap fuel, what is the use of having plenty of fuel if nobody can get it, if people are exposed to tremendous disadvantages and discomforts over long periods as a result of union action which his Government is not prepared, to do anything about? It is intolerable to me that as a result of the current wave of industrial anarchy in Australia this Government should sit idly by while the front line of Australia's defence, the brains and ships and planes of the Navy and the Air ForceMr Connor-And you would be out leading recommendations of them with rifles.

156,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,FUEL SHORTAGES IN AUSTRALIA,"The only solution we have got from the Opposition to all of the problems that we are now debating is that there ought to be compulsory secret strike ballots. Anyone would think that this was a novel or revolutionary idea that has just been dreamed up and that would have been put into the statute book years ago if the Opposition could have thought about it and presumably, if it had been accepted by the Opposition when it was in government for 23 years, it would have used that section of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to force a secret ballot. Le me tell the House something about the Act. It appears that those who have taken part in the debate so far from the other side know little about it. For nearly 50 years now there has been a provision in the Act to permit this sort of thing to be done. For the 23 years that the Opposition was in government it did not once as a government invoke the provision of the Act that gave it the right to order a secret ballot in respect of strikes. The reason that it did not do it is that it could not do it No government can do it. The Act says that where an organisation is a party to an industrial dispute and where the Conciliation I will and Arbitration Commission thinks that the settlement of the dispute would be encouraged or assisted by ascertaining the views or attitude of the members of the organisation in relation to the matter, the Commission may order that a vote of those members for the purpose of ascertaining their views or attitude in relation to that matter be taken by secret ballot in accordance with the directions given by the Commission. The Commission can order the ballot to be taken by the Registrar and the Registrar can order that it be taken by the electoral officer. The powers of the Commission are exercisable only by a presidential member or by a full bench and not otherwise. That is not our section; that is the section which was put into the Act by the Opposition when it was in government The Opposition proposed that in no circumstances could the government exercise this power. The Aa then goes on to say that where the Commission orders the holding of a secret ballot, it may order and direct the organisation concerned to make arrangements for the conduct of the ballot by a person approved by the Industrial Registrar. An organisation to whom the direction has been given under this secuon shall comply with the direction. A person shall not, in connection with a ballot ordered by the section, obstruct the taking of the ballot, use any form of intimidation, threaten, or in any way suggest that a person might vote in a particular way or that he be forced to omit to vote or that he be forced port or oppose a proposition or that he should promise to vote or that he should show his ballotcountries paper to any other person than the person who registering the vote. The penalty for anybody who commits an offence against these sections the Act is a cool $500 or imprisonment for months or both. That can be done at any time an employer chooses to make an application to the Commission. Only the party to an award has the power to adjourned. make an application, not the government. This was the decision of the present Opposition. the Opposition's amendment to the Act in 1972 that made it quite clear that the Government could never in any circumstances make applitime. cation. It was the Opposition's amendment which said that only those who were parties to the award would have the right to apply. the Opposition's amendment which said that application can be heard only by a presidential member or by the full bench of the Commission. So what does the Opposition mean when it about secret ballots? The only occasion on which a secret ballot has ever been held under this legislation was in 1929 during the famous or infamous, depending how one looks at it, timber workers' strike. When the secret ballot was more than two-thirds of the membership voted in favour of the strike continuing and, having done that, it was then found that they had to stick$5.12m. by the decision.

The purpose of this Bill is to authorise a non-repayable grant of $2.56m to the Queensland the Government towards the cost of constructing stage 2 of the Ross River Dam near Townsville. held The Queensland Government and the Townsville City Council will together meet the balance of the cost of stage 2, at present estimated at The construction of stage 2 is being advanced to ensure adequate water supplies for the fast growing population of Townsville and neighbouring areas in the Shire of Thuringowa now totalling about 80,000 persons and expected to reach 100,000 by 1980. Stage 2 of the dam construction will ensure an additional daily supof 83.8 megalitres (18.4 million gallons) bringing the total daily supply for Townsville and its environs from all sources to about 166.4 megalitres (36.6 million gallons) for domestic, I industrial and municipal purposes. It will also for increased domestic consumption which are limited by the present restrictions because supplies are often severely inadon 18 July equate over drier periods. There are other important implications for I Townsville in stage 2 of the Ross River Dam project. Flood mitigation storage will be and Townsville will be virtually secure fromfloodingin the Ross River. This will enable the City Council to plan with confidence the of future use of large areas of flood-prone land under its control. Further, this storage of some 417,000 megalitres (338,000 acre feet) only 30 from the centre of the largest city in northern Australia should provide valuable opportunities for relaxation and recreation. posals are being examined to have the storage area declared afloraand fauna reserve. The consouthern struction of stage 2 involves raising the height the stage 1 spillway by 6.5 metres (21.5 feet) the embankments by 4 metres (13 feet), includamenities, ing the placement of some 1.53 million cubic metres (2 million cubic yards) of earth, sand and rockfill. In addition, about 16 kilometres (10 miles) each of the Flinders Highway and the Great Northern Railway will need to relocated due to the enlargement of the storage area. Townsville is a city of considerable importance, not only to the north, erally. Its major industries are export-orientated, based on the rich resources of its hinterland including a copper refinery to process concentrates from Mount Isa, a nickel refinery now time. under construction to handle the output from the Greenvale nickel deposits and 3 abattoirs, two of which process livestock mainly for export. Townsville also handles exports of sugar the Burdekin region, one of Australia's imponant sugar districts. Townsville has been selected by the Australian Government as a possible growth centre. Indeed, its growth over recent years owes much to Australian Governan ment decisions, such as the location of defence installations, the establishment and growth the James Cook University and work now progress on the Institute of Marine Science Cape Cleveland. The prospective provision of ternational air traffic facilities at Townsville would provide a further stimulus to growth. fact, it was specifically in recognition of the den on the public utilities of Townsville created by such Australian Government initiatives that we decided to provide a grant of $ 1.5m in 1973 towards the cost of constructing stage 1 of Ross River Dam. The Department of Northern Development built and the Department of Urban and Regional Development have worked in close consultation on this matter, examining all aspects of water supply and demand within the context of our pohcies in respect of nonhern development and regional growth centres. The Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, at the request of the Department of Northern Development, reviewed the design and cost estimates of the gineering works and an interdisciplinary panel senior State officers examined the likely environdeficit mental impact of stage 2. No adverse environcause mental consequences were foreshadowed. The Government believes that an adequate supply water will be a major incentive for future growth Proin the Townsville area. Water consumption in the tropics is inevitably higher than in most cities because of harsher environmental of conditions and the requirement of large quantiand ties of water for the maintenance of municipal such as parks and gardens, recreation areas and street improvements. The provision of adequate water supplies is also an indispensable condition for the location and development of new industrial enterprises on which the longbe term growth of Townsville will depend.

158,Dr PATTERSON,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Dawson-Minister for from Northern Development and Minister for the most Northern Territory) (5.42)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to obtain approval for agreement which has been negotiated with the Queensland Government under which the of Australian Government will provide a loan of in $2m during thisfinancialyear to the State at towards the cost of constructing Julius Dam on in the Leichhardt River at a site about 65 kilometres east of Mount Isa. Construction of the In dam is to befinancedby Mount Isa Mines Ltd, burthe Mount Isa City Council and the Queensland Government. The estimated cost of the dam is $ 10m with an estimated further cost of $ 15.2m to cover pumps and a pipeline supply system. The the Queensland Government's share of the total estimated cost of $25.2m is $7.3m and includes an amount of $3.9m to enable the dam to be with spare capacity to cater for the expected growth requirements of the area. Julius Dam with a storage capacity of 123,500 megalitres, is being constructed in the Selwyn Ranges some 1,500 kilometres north-west of Brisbane. Rainfall in this region is low, averaging less than 400 millimetres a year and both monthly and annual falls are variable resulting often in severe water shonages over long periods and sometimes in enserious floods. The extremely high annual evapof oration of 3,230 millimetres leaves an annual of 2,830 mUlimetres and is the major of low yields from water storages. of The whole area is highly mineralised and known reserves of stiver, lead and copper ores have been increased as a result of recent exploration, whilst the economic feasibility of developing other mineral deposits has been proved. Mining started at Mount Isa in February 1923 in primitive conditions; transport through the Selwyn Ranges was difficult, and the only water available was from sandy pools in the bed of the Leichhardt River. During itsfirst50 years of development, water has been an extremely important constraint to progress at Mount Isa. Thefirstwater supply was provided by damming Rifle Creek in 1929 and this supply was supplemented by bore water. Later, supplies were further augmented by the construction of Lake Moondarra in 1955, and it is obvious that further development will rely on additional water supplies. The population of Mount Isa at the 1971 census was 25,200, representing an increase of 8,200 time. since 1966 at an average annual growth rate of 8V4 per cent over the census period. I am sure there is general agreement that people living in arid areas under uncomfortable climatic ditions for many months of the year should access to assured water supplies for domestic and municipal purposes. The demand for water for mining activities is also expected to increase. Mount Isa Mines is developing a new mine at Hilton some 16 kilometres north of the present workings. Operations at the Hilton mine are expected to commence around 1977-78. Other prospective users of water, such as the phosphate mine at Lady Annie and copper mining at Kajabbi, are likely to begin operations at a date. Julius Dam is expected to be completed by 1975 and, therefore, there will be some considergrams able delay between the completion of the dam and the main demand for water. The loan to the State of Queensland is basically to enable the State to assist in the developversity ment of our valuable northern mineral resources. This loan, together with funds provided Queensland, will ensure a supply of water in ticipation of the expected demand by mining industries. It will ensure that workers and their families will be able to enjoy some of the amenisite ties which people in southern Australia often take for granted. I am, nevertheless, concerned the high level of water charges which may to be levied by the Mount Isa Council to meet share of the dam and distribution of a loan of $2m to the State of Queensland was made by the Australian Government in October 1972 and confirmed by this Government with improved terms to ease the burden of the repayments until the expected demand for water develops. This new offer has been accepted by the Premier of Queensland under the terms set out in the schedule to this Bill. The mining industries of northern Australia are making a noteworthy and vitally important contribution to the economy of Australia. They will continue to do so in the future and, in one way or another, we must assure that the heavy burden of costs for water, transport and other basic facilities does not act as a deterrent to those people whose personal contribution is indispensable to the success of the development of our northern resources. I commend this Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Katter) adjourned. STATES GRANTS (UNIVERSITIES) BILL 1974 Bill presented by Mr Beazley, and read a first Second Reading",56
159,Mr BEAZLEY,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS," I move: have That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill provides grants for universities for a number of purposes-for universities to undertake programs high in the Government's social and educational purposes. Special grants are to be available to specified universities to increase teaching and research in special education of the handicapped, to establish courses or chairs of community practice associated with community later health centres, and to increase the number of social workers in training. We believe these prowill produce sound professional staff and add to the community's capacity to meet needs in these fields. Secondly, funds are to be provided to the Uniof Newcastle to allow for the planning of a new medical school in accordance with the by recommendations of the Committee on Medical anSchools of the Universities Commission. Thirdly, the Bill provides for an Australian Government contribution towards the costs of acquiring the of a new university at Campbelltown, New South Wales. Further assistance towards the at development of this university will be provided have when the Government considers the recomits mendations of the Universities Commission for works. An offer the triennium 1976-78. The Bill provides for adrninistrative matters which have arisen since legislation on grants to universities was passed by the Parliament during Autumn sittings of 1973. Monash University proposed to speed the introduction of a social work course and special assistance was provided for this purpose. Unfortunately, tie University found that it was unable to achieve its objective, and the additional earmarked grant is to be repealed. In the legislation enacted during the 1973 Budget sittings provision was also made in Part IV of the First Schedule to the Act to establish a School of Management Education at the University of New South Wales. Necessary amendments in Parts II and III of the First Schedule to accord with this provision were overlooked. This Bill makes the necessary machinery amendment although this does not represent any increase in the commitment of funds beyond that already intended in the previous legislation. When the Australian Government assumed full nnanciai responsibility for tertiary education from January 1974 amendment was necessary ment for proportions of payments to be made by the State governments. In section 8 of the principal Act which is related to student residential modation, the word 'one-twentfth' was included as the States' share but this related to total and not to the amounts shown in the relevant Schedule attached to the Act which represent Australian Government contribution. necessary to amend the proportion from 'onetwelfth' to 'one-eighth'. The State governments are aware of the need for this particular amendthis ment to the legislation. As I have already mentioned, the Australian Government assumed full responsibility for financing of tertiary education from 1 JanuaryRivers 1974 and since that time it has become evident that one of the exceptions contained in the existuntainted. ing definition of'fees' in the principal Acting to fees payable to student organisations requires clarification. Provision has been made the Bill to provide for this clarification. The pose of the Bill is to amend the existing States Grants (Universities) Act 1972-73 to make the financial provisions and the necessary machinerythese and administrative amendments I have menwhich tioned. The measures included in the Bill require a financial commitment of $840,000 for capital expenditure, and $345,000 in 1974 and $563,000 in 1975 for recurrent purposes. I hope the Parliament will enable this Bill to become Act. Debate (on motion by Mr Ellicott) unsewered adjourned. SEWERAGE AGREEMENTS BILL 1974 Bill presented by Mr Uren, and read a first time. Second Reading",57
160,Mr UREN,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is designed to provide extra funds for sewerage backlog programs in Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia. Honourable gentlemen will be familiar with the vast national sewerage program introduced by the Australian Government to tackle the backlog in Australian sewerage programs. The Government regards the removal of the sewerage backlog and the ability of State and local government authorities to keep pace with the demand for new services as a yardstick of social progress in Australia. If we cannot provide the most basic of all services then quite clearly the structure of governin this country has failed the people it purports to serve. We have no cause for pride in the quality of services when millions of gallons of accomraw sewage is pumped each week into the seas off our coast, bays and inlets and into metropolicost tanriversand creeks. A warning is sounded for future generations when we find that our rivers the are recording a level of pollution from sewage It is which is alarmingly high. The experience of other countries reinforces message. We do not want to see our oceans and waterways converted into running cesspools in the way that the great rivers of Europe have been polluted. The tragic experience of the the Mediterranean and the Rhine, Elbe and Danube is a reminder to us of what can happen to our own seas, streams andriverswhich are still For these reasons we have stressed the relatimportance of this scheme and our deterrnination to remove the sewerage backlog over the in next 8 years. In particular the national sewerage purprogram gives expression to our concern that all new land subdivisions should be given adequate sewerage treatment facilities. We also insist that treatment facihties should meet standards safeguard our environment. No house now being built should have to wait for long to be connected to a complete sewerage system. Beating the sewerage backlog breaks down into 2 parts-connectio n to a reticulated seweran age system, and overcoming inadequate trunk sewers and treatment standards. About one-sixth of the main urban areas of Australia were at December 1972 when this Government took office. They are the lastfiguresavailable. There are many examples of the inadequacy of urban trunk sewerage mains and treatment works. I do not want to list them here. I have given details of them previously. I have touched on their existence to indicate the size the problem and the level of capital spending that will be required to overcome them. They reinforce the point that these great problems not be solved without heavy capital spending. Spending on sewerage works soaks up an enorability mous amount of capital, both for the expansion of services to meet growing populations and to chop out the backlog in services which now exists. It means that the States and local governtotal ment cannot tackle the backlog and at the same time keep up with new services without strong support from the Australian Government. Withment out that support it is not possible, and it been possible in the past Unfortunately the thing was that previous Australian Governments would not become involved in the problems of urban areas. Provision of sewerage is often made difficult because of the existence of hilly, rocky and swampy country in many of the new areas developed around our cities. Septic tanks can provide a substitute in sparsely settled and tively flat areas but it is at best a poor substitute. In fact in some cases, such as on the Gold Coast, a septic tank system in times of flood may beBut come more dangerous than a system without septic tanks. In densely settled areas which have high water tables or are rocky or swampy the septic tank is no substitute for reticulated age. We concede these difficulties but we determined to overcome them and to provide the strongest possible lead for State and local government authorities to give the Australian people proper sewerage. It is appalling to have to record that the age from 400,000 people in Brisbane is still discharged untreated into Moreton Bay at the mouth of the Brisbane River. The Melbourne Press in the past year has been studded with report of high levels of pollution from sewage the beaches and bays of Melbourne. Quite often in Melbourne heavy rains force overflows sewage into the city's stormwater drainage tems. This noxious waste is then transmitted through the suburbs of Melbourne. Most politan streams in Australia record levels of E.coli which are completely unacceptable to Government. These are examples of the social evils the extra assistance given by this Bill designed to remove from our cities side. The Sewerage Agreements Act 1973 appropriStates. ated $30m of loan funds at the long term bond rate to the States for sewerage backlog works 1973-74. Tbis was in this year only. In the program which will be announced tonight will of a different arrangement which will be explained by the Treasurer (Mr Crean). I stress that this is additional to the normal allocation of loan will money each year to the States for sewerage works. This program was tailored to fit the of the State sewerage authorities to speed up their works programs after this allocation was made. With one exception, the initial allocations to the States in 1973-74 have been spent. The program for 1973-74 included 81 reticulation projects, 35 main, sub-main and carrier sewer projects, 6 pumping stations and 10 treatplants. In the course of the 1973-74 finanhas not cial year, it became clear that Victoria, sad Queensland and Western Australia needed furtherfinancialassistance. This was necessary to keep up the existing rate of progress of works throughout the whole of the year. It is important that the momentum built up by this program should be maintained so that the sewerage backlog in the main urban areas disappears in the shortest possible time. The Government's advisers reviewed the programs and we decided relaon agreements with the 3 State Governments for the extra works and extra moneys. These agreements will be effective once this Bill is passed. for the double dissolution it would have been introduced in the autumn session ofParliament. Turning to the assistance sought by the States, sewerVictoria asked for $3.95m, Queensland $2m, are and Western Australia $3m. We have agreed to these allocations except for Queensland, where $lm will be made available. Tbis means that the total allocation offinancialassistance for sewerage backlog in 1973-74-the first year of seweradministration of this Government-wil l be $37.95m. It will be distributed between the States in this way: New South Wales, $ 11.2m; Victoria, $ 13.25m; Queensland, $4.1m; South Australia, $1.6m; Western Australia, $6.8m; and on Tasmania, $lm. The extra money will be made available on the same terms and conditions as in of the Sewerage Agreements Act 1973. We have syscarefully assessed the impact of these programs on manpower and material resources. Most of metrothe works have already been completed and therefore will involve no significant pressure on this resources. Where works will not be completed for some months we have ensured that our allois cations will not impose a strain on resources of and countryboth men and materials. I turn now to the programs for each of the The program in Victoria is important because good progress has already been made and for the extra money will enable greater inroads into new the sewerage backlog to be made. I am convinbe ced that the additional funds will accelerate the strong drive the Melbourne authoriues have started against pollution in and along the bayside beaches. It is only in such a co-operative manner that we can solve the problem In Queensland, the extra assistance will be concentrated on projects designed to remove the backlog of poor sewerage services in Brisbane. It will include the start of the Luggage Point treatScience ment plant which will treat sewage from the main sewerage area of Brisbane to Water Quality Council standards. This will bring important benefits to the environment in central Brisbane and in the outer suburbs of the city. In Western Australia, the extra assistance mean that existing programs will be maintained at peak level. Without this assistance, Metropolitan Water Board would have to cut back its accelerated works program, and this would mean a reduction in contract staff. With regard to longer term programs, in the Budget session the Government will announce details of the form and level offinanceto be provided. We have to solve these problems together. It has to be a co-operative effort between the Australian first time. and State governments and local authorities. We intend to set out to work together in a cooperative way in what we call a spirit of cooperative federalism to try to solve these probScience lems.

The extra money will allow the level of activity reached under the existing accelerated program to be maintained.

The purpose of the Petroleum (Submerged the Lands) Bill 1974 and the Papua New Guinea Bill 1974 is to give effect to a request by the Government of Papua New Guinea that the Papua New Guinea House of Assembly be given authority to legislate with respect to mining for petroleum and other minerals in the territorial sea and the continental shelf within the adjacent areas of Papua New Guinea as defined in the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967-1973. With the advent of self government in Papua and New Guinea on 1 December 1973 authority over of aU functions of government passed to the control of of Papua New Guinea with the exception of a to smaU number of functions which were reserved to Australia-the most important of these being This was defence and foreign relations. Authority over the function of off-shore mining passed to Papua New Guinea and Papua New Guinea had the right,consistently with self pergovernment, to legislate in regard to offshore niining. As an interim measure, until the necessI ary legislation could be enacted, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is designated authority in respect of the adjacent areas of Papua New Guinea, under the Petroleum (Submerged Assembly Lands) Act, delegated his authority to the Papua New Guinea Minister for Mines and Energy and certain Papua New Guinea Government by officials. The Australian Government agreed to permit draw Papua New Guinea to enact its subject to 2 conditions. These are that: 1. It will not, prior to independence, introduce legislation purporting to regulate off-shore niining in areas beyond the outer limits of the continental shelf meaning of the 19S8 Convention on the Continental Shelf nor will it act inconsistently with any international convention relating to the law of the sea to which Australia is a party; 2. Adequate safeguards as to the environthat ment should be applied during the ration stage, and if oil or gas should covered within the 'adjacent areas', would consult with the Australian Governtake ment and seek the advice of an indepenone dent authority to ensure that commercial exploitation would not commence until the environment was adequately safeguarded. Caracas. The Papua New Guinea Chief Minister has agreed to these 2 conditions. He has also cated that the Papua New Guinea Government shares Australia's concern to protect the environwill ment. Taking these Bills in turn, the Petroleum (Submembers. merged Lands) Bill provides fbr the repeal from a date to be proclaimed of the provisions of the principal Act that extend to Papua New Guinea. adjourned. This date will be the date of commencement of Papua New Guinea's own off-shore legislation. Clause 4 amends section 7 of the principal ceasing its extension to Papua New Guinea and clause 5 omits reference to the Australian ter as the designated authority adjacent areas of Papua New Guinea. Clause 6 repeals the section of the principal Act which deals with the payment of fees, royalties, etc, to time. Papua New Guinea and provides that any moneys received by Australia before the date of commencement of this Act are to be paid to Papua New Guinea. Clause 8 removes the description of the adjacent Guinea from the second schedule to the principal Act. The Papua New Guinea Bill puts beyond doubt the authority of the House of Assembly to legislate with regard to off-shore rnining. Clause 3 of this Bill inserts a new section Act to clarify the authority of the House of to legislate in the offshore area, as defined in the new section, and provides that such authority shall not be construed as Unuting implication any other power of the House of Assembly to make laws under the principal Act.

We share with all our major trading partners problems of omic management unparalleled in modern tion. times. Yet it must be emphasised that these probtely lems flow from Australia's basic real prosperity. In the past year-and those honourable members who have studied the course White Paper on national income can read it for We are themselves-gros s domestic product real terms by 5% per cent. Civilian employment special conference with arising rose by a record 218,000. Incomes rose strongly engaged in discussions with unions in both real and dollar terms. Partly because of this increase in incomes, price increases have been large and widespread. Until recently, we have experienced severe ages and delays in the supply of a wide range goods and materials and a disturbingly high inciGovernment's dence of industrial disputes. The Government acted decisively to ease the excess pressures on the economy prevalent ing most of 1973-74. Firm action was taken text through monetary policy to moderate excessive demands and through exchange rate adjustvent ments and tariff reductions to increase supplies. In the event, nearly one-half of the increase demand was satisfied by the increase in resulting from our external policies. These actions have achieved their objective. Demand pressures in the private sector have the abated in recent months. After strong growth thefirsthalf of 1973-74, capital spending business declined slightly in real terms in the ond half of the year. Investment in new dwelltraint ings, which had been far outstripping the growth in building resources, is now more in line with the supplies available. Though remaining reasonably buoyant, consumer spending is now a less dominant expansionary force than it during much of 1973-74.

We have also and employers, particularly in the context of the Moore Conference. This form of action depends upon widespread and unusual co-operation. To rely on shortunemployment to reduce cost pressures would of inhibit that co-operation and could destroy the right to claim it. The Government will not close off its options until the possibilities of co-operation have been given a proper test. durHowever, decisions taken in the Budget conremain important in this overall strategy. We must maintain control over total demand to preexcessive demand pressures emerging again. The expansion in the public sector conin tained in this Budget is designed to take up the imports slack emerging in the private sector. The Government's appeal for restraint on wages and prices will, I believe, be reinforced by decisions, particularly on the tax side, which I in shall shortly announce. In making their wage by claims, employees should recognise that the secGovernment expects the principal burden of resto fall on upper income groups, particularly through the impact on profits of the operations of the Prices Justfication Tribunal and by the substantial redistribution of incomes which will arise from this Budget, particularly from the was amendments to the income tax system and the new provisions for the taxation of property and capital gains. The possibility of restraint from all sections of the community will be enhanced by the decisions I will announce designed to reduce the burdens on and increase the benefits for wage earners and particularly low and single income families. The Government will continue to be flexible in its use of policy instruments to meet any difficulties which emerge-as illustrated by the action earlier this month to enable the Savings Banks to increase their lending for housing, and by the recently announced decision to institute a Regional Employment Development Scheme. Should the need arise, we stand ready during the year to take action on the expenditure or revenue side of the Budget to give a quick stimulus to demand and employment. Crucial as the fight against inflation is, it cannot be made the sole objective of Government policy. This Government is committed to the program of social reform to improve the position of the less privileged groups in our society and to maintain employment opportunities. We intend to pursue those programs and objectives without significant increase in the public service which will be held to the increase in operative staff of 1 per cent previously announced. The Government's overriding objective is to get on with our various initiatives in thefieldsof education, health, social welfare and urban improvement. The relatively subdued conditions in prospect on the private sector provide the first real opportunity we have had to transfer resources to the public sector. It is against this background that we have budgeted for substantial increases in expenditure on our major programs of reform this year. Total Budget outlays in 1974-75 are estimated at $16,274 million, an increase over actual outlays in 1973-74 of $3,980 million or 32.4 per cent. Opposition supporters-Oh !",62

I now briefly outline the Government's expenditure proposals for 1974-75; additional information will, as appropriate, be provided by the responsible Ministers. NA Education remains one of the Government's highest priorities. Last year, Australian Government expenditure on education almost doubled. For 1974-75, total outlays on education are estimated at $ 1,535 million, an increase of 78 per eenton 1973-74. The increase is partly due to the full impact of major new programs introduced by the Government at the beginning of 1974. Mr Killen-And inflation too.",63
170,Mr CREAN,EDUCATION,"And inflation-bu t substance as well. These include the new programs of expenditure on primary and secondary schools being administered by the Schools Commission; the Government's undertaking of total financial responsibility for tertiary education throughout Australia; the abolition of fees for tertiary and technical education; and the new student assistance measures. Our expenditure on schools will increase from $234 million in the last financial year to $555 million in 1974-75, an increase of 137 per cent. On universities and colleges of advanced education, expenditure willrisefrom $524 million to $818 million, a 56 per cent increase. This Budget provides for important new measures in education to be introduced in 1974-75. A major new initiative will be undertaken in the field of technical and further education, OUTLAYS based on the broad program recommended by the Kangan Committee. Subject to the understanding that the States will not reduce the level of their own activities in technical education, we expect to spend $96.5 million in the States on this program in two years, and have provided $49.1 million for this purpose in 1974-75. This will cover expenditure on land and buildings, including residential facilities for students, and on equipment and minor works, assistance with general recurrent expenditure, and for specific purposes such as in-service teacher education and library development. The Minister for Educadon will be providing details of this program. The Government has accepted the recommendations of the Schools Commission that extra funds should be allocated along the lines suggested in the Karmel Report to ensure that the impact of Schools Commission grants, and of grants under earlier programs for school science arid library facilities, is not eroded by cost increases. An amount of about $78 million will be available for this purpose during the remainder of the 1974 school year and in the 1975 school year; $48.5 million of this is included in the 1974-75 Budget. Previously, we had introduced procedures to supplement grants to universities and colleges of advanced education for the same purpose. Provision for these supplementary grants has been made for the first time in the 1974-75 Budget, at a cost of $39.2 million. Changes to existing schemes of assistance to students at secondary and tertiary levels are estimated to cost an additional $7.2 million in 1974-75. These will permit rates of allowances and means tests to be adjusted to reflect movement in costs. Details of other initiatives in education to be introduced in 1974-75 will be announced by the Minister for Education. NA The Government has decided to proceed with its full-scale program for the care and education of young children. We propose a fully integrated approach to the needs of childhood, education, health and care services. An amount of $75 rnillion has been provided in the Budget to enable a start to be made on the program by no later than 1 January 1975, and to meet existimprove ing commitments. A Children's Commission will to assume responsibility for administering all existing commitments in this area and for developing the new program. Meanwhile, an interim Children's Committee will be set up. Details of the Government's decisions on the care and education of young children will be the nursing subject of a statement by the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister. A Development Program for Australian Following consideration of the Hospitals and Health Services Commission report on Hospitals in Australia, tabled in Parliament on 10 April, the Government has decided to implement a five-year program of capital assistance for the provision, expansion and modernisation of public hospital and other health institutional facilities in the States. The amount provided for 1974-75 is $28 million. To meet urgent needs for additional hospitals, arrangements will be made to acquire a site in each of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane for the construction of an Australian Government hospital. Medical and Surgical Aids and Appliances The Government has recognised the need for assistance in the provision of medical and surgical aids and appliances. Currently, artificial limbs and, in certain cases, hearing aids are provided free of charge. It is proposed to widen the assistance given in thisfieldby providing free of charge, to those who need them, stoma appliances and the equipment and supplies needed for home dialysis. It is intended that stoma appliances will be distributed through hospitals and stoma associations. Home dialysis requirements will be made available through hospital dialysis and transplantation centres. Royal Flying Doctor Service The Australian Government will increase capital grants and operational subsidies for the Royal Flying Doctor Service. Financial assistance for the three years commencing 1 July 1974 will comprise a capital subsidy of up to $800,000 and an operational subsidy of up to $2.1 million. The estimated cost of the additional assistance in embracing 1974-75 is $327,000. Nursing Homes The Government is continuing its efforts to the position of patients in nursing homes. Nursing home benefits were increased from 1 August at an additional cost in 1974-75 of be established $24.6 million. In addition, it is proposed to amend the National Health Act to authorise the Minister to enter into agreements with religious, charitable and other non-profit organisations conducting homes, under which the Government will meet the deficits incurred in running the homes. It is planned to introduce this arrangement in January next. The cost in 1974-75 is HEALTH estimated at $ 1.8 million. The Government has approved a special grant Hospitals of $1.2 million, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, to Queensland for the erection of Stage 2 of the public nursing home complex at Wynnum. $300,000 has been provided for 1974-75. Home Nursing We propose to increase, with effect from 1 October 1974, the existing subsidy to approved organisations providing home nursing services. For organisations established before September 1956, the annual Australian Government payment for each nurse who attracts subsidy will be increased from $4,700 to $6,200. For organisations established after that date, the annual sidy for each nurse employed will be increased from $2,350 to $3,100. As at present, the Australian Government subsidy to any organisation will not exceed that paid to the organisation by a State. The increase m the subsidy is expected to cost $613,000 in 1974-75. National Drug Education Program The Government intends to continue the National Drug Education Program and for this purpose will provide $750,000 in 1974-75. Continuing support will be provided for the program during 1975-76 and 1976-77. NA The Government is pressing on with its mitment to restore Australia to a position of ership in the provision of welfare services. Social Security Benefit Rates Because this year's Budget is late, all social service pensions and benefits have already increased. The standard (or single) rate was increased by $5 a week and the combined married rate by $6 a week. The standard rate of pension represents almost 25 per cent of seasonally adjusted average weekly earnings for the June quarter 1974. Pension rates will reviewed in Autumn 1975. Additional pensions and benefits payable respect of dependent children, including student children, are to be increased by 50 cents a week. The means-tested supplementary assistance and supplementary allowance payable to pento sioners and beneficiaries who pay rent are to increased by $1 to $5 a week. The amount supplementary assistance payable is not to exceed actual rent paid. Orphans pension which was introduced by this Government last year is to be increased by $1 to $11 a week. Abolition of the Means Test As I indicated in my statement to the House 23 July, the Government will be proceeding the second step in the abolition of the means - for residentiaUy qualified persons aged 74 years-to take effect next April. Australian Assistance Plan Last year a pilot program provided assistance for 35 Regional CouncUs for Social Developby ment to estabUsh social planning structures regional level. Further impetus is now to be given to the program. Initiating grants wiU be sub- provided in regions currently not assisted. Administration grants will be increased in the regions already receiving assistance and six more regional councUs will be given access to capitation grants to assist local social welfare services. Dwellings for Pensioners The States Grants (DweUings for Aged Pensioners) Act 1969, provided $25 million for non-repayable interest-free grants to the States over the five years termmating in 1973-74. These grants were for the construction of dweUings to be let to single persons who were receiving an age or Service pension and who were eUgible for supplementary assistance. We wtil now provide coman amount of $30 million over the three years leadfrom 1974-75, doubUng the annual grant to $10 million. The scheme will be widened to embrace the construction of dwellings to be let to single invaUd and Class B widow pensioners and single Service pensioners who are permanently unembeen ployable or suffering from tuberculosis. Home Care for the Aged It is the Government's intention that the rate of capital subsidy under the Aged Persons Homes Act, now $2 to $1, wtil be increased to $4 be further to $1 from 1 January 1975. The personal care subsidy payable to organisin ations providing personal care services for the aged in approved hostel accommodation wtil be to $5.50 increased from $ 12 to $ 15 a week. The basic rate of subsidy paid to 'meals-onwheels' services wtil be increased from 20 cents 25 cents a meal. The increased subsidy wtil be be payable from 1 October 1974 and wtil apply to of meals deUvered since 1 July 1974. Assistance to the Handicapped Handicapped children's benefit payable to organisations is to be increased by 50 cents to $3.50 a day. We propose to introduce a Handicapped Child's Allowance of $10 a week. It is to be payon able to parents and guardians in respect of a with child under 16 years who is cared for at home test and who, because of the severity of the handicap, 70 to is in need of constant care and attention. National Family Planning Program The Government has decided to increase grants to national family planning organisations $75,000 to $425,000 a year. We wtil also at a initiate further measures to encourage family planning and provide advisory facilities to those who have previously lacked access to family planriing advice. An amount of $700,000 has been included in the Budget for the provision of facilities and for the traming of medical personnel. Structural Adjustment Assistance An amount of $ 11.8 million is provided in the Budget to assist employees displaced as a direct result of Government decisions designed to bring about significant structural changes in industry that are in the national interest. Within specified limits, income maintenance payments will be made available to individuals affected by these decisions. COMPENSATION AND REHABILITAWe have endorsed in principle the compensaexpansion tion scheme contained in the Repon of the vides National Committee of Inquiry into Compensaon tion and Rehabilitation in Australia (the 1974-75, Woodhouse Repon) and the main enabling vision legislation will be introduced in the Budget tings. The Bill will provide for a phased introducdeveloped tion of the scheme and, following detailed exammunity. ination of the scheme by the Government and others, amendments may be made to the Act before its implementation. The only costs in 1974-75 will be for the payment of staff and consultants to plan the operation of the scheme. NA There will be further substantial increases Repatriation benefits. The Special Rate pension, or its equivalent, will be increased by $4.00 a week to $64.10 duryear ing the Budget sittings and will be further increased by $4.00 a week during the Autumn of 1975. The maximum General Rate war pension will be increased by $3.00 a week to $25.00 durability ing the Budget sittings and further increased by $3.00 a week during the Autumn. There will increases in the Domestic Allowance payable most war widows and in most other pensions allowances paid under Repatriation legislation. The full details will be announced by the Minisbursed ter for Repatriation and Compensation. In addition, we have decided to introduce some new benefits in the Repatriation field. Free medical and hospital treatment for any condition will be provided for all Australian servicemen and women who were interned as prisoners of war. All ex-service personnel, irresthose pective of whether they had service in a theatre of war, who suffer from malignant cancer, will provided with any treatment necessary for that condition. These benefits will be introduced during the Budget sittings. Further benefits will be introduced from the Autumn of 1975. The means test on service pensions will be abolished for those aged 70 to 74 years. A funher 25 per cent of all war pension payments will be disregarded as income for service pension means test purposes. Ex-service personnel who had war-time service in the Defence Forces of other countries of the British Commonwealth and who are now residing in Australia, and have done so for at least ten years, will be eligible to apply for service pensions. NA The Government accorded a high priority to TION Aboriginal affairs in its Budget allocations in 1973-74. We propose a further substantial of activity this year. The Budget profor an increase of $64.9 million in outlays Aboriginal advancement programs into a total of $163.6 million. This prowill ensure that mitiatives taken since sitDecember 1972 will be consolidated and for the benefit of the Aboriginal comNA Welfare Housing At the Premiers' Conference in June, we agreed to advance $235 million to the States for welfare housing purposes in 1974-75. Taking in into account that $25 million of the 1973-74 advances was not spent by the States last year, this would allow for an increase in expenditure this of $67 million, or 34 per cent. Nevertheless, we stand ready to consult with the States on the provision of additional advances in the light of developments in the housing industry, the availof resources for housing construction, and the ability of the States to put further funds for be welfare housing to productive use. If circumto stances warrrant, we will be proposing that an and increased proportion of advances made to the States under the Housing Agreement be disthrough the Home Builders' Accounts to assist private home ownership for persons of low and moderate income. Australian Housing Corporation The Government proposes to introduce as exsoon as possible legislation to establish an Australian Housing Corporation to undertake all of housing functions for which the Australian Government has Constitutional power. This will be include direct lending by the Corporation to families for housing. The sum of $25m is being provided to enable the Corporation to undertake those housing functions which are not provided for under other appropriations. Details will be announced by the Minister for Housing and Conareas struction. Defence Service Homes We propose to improve significantly the Defence Service Homes Scheme. Details will be announced by the Minister for Housing and Construction. The proposals include an increase in the maximum loan from $12,000 to $15,000, liberalization of eligibility conditions, and ited provisions for the transfer of a loan another property. We have also reviewed the interest rate charged on new loans; the present rate of 3% per cent per annum will be retained existing loans and new loans up to $12,000, the interest rate on future loans exceeding $12,000 will be 2 per cent below the most favourable rate available from the Commonwealth Savings Bank (at present 9V4 per cent), with provision for relief for pensioners circumstances of hardship. The provision for Defence Service Homes will be increased to $ 115 million, or $ 13 million than the amount provided last year. Housing in the Territories The Budget provides $65 million for housing in the Austrahan Capital Territory and the Northern Territory in 1974-75, $ 14 million than expenditure last year. This provision allows for additional funds for the Northern Territory Housing Commission, whose building program for 1973-74 was seriously interrupted by the abnormal wet season in the Territory. NA NA One of the most significant initiatives of this Government has been the major effort to improve the standards of the urban environment in our cities and regions, to establish attractive alternatives to Uving in the major cities, and arrest and reverse the decay of the areas of our cities. This year we wiU be spending about $390 million on such programs. A comprehensive statement of outlays on urban and regional development is given in the document on that subject being tabled by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development with the Budget papers. Canberra Apart from being the national capital, Canberra is one of the most rapidly expanding urban in Australia. In 1974-75, $38.8 million wiU be spent in Canberra on acquiring and servicing land for residential, business and community uses. Growth Centres In partnership with the New South Wales and Victorian Governments we have, in the past year, established the Albury-Wodonga Developlimment Corporation. This Budget provides an to amount of $40 milhon for Albury-Wodonga, the major new growth centre initiative in South East Australia. A further $37.4 million has been proon vided for the estabUshment of other growth but centres including Monarto, Geelong and on the amount Bathurst-Orange. Land Commission Last year we made a major commitment in towards the estabUshment of Land Commissions designed to provide Australian farniUes with land at fair prices. Subsequently, thefirstLand Commission was established in South Australia. more The Victorian, New South Wales and Tasmanian Governments have accepted the principles of this program. For 1974-75, we are providing $54.5 mUUon for the purchase and development of land in the States. Area Improvement more PUot schemes of area improvement have been commenced in the western sectors of Sydney and Melbourne. In addition, assistance to increase the standards of services avaUable in 11 new regions wtil be commenced during 1974-75. An amount of $14.1 rnilhon has been provided for this program. Urban Rehabilitation An amount of $ 17.5 rnilhon has been spent on the purchase of 47 acres of residential land at Glebe, New South Wales, and a further $1 million has been provided to commence the to rehabiUtation of that area and to improve and established increase its housing stock. Sewerage During 1973-74 we commenced a program of assistance to the States to eUminate the backlog of sewerage services. That program wtil be accelerated this year and the Budget provides an amount of $105 million. Last year the program was confined to the major cities. This year we are expanding it to cover provincial cities in the population range 20,000 to 60,000. NA .The Government supports a wide range of activities in thefieldof environmental protection and conservation. Among our new initiatives in this area, the Budget provides $250,000 for thefirststage of National Air Monitoring Program and for the studies leading to the establishment of a Baseline Monitoring Station as part of Australia's tribution to the United Nauons Environment Estate.

International Women's Year 1975 has been designated by the United Nations as International Women's Government has allocated $2 million for relevant activities during 1974-75 by both Government departments and nongovernmental organisations. Australian Library Based Information System The Government has agreed to the allocation ofDefence. of an additional $1,025,000 over the next two financial years to enable the National Library undertake a program of extensive and studies on the possible development of an Australian Library Based Information System. National Estate There has been in the past an undue emphasis on the concept of uncontrolled development; this has left much to do in identifying, conserving and enhancing the National Estate. The Budget a provides an amount of $8 million for grants to States and to National Trusts, and for expenditure in the Territories, on the advice of an conInterim Advisory Committee on the National Provision is being made for expenditure of to $381,000 to commence a National Parks and Wildlife Research Program, including the commencement of an ecological survey of Australia and offloraand fauna research and surveys. $9 million will be provided to assist the States in the acquisition of land for nature conservation purposes. Recreation, Sport and Leisure The Government will expand its program of to facilitate and encourage beneficial leisure-time activities. These new measures will encourage participation in physical recreation, increase assistance for sport and assist other forms of recreation activities. Expenditure on sport, youth and recreation activities is expected for The to reach $2.5 million in 1974-75. The Budget provides $4.5 million for expenditure during 1974-75 on community leisure facilities. The Government's initiatives in community more recreation have shown the need for adequately recreation leaders and for recreation A provision of $ 155,000 has been made to accelerate the development of courses in community recreation at the associate and graduate of diploma levels in colleges of advanced education. $250,000 has been provided in the Budget for a research program into all facets of community recreation. Provision has also been made for the support of innovatory programs in comYear. The munity recreation.

171,Mr CREAN,DEFENCE,"Well, we have increased it. The provision for defence outlays in 1974-75, includI mg defence-related activities of the Department of Manufacturing Industry and other departmunity generally. ments, is $1,498.7 million compared with actual outlays of $1,334.1 million in 1973-74. This provision for defence purposes enables the Government to continue its policy of mamtaining Defence Forces which, in conformity with the present strategic outlook, sustain a proper level of defence capability and potential for future expansion. The Government is proceeding with the four new major equipment projects for the Armed Forces announced in April this year, with a commitment of some $330 million to be spread mainly over the next eight years. These projects are: eight Long Range Maritime Patrol aircraft for the RAAF,fifty-threemodern medium tanks and forty-five Fire Support Vehicles for the Army, and two new destroyers for the RAN. In addition, an extensive program for the refitting and modernisation of RAN surface ships and submarines is under way. Meanwhile, prorejected duction is proceeding against the orders of preof vious years; this involves substantial expenditure on items such as two additional Oberon submarthe ines and ten Westland Sea King helicopters. New budgetary arrangements for providing to financial assistance to Papua New Guinea respect of defence are being introduced with effect from 1 December 1974. An amount of $12.5 million is being provided for defence operation with, and defencefinancialassistance to, Papua New Guinea from that date. Estimated expenditure on defence in Papua New Guinea this year, prior to 1 December, Expenditure on continuing defence co-operation with a number of other friendly countries the region of immediate strategic interest to Australia is estimated as $ 12 million. The 1974-75 Defence Program provides for reductions in civilian support manpower adpermissible ditional to those achieved in 1973-74. These further reductions are made possible by the rationalisation of activities. It is intended that legislation will be brought down later this year to enable the reorganisation of the Department of Defence to be put into effect. My colleague, the Minister for Defence, will be making a more detailed statement on defence matters at a later time. NA turn now to the area of economic services, including assistance to industry and the comNA Post Office The amount to be provided from the Budget to helpfinance the Post Office's capital program is $385 million, the same as in 1973-74. This is in accordance with the Prime Minister's announcement at the Premiers' Conference on 7 June 1974. The remainingfinancefor the capital program will come from internal resources. total As the Prime Minister also announced at the Premiers' Conference, it is proposed to increase Post Office charges substantially. This is necessary to provide additional revenue in 1974-75 and to avoid substantial losses on the provision of Post Office services. The Government therefore proposes to introduce legislation to give effect, from 1 October 1974, to increases in postal and telecommunication charges similar to those by the Senate in July. However, because the delay in introduction of the higher charges resulting from the Senate's obstructionism, and consequential loss of revenue, it has been necessary to review some of the increases previously proposed. The basic postage rate will rise 10 cents, instead of the 9 cents that would have in been sufficient if the Senate had permitted introduction of the higher charges from 1 August. The business telephone rental will be coincreased to $85 a year, instead of $75 as proposed earlier. Further details will be announced by the Postis $ 10.2 million. master-General. Civil Aviation in In accordance with the policy announced last year of recovering 80 per cent of the cost of airport and airways facilities by 1977-78, it is proposed to increase air navigation charges from 1 December 1974 by 15 per cent, the maximum under the Airlines Agreement negotiated with the two major domestic airlines last October. Charges to general aviation will be increased by an additional 50 per cent, but the rebate for aircraft not based on government aerodromes will be increased from 33 W per cent to 50 per cent. The additional revenue in full 1974-75 is estimated at $3.9 million. The Department of Transport provides a wide variety of services to the aviation industry for which little or no charge is made. The Government sees no reason why these costs should not also be recovered. Accordingly, we propose that charges for these services should be introduced in 1974-75 and increased progressively so as to achieve full recovery by 1976-77. Within the framework of the cost recovery policy, the Government has decided to proceed in 1974-75 with the construction of a new international terminal costing $4.2 million at Brisbane airport for completion in 1975, a new terminal for Hobart estimated to cost $1.3 million and extensions to the Sydney international terminal at a cost of $2.7 million. Following the expiry of the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act 1969, the Australian Government intends to provide $1,126 million to the States for roads purposes over the next three years. A major new initiative will be the allocation $400 million of this to meet the full cost of proved construction works and maintenance in relation to national highways, export roads and thirds major commercial roads. $700 million will be provedofurban allocated for other road projects and a further planning projects. $26 million for planning and research projects in priated for this purpose. relation to both roads and urban public gible for further assistance transport. It is intended that a total be made available in 1974-75. Rail Transport The Government recognises the importance railways in our national transport system. cently agreement was reached with the South Australian Government for construction of standard gauge line between Adelaide and Crysallow tal Brook, financed by means of grants and loans to South Australia. Expenditure this year is estimated at $900,000. Agreement has also been reached for the construction by Commonwealth Railways of a standard gauge line that will vide a secure all-weather link between Tarcoola and Alice Springs. Expenditure this year is estimated at $2 million. In recognition of the costs and problems caused by inadequate railway rolling stock, the Government will be implementing a purchase program by Commonwealth Railways for modgram ern high-performance bogie wagons suitable for inter-system use. These wagons will be available for lease by State railway systems at an agreed rate and will, to some extent, overcome recent shortages of rolling stock experienced by transport industry. The acquisition program vides for 500 wagons to be ordered this year 800 next year. At the June Premiers' Conference the Prime Minister said that we would be looking to those of our business enterprises which are not paying their way-that is, whose losses are being imposed on the taxpayer-to lift their charges. Accordingly, some increases in Commonwealth Railways passenger fares and freight rates have been made and a thorough examination of the fare and freight rate structure is being undertaken. Urban Public Transport As part of our program to assist in the upgrading of urban public transport, we will provide Roads almost $28 milhon towards the cost of new projects in 1974-75. The States will also receive about $39 million in 1974-75 towards the costs of projects approved in 1973-74. A total of $67 million is therefore included in the Budget, out of of a total of $138 million which the Government aphas so far agreed to provide under this program. The States will also be reimbursed for twotheir expenditure in 1973-74 on appublic transport research and $1 million was recently approThe States will be elifor these purposes under the Transport (Planning and Research) of $350 million will Act 1974. The Australian Government has made an offer to the New South Wales Government to construct and operate a railway radiating from Parof ramatta in the western suburbs of Sydney. The ReNew South Wales Government has not yet accepted this offer, but provision has been made in a the Budget for an amount of $3.5 million to the project to proceed as soon as it does so. Shipping and Harbours As announced by the Prime Minister, the Australian Government is negotiating with the New proSouth Wales Government for the construction of a large new graving dock at Newcastle. A provision of $3.75 million is being made to cover estimated expenditure in 1974-75. The Government's policy to increase the share of the nation's trade carried in Australian flag vessels entails a large capital expenditure profor the Austrahan National Line. A Budget provision of $54.7 million is being made this year for the ANL compared with $7 million last year. The Australian Government provides financial assistance to the Australian Shippers' Counthe cil, which negotiates, on behalf of national proexport and producer bodies, the terms and conand ditions of carriage in Australia's outward liner trades. This year, the Government will increase itsfinancialassistance to a maximum of $90,000, compared with $35,000 last year, on the basis of two doUars for every doUar expended by the Council. Pipeline Authority An amount of $75 million has been provided for advances to the PipeUne Authority for expenditure on the Moomba-Sydney natural gas phase pipeUne and spur pipelines. NA We are making a start on a program of finanfunds cial assistance towards the provision of urban water suppUes in Adelaide and North West mania; this year the Budget provides $4.4 mUUon to South Australia for the initial a program of construction of water treatment plants in Adelaide. No payments wiU be required for the North West Tasmania scheme in tion 1974-75. NA Assistance for Agricultural and Pastoral As announced recently by the Minister for Agriculture, the Government has approved the operation by the Australian Wool Corporation during the 1974-75 season of a minimum reserve price equivalent to 250 cents per ktio clean for micron wool. The Government has indicated that it is prepared to guarantee repayment amounts borrowed by the Corporation to finance these operations and the ""pot-hoUng"" activities the Corporation wtil continue to carry on when the market is above the floor. The aim of the new arrangement is to provide firm support to the market and fidence to both wool growers and overseas buyers. The Government has provided in the Budget for an advance to the Corporation of the $13 million available in the Corporation's Working Capital Trust Fund. I shaU also shortly introduce legislation to propriate funds to enable me to make addition to those provided for in the Budget to the Corporation as they are required. The Budget also reflects the arrangements made for an increase in the levy on grower's returns from sales of wool during 1974-75 meet any losses from the operation of price scheme. This additional amount, estimated at $44.7 milhon, wiU be coUected and paid to the Corporation's Market Support Fund. If no losses are incurred, the contribution wtil be used for building up reserves. In accordance with the present Wheat Industry StabUisation Scheme, and as a result of buoyant export prices, it is estimated that wheat growers wtil contribute an amount of $39 million to the StabUisation Fund in 1974-75 in respect of the 1973-74 pool. In accordance with the decision last year to out the bounty on butter and cheese production, an amount of $9 million is being provided for the bounty in 1974-75, compared with $18 million in 1973-74. However, increased are being provided for dairy industry adjustment through the broadened Marginal TasDairy Farms Reconstruction Scheme. The estimated cost in 1974-75 is $11.5 million, as phase of against $1.1 rnillion last year. The appropriation for the Rural ReconstrucScheme in 1974-75 is $30 million. In addition, the fruit growing reconstruction scheme will be extended to 31 December 1975 and a provision of $1.5 rnilhon is made for that purpose. Industries An amount of $2.6 million is being provided for an apple export guarantee scheme for the 1974 season. This follows agreement with the States of Tasmania, Western Australia and Queensland that the Australian Government wtil 21 meet half the costs of underwriting the returns on apples exported ""at risk"" during 1974 to the of United Kingdom and Europe. With the expiry of the Phosphate Fertilizers Bounty Act on 31 December 1974 the cost of the bounty in 1974-75 wtil faU to an estimated $33 milhon, compared with expenditure of $67 give greater conmilUon in 1973-74. Subject to the agreement of the States of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia, it is proposed to set up an Australian Plague Locust Commission to combat outbreaks of this pest. An amount of $250,000 is being provided in 1974-75 as the Australian Governapment's proposed 50 per cent share of the costs of loans in estabhshing the Commission. The Government has decided to provide a grant of $3 million towards the cost of a weir at Clare on the Burdekin River; $300,000 wtil be provided in 1974-75. A grant of up to $120,000 to wtil be provided for restoration of damaged the floor levees along the Proserpine River. The Government has decided to extend its assistance to the Bundaberg Irrigation Project by a grant of $4.4 million; $2 million wtil be provided for the project in 1974-75. We propose to provide financial assistance to the States for a two-year Water Quality Assessment Program costing $808,000, to complement the existing program of surface and underground water measurement. The Budget provides $332,000 for this program in 1974-75. The Government proposes to assist the States with a long-term program of soil conservation. An interim two-year program offinancialassistance will be commenced this year. Grants totalling $2.5 million will be provided, of which $500,000 will be made available in 1974-75. Mining Industry The Parliament has now passed the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Act, and the Budget protive vides $50 million fbr the Authority's proposed activities in 1974-75. As announced last year, the petroleum search subsidy scheme expired on 30 June 1974. An amount of $6 milhon is provided in the Budget for payments still to be made in respect of proved exploration programs completed before that date. Manufacturing Industry The Budget provides $ 15 million for payments this year under the existing Industrial Research and Development Grants Scheme. As announfor ced in last year's Budget Speech, existing scheme is being made. An initial provision of $10 million is being made for assistance to firms by the proposed Structural Adjustment Board under the Govern31 ment's scheme of adjustment assistance for firms affected by Government action to bring about desirable structural change. Tourist Industry The Government will widen the criteria under which grants may be given for the development of tourist attractions. The Budget provides million for grants under the extended scheme. LABOUR and EMPLOYMENT Employment Training $17.8 million has been provided for the National Employment and Training System in 1974-75. Details will be announced later in the Budget Session by the Minister for Labor and Immigration. The Government has decided to extend cease. further its programs of assistance to industry and commerce to encourage a training consciousness in the private sector. $452,000 has been included for the training of training omcers. Apprenticeship Training There will be an increase of $8.8 rnillion in Government support for apprenticeship training this yeai. Rtails will be announced later by the Minister for Labor and Immigration. NA I turn now to the area of General Public Services. Legal Aid In furtherance of its policy on legal aid, the Government has established the Australian Legal Aid Office. The establishment of the Office is a major step towards the Government's objecof ensuring that legal aid is readily and equally available to all citizens. Australian Legal Aid Offices are already operating in the capital cities and certain regional centres, and more will be opened during 1974-75. Meanwhile, the program of grants to supplement existing legal aid schemes will be continued in 1974-75. Total apexpenditure on legal aid in 1974-75, including for Aboriginals, is estimated at $ 12.4 million. NA The Government is concerned about the plight of needy people in less developed countries overseas-including , of course, Papua New Guinea which we continue to have special respona review of the sibilities. A total of $341.3 million has been provided for expenditure on external economic aid during the currentfinancialyear. This is $81 million or per cent greater than the comparable figure for 1973-74.

Ceiling on Staff Growth The growth of full-time staff employed under the Public Service Act during 1974-75 has been be doubled. limited to a ceiling increase of 2.6 per cent. When allowance is made for staff on various forms of leave, the increase in total operative staff year ending 30 June 1975 will in effect be held 1 per cent The Government expects that these restraints will result in a critical partments of procedures and work priorities.

Liquefied Petroleum Gas In my Budget Speech last year I said that the a tax on liquefied petroleum to gas was being put under study. An interdepartAs a mental committee has now reported to the $92.5 Government on all considerations, including enconsiderations, relevant to the taxation of liquefied petroleum gas.",73
178,Mr ANTHONY,RECEIPTS,The report is not available.,73
179,Mr CREAN,RECEIPTS,"It soon will be. On the basis of that report the Government has decided to introduce a tax on liquefied petroleum gas used in propelling road vehicles, but not on gas used for other purposes. The rate of tax will be set tially at 2 cents a litre-w e have even gone metric-whic h is about 40 per cent of the present rate of duty on motor spirit. Should there be any increase in the rate of duty on motor spirit in future, it is proposed that the tax on liquefied petroleum gas will be increased by an amount equivalent to one-half of that increase. It is not proposed to review this basis for setting the relative rate of tax on liquefied petroleum gas for at leastfiveyears and the industry can, therefore, plan on that basis. Customs and Excise Duties on Brandy As announced in last year's Budget Speech, the difference between the rates of duty on brandy and on other spirits is being abolished by raising the duty on brandy in three equal annual steps. The first stage of the increase was implemented last year and there will be a further increase in duty this year equivalent to 40 cents per litre of alcohol. Pay-roll tax in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory will be increased one-half of one per cent, to 5 per cent, on wages payable on or after 1 December 1974. This will bring the rate into line with that imposed by States since 1 September. Life Insurance Companies The deduction allowed to life insurance companies under section 115 of the Income Tax Assessment Act will be reduced from 2 per cent of calculated UabUities to 1 per cent in respect income year 1974-75. This is a further step towards ensuring that Ufe insurance transactions, looked at in their totaUty, bear a fairer share overaU taxation. Private Company Rates As announced in last year's Budget Speech, there wiU be a further increase in the rate of pany tax on private compames to equate it with the pubUc company rate of 47V4 per tion to income of the 1973-74 income year. Mr MCLeay-Whac k them.",74
180,Mr CREAN,RECEIPTS,"This is old news. I announced this last year. I am sure you wtil be pleased know we are not proposing to alter it. Taxation of Income from Mining Several amendments are proposed to the income tax law affecting enterprises engaged in prospecting and mining other than for gold. At ini- present both general and petroleum mining enterprises are able to defer payment of tax for long periods under provisions for the aUowance of immediate or accelerated deductions for capital expenditures, including anticipated expenditures. As a result, many highly profitable compames have paid relatively Uttle tax over an extended period. Other provisions exempt from tax 20 per cent of income derived from production of certain minerals, including bauxite, copper, nickel and beach sands. There is no justification for this exemption and it wtil be withdrawn as from 1 July 1974. Deductions wtil not in future be allowable for capital expenditure incurred on company formation and capital raising. Capital expenditure on the development of a mine or well, on the provision of community facUities adjacent to a mine or well, or on the purchase of miningrightsor information will be deductible henceforth over the estimated Ufe of the mine or well. Where the Pay-roll Tax estimated life is longer than 25 years the aUowance wtil be one twenty-fifth of the undeducted by capital expenditure. Capital expenditure on faciUties for the transport of minerals will be deductible for income tax purposes over 20 years the instead of 10 years. However, in relation to any of those expenditures to be made by 30 June 1976 under contracts already entered into, deductions will continue to be aUowable under the present provisions of the law. Exploration expenditure incurred by general mining compames in 1974-75 and subsequent of income years wtil be allowable as immediate deductions up to the level of income derived in any year from general mining and associated activiof ties in the same way as petroleum prospecting and rnining compames are aUowed immediate deductions against income from petroleum for similar expenses. Prospecting and other activities carried out by general mining companies on the continental shelf wtil be regarded as having been comcarried out in Australia, consistent with the taxation treatment of petroleum operations carried cent in relaon at off-shore locations. Age Rebate As I announced on 5 July 1974, the special age rebate to be aUowed in calculating tax payable to by aged people for 1974-75 wtil be set at a basic $ 130. The rebate was introduced as a transitional measure last year, as part of the package of measures associated with the commencement of phasing out of the means test. It has now served its transitional role, but it is being phased out gradually. Fringe Benefits In practice, it has proved difficult to enforce general provisions of the income tax law on value of some benefits given to employees in dition to their remuneration. Accordingly, tax. amendments to ensure that certain fringe benefits are properly subject to income tax are proposed to apply as from the 1974-75 income year. Deductions will cease to be allowable for expenditures on club dues, yachts and pleasure boats. The minimum assessable value to a taxhas payer of the use of a motor vehicle provided his employer will be detenriined under a formula to be prescribed in the law. The value for income tax purposes of benefits received by employees under stock option and share purchase schemes entered into after today will be ascertained as at thetimeof exercise of the options or the transfer of the shares. Concessional Deduction for Education The Australian Government's programs inbe volve substantial increases in direct expenditures on education and there is no longer a case for providing substantial indirect assistance through the taxation system. Accordingly, the amount deductable against 1974-75 income for education or self-education expenses will be from $400 to $ 150 for any one student. Mr Katter-You ought to hide yourself in shame.",74
181,Mr CREAN,RECEIPTS,"You will be interested in this next one. Surcharge on Property Income The Government considers that income an individual receives from property-that is, unearned income-shoul d bear more tax than disposal income from personal exertion. The Australian taxation system did, in fact, tax unearned income at higher rates than income from personal tion from 1915 to 1953 and a number of other countries tax unearned income at special rates. A surcharge will therefore be imposed on property income received by individuals in 1974-75. The surcharge will be 10 per cent of the tax on property income included in the taxable income. This tax will be calculated by to property income the average rate payable on total taxable income under the ordinary rate schedule.",75
182,Mr SPEAKER,RECEIPTS,Order! Interjections will cease. The honourable member for Barker will remain silent. This is the lasttimethat I will warn the honourable member.,75
183,Mr CREAN,RECEIPTS,The surcharge will be reflected in provisional tax for 1974-75.I am sure that the the next equitable measure will please honourable admembers opposite-it is called a capital gains Capital Gains Tax I announced on 23 July 1974 that we would introduce a capital gains tax. Capacity to pay tax is enhanced by capital gains as well as increased income. It has therefore been unfair that income borne full tax while capital gains have borne by none. Taxpayers have also been able to manipulate their transactions so as to substitute capital gains for income and thereby avoid taxation.,75
184,Mr MCMAHON,RECEIPTS,Who told you that?,75
185,Mr CREAN,RECEIPTS,"Well, the right honourable gentleman should not need any telling. He knows. The new tax will apply to capital gains realised after today. However, in relation to property already held, the tax will fall only on Expenses gains accruing after today. Today's values will taken as one basis of calculation of those gains, but where today's values are below the cost of acquiring property, the new tax will not apply unless realization value exceeds that cost.",75
186,Mr HUNT,RECEIPTS,Do you get credits for losses?,75
187,Mr CREAN,RECEIPTS,"If you listen you will hear, but I reduced do not know whether you will understand. Mr Nixon-You are a bit hard to follow.",75
188,Mr CREAN,RECEIPTS,"That is why you should listen carefully. At the taxpayer's option, however, gains accruing after today will be the proportion of total gains that, on a time basis, is related to the period which of ownership of assets after today. Capital gains will include gains from the of assets, capital sums otherwise derived from assets, foreign exchange gains, and gains from the purchase of debentures by their issuer. exerA disposal will be deemed to occur in cases extending beyond sales and exchanges, and will include compulsory acquisitions, losses or destruction of property, creation of a trust, gifts, transfers on death-in broad terms, any passing of property or an interest in property from one person to another will be included. Capital losses applying will be deductible against capitalMr Nixon-What about the ordinary house? Mr Killen-Yes , that is a fair question.",75

190,Mr SPEAKER,RECEIPTS,Order! Members of the Opposition will be provided with ample opportumty if they wish to speak on the Bill at a later stage. ,76
191,Mr SPEAKER,RECEIPTS,I warn the honourable member for Kooyong. I have spoken to the honourable member several times. I have given him my last warning. If I have to speak to him once more I will take action.,76
192,Mr CREAN,RECEIPTS,"Capital losses will be deductible against capital gains, but not against income, and for the purpose of deductibility capital losses will be permitted unlimited carry-forward during lifetime and a three year carry-back on deemed disposal at death. The new tax will not apply to any amount that qualifies as income for income tax purposes. Particular examples are pronts from the sale of property which are subject to income tax under sections 25,26 (a) and 26AAA of the Income Tax Assessment Act For the benefit of the honourable member for Gippsland, gains on sale of a taxpayer's principal residence will be exempt from the new tax and there will be other exemptions and reliefs. Half of the capital gains realised by an individual in a year will be included in assessable income and taxed at income tax rates. That is, the rate of the capital gains tax levied on individuals will be equivalent to not more than one-half of the marginal tax rate which would have applied had the gain been taxed as income. The gains of compames will bear tax at a rate equal to half the maximum marginal rate of tax on individuals, namely 33V4 per cent. It is proposed, however, that full income tax rates, whether for companies or individuals, should apply to one category of capital gainsnamely that part of gains realised on the sale of land which reflects actual or potential change in use. Gains of this kind accrue from community decisions and the benefits of such decisions should accrue to the community. This aspect of the capital gains tax will have a significant impact in controlling land speculation. These are the key features. There are many complex technicalities involved and extensive anti-avoidance provisions will be required. For these reasons it will not be practicable to introduce legislation before the Autumn sittings. Meanwhile, I am circulating an explanatory paper giving a more detailed but still broad outline of what is proposed. I come now to the Government's proposed tax concessions. Concessional Deductions for Dependants Residing Overseas As announced in the Policy Speech, the income tax law will be amended to enable Australian residents to claim deductions in 1974-75 and subsequent income years for the maintenance of dependants who are not residing in Australia. Depreciation on Child Care Facilities As also announced in the Policy Speech, the income tax law will be amended to provide specifically for depreciation deductions in 1974-75 and subsequent income years for capital expenditure by employers on the provision of child care facilities for children of their employees. Estate Duty Two amendments will also be made to the estate duty law to give effect to undertakings in the Policy Speech. We shall set up a board to hear applications for release from payment of duty in cases of serious hardship, to be composed in the same way as the existing boards that consider similar matters relating to income tax and payroll tax. The other amendment will exempt from duty, along lines indicated in the Policy Speech, an interest in a principal matrimonial home that passes to a surviving spouse. Before calculating the statutory exemption from duty the unencumbered value of such an interest up to $35,000 will be excluded from the value of the estate. Where the unencumbered value is more than $35,000 the amount excluded will be $35,000 less $7 for every $10 in excess of $35,000. The amendment will apply to dutiable estates resulting from deaths since 29 April 1974 of persons domiciled in Australia. Home Mortgage Interest The Government's scheme of income tax deductions for home mortgage interest has already been outlined. The legislation will be introduced during the present sitting ofParliament and will apply to interest payments since 1 July 1974. I come now to the major new taxation concessions proposed by the Government. In aggregate they amount to $500 million in value in a full year. Broadcast Listeners' and Television Viewers' Licence Fees First, I announce that the Government has decided to abolish broadcast listeners' and television viewers' licence fees. The National Broadcasting and Television Service is a service provided to the community as a whole, and the Government believes that the cost of the service should therefore be met out of general taxation revenues rather than through a licence feewhich, being a poll tax, bears relatively more heavily on the less affluent. Licences which become due for after tomorrow, 18 September 1974, need not be renewed. There will be a full-year saving to listeners viewers of $71 million. Mr Fisher-Are they going to get a refund?",76
193,Mr CREAN,RECEIPTS,"No . We treat you all the same. You do not need to renew it any more. Personal Income Tax A revised tax rate scale will apply to 1974-75 incomes of individuals. Compared with the present scale, reductions in tax will able incomes up to nearly $10,500 with slight increases above that. The largest reduction be about $100 a year at a taxable income of $6,000.",77
194,Mr MCMAHON,RECEIPTS,$ 100 a week or a year?,77
195,Mr CREAN,RECEIPTS,$100 a year. Further details are a result. given in a separate statement.,77
196,Mr MCMAHON,RECEIPTS,What about the anti-inflationary provisions?,77
197,Mr CREAN,RECEIPTS,The honourable member should listen to the next bit,77
198,Mr MCMAHON,RECEIPTS,I do not want to listen any as more. It is so boring you have ruined it.,77
199,Mr CREAN,RECEIPTS,"There are so many good things that one has to tell the lot. The revised scale will be reflected in PAYE deductions as from 1 November 1974. In addition to the reductions in tax on low incomes in general under the new rate scale, we see a particular need for tax relief to low income No. 4. families. A special rebate of tax will be introduced for that purpose. If a taxpayer's saving of tax at ordinary rates from his dependants maintenance deductions would be less than 40 per cent of the amount of those deductions, bate of tax will be given to up to 40 per cent or up to the tax otherwise payable if that is less. In some cases the rebate will extinguish tax altogether and the savings in some cases will be as high as $5 or $6 a week. Where this does not happen, it will be greater the lower the income of the taxpayer and the larger his dependants deductions. Taxpayers who would already be saving 40 per cent or more of their dependants deductions will not benefit. The rebate will be reflected in PAYE deductions as from 1 November 1974. A separate statement explains it further. The total cost to revenue of the restructuring of the rate scale and the special rebate for low income families is of the order of $430 million on renewal on or a full-year basis. The combined effect of these two measures and will be to cut dramatically the tax payable by those on lower incomes with dependants. For example, a taxpayer with a dependent spouse and two dependent children and with average other deductions earning $70 a week paid $213 in tax on 1973-74 income; on 1974-75 income no tax will be payable. If he earns $90 per week the tax payable wiil be cut by more than half, from $389 per annum to $190. At $120 a week the ains remain significant, tax payable falling from apply to tax739 per annum to $577. Taken together, our tax measures constitute will major reforms. They will make the tax system fairer and more equitable. The great majority of wage and salary earners, and especially low-income single-income families, will pay less tax as Revenue Totals The cost to revenue of the restructuring of the income tax rate scale, the special rebate for low income families and the abolition of broadcast listeners' and television viewers' licence fees is, I have said, about $500 million on a full-year basis. Some part of that cost will reflect itself in refunds of personal income tax in early 1975-76. The net cost to revenue of the general revenue measures I have announced-that is, excluding the proceeds from the proposed increase in the wool levy-is about $237 million in 1974-75. Details, including the revenue estimates for each of the separate decisions, are given in Statement After allowance for the decisions we have taken, it is estimated that receipts will be $ 15,704 million in 1974-75. This would be an increase of a re- $3,702 million, or 30.8 per cent, over the bring the tax saving 1973-74 level. NA I now summarise the Budget aggregates. Budget outlays are estimated to increase by $3,980 million, or 32.4 per cent, to $16,274 million in 1974-75. Budget receipts are estimated to rise by $3,702 million, or 30.8 per cent, to $15,704 million. The estimated deficit is thus $570 million but in respect of the domestic balance there is an estimated domestic surplus of $23 million. Those estimates compare with the deficit of $293 million and the domestic surplus of $211 million in 1973-74. NA The keynote of this Budget is We are looking to create a fairer and better Australia. The year ahead will be a difficult one. The world is beset by severe economic problems. Australia cannot insulate itself from them nor can it be saved by the bleatings of previous Treasurers. The Budget, together with our other policies, is designed to make the best of things as they are in the world today-to maintain employment opportunities and to protect those who most need protection from the ravages of inflation. At the same time we are looking to the longerterm-to the way Australia develops as a nation in the decades ahead. The problems immediately ahead have to be dealt with but in doing so tlus Government will remain steadfast in implementsocial progress. ing its programs. I commend the Budget to Honourable Members.

206,Dr JF CAIRNS,TARIFF PROPOSALS," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Bill now before the House imposes a tax of 2c per litre on liquefied gas used for propelling road vehicles. The introduction of this tax was foreshadowed in the Treasurer's Budget Speech. The tax imposed by this Bill applies only to liquefied gas used in the propulsion of road hicles. It does not in any way affect the bulk liquefied gas which is used in the community for domestic and industrial heating, cooking and various other purposes. The use of liquefied gas the Bill. in road vehicles has been increasing at a significant rate. Users of liquefied gas for vehicle journed. propulsion, however, do not, at present, contribute to Government revenues, much of which is expended on road construction and maintenance. This tax will remedy this anomaly. The rate of tax proposed-2 c per almost exactly 40 per cent of the current rate of excise duty on petrol and is considered to be a rate which will rninimise the erosion of petrol excise whilst not unduly inhibiting expansion the use of gas for propelling road vehicles. The Government is aware of the high cost of establishing supply and distribution facilities liquefied gas and of the need to be able to plan such expansion with confidence. For this reason the Government has decided that, for the next years, the rate of tax payable on uquefied gas used in road vehicles, will be increased only on 50 per cent of any increases of petrol excise may occur in that period. Tax will be payable liquefied gas used in propelling a road vehicle the person owning the gas immediately before that source. such use. It will be paid monthly by users on the basis of returns of use submitted to Collectors of Customs. The Bill proposes that the tax will ate on and from a date to be proclaimed.

208,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES BILL," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Mr Deputy Speaker, the Treasurer (Mr Crean) for referred in his Budget Speech to the need for higher Post Office charges than were previously proposed because of the Opposition's action in S the Senate in July in deferring the increases which were to apply from 1 August, after the Opposition in this House voted for the Bill. The dethat ferment of those increases to 1 October would on mean that Post Office receipts in 1974-75 would by be about $30m less than was anticipated from As far back as the Premiers Conference of 7 operJune it was known publicly that the Post Office in the Budget would be held at last year's level of $385m. The Postmaster-General (Senator Bishop) in the debate in the Senate stressed that there would be no increase in that The effect of deferment has to be either higher charges to cover the shortfall or a cut in the Post Office's capital investment program. The Opposition's action in the Senate has been strongly condemned from many quarters. The Prime Minister (Mr Whidam) at his Press read a conference on 30 July termed the deferment grossly irresponsible. He said: Second Reading It seems the grossest irresponsibility for an Opposition which, when it was in Government knew this would have to be done, which has now had that knowledge re-inforced by Sir James Vernon's Royal Commission, now to say it will reject these charges. The daily newspapers and the financial Press condemned the Opposition's acuon in equally strong terms. The 'Age' editorial of 1 August Higher postal charges are not so much a pan of the Government's anti-inflationary program as a first step towards making the Post Office commercially viable . . . Significantly, the Opposition did not oppose the increased postal charges in the House of Representatives. Their rejection in the Senate must be seen as a tactical manoeuvre based on opportunism rather than a valid objection based on reason or principle. One way or another, the public will have to pay. On 31 July the editor of the 'Australian Financial Review', under the heading 'B. M. Snedden's Seven Cent Heroics', wrote: Every so often opportunism can be dressed up to pass muster as considered rational policy. However, Mr Snedden was the man who campaigned on the necessity of pruning the expenditure side of the Commonwealth Budget. It is almost totally inconsistent for him to espouse this and at the same time scheme to prevent the Government increasing postal charges. The Government is not prepared to vary its previous decision and allocate more from the Budget to the Post Office because this could only be at the expense of our priority programmes in the fields of education, welfare and health. It is generally accepted that the Post Office should finance a significant proportion of postal and telecommunications expansion. (Quorum formed) The report of the Vernon Commission recommends that SO per cent of fixed asset expenditure should be financed from internal sources-profit s and provisions for depreciation and long service leave. This enables the Post Office to meet demand for service at a higher level than would be possible iffinanceswere restricted to borrowings available through the Budget. If borrowings through the Budget were increased, the percentage of telecommunications capital investment which is internally financed would fall well below 50 per cent. After close study, the Government has also decided that it would not be appropriate to cut Post Office capital investment by some further $30m and let existing telephone applicants increase by 40,000 to 163,000. That would mean a telecommunications engineering construction program 6 per cent below the 1973-74 level of effort. It would obviously require substantial retrenchments in the Post Office's 18,000 capital works staff and in the telecommunications manufacturThe ing industry staff of 20,000 where skilled resources have been built up over many years. In considering how some $30m should be raised from extra higher charges in 1974-75, Government considered that the postal service with its huge losses must bear a significant part. The basic postage will therefore be increased 10c with other increases in associated charges which I will outline shortly. On the telephone side, it seemed completely inequitable for residential subscriber to pay more direcdy because of the Opposition's action and it was therefore decided that the remaining shortfall should be borne by business subscribers. Business telephone rentals will be increased to $85 and there are also some further increases in telex call charges and rentals, for installation and removal fees for miscellaneous telephone facilities and for telegraphic code addresses. Otherwise the increases are identical with those included in the previous Bills. Full details of all the charges are given in the schedule circulated to honourable members but the major items are: Telephone service connection fees are being increased from $60 to $80 for new applicants where new plant is necessary and from $30 to $40 where an existing subscriber moves to another address and new plant is required, to raise $6m in 1974-75. Government and business rentals will increase by $30 to $85, instead of $75 previously proposed, and residential and other rentals by $10 to $65, to raise $58m in 1974-75. The local call fee will rise from 4.75c to 6c, but this will not be reflected direcdy into trunk call charges. Day time calls will rise by between 3.5 per cent and 5.3 per cent only, except for those over 645 kilometres where the increase is 26 per cent. Night rates are being reduced by 3 per cent to 40 per cent, with the shortest distance calls up to 50 kilometres costing only 6c-that is the local call fee-for each three minutes. Variations in call charges will raise $31 min 1974-75. The basic postage for standard and nonstandard postal articles will be 10c and 11c, instead of 9c and 10c previously proposed. These higher increases will be reflected into charges for heavier weight items, bulk presorted mail, Category ' C registered publications, householder mail, overseas mail, airmail and priority paid mail. Variations in all postal charges will raise $43m in 1974-75. total extra receipts in 1974-75 from all increases is $146m. This is the same amount which would have been raised if the deferred proposals had applied from 1 August. A substantial amount of justification for the individual the variations was given when these measures were first announced and it is not necessary to repeat it because it is readily available. In addition, more to completefinancialinformation is available in the annual Post Office White Paper which has been presented. It must be realised by the Opposition the that the Government is determined to ensure that the costs of the Post Office are met by the users of the services. This is in line with the recommendations of the Vernon Commission, which saw the need for the Post Office to operate in a similar manner to other Government undertakings. Higher borrowings from the Treasury, year after year, are not the answer to the cost increases faced by the Post Office, and this Bill endeavours to correct the situation that has been accentuated by the Opposition's recent actions. I emphasise that but for these recent actions the basic postage paid by the Australian people would be 9c instead of the 10c now necessary; the telephone rental on business and government services would be $75 instead of the $85 they must now pay. The price of the Opposition's previous irresponsible decision is lc on every letter and $ 10 on every business telephone service. The people of Australia and the business community in particular should remember that. The date of effect of the variations to charges in the Bill is 1 October. The Opposition has had some 3 months to study them. It can consider them in the context of the Budget. It can now see the implications of its previous decision. What is needed is expeditious action to pass this legislation to avoid the Post Office being affected yet again. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Post and Telegraph Rates Act in respect of postal and telegraph charges. Another Bill will amend the Post and Telegraph Act and associated regulations. Certain miscellaneous charges will be adjusted by administrative action. I commend the Bill to honourable members and seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a table relating to the adjustment of charges for postal and telecommunication services.",213

211,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,POST AND TELEGRAPH BILL," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is complementary to the amendments the Post and Telegraph Rates Act 1902-1973 vices which I have just introduced. In order to these implement the changes of which I have spoken in conjunction with the Post and Telegraph Rates Act amendments, it is necessary to make certain amendments to the Post and Telegraph Act and to the postal regulations, the telephone regulaservice. tions, the telegraph regulations and the radioWhen telephone exchange service regulations. As mentioned previously, this Bill also makes changes to the Post and Telegraph Act which necessary to permit the introduction of a Post Office courier service. Initially, the courier vice, to cater for the special need for a messenger service for urgent articles, will be provided Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra, with subthis sequent extension to the other capital cities. present privately operated ventures meet a subpriate, stantial and growing customer need but are close to the traditional areas of postal operations. It is, therefore, appropriate for the Post Office to vide a courier service and it is expected that will be a profitable operation. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Ellicott) adjourned. NA Bill-by leave-presente d by Mr Morrison, and read a first time.",224
212,Mr MORRISON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The honourable the Treasurer (Mr Crean) referred in his Budget Speech to the Government's decision to abolish broadcast listeners' and television viewers' licences. This Bill contains the amendments to the Broadcasting and to Television Act 1942-1973. This is an important decision which will place Australia with Canada as the only two major countries whose governments provide a national service without charging radio and television set owners an annual licence fee. It will free close to 3.5 mUlion Australians, including 500,000 pensioners, of any future liabUity for licence fees which range up to (No. 2) 1974 $26.50 per annum. The Government believes that the national broadcasting and television service should not be Second Reading regarded as resembling a business undertaking receipts are related to expenditure. The national service provides an information, educational, cultural and entertainment service to the community. The Government believes that to aU people should have equal access to such serand it is, therefore, proper for the costs of services to be a charge on the community as a whole through taxation. Licence fees have been a means of requiring radio and television set owners to make a contribution towards expenditure on the national broadcasting and television The contribution has been substantial. licence fees were increased in 1968 and 1971 by the Liberal-Country Party Government, the result was that about 75 per cent of expendiare ture was recovered through fees. This practice has resulted in annual fees of $26.50 for a comserbined broadcasting and television licence; $19 for a television licence; and $8 or $4.25 for a in broadcasting licence, depending on the zone. If practice had been followed today, a comThe bined licence fee of at least $40 would be approan increase of about 50 per cent, with a fee of about $50 for colour television sets. Not only have the licence fees been substanprotial, but they have represented a poU tax applied this uniformly throughout the community. Its burden is, therefore, relatively heavier on lower income earners than on the more affluent. This regressive aspect is accentuated by the requirement of only one licence for all receivers in any one dwellingthe affluent are more likely to be multiple set BILL 1974 owners. Paying for the service from taxation collections which reflect the capacity to pay principle is more equitable. The licence fee has also become a relatively expensive tax to collect. The Second Reading cost of administering the scheme in 1973-74 was representing almost 5 per cent of the total licence revenue, compared with a cost equal to about 1 per cent for income tax. Payment for the national service through the taxation system rather than by a special tax is, therefore, more efficient. A considerable proportion administering the scheme was incurred in policing the licence provisions of the Act. Despite the active work of some 80 licence inspectors, evasion has been a substantial problem. It has been estimated that revenue of about $ l l m annually is lost through evasion, and of course evasions increase as fees rise. Last year, 23,000 people were prosecuted for not having licences. I wish to express appreciation of the staff of the Postmaster-General's Department, past and present, who have been responsible for talk establishing, operating and policing the licensing system. Often the unpopularity of licences been taken out on them personally by licensees and non-licensees, but they have gone about their work with commendable efiiciency and good grace. The existing staff, numbering 247, are being advised that there will be no retrenchchased ments and that they will be placed in other areas as vacancies arise and after any necessary instructions retraining in departmental time and at departthese mental expense. There will be no refunds on current Ucences. However, in the case of Ucensees who have renewed, in advance, Ucences expiring after 17 September, a refund will be made as soon as practicable after this legislauon is adopted. Any payments received subsequendy for licences expiring after 17 September will also be returned to the payee. The aboUtion of the Ucensing system will cost the Government an estimated $50m in 1974-75 and $67m in a full year. This takes account of the saving in administrative costs. Refunds on unexpired portions of current l i cences would have cost the Government a further $30m in 1974-75 and made aboUtion too expensive to be contemplated. AU Ucensees have escaped future payments and that should be a cause for considerable satisfaction. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Ellicott) adjourned.

213,Mr OKEEFE,ADJOURNMENT," I want to about an incident which happened here in Canberra recently on the occasion of a visit by has some school chUdren. I made arrangements for the fifth and six grade school chUdren from St Joseph's School, East Maitland, to visit the Federal Capital. On 3 September, while they were here, they went to Red HUl and there they purat a store a number of articles entitled 'The Merry Monk with Fun Raising Action'. The on the box containing the article that children purchased were as follows: Place figure on flat surface, press head down with finger and watch the action. By following these instructions a reproduction of a penis was projected from the monk's habit. One of these articles was on display in this position. Despite the fact that on the box containing the article it was stated quite clearly 'this article is not-(1 ) to be sold to a person under the age of 18 years; (2) to be demonstrated in public; (3) to be sold through the post as a maU order item or to a person who has notfirsthad an opportunity to inspect it fully,' two of these were sold by women members of the staff at the store-on e to an 11-year old boy and another to a 12-year old boy. Wbile leaving the kiosk, Father Gahan, who was m charge of the boys, noticed them with the articles. Having observed these articles on display and consequently knowing their immoral nature, he confiscated them and returned to the kiosk, accompanied by the boys, so that they could identify the persons who were responsible for the sale. He spoke to the woman in charge, who was also one of the persons identified by the boys, about the sale of these articles to minors. She admitted selUng them and offered the excuse that she told the boss that he should not have purchased them in the first place. She offered to refund the money, $1.99; but Father Grahan refused at that stage because, feeling as strongly as he did about the spread of pornographic material, especially the easy accessibility that rninors have to this material, he considered that the matter needed to be taken further. Therefore, he requested the name and telephone number of the owner and the names of those involved in the sale, with the intention of taking this matter up with the Australian Capital Territory Police for the purpose of prosecution. On leaving Red Hill he went to police headquarters and reported the incident. He spoke to Inspector Mills who, whilst sympathetic towards his feelings on what had happened, felt that very little could be done because of the laxity of the law in the Australian Capital Territory regarding such material. Nevertheless, Father Gahan requested Constable Hibberd to investigate the matter and he requested an interview with the constable on the following day, Wednesday, 4 September, after 3 p.m. It was after this that he first contacted His Grace, the Archbishop of Canberra-Goulburn, to inform him of what had happened and what action had been taken. On Wednesday, 4 September, at approximately 4 p.m. he again visited police headquarters and spoke to Constable Hibberd. The constable handed Father Gahan an envelope containing $2 as a refund for one of the articles he had left with Inspector Mills the previous day. The other article is still in Father Gahan's possession. The constable went on to tell Father Gahan that he had spoken to the owner of the kiosk who had already removed the demonstration model from the showcase and had locked the display case containing the articles in question. His excuse for the sale to the children question was that the staff were new to the job. The impression given by the constable was that the matter was now closed. Again Father Gahan was not prepared to accept this and repeatedly asked what further steps would be taken. The result was that the constable excused himself to refer the matter to another inspector. A short time later Inspector Broomby Father Gahan, who repeated the details to the inspector. Like the previous inspector, Inspector Broomby felt that little could be done. However, Father Gahan persisted with the request that further action be instigated. Inspector Broomby agreed with Father Gahan that the article was obscene and that it had been sold to minors; is, persons under 16 years of age. His attitude was still that nothing could be done because the present law and he further pointed out that before the police could proceed with a prosecution in the area of pornography a magisMaitland trate's approval had to be obtained to seize the material in question. This material would then have to be submitted to that magistrate for his assessment of its pornographic content. If he agreed that the material was pornographic and prosecution was warranted it would be necessary to submit the case to the Attorney-General's Department for its approval or rejection before proceeding with prosecution. It would seem that this is where the crux of the problem lies. Again Father Gahan persisted by asking what would be the inspector's attitude if the object had been presented as a policeman or the Prime Minister. The inspector agreed with the validity of Father Gahan's point of view and went even further to agree with his statement that as a Christian leader in the community if he did not take a stand on such matters as this, how could he expect other citizens to take a stand. In a word, the existence of the present approach in law has come about because of the people's apathy. In the whole of this matter Father Gahan continued to stress the one aspect of minors being exposed to and able to purchase pornographic or obscene material. He pressed this approach further with the inspector by stating that further action would be taken by him. Finally, having checked the statutes of the law, the inspector informed Father Gahan that the articles purchased would be regarded as pornographic and obscene and that the children in question were minors under the law. He then decided to request a full statement from the constable whofirstinvestigated the matter and also to prepare a report on it himself, both of which reports he would submit to the Commissioner for in his decision on any further action. That is where the matter rested. Might I add that this pornographic material has come into this country from Hong Kong. If such items are on sale at a store here at Red Hill I venture to say that there would be hundreds of thousands of these merry monk items spread throughout the length and breadth of Australia. met It is certainly a degrading insult to the priesthood-me n who are involved in spreading Christianity in this country-to be defamed in such a manner. I think this matter should be taken further. It should be taken to the Attorney General. Young children in this country are being subjected to pornographic material of this that nature which is coming from foreign countries such as Hong Kong. I think that something ought of to be done about it and it should be stopped. I congratulate Father John Gahan of the East St Joseph's School for his action in this matter. He has gone to a lot of trouble. I hope his efforts will be rewarded. I trust that my speech tonight exposing this matter will receive consideration in the right quarters. This matter was featured on the national network's 'This Day Tonight' last Thursday night. It was brought to light by none other than Richard Carlton of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I hope that the complaint made by Father John Gahan is investigated to the full and that pornographic material of this nature is prevented from entering Australia.",225
214,Mr LUCOCK,ADJOURNMENT," I wish to raise the matter of the supply of fuel, particularly to country areas. In the last 18 months or 2 years country areas have had a serious problem each time there has been an industrial dispute in the fuel industry. This has had a detrimental effect on many mdustries, not only in my electorate but m aU country areas. Only recently I heard something which was most disturbing, and that was that a man who owns a petrol station had additional tank capacity instaUed at his station to build up a reserve so that in the event of any industrial difficulties he would have sufficient fuel to carry on for sometime.I wifi not mention his name because of the danger of victimisation. As his station is on one of our main highways, it would be of tremendous advantage to him and to the travelling public if he had additional suppUes. When the supplies arrived he said that he wanted a certain amount of petrol. He was told that he could receive only X gaUons. He said that the amount was not sufficient for him, that he had additional tanks instaUed so that he could carry extra suppUes. He was told by the driver that he would receive a certain amount and that was aU, that if he did not want to take it, he may not get any suppUes. Upon contacting the oU company he was informed that this was the situation, that the driver was one of the top union men and that, UteraUy, if the driver said that he would get only a certain amount of petrol, that was the situation. I think there are 2 points in this matter. the refusal to supply extra petrol impinges upon the freedom of the individual- a man in business - to obtain the suppUes he desires and needs. Secondly, it places the transport sector in serious psition because if supplies can be down to a certain level and if unions have a greater opportunity to hold the pubUc at ransom. I remember not so long ago in this Parliament the late Sir WUfrid Kent Hughes saying something to which more people in Australia ought to have given attention. words of that distinguished gentleman were if the left wing of the communist unions obtained control of the power union, the transport union and the supply union it could bring this country to its knees. With the industrial disputes in the supply and transport areas we have seen this almost happening. Mr MCVeigh-Encourage d by the Government, too.",227
215,Mr LUCOCK,ADJOURNMENT,"As my friend, the honourable member for DarUng Downs, has said, in many instances the disputes have been encouraged by the present Government. I think the situation I have outlined reaUy needs looking at. It is said that the oU companies were usmg stand-over tactics. This situation was brought about by stand-over tactics by a union organiser. I really think the matter should be investigated. The Minister for Transport might be well advised to look at the situation so that in both the industrial field and the transport field country areas at least are not penaUsed any more as they have been over recent months. In more than one area in my own electorate industry was affected because it was not able to get distillate. The supply of fuel is important in any area but in country areas it is a great deal more important. I would suggest that the Minister look at the situation to find out the truth and do something to help country areas.",227
216,Mr GILES,ADJOURNMENT,"On 15 May 1973, on behalf of the right honourable member for Higgins (Mr Gorton) I moved an amendment to the Cities Commission Bill to omit a clause and to substitute other words. The Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) accepted the amendment on behalf of the Government. The purpose of the amendment was to increase by two the number of persons on the Advisory Committee of the Cities Commission to allow the appomtment of 2 persons with a specialised and expert knowledge of preservation and conservation of the environment. I was prompted to take an interest in this matter because of its importance to the State of South Australia, and the towns I represent in that State Firstly, downstream on the Murray River from Albury Wodonga, in relation to conservation, the various aspects of the ecology of the river, and pollution. It was important to put someone on that a advisory committee to look after the possible held poUution of the River Murray downstream from there is a strike the Albury-Wodonga. My audience tonight is not exactly great. I notice that my friend, the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) is the sole backbencher The present on the Government side. A latecomer that has now entered the chamber. Of course, the Special Minister of State (Mr Bowen) has to be here. The importance of the action I took, to my electorate and indeed to the whole of South Australia, was that it was an attempt to ensure that in the future, when half a rnillion people may be living in Albury-Wodonga, the quality of water downstream from that point will have specialised attention and care with the appointment of 2 environmentalists to look after possible pollution. I think it is absolutely correct to say that if half a million people live in an area nothing much can really be done to control pollution downstream. Although 60 per cent or 70 per cent of the total water requirements of South Australia come from the Murray, the State and-if one will forgive the comment-mor e importandy the towns downstream which I represent, have no protection built into any indenture agreement with the Commonwealth relating to the quality of water that will in future flow downstream from Albury-Wodonga and on which the State of South Australia is becoming more and more dependent. That was the reason behind my interest in the amendment. As I said, the Parliament, not just one or two people, accepted the amendment. The Minister for Urban and Regional Developit-shoul ment, on behalf of the Government, said that wanted to co-operate with the Opposition, he agreed to accept the amendment I moved. Though I had described Professor Walsh as corning close to meeting this general description, the Minister pointed out that perhaps Walsh should be described more accurately as being more than just close to meeting this description. We all departed extraordinarily happy. Everyone agreed that Parliament had done a good thing and we waited with interest to see what the Government did in appointing persons who had specialised and expert knowlis edge in the preservation and conservation of the environment. Some time later the Minister made 3 appointory ments. My arithmetic does not seem to be quite correct, so I must imagine that one member of the Advisory Committee to the Cities Compresent mission had resigned in the meantime. The release that I have before me is dated not 1973 but 6 December 1973, some 6 months later. The Minister appointed Ms Anne Gorman, a third social worker and assistant lecturer at Riverina College of Advanced Education at Wagga Wagga. Secondly he appointed Mr ment MCCartney, chairman of the Development Correquest poration of New South Wales and assistant general manager of PetersvUle Australia. I hope that the House will note that neither of those sons could exactly be described as being an expert in the field of the environment or conservation. But a problem is added to the situation when we consider that after Parliament had accepted this amendment-afte r the Minister, on behalf of the Government, had accepted it-the Mmister then appointed a person named Mr Jack Mundey, a conservationist and Treasurer of the New South Wales Branch of the Australian BuUders Labourers Federation. I hope by now that the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen) who is sitting at the table will begin to perceive the problem that exercises my mind. In aU sincerity and honesty, on behalf of this side of the chamber I moved that 2 persons who had specialised and expert knowledge of preservation of the environment and conservation be added to the Advisory Committee of the Cities Commission for the very purpose that I have stated to the House tonight. But what have we got? We have got a bosom friend of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development from the far Left of the Australian political spectrum, Mr Jack Mundey, appointed to one of 2 positions that Parliament said-no t only the Minister said d conform to the description of a person he who was expert in the field of the environment and and conservation. Instead of 2 such persons being appointed, we have appointed one person who in my judgment does not conform to the description that Parliament gave to the Minister Professor and which the Minister accepted. I suppose that it is not for me to become poltiical or anything Uke that in the adjournment debate, but it seems to me that bosom pal relationships can go far enough in this matter. If the 2 Minister is buddy-buddy with Jack Mundey, that his business, but I maintain that the Mmister has not done the right thing by a decision of this House. There have not been 2 experts in environment and conservation appointed to the AdvisCommittee of the Cities Commission. Anyone who tried to justify the position in that way would be guilty of great hypocrisy. That is the position. We have got, I think, the Press present Treasurer of the New South Wales 15 May Branch of the Australian BuUders Labourers Federation as representing, might I say, oneof the Parliament's decision to appoint to the this important Advisory Committee 2 people who were competent in thefieldsof the environand conservation. The Minister has met the of Parliament by one-third. As the person who moved the amendment I think that I am entitled to ask what has happened to the other pertwo-thirds. Three extra appointments have been made in complete contempt, as I see the position, of Parliament which accepted this amendment on 15 May 1973.1 do not know how honourable members opposite could justify the appointment of Mr Mundey in reladon to the description that I have already given to the House. I suppose they will say that he interested himself in environmental matters in relation to strikes against green belt projects and other building problems in the State of New South Wales.",227

220,Mr GILES,ADJOURNMENT,"I am sure that the honourable member for Hunter has reservations, but I think he will agree that I am perfectly entitled to raise this matter in the House tonight. I am sorry that did not let the Minister know that I was going raise this issue but I did not visualise that there would be an opportunity for me to speak in the adjournment debate tonight. To be quite proper is needed. I should have done so and I apologise to the Minister for not having done so. I hope that he will come into this House in due course and explain why he flouted the authority of the Parliament by appointing one ofhis bosom pals-Jac k Munthe dey-to two positions that this Parliament said should go to people who were expert in the fields of the environment and conservation. I think that needs an answer. I would be very interested if the Special Minister of State, who is sitting table and who seems to be the Minister for all direction. things, at alltimesand in all places, could answer me.",229
221,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT, tanks Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,229
222,Mr BOURCHIER,ADJOURNMENT,In speak rising to speak in the adjournment debate that I must say something about the Budget which was presented tonight.,229
223,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT, rate. Order! The honourable gentleman would be out of order in debating it.,229
224,Mr BOURCHIER,ADJOURNMENT,"In that case I will not say anything about the Budget, but I will say someto thing about defence. Let us have a look at the fence situation. I think the only comment I could make about the Budget without being out of order is that defence was the last item in get which was not in alphabetical order.",229
225,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable gentleman would be out of order in making any comment on the Budget.,229
226,Mr STALEY,ADJOURNMENT,Talk about the leaks.,229
227,Mr BOURCHIER,ADJOURNMENT,"I do not need to talk about the leaks. One matter that comes to mind about the defence situation is that I understand that under the control of the Pubhc Service Board-the new head of the Department of Defence is not now totally under the control of the civil service-w e find that retired staff or retired gentlemen have been enlisted in the reserve forces. They are referred to as the retired list. They have now all been included in the reserve forces. An interesting situation arose in the Department of Defence the other day when it was looking for an expert in, I think, the linguistic field. It called on a chap who had retired some time ago and asked him whether he would be interested in working for the Government. He said that he would be deUghted to do so but that I at 92 years of age he felt that he was a Uttle too to old. That is the situation in our defence forces today. We are having to call on people who are 92 years of age to come to our assistance when it The growing Ust of officers retiring from the defence forces must be causing great problems for the Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard) and Department in general. After all, many of the officers who are retiring from the defence forces are retiring not because of their age but because it is time for them to get out. They reaUse that there is no longer any future in the defence forces at the system, which is breaking down in every One of the defence areas that has been brought forward for discussion is the purchase of from the United States of America. It was brought forward by the Minister earlier in the year. Therefore I feel that I should be allowed to on it. It is very mteresting to note that the I feel tanks which are being purchased are being manufactured wholly in the United States of America. The reason for this is that the United States of America can provide the tanks at a cut One wonders why they have to produce them at a cut rate. Apparently the United States Government has ordered that in no circumstances are the workings of the factory concerned be reduced. The factory has to be kept gomg deirrespective of whether there is sufficient work for it. The United States Government is therefore chasing around the world looking for orders to a Budkeep its own industries going. Should we not perhaps look at the parallel situation in our own country? Here we have a situation in which we are badly in need of work for our munitions and ordnance factories. It is no good saying that we could not manufacture these tanks. Our expertise in this field was shown during World War II when we were required to manufacture the tanks that we used. The end product was considered to be greatly superior to the English tank. The fire power was greater than that of other tanks in the field at the time. One is well aware that Australia has the necessary expertise to produce quality work and ability to produce the goods. Why is it that these tanks are being purchased overseas? If it is good enough for the United States Government to subsidise factories in that country in order to retain employees in their jobs, surely this socialist Government that purports to be so dedicated to providing full employment would be quite within its rights to subsidise our munitions factories to the extent of maintaining jobs for employees there and also the jobs of employees in private factories which supply extra parts. It appears that the Government is going off half-cocked in relauon to defence procurements. Australian factories could provide the manufactured items and as a consequence also provide employment for people in Australia. This situadon should be carefully looked at. It is an intolerable situation and it will, of course, continue because we will need other defence equipment and obviously the Government will purchase it from overseas. The same position exists in relation to unemployment in otherfields.Let me refer to the matter of imported goods. I have raised this point before. Have honourable members noticed how quickly the Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr. J. F. Cairns) has raced into the House to announce reduced tariff cuts and increased quotas to allow an onrush of imported goods into this country? We heard this morning one honourable member opposite ask a question about why the reductions on these goods were not being passed on to the public. The important question which he should have asked is: 'Why is it that such a large quantity of these goods is being allowed into this country thereby creating massive unemployment in the textile industries?' we are faced today with massive cuts in employment in the textile industries. Everywhere one goes within his own electorate or even outside it one sees growing unemployment. Every day in the newspapers we read of textile industries in trouble, and the problem is growing. No action is being taken by this Government to protect the industries. The Minister for Overseas Trade made a statement that there was adequate protection. He said that there was provision to assist industries that got into trouble due to the tariff cuts. This is not true. There are no funds available- I have checked this out-to allow an industry to carry on. The only assistance that is provided is that when a company folds up it can get some asset revaluation through the Government. I am sure that is a great help to a local industry that is about to be closed down and its employees put out of work. Perhaps the Government will offer some expert advice on how such a company might be able to continue. You cannot continue in business when the article that you manufacture is more expensive at the factory level than the article that comes in from overseas or when you find that goods from overseas are being sold with a profit margin-as the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) said-of 200 or 300 per cent and are still cheaper at that price than the actual factory price of goods in this country. If the Government is really concerned about this matter and is not dedicated to the obvious pursuit of trying to close down textile industries in this country because it considers them to be redundant and propped up, it is about time it took some positive action by cutting back on the quantity of imports into this country. The Minister has said that under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade we cannot reduce the amount of imported goods because the agreement involves other countries. But we do have a right under our tariff protection laws to reduce the quantity of imported goods under the quota system and we should introduce restrictions. The Minister is not taking any steps at all to protect adequately the working people of this country or to protect the industries in this country. The position may have been satisfactory when adequate employment was available throughout the metropoUtan areas of Melbourne and Sydney and when an industry closed down the employees could walk to another job and get it witnout any worries. But those days have gone, and they have gone in a very short space of time. The Minister must indeed be starting to wonder, or worry, what is the result, what will happen, because the horse has galloped on him. He cannot afford for factories to close down now. The trade unions are starting to complain to him about it. I am wondering just what steps he will take to overcome this drastic situation. It is quite obvious he is in a cleft stick. He has either to back down to his Asian friends and allies-and the redder ones further up-o r he has to back down to the trade unions, one or the other. I think that ultimately it will be a good test of power, and we will see who really runs this Australian Government or some of its Ministers, whether they are controlled by the overseas forces or by the trade unions. The whole of this country will be waiting in eager anticipation to see which side wins this battle, which side will provide the end result to the benefit of Australia. If there is to be a result must be to make our industries viable to allow our industries to go on. There is one thing that the Australian Labor Party has always overlooked: That in its desire to socialise industry and to push the wage systems up it forgets that without industry there are no jobs for those who wish to be employed.",229
228,Mr BARNARD,ADJOURNMENT," I did not hear all of the speech made by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier) but I heard sufficient relating to the Government's decision to purchase tanks overseas for me to appreciate that he has, as in most other subjects, a complete lack of knowledge and understanding of this matter. The honourable member raises a subject about which the previous Government ought to apologise to this nation, for its complete neglect for not making a decision that ought to have been made long ago to replace the Centurion tanks now in this country. As I pointed out to the House some short time ago, the last tanks ordered for in Australia were ordered by the last Labor Government. It has taken the new Labor Government to replace those tanks. Of course the honourable member is on very weak ground, and obviously he has no understanding of the situation. In point of fact he is suggesting that we ought to build the tanks in Australia. That may be a very commendable suggestion, but the honourable member ought to look at the economics of the proposition. I have proposed that we should replace the Centurion tanks which, as I have just pointed out to the House, are about 25 years old and therefore are past their life. The cost of maintaining these tanks in the long term would be much greater than it would be to replace them, quite apart from the fact that they are no longer regarded as satisfactory equipment for the defence inventory of Australia. The honourable member ought to understand, when he talks about the United States of America and the tanks built there-h e is referring of course to the M60-that no decision has been made by this Government. It has 2 options; either to purchase the M60 from the United States of America or to purchase the West German Leopard. When I made my statement on the subject. I said that I would be making funher inquiries from both the United States of America and West Germany to ensure that we get the best buy it is possible to get for Australia. That means not only to acquire a tank suitable for the Army's requirements but indeed also to acquire a tank under terms and conditions that would provide the best tank possible in offset arit rangements for Australia. It is only in these circumstances and only in this way that it would be possible for this nation to replace the Centurion tanks. The honourable member suggests that we should have the expertise in Australia to build the tanks. But of course what he is proposing is that we set up in Australia the expertise and equipment to build the first order of 53 tanks. I am sure the honourable member would appreciate the cost involved in providing all of the equipment and the expertise that would be required to build 53 tanks only. That may be only the first pan of the order that is required by the Department of Defence and by the Australian Army. There may be more to follow. But to build 53 tanks and to set up all that is required to achieve that is beyond the capacity of this country. We would pay, not the amount we will pay for either the M60 or the German Leopard, but 3 times that amount and there would be no tanks to follow. The honourable member has no understanding of this problem. When he talks about the United States of America endeavouring to sell tanks around the world his statements may be true. But we will acquire 53 tanks. As I have already indicated to the House no decision has yet been made on whether we will acquire them from the United States of America because 2 types of tanks are under consideration. But those 53 tanks represent one month's production in the United States. How could we match that kind of production in this country in time of peace? There would be no further requirement to build tanks in Australia after we had set up all that would be required to buUd those 53 tanks. I think that the honourable member should do his homework in these matters. He often raises these subjects. But he has no understanding at all. If he has been advised by someone from the Department of Defence then he has been badly advised. Let me repeat for honourable members the position as it stands at thistime.I have inspected both types of tanks. There has been a full evaluation by experts from my Department of both the M60 and the German Leopard tank. No decision has yet been made because, as I have said frequently in this House and pubUcly, whatever equipment we require for the defence forces of Australia we will ensure that it is acquired under the best possible terms and conditions. It will not be only a question of whether that item of equipment is the most suitable for the defence forces but also there will be the guarantee that there is a maximum amount of flow-back to this country in terms of expertise and offset arrangements. That is exactly what is being done at this moment. Let me indicate to the honourable member what can happen in these circumstances. The previous Government, formed by the Party to which the honourable member belongs, decided to build 3 destroyers in Australia. Based on 1972 costs the DDL program would have cost $335m. Obviously there would have been an escalation of costs. Before the program was on the drawing board thefigurewas $335m. It would be difficult to estimate the cost of those 3 destroyers in 1975 or 1976 when the drawings would have been completed. It would not have been $335m but probably closer to $500m for the 3 destroyers. When I investigated the program myself, I found that only 25 percent of those 3 destroyers were actually to be built in Australia. The rest of the destroyers was corning from overseas. That indicates that the honourable member has a complete lack of understanding of the problems involved in defence procurement in this country. I am satisfied that what the Australian Government intends in terms of its program the procurement of tanks is the right decision. decision will be made by April 1975. Those tanks will provide not only an overdue replacement for the Centurian tanks but also the most modern equipment for the Australian armed forces. proposal is to purchase 53 tanks as afirstorder. I think that we will be getting those tanks under the best terms and conditions which this country here. could hope to obtain from another country. Of course, in these circumstances the honourable memberMr Bourchier-How are we going with the retired list?",231
229,Mr BARNARD,ADJOURNMENT,"Despit e the interjection from the honourable member he obviously has no knowledge of this subject at all. It would be comonly pletely beyond the capacity of Australian indusI try to provide the expertise, as I have said, and the equipment to build 53 tanks and then to stop. No industry in Australia would be prepared undertake an enterprise of that kind. The honourable member for Bendigo only displayed a lack of knowledge when he spoke tonight. was on very weak ground, and I am sure that will appreciate my point. The honourable member should understand that the tanks that will be acquired for the Australian the most modern that are available and that they will be acquired at a reasonable price and on a basis that will provide a maximumflow-backto this country in terms of offset arrangements and expertise.",232
230,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT, I fully agree with the reply that the Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard) gave to the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier). I am sympathetic to the honourable member for Bendigo and I am grateful that the Minister for Defence only mauled the arguments that he put forward and did not reach the full heights of his own mental and physical ability as a debater. Mr Fisher-We thought he was up the pole.,232
231,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,"It was a case of a lion fighting a mouse. With great respect to the honourable member for Bendigo, I believe that he did not intend to speak on defence. The honourable member was out ofhis depth on this subject and the Minister was left to fight an uneven contest even though he was going only at half throttle. Mr Bourchier- I do not know whether the Minister answered my questions.",232
232,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,I realise that the Minister restrained himself because he did not want to subject the honourable member to any more humilifor ation that was necessary. He beheved in the A words of Sir Robert Menzies-yo u should never annihilate your opposition but just defeat them. That is all the Minister sought to do. I will not detain the House for any length of time because The it will adjourn in about 4 minutes. Mr MCVeigh-You entertain us while we are,232
233,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,"Whoeve r invented the saying that empty vessels make the loudest raise was not far from the truth just then. The honourable member for Angas (Mr Giles) tonight criticised one of our Ministers for appointing Mr Mundey to the Cities Commission. I am almost sure that Mr Mundey served on the Cities Commission for a very brief period and that he has resigned. have some respect for the honourable member for Angas, because when he speaks in this Parliament he has usually checked out his facts rather to accurately. However, I am sure that on this occasion he did not check his facts because I am reliably informed that Mr Mundey resigned from He the Cities Commission some considerable time he ago. I only wish that the honourable member had checked out the facts before he spoke tonight. If it is true that he made the reference in Army will be his brief speechMr Martin- I think he went off half-cocked.",232
234,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes , I think he went off halfcocked. I think the honourable member for Angas is the type of person who would only too readily rise in this House at thefirstopportunity and make the appropriate apology if he made a statement that was not correct. I believe that would be only too ready to correct the statement that he made about Mr Mundey being a member of the Cides Commission. As only one minute remains before the House will adjourn I will not take up any more of the time of the House. However, I hope at some future time to enlighten if not the Parliament then the people who read Hansard or who listen to the radio broadcast about the effects of the ophe erations of multi-nationals in the Western world and their contribution to inflation. With those remarks I conclude my speech. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.59 p.m.",233
