1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. David Hawker) took the chair at 9.00 am and read prayers. NA BILL 2005 First Reading  first time. Second Reading  tary to the Minister for Health and Ageing) (9.01 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill makes a number of amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989-the actto better secure compliance with Australia's high standards for therapeutic goods. These amendments follow on amendments to the act made in May 2003 in the wake of a succession of serious safety and quality breaches by a major Australian manufacturer of therapeutic goods-Pan Pharmaceuticals Ltd-which necessitated unprecedented regulatory action to protect the Australian public from medicines manufactured in a way that posed a threat to public health and safety. Since that time evidence from further monitoring and auditing by Australia's therapeutic goods regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), has shown that further amendments to the act are required to more effectively address continuing failure by other manufacturers to adequately comply with regulatory requirements. The main purpose of the amendments is to provide new alternative enforcement options to enable the TGA to deal more effectively and efficiently with suppliers and manufacturers who may place public health and safety at risk by failing to fully comply with regulatory requirements including product and manufacturing standards. The amendments represent the government's determination to respond to deficiencies arising from the limited range of enforcement measures presently available to the TGA and are considered necessary to enable the TGA to adequately protect public health and safety. Existing options for dealing with breaches of regulatory requirements are restricted to either criminal prosecution or administrative sanctions such as withdrawing the sponsor's or manufacturer's right to continue marketing or manufacturing therapeutic goods. Resort to either of these options may not, in some circumstances, be appropriate or achieve the optimal regulatory outcome, given the time and resources taken to prosecute offenders and the possible need to maintain supply of products to the public because of their essential nature or the lack of available substitute products. These new provisions are designed to overcome these difficulties and ensure that the TGA can take timely, appropriate and effective action to discourage sponsors and manufacturers from not fully complying with regulatory requirements, particularly when this is driven or influenced by commercial considerations at the expense of public health and safety. The new package of sanctions is built on existing conduct already regulated as an offence under the act. Several important measures are introduced in this bill. In relation to a number of significant existing offences the bill introduces a tiered regime of criminal offences that is intended to better tailor penalties for criminal conduct so that more serious offences resulting in, or likely to cause, harm or injury will attract heavier criminal sanctions. The penalties for higher tiered offences, that require proof of an aggravating element relating to harm or injury, are significantly higher than the corresponding offences without the aggravating element to reflect the more serious consequences flowing from breaches of regulatory requirements that result in, or will pose, a serious and direct threat to public health and safety. The level of penalties for offences with an aggravating element is comparable to those contained in other Commonwealth legislation. Under the bill penalty levels for some offences are increased to ensure consistency of penalties across the act. The bill allows for alternative verdicts in respect of the various tiered offences in tion to the same conduct regulated under the act. This measure allows a jury to convict a person of the lesser offence, if the jury acquits the person of an offence specifying an aggravating element but is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of facts that prove the person is guilty of the lesser offence relating the same conduct. This provision is necessary in view of the tiered offence regime regulating conduct that consists of the same physical elements. This approach is modelled on similar alternative verdict provisions in other Commonwealth legislation. Under the bill a defendant may be required to provide a pre-disclosure notice of evidence, in support of a defence to an offence related to dealings with unapproved goods, prior to the defendant being committed to trial or the determination or hearing by a court of summary jurisdiction. It provides the Director of Public Prosecutions with a way of adequately assessing evidence of an exception to the offence claimed by a defendant prior to committal or hearing. The pretrial disclosure requirement is similar to that provided under the New South Wales Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The bill introduces a parallel civil penalty regime for breaches of the act. The inclusion in the act of civil penalties, alongside criminal penalties, will allow for an alternative and quicker process for dealing with a wide range of legislative breaches. Civil penalties are expected to be more effective in deterring and preventing non-compliance with regulatory requirements by body corporates, who represent the bulk of those regulated under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 and regulations. Higher penalty levels attach to civil penalties because they are designed to provide adequate incentives, especially in relation to well-resourced corporate entities, for deterrelaring breaches of regulatory requirements under the act. The inclusion of alternative civil penalties and criminal offences is an effective strategy that has worked well under other Commonwealth legislation. The bill introduces infringement notices (on-the-spot fines) for strict liability offences to and for conduct that is subject to the new civil penalty regime. Use of infringement notices will allow appropriate enforcement action to be taken where readily assessable elements of a breach are identified and where use of other enforcement options are not warranted. An infringement notice, which will set out the particulars of the offence, is intended to give the offender the option of either paying the penalty specified in the notice or electing to have the matter dealt with by a court. If paid on time no further liability arises. If not so paid, the matter may be subject to subsequent court proceedings. The bill introduces provisions that enable the TGA to accept enforceable undertakings by a person either to remedy breaches of regulatory requirements or to not engage in future contraventions. Enforceable undertakings are a form of administrative resolution based on voluntary undertakings given by the person concerned as an alternative to litigation or regulatory action. If an undertaking is breached the TGA may seek enforcement of the undertaking by the Federal Court. The use of this measure may be more efficient and productive in particular circumstances, such as where a deficiency in a manufacturing process needs to be rectified by a manufacturer whose general manufacturing ability is not in question. The use of enforceable undertakings in appropriate situations will ensure that public health and safety is assured while access to therapeutic goods for which the public has a continuing need is maintained. The power to accept enforceable undertakings is already given under Commonwealth legislation to other regulators such as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Enforceable undertakings cannot be unilaterally enforced by the TGA and can only be used where those regulated agree to their use. The bill provides for certain offences to extend to conduct by an Australian citizen or Australian body corporate outside Australia, and to conduct by an Australian resident outside Australia where there is an equivalent offence in the laws of the relevant overseas jurisdiction. The offences that will be extended extraterritorially relate to the making of false misleading statements in a material particular in connection with an application to include therapeutic goods in the register, the manufacture, supply, export or import of counterfeit therapeutic goods, the manufacture or supply of tampered goods and the failure to notify the secretary or the National Manager of the Therapeutic Goods Administration about actual or potential tampering of therapeutic goods. These particular offence provisions have been given extended extraterritorial application in order to ensure that a person who would ordinarily be subject to the laws of Australia, had the conduct occurred within Australia, will be held accountable for the same conduct undertaken whilst the person is not in Australia, on the basis that the conduct, undertaken externally, could result in a significant impact on the health and safety of the Australian community. The bill extends the powers by an authorised person available under monitoring warrants to secure appropriate evidence in respect of a contravention or suspected contravention of civil penalty provisions. The bill also introduces a new search and seizure warrant relating to contraventions of civil penalty provisions. The provisions reflect similar requirements in the act for offence related warrants. The bill extends the liability of a body corporate to executive officers who are directly involved in its day-today management if the body corporate commits an offence or contravenes a civil penalty provision. This measure ensures that executive officers who are in a position to prevent a contravention by the body corporate will be deemed liable for the contravention if they fail to take reasonable steps to do so. The bill extends the circumstances in which the TGA is authorised to release inand formation it holds in relation to therapeutic goods. The bill specifically permits the public release of information relating to any regulatory decisions and actions taken under the act and regulations. In addition, the bill also authorises the release of information relating to a breach or an alleged breach of the act or regulations involving therapeutic goods to Australian and overseas regulatory agencies. This extra capacity to disseminate such information will assist in improving the TGA's ability to protect public health and safety. The bill provides substantial measures to improve the regulation of therapeutic goods. The expanded range of enforcement mechanisms under the bill provides a more flexible approach to securing compliance with the regulatory scheme. The introduction of civil penalties means that noncompliant persons can be fined rather than prosecuted in appropriate circumstances. In a number of cases this may be the TGA's preferred course of action unless the conduct has the characteristic of criminality and is likely to cause or has caused harm or injury to consumers. The level of fines applicable in a particular case will be determined by a court and will reflect its assessment of the seriousness of the conduct in question. The payment of fines rather than conviction is likely to be preferable to many persons in view of the adverse consequences on a person following a conviction. With the new measures the TGA will be better placed to deter a company's continuing breaches of regulatory requirements before they become so serious that administrative action has to be taken that could put the company out of business. Deterring non-compliance by the industry as a whole is important in protecting consumers but it also creates a fairer environment for all players as law-abiding sponsors and manufacturers are not unfairly disadvantaged by their noncompliant competitors. Increased compliance also leads to greater credibility and attractiveness of marketed products. The confidence of the community in the safety of therapeutic goods is of great importance. The observance of Australia's regulatory requirements for therapeutic goods by suppliers and manufacturers enhances the reputation of Australian industry. The provisions in the bill represent appropriate measures to protect the interests of both the community and industry. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Gavan O'Connor) adjourned. NA",21
2,Mr ANDREN,TELSTRA,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Calare from moving that this House: (1) condemns the Government for agreeing to the full sale of Telstra in the face of overwhelming public opposition; (2) notes the inability of the Government and Telstra to provide any credible figures on the amount needed to bring parity of price and parity of service to rural and regional Australia; (3) further notes the totally inadequate universal service obligation funding and the Government's continued ignoring of the Productivity Commission's 2001 inquiry into telecommunications regulation that supported the then Australian Communications Authority's belief that half a billion dollars per annum was needed to maintain and enhance the network; (4) calls on the Government to implement an immediate reinvestment strategy from existing income streams to ensure adequate telecommunications infrastructure and affordable services for all Australians wherever they live; and (5) calls on all country representatives to oppose the Telstra sale legislation.

NA AMENDMENT (SMALL BUSINESS EMPLOYMENT PROTECTION) BILL 2004 Second Reading Debate resumed from 16 August, on motion by Mr Andrews: That this bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Stephen Smith moved by way of amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: (1) noting that the nation's independent umpire in industrial relations matters, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC), has examined and heard submissions concerning the impact of redundancy payments on small business; (2) noting that the AIRC has found that the available evidence does not support the general proposition that small businesses across the board does not have the capacity to pay severance pay; but (3) recognising the circumstances of those individual small business which are incapable of making redundancy payments; calls on the Government to comply with the AIRC decision and to adopt mechanisms to address those individual businesses with a genuine incapacity to make redundancy payments”.",25
5,Mr BARRESI,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I continue my remarks from last night's debate. The reason why the Workplace Relations Amendment (Small Business Employment Protection) Bill 2004 needs to be introduced into the parliament is the decision by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to overturn small business's exemption from redundancy pay obligations. The Australian Labor Party's blocking of unfair dismissal reform in the Senate on over 40 occasions demonstrates that the Labor members in the other house are certainly not friends of the small business community. It is unfortunate that their stance has been supported by the recent decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to impose redundancy pay obligations on the small business community. In this instance, it is not the ALP and their blind allegiance to the militant unions that is placing a noose on small business; it is the AIRC itself. That is a real shame. It is a disgrace. The AIRC's decision highlights the deficiencies within the antiquated industrial relations system, which is not up to speed with the needs of modern small business in modern Australia. The fact that there is a need this bill hammers home the piecemeal pace at which industrial relations reform has taken place in Australia. While many sectors in the economy have adapted and evolved with change, our current industrial relations system is restricted by the parameters of the past. The commission is a creature of initial post Federation Australia. Our economy and our business sector continually strive to adapt to the ever globalising environment. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission however, as a bastion of the traditional industrial club, has continued to stand out as a key example of how the system can stifle modern workplace agreements. The failure of the commission to provide sufficient protection for small businesses against often financially crippling redundancy payments highlights the commission's disconnection from the needs of our small business community. It also highlights a strong need to reform the commission. I welcome the decision of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations to introduce as part of the coming reforms a new Fair Pay Commission along the lines of that currently operating in the United Kingdom. This important reform will help drag the industrial relations system into the 21st century and will create a real benefit for small business. A strong and sustainable economy is vital for the small business sector to prosper. They do not have the buffer zones within their budgets to absorb an economic downturn and, if things are going well, a small business should be able to put on extra staff. This productive improvement for small business will also enable the local community to share in the net benefit of the strong business climate. We know that there should not be a ‘one size fits all' approach to our industrial relations system. It is unfortunate, but the Labor Party's opposition to this bill highlights that for they are increasingly out of touch. They look at industrial relations as something that can so easily be implemented and imposed on businesses no matter what their size. In a strong economy small businesses create employment. The last thing that the small business sector needs is an impediment and a disincentive placed upon it by the AIRC through pressure from an ever irrelevant Australian Council of Trade Unions, which is suffering from underrepresentation in the Australian work force. Historically the industrial relations system has adapted to contemporary requirements at a snail's pace. More than ever before, it is evident that large centralised bodies such as the government and the commission have less of a role to play in efficient employment arrangements within small business. This bill is vitally important. Its purpose goes right to the heart of the small business liability. If not passed, the vast majority of small businesses covered by federal awards will eventually be subject to redundancy payments for their employees in accordance with the Industrial Relations Commission's decision. With the commission's decision pointing the IR system in a ‘one size fits all' direction, there need for legislative change to guarantee protection for small business. The bill underlines the current need for reform within this system. The commission's decision will impose an unfair financial burden on small businesses. Every employee and their employer deserve the right to negotiate and reach an agreement on employment and salary packages. One must ask how far we have actually come in workplace relations given the fact that this piece of legislation is even needed. Small businesses were exempted by the commission's predecessor, the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, in 1984. The decision to exempt small businesses from mandatory severance pay was an ironic step in the right direction by that commission during the time of the former Labor government. It is perplexing to understand why the current Labor opposition are against this bill, considering that those exemptions were put in place when they were in power. More importantly, it is also perplexing when one realises that state based industrial relations commissions around Australia-of course, all in Labor states-have created this exemption as well. Two years prior to the coalition's election in 1996, the New South Wales Industrial Commission reaffirmed the need for the small business exemption. Just recently, the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission continued the almost unanimous view that the exemption made plain common sense. The question remains: why did the national commission go against this trend and why will federal Labor also go against this trend? It is a trend so readily accepted by their mates in Queensland and New South Wales. I ask that the Labor opposition rethink their view on this issue and realise that their position is contrary to the practices that are takis a ing place in other states and also from when they were in power at a federal level.",27
6,Mr HENRY,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"From the viewpoint of the very many small business holders in my electorate of Hasluck, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Small Business Employment Protection) Bill 2004 is very welcome, removing as it does onerous and unacceptable burdens placed upon them by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The bill will amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to ensure that those small businesses covered by federal awards will continue to enjoy an exemption from the need to provide redundancy payments-an exemption, I might add, which they have enjoyed since 1984. If the AIRC's decision imposing such a burdensome obligation of redundancy payments is allowed to stand without challenge, it will directly impact on the ability of many thousands of small businesses to continue to operate and provide, as they do, much needed employment opportunities for local people in the community of the electorate of Hasluck. Members may recall that in my maiden speech to this House in November 2004 I made a commitment to small business within the electorate of Hasluck to work on their behalf to reduce the excessive burden placed on them by bureaucracies such as the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. I am therefore delighted to be able to stand here today to provide those small businesses with a loud voice to protect their interests. Local businesses stand at the heart of many local communities, including my own, adding vibrancy, and providing valuable services and, most importantly, employment to the many constituents of Hasluck. This sector of our economy is one that truly underpins our economic capacity and, indeed, our Australian way of life. The 1.1 million nonagricultural small businesses that are spread throughout Australia are responsible for employing over 3.3 million people, and the role they play in economic growth and job creation within this nation should not be underestimated or go unrecognised. Any measure that threatens the viability of small business is therefore unwelcome and will have many undesirable consequences. The small business sector is filled with some of our nation's most self-reliant, innovative and entrepreneurial people. Small businesses operate the length and breadth of our country, from the smallest country town to the largest of our capital cities. For me, and indeed for the majority of people within my electorate of Hasluck and within this country as a whole, the decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission overturning the exemption from severance pay for businesses employing fewer than 15 employees is very baffling and puzzling in the extreme. The exemption was granted with good reason by its predecessor over 20 years ago. It is therefore truly mystifying why the Australian Industrial Relations Commission should introduce a requirement that has the very real potential to result in the insolvency of many small business holders. It is a flawed decision, and one that must be extinguished by this bill. The decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has caused alarm and consternation. We must not allow excessive regulation and compliance standards to stand in the way or crush the aspirations of those hard-working and committed people who run small businesses and contribute so much to the communities in which they operate. For many years I was the Chief Executive Officer of the Master Plumbers and Gasfitters Association as well as the Master Painters, Decorators and Signwriters Association. They served the interests of many small business operators in the building and construction sector, so I know from personal experience the difficult environment that many small businesses have to work in. The decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to impose the requirement to take on the obligation for redundancy payments stifles free enterprise and has the potential to be the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back for many small businesses. It is interesting to note that both the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission and the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission have reaffirmed the need for small business exemptions in this regard. It is also interesting to note that none of the four state governments that participated in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission test case supported the removal of the exemption. Indeed, my own state of Western Australia actively opposed the measurewhy?-because it just does not make economic sense. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission imposes a ridiculous and unreasonable financial burden on businesses that operate in often difficult circumstances and with tight margins. Typically, a small retailer employing just six or seven people could potentially find itself having to put aside many thousands of dollars into a contingency fund to cover its liability for severance pay. It is a cost that few if any but the most prosperous of small businesses can afford to bear. Those affected by this decision are not the BHPs or the News Corps of this world, with their multimillionor even multibilliondollar turnovers; they are often family owned businesses that, while paying their way, are not in a position to take on redundancy liabilities that can run into the tens of thousands of dollars. The coalition and indeed the majority of reasonably minded people within this country oppose any unnecessary restraints on small business operators that make it more difficult for them to employ people. This government has consistently made its support for small businesses known and has translated that support into action. This bill shows that we will continue to oppose absurd and unwarranted impediments that will make it much harder for small businesses to provide jobs and contribute to the health of local economies. The opposition is opposing the bill-not because the bill doesn't make good sense, but rather out of political dogma and, I suspect, a desire to be seen to support the ACTU's opposition to the exemption. In reality, it is also about protecting the Labor Party's bottom line and the $47 million that the union movement has donated to the opposition over the last 10 years. It seems that Labor is prepared to leave small business operators and the millions of people that they employ out on a limb in order to line its own pockets. The Labor Party is proposing a system whereby small businesses will have to make individual applications to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission for exemption from redundancy payments. The proposal is unreasonable-indeed absurd. It imposes an extra and totally unnecessary burden on small businesses and a degree of uncertainty that at the end of the day is just acceptable. The Labor Party's expectation is that small business owners should jump through hoops to deal with the bureaucracy of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The reason for doing so is to restore an exemption that should never have been removed in the first place. Small business owners have neither the time nor the money to devote to such a farcical system, a system which previous experience has shown just does not and will not work. Such a system has been in operation for larger businesses for around 20 years; in all of that time there does not appear to have been a single exemption granted. The Labor Party is once again failing small businesses in Australia in a deplorable and absolutely abysmal way. While at least the ACTU's support for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's decision is understandable-it is after all a morally bankrupt institution-I find the Labor Party's slavish following of the ACTU's position repugnant. It should be noted that this bill will not affect any redundancy pay provisions that were in awards prior to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's decision. Nor does the bill prevent small businesses from reaching an agreement with their employees on redundancy payments should they wish to and should they be able to afford to do so. Rather, the bill extinguishes an entitlement which previously did not exist and which small businesses were unable to plan for. By introducing this bill, the coalition is going some way to deliver on its re-election promise to continue to pursue changes to take the unfair dismissal laws burden off the back of small businesses and protect small business from redundancy payments. In my view, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission seriously underestimated the adverse impact its decision would have on an unimportant sector of the Australian economy. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission's imposition of a ‘one size fits all' regulation flies in the face of economic reality and small business imperatives. It also very seriously ignores the fact that small businesses simply cannot afford the financial burden it has imposed upon them. I wholeheartedly support this bill and recommend it to the House.",29
7,Mr TICEHURST,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I would like to dedicate my speech on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Small Business Employment Protection) Bill 2004 to the memory of Clive Macness, who passed away in February this year. Small business people in my electorate of Dobell cannot afford an increase in the cost of running their businesses-nor can the Central Coast economy. That is why I am here today debating this important bill. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting Small Business Employment) Bill 2004 proposes to amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to maintain the exemption for small business from redundancy pay by overturning a recent decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to impose redundancy pay obligations on small business. If this bill is not passed, hundreds of businesses in my electorate will be required to make redundancy payments to their employees, which will result in the loss of many permanent jobs on the Central Coast. It will make the lives of small business people unnecessarily harder and will make them more reluctant to give new apprentices and disadvantaged groups like unemployed people the opportunity of full-time work. The Australian Labor Party does not understand this. The Labor Party, which is beholden to union bosses, does not understand that small business is the biggest contributor to employment there is and needs to be supported for the future prosperity of our region. Small businesses need greater flexibility, because they do not have the same access to financial and human resources as larger businesses do. Unplanned expenses can threaten the viability of businesses and, importantly, the jobs of those working in those businesses. You can only pay people out of profit. The AIRC ruling is essentially a $190 million tax on the restructuring businesses need to undertake regularly just to survive. The Australian Labor Party simply cannot purport to support permanent jobs and then oppose this important legislation-and, in doing so, oppose much of the significant workplace relations reform that has taken place over the last decade. Strangely enough, the Labor Party's own policy concedes that many small businesses should be exempted from redundancy pay. It has proposed an ‘exemption' system, in which affected small businesses can apply to the AIRC to be exempt from redundancy payments. The times when small businesses are forced to retrench people are typically times when their financial resources are stretched. It is absurd to expect that small businesses in that situation will have the money and the time available to run a case before the AIRC to have them exempted. The small Labor Party does not really care about the challenges facing small business. The truth is that, by opposing this bill as well as our reforms to right of entry laws, unfair dismissal and compulsory union membership, the ALP is showing Australia that it is indifferent to non-union businesses and job creation. I will take this opportunity to read a letter from a man named Phil Dulhunty, who wrote to me about the turmoil union bosses put his company through, eventually forcing him to sell his hard-earned business to a foreign company. I worked for this company in the late 1970s and early 1980s, so I experienced first-hand the havoc caused by bullying union bosses. The letter states: My consideration for Unions was totally destroyed when my company in Wyong was ‘invaded' by the Storemen and Packers Union under the leadership of a fellow by the name of Simon Crean. My company, Dulmison, was founded by 3 ex servicemen in 1947 at the end of the Pacific War, using their deferred pay as initial capital. Over some 40 years, through hard work and enthusiasm the company grew to a size where we employed some 350 people and had a turnover of $50m. We established a large export market for our products in the electric power transmission industry. We manufactured and supplied all the fittings and equipment for the major 500kv grids of Victoria and NSW. We had established factories overseas in NZ, Thailand, UK, USA and South Africa and became the largest international supplier of these products. Because we had a factory in South Africa we came into the spotlight of the union movement who decided eventually to apply secondary boycott so that we could not ship any goods nor receive any from overseas. Mr Crean became incensed when he learned that none of our employees in Wyong were members of neither his union nor any other union. We were a decentralized manufacturer and most of our employees were local residents, country people, conscientious and hard working. There was a great esprit de corps amongst us all, managers, owners and workers. We invited Mr Crean and his men to visit and address the company employees and to recruit them into his union. Not one person was interested or prepared to join and the union representatives were invited to leave. This is what then led to the secondary boycott and the smashing of headlights of our employees' the company car park! Our company, all our employees, the Wyong district and the nation as a whole suffered immensely from this action. The union leaders had absolutely no concern for anything but themselves. As a result of Mr Crean's action the Dulmison company, proudly Australian owned, had to be sold, eventually to an overseas company and is now owned 100% by Tyco of USA. If any political party is beholden in any way to support the union movement at the expense of the broader national interest, it will be to their doom along with Australia as a Nation. If the Labor Party is ever to get my vote again, they must reorganize the union movement or disassociate themselves entirely from it. Mr Dulhunty is perfectly right. As it stands, 71 per cent of Labor members of parliament have union links, which is scandalous when you consider that average union membership in private industry is only 17 per cent. If the Australian Labor Party are serious about wanting to govern Australia, they need to understand what small Australian businesses need. What they need are laws that support them. Labor must support this legislation and put jobs in my electorate first, particularly permanent jobs. They can no longer support legislation that hinders non-union businesses and, in so doing, impedes jobs. The AIRC's decision is severely flawed. It is significant to note that none of the four state governments that participated in the AIRC test case supported the removal of the exemption. The Queensland and Western Australian governments opposed the removal, while the New South Wales and Victorian governments neither supported nor opposed it. With a background in small business I understand what the AIRC ruling means for small businesses in the electorate of Dobell. cars in A typical retail small business with seven employees, each with six years of continuous employment, would, under this ruling, face a contingent liability for redundancy pay of nearly $30,000. I know that there are business operators in my electorate who have taken a risk to provide some wealth for their families and are struggling, with their homes and their assets on the line. Forcing small businesses to make redundancy payments will serve only to push these businesses into insolvency. It is vital that opportunities for continued growth and job creation for the 1.4 million small businesses in Australia be maximised. It is even more essential for the 3.3 million people employed by these businesses. The Howard government is the only government that is consistent and strong in its support for small business. It recognises that the biggest threat to jobs growth in Australia is the unnecessary impediments which make it harder for small businesses to employ people. I encourage members to dissociate themselves from the union movement and instead put small business and jobs in my electorate and across Australia first and foremost. I commend this bill to the House.",32
8,Mr ANDREWS,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Menzies-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (9.56 am)-I thank all members for their valuable contribution to this debate on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Small Business Employment Protection) Bill 2004. While I understand some of the concerns raised, I sincerely hope that the opposition will finally join with the government and stand up for small businesses and their employees by supporting the key measures that are proposed in this bill. This bill will ensure that small businesses with fewer than 15 employees that are covered by federal awards are not burdened by redundancy pay obligations. It will amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to maintain the exemption that has been in place for small businesses from redundancy pay and it will legislate to address the Australian Indussmall trial Relations Commission decision of 26 March last year. As honourable members know, the government introduced this bill to parliament on 8 December last year. Since then there have been a number of key developments that have further strengthened the case for this bill. These developments have made it increasingly obvious that the Industrial Relations Commission's decision to impose redundancy pay on small business was a mistake that must be addressed. I am of course referring to the fact that, since the bill was first introduced, two state industrial relations tribunals have issued rulings rejecting union claims to adopt the AIRC's decision and remove the small business exemptions in their states. In December last year the full bench of the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission rejected for a second time a claim by the Queensland Council of Unions to remove the small business exemption. It first rejected the claim in October 2003. In its most recent decision the full bench declined to adopt the AIRC's decision and instead reinforced its original decision. It stated: There are substantial reasons for a small business exemption and we again adopt those reasons referred to in our previous decision. The Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission also refused to adopt the Australian Industrial Relations Commission decision in April this year, rejecting a claim by the Trades and Labour Council of Western Australia to impose redundancy pay provisions on the small business sector in that state. Rejecting the union's claim, the Western Australian commission stated that they were ‘required to evaluate the evidence according to its weight and not merely adopt the conclusion of the AIRC'. The decision particularly relied on witness evidence that business as a whole is inherently riskier than larger business and that small businesses have more difficulty in obtaining finance when required. Two industrial relations tribunals were strongly urged by unions to accept the reasoning of the AIRC decision. Both refused to impose redundancy pay provisions on small business. The cumulative effect of these decisions has produced an untenable situation across Australia. Employees of small businesses located side by side can now have widely different redundancy entitlements, depending on whether they are covered by a state or federal award-in fact, employees of the same small business that is covered by a federal award and a state award can have significantly different entitlements. This situation is totally unsatisfactory and we believe it demands legislative action from this parliament now; yet our Labor colleagues would have this uncertainty and confusion for small business continue indefinitely. This is an irresponsible stance to take for both employees and employers. As well as protecting jobs, this bill will provide small nesses and their employees with consistency and certainty. During the debate on this bill, we have heard from several Labor members about the incapacity of some small businesses to make redundancy payments. We now know that Labor accepts that the AIRC's decision does not adequately protect small businesses that cannot afford redundancy pay. The Labor Party also accepts that many small businesses need to be exempted from redundancy pay. The Labor Party acknowledges that the AIRC's decision as it stands will not achieve this. The only real difference between the government and Labor on this is how to go about protecting small businesses that cannot afford redundancy pay. The government's answer is clear and simple, and it will work. Our bill will exempt small businesses from new redundancy pay obligations and will enable employers and their employees to negotiate redundancy pay through workplace bargaining where a small business can afford it and it is a priority for employees. In contrast, the solution proposed by the member for Perth in his second reading amendment is for the government to ‘adopt mechanisms to address those individual businesses with a genuine incapacity to make redundancy payments'. The member for Perth elaborated that the government should ‘find mechanisms to assist those small businesses which genuinely cannot afford to make redundancy payments'. He said that the ‘process for small business employers to demonstrate an incapacity to pay should be readily accessible and simple' and that they should not have to go through ‘expensive, time-consuming processes' to prove incapacity. This is the same alternative that Labor put forward over 12 months ago, except that, at that time, Labor wanted a Senate inquiry to find the mechanisms, not the government, busiand they suggested that electronic lodgement of applications might be the way to go. At least our Labor colleagues have learned since then that electronic lodgement already exists, has been tested and has been proven to be a complete failure in overcoming the notorious ineffectiveness of the incapacity to pay processes. I would have thought that, in the intervening 12 months, Labor might have been able to develop some specific proposals of their own, other than a wish for a simple and inexpensive process. It goes without saying that we all want all processes to be simple and inexpensive. The incapacity to pay mechanism envisaged by Labor will not work. The incapacity to pay process is not capable of protecting small businesses from redundancy payments. I am surprised that Labor again put forward incapacity to pay processes as some kind of bandaid solution. It is particularly surprising given the recent developments in Queensland and Western Australia that I have just outlined. Both the Queensland and Western Australian industrial relations commissions had the option of using incapacity to pay processes to address the very real financial burden which small businesses would face if redundancy pay obligations were imposed on them. In fact, the unions argued before both commissions that this would be the appropriate way to deal with small businesses which could not afford redundancy payments. So why did both the Queensland and Western Australian commissions reject these arguments and refuse to remove the small business exemption? It was because the evidence resoundingly shows that incapacity to pay processes do not work. The evidence also shows that the lack of financial resilience found in small businesses means that the only real option for this important sector of our economy is to retain the exemption for small businesses from redundancy pay obligations. Our Labor colleagues know this, yet they persist along the same worn track. One can only wonder why. I note that some members believe that this bill undermines the authority and independence of the Industrial Relations Commission. I reiterate that legislation is the only possible option available to government to overturn this decision of the commission. On 3 April 2004, the Prime Minister publicly announced that the government would legislate to overturn the commission's decision to impose redundancy pay obligations on small businesses under federal awards. The government sought and obtained a mandate on this issue at the subsequent October election. By delivering the Howard government a majority in both houses of parliament, the Australian people have made it clear where they stand on this issue. Australians realise the importance of protecting the job-generating capacity of small businesses and they have chosen to re-elect a government that will not only protect existing jobs but encourage and support new jobs growth. Labor members have also argued that the bill goes further than just overturning the decision of the Industrial Relations Commission and that the government is bulldozing its way into state industrial relations systems. That is simply not true. Test case decisions of the AIRC hold enormous weight within the various state industrial relations systems. The Western Australian commission confirmed this when it handed down its redundancy decision earlier this year. While the commission rejected the general removal of the small business exemption, it left the way open for unions to mount cases to remove the exemption from individual awards. In doing so, the commission noted that ‘the decision of the AIRC will, in our view, be of considerable weight in such claims'. This is a very real possibility in other state jurisdictions as well. To properly stop any further adverse consequences as a result of the decision, it must be prevented from flowing to state jurisdictions. The bill will achieve this-no more and no less. Throughout the debate on the bill, Labor members have tended to focus on the supplementary decision of the Industrial Relations Commission, seemingly believing that the decision is some kind of magic cure-all for small businesses-but of course it is not. The member for Perth is correct that the supplementary decision reduces the immediate burden for small businesses, but that is all it does. In the longer term, the decision changes nothing. After four years, small businesses would suffer exactly the same cost burden as they would if redundancy pay were introduced in full immediately. If small businesses were to spend the next four years accumulating the massive reserves necessary to fund potential redundancy payments, as suggested by Labor, instead of using the funds to employ people and expand their businesses, the impact on employment and the economy would be devastating. To summarise the government's position, this bill underlines the government's strong commitment to the small business sector, which it recognises as the job-generating engine of the economy. I call on the opposition to show the same level of commitment by supporting this important legislative amendment.",34

10,Mr ANDREWS,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Menzies-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (10.07 am)-I present the supplementary explanatory memorandum to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Small Business Employment Protection) Bill 2004 and I move the government amendment as circulated: (1) Schedule 1, item 9, page 7 (lines 9 to 20), omit the item, substitute: 9 Transitional-eligible instruments Item applies to eligible instruments with small business redundancy pay requirements just before commencement (1) This item applies if, just before the commencement of this Schedule, an eligible instrument contained provisions requiring some or all (the affected employers) relevant employers that employ fewer than 15 employees to pay redundancy pay. Eligible instruments that began to provide for small business redundancy pay between 26 March 2004 and commencement (2) If: (a) the eligible instrument was made before 26 March 2004 and just before 26 March 2004 the eligible instrument did not contain provisions requiring the affected employers to pay redundancy pay; or (b) the eligible instrument was made on or after 26 March 2004; then, from the commencement of this Schedule, the provisions do not have the effect of requiring any affected employers to pay redundancy pay. Eligible instruments where Federal award suppressed a small business redundancy pay requirement that was present just before 26 March 2004 (3) If: (a) just before 26 March 2004, the eligible instrument contained provisions requiring the affected employers to pay redundancy pay; and (b) only because of a Federal award, the provisions did not, just before the commencement of this Schedule, have the effect of requiring a particular affected employer to pay redundancy pay; then the provisions do not, at or at any time after the commencement of this Schedule, have that effect in relation to the particular affected employer. Eligible instruments where certified agreement or AWA suppressed a small business redundancy pay requirement that was present just before 26 March 2004, and a Federal award would also have had that effect (4) If: (a) just before 26 March 2004, the eligible instrument contained provisions requiring the affected employers to pay redundancy pay; and (b) just before the commencement of this Schedule: (i) only because of a certified agreement or an AWA, the provisions did not have the effect of requiring a particular affected employer to pay redundancy pay; and (ii) disregarding the certified agreement or the AWA, the provisions would still not have had that effect, and this would have been so only because of a Federal award; then the provisions do not, at or at any time after the commencement of this Schedule, have that effect in relation to the particular affected employer. Eligible instruments where small business redundancy pay requirement was present just before 26 March 2004 and a future Federal award starts to apply (5) If: (a) just before 26 March 2004, the eligible instrument contained provisions requiring the affected employers to pay redundancy pay; and (b) neither subitem (3) nor subitem (4) applies; and (c) the eligible instrument contains the provisions from the commencement of this Schedule until a later time (the award time) when a particular affected employer becomes bound by a Federal award; and (d) the Federal award applies in relation to some or all (the affected employees) of the particular affected employer's employees to whom the requirement to pay redundancy pay relates; then, from the award time, the provisions do not have the effect of requiring the particular affected employer to pay redundancy pay in respect of the affected employees. Definitions (6) In this item: eligible instrument has the meaning given by subsection 167(1) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 as inserted by item 5 of this Schedule. Federal award means an award under the Workplace Relations Act 1996. relevant employer has the meaning given by subsection 167(4) of that Act as inserted by item 5 of this Schedule. A key aim of this bill is to maintain an exemption for small businesses from the obligation to make redundancy payments by overturning the Australian Industrial Relations Commission decision of 26 March 2004. The bill, as introduced, will amend the Workplace Relations Act to, firstly, prevent the Industrial Relations Commission from including new small business redundancy pay provisions in federal awards and, secondly, prevent the flow-on of the commission's decision by precluding the imposition of new small business redundancy pay obligations by state laws, state awards and state authority orders in respect of small businesses that are corporations and by territory laws in respect of all small business. The bill, as introduced, also contains transitional provisions cancelling small business redundancy pay obligations contained in federal awards and state and territory industrial instruments that were made on or after 26 March 2004 and before the commencement of the bill. However, the bill, as introduced, does not prevent a state law, a state award, a state authority order or a territory law made before 26 March 2004 which contains a small business redundancy pay obligation that was previously suppressed by a federal award from springing up to fill the gap when a federal award no longer provides for small business redundancy pay. The proposed government amendment to the bill addresses the lacuna in the bill, as introduced, by substituting a new item 9. This amendment will simply ensure that, to the maximum extent of Commonwealth power, small businesses respondent to a federal award that previously exempted small business from redundancy pay are not subject to new redundancy pay obligations as a result of other changes proposed in the bill. I commend the amendment to the House. Question agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading",37

17,Ms GILLARD,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"The Health Insurance Amendment (Medical Specialists) Bill 2005 implements changes to the prerequisites for the recognition of certain medical specialists and consultant physicians. The changes will remove separate processes that these medical practitioners must undertake currently to access Medicare. Currently there are three ways in which medical practitioners can apply to the Health Insurance Commission to provide Medicare services. The processes vary depending on the circumstances. If a medical practitioner is domiciled in Australia, if they are a fellow or if they have a relevant qualification from a specialist medical college, they are able to seek automatic recognition. This recognition occurs after the Health Insurance Commission receives confirmation from the medical college that these qualifications have been satisfied. Consultant physicians and other medical practitioners that do not meet these criteria must seek recognition through the Specialist Recognition Advisory Committee. These committees are established in every state and territory and meet every two months to perform this task. They are appointed by the minister. All other medical practitioners not domiciled in Australia must seek recognition through a ministerial determination. The government sees these committees as redundant because they rely on the advice of the specialist medical college. They have the effect of delaying recognition for the purpose of Medicare because the committees meet only every two months. This bill proposes that, in their place, this recognition will come from a delegate of the minister in the Health Insurance Commission. This bill tidies up an administrative process associated with the recognition of medical practitioners for the purposes of Medicare, and Labor supports this. However, the bill demonstrates that the government is happy to fiddle with extraneous elements of our medical work force policy but the government is not happy to look at the big picture and focus on the larger and longer term issues facing the sector. It is no mystery that the minister with carriage of this bill in this place is Minister Abbott. As we know, the government is happy for Minister Abbott to fiddle around the edges of health policy. But the truth is that today the core of health policy in this country is being driven by the Treasurer entirely through the premise of what health costs and what savings can be made. Minister Abbott has counted himself out of the health debate and out of any substantial role in driving health policy in this country because he has positioned himself absurdly by saying that there should be no reform at all in health. This might strike people as a remarkable position, given that everybody knows that this nation, along with all other Western developed nations, will experience huge cost pressures in health over the coming few decades. Part of those cost pressures is attributlenges able to changes in demographics with the ageing of our population. That means that there will be more people in the older age ranges needing a significant draw-down on health services. Then there is the challenge of the financing, as the dependency ratio changes and there are fewer taxpayers engaged in the work force to generate taxation revenue to meet the needs of the ageing population. The cost pressures in health do not end there. We know that our society, along with all other Western developed countries, is facing a significant increase in the burden of chronic and complex diseases, which has huge implications for health expenditure. In addition, we know that there are significant cost pressures from innovative pharmaceuticals and new technologies. All of that adds up to a substantial challenge that the government needs to manage with a reform agenda. The purpose of that reform agenda must be to ensure that we are constantly improving health, from the point of view of those of us who receive health services and preventive health messages and of those we are relying on to manage our health. We want to improve the system for those who rely on it, but we also want to improve its productivity and efficiency. We want to relegate to the dustbin of history the big proportion of waste that is in the system now. That degree of waste has been estimated by experts to be in the vicinity of $1 billion to $2 billion annually. We know that having frail aged people accommodated inappropriately in public hospital bedsbecause there are no aged care places, respite care places or rehabilitation places for them to go to-wastes around half a billion dollars a year. So there are big reform challenges facing this country, as we look at our current health system and seek to eradicate waste and to drive productivity and efficiency and as we look to the future to manage the chaland the cost pressures that this nation will undoubtedly face. In the face of that complex debate and the complex set of choices about what Australia should do next to make sure that our health system serves us better today and continues to serve us well 10, 20, 30 to 40 years down the track, Minister Abbott has decided just to step out of the way. It is too hard and he does not want to know. He is wandering around saying-and this was published last week in the newspapers-that there is no need for reform. He has, in fact, shrugged his shoulders and said, ‘What does it matter if health expenditure moves from around nine per cent of our national income, nine per cent of GDP'-which it is now-‘to around 15 per cent?' ‘What does that matter?' Minister Abbott says, with a shrug of the shoulders. To give the House an idea of how much that matters, in today's dollars the difference between nine per cent of GDP going on health and 15 per cent of GDP going on health is $51 billion. If in Minister Abbott's version that $51 billion is to be taxpayer dollars, it will increase the tax burden on every Australian taxpayer by around $4,500 per year. So, when Minister Abbott with a shrug of his shoulders says, ‘Who cares? It does not matter if it goes up to 15 per cent of GDP,' he is contemplating a system where this government would need to increase the tax burden on Australians, on average, by $4,500 a year. This government, which already runs the highest taxing government in Australia's history-a big, bloated government-would increase the tax burden of every Australian taxpayer by $4,500 a year. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that in question time last week we had some interplay about this. When asked about Minister Abbott's speech about this new fiscal burden and about the weight it would put on taxpayers' shoulders, Treasurer Costello frankly conceded that he had not read the speech. The day afterwards, when the matter came up by way of interjection, as I recall, he said that he had tried to read the speech but had fallen asleep at the second paragraph. I guess there is no mystery why Treasurer Costello would fall asleep trying to read Minister Abbott's speeches. It might be because they are boring-and I am sure that is part of the explanation-but, beyond that, Treasurer Costello knows that he does not have to trouble himself with what Minister Abbott says. What Minister Abbott says does not matter because Treasurer Costello is actually in control. But sooner or later Treasurer Costello will have to say to Minister Abbott that he does care if the amount spent on health floats from nine per cent of GDP to 15 per cent of GDP. In fact, concern about those sorts of questions led to the Treasurer publishing with the budget papers two years ago the Intergenerational report. One of these days Treasurer Costello will have to explain to Minister Abbott that it probably is not on the Howard government's agenda to put taxes up by $4,500 per taxpayer just so Minister Abbott can stand by watching the passing parade of health generate increased health expenditure. I think it was at the point of that byplay question time last week that Minister Abbott was shrugging his shoulders and saying, ‘Well, it doesn't have to be taxpayers' dollars.' But, if that is right, Minister Abbott's solution to increased cost pressures in health will be to say, ‘Well, health expenditure will float from nine per cent of GDP to 15 per cent of GDP,' and then presumably he will say, ‘But we won't be putting up government expenditure; we'll hold government expenditure around where it is.' So presumably that difference of $4,500 will fall on Australians as private expenditure. Either way you cut Minister Abbott's speech, it is a pretty dark view of the future: where you stand by, engage in no health reform and do absolutely nothing-except fiddle around and watch health expenditure go up as a percentage of our national incomeand then somehow Australians pay the bill. There are only two choices: they will pay the bill through their taxes or they will pay the bill through their private expenditure-there is nowhere else the money can come from. That is Minister Abbott's view of the future. It is an absurd view. One should not get paid for being health minister for taking such a lackadaisical approach. If in truth the Howard government now views Minister Abbott as so incompetent that the only thing he can do is fiddle around the edges and bring bills like this into the parliament-but do nothing else-then really it is time that he was replaced, rather than have him sit in this House masquerading as the health minister while Treasurer Costello is really doing it all and doing it all through the prism of cost cutting. One of the biggest issues that need reform-and obviously it is squarely raised by this bill-is the crisis we have in Australia's medical work force. I use the language of ‘crisis' advisedly, because any Australian who lives in an outer metropolitan or rural in and regional area-and I am sure Minister Kelly at the table has probably had some experience with this-will tell you about the problems of getting access to the right medical practitioner when they need to. They will tell you about the shortage of GPs and the shortage of specialists. That means that people are waiting for care because there are simply not enough people in the medical work force or-perhaps more disturbingly still-they are not getting care at all. Particularly in the GP primary-care end of the spectrum, it is very likely that people are putting off going and getting the preventative health checks they know they really should have. But, if accessing a GP is problematic and expensive and so people are not having those preventative health checks, that is going to show up in the future as an increased burden of disease. We know from the statistics that over the 30 years to 2001 the rate of growth in the number of medical practitioners was faster than the rate of growth of the population generally, but in the 1980s and 1990s this rate of growth slowed. At the end of 2002 there were nearly 22,000 primary-care practitioners employed in Australia, of which 64 per cent were male and 34 per cent were female. The majority of the group-about 87 per cent-are vocationally registered GPs, who are essentially Medicare-licensed GPs. We need to remember that amongst the first actions of the Howard government was a cut in the number of GP training places, so where we are with the work force balance now has in part been driven by Howard government cutbacks. Apart from the cutbacks another thing that has put a great burden on our primary-care system and has hugely exacerbated the shortage of primary-care practitioners is the changing nature of the medical work force, particularly the changing nature of the number of hours that GPs now work. Deputy Speaker Lindsay, I am sure that you are aware that the historic image of the GP was of a man who could work almost an endless number of hours, relying on a non-working wife to attend to all matters associated with the family. We know, of course, that that hisof toric image of the GP does not accord with modern day reality, where many GPs are women and where many men who are GPs want to work fewer hours than their historic counterparts, because they have working wives and they have a view about workfamily balance. This means that out of the raw number of GPs that we train we actually get fewer full-time equivalent GPs because each GP on average is working fewer hours. So an important measure of the medical work force is full-time equivalents. Measured in full-time equivalents, there are 101 full-time equivalent primary-care practitioners per 100,000 people in Australia, based on a 45-hour standard week, which is a decrease from 108, which was the statistic as recently as 1997. Apart from there being fewer GPs as a whole and apart from the changing nature of the medical work force compounding there being fewer full-time equivalent GPs, we also know that our health work force is ageing. About 39 per cent of people employed in health are aged 45 years or more, up from 31 per cent in 1996. The proportion of workers aged 45-plus increased faster for females than for males, which reflects the fact that our nursing work force is rapidly ageing. We know that there is a global shortage of GPs and, coming back to Australia's situation, we know that there is a national shortage of GPs. We also know that this national shortage is compounded in outer metropolitan and rural and regional areas by problems of maldistribution. We are short of work force numbers overall and the work force we have tends to be clustered closer to the centre of our bigger capital cities rather than being in outer metropolitan and rural and regional locations. This is very important-and I am sure Minister Kelly at the table would agree with me in this-because we know that one-third Australians live in rural and regional areas and that generally these Australians have a higher mortality rate and higher health risk levels than their counterparts in the city. This is due to a greater tendency to develop chronic illness, which is due to the likelihood that people will be working in physical employment, in occupations such as farming, mining and forestry, which can be more hazardous-not to mention the fact, of course, that our Indigenous communities are also concentrated in many rural and regional areas. In 2002 the AMA commissioned Access Economics to investigate the extent of the shortage of GPs that we will face in the future. I have to say that their results are tling. They found that there is a declining participation rate by GPs. They found that female GPs, who form an increasing proportion of the work force, and younger GPs, both men and women, are only prepared to commit to a working life of well under the 50 to 60 hours per week traditionally worked by GPs. They found that Australian medical schools are not graduating enough doctors and they found that the GP work force shortage has been greatly exacerbated by the Howard government cutbacks to GP training places. In 2001 Access Economics estimated that the overall shortfall of GPs in Australia was between 1,200 and 2,000 full-time equivalent GPs. The rural shortage was estimated at 700 full-time equivalents and the urban shortage at 500 full-time equivalents. Confronted with that knowledge, you would think that a responsible government that was competent rather than incompetent would be spurred to act, but we really have not seen anything profound being done in the medical work force area; we really have not seen anything except an increasing reliance on overseas trained doctors. We understand that in the current circumstances overseas trained doctors have an important role to play in our medical work force. There is no doubt about that. But it cannot be a strategy for the long term that we rely on importing doctors, nurses and other medical professionals. Why? The world is short of doctors, nurses and other medical professionals. Other developed countries have the same problems we have. They also have medical work forces which are ageing, and they too are looking to be net importers of staff for their medical work forces, so there will not be enough health and medical work force staff to go around. It is a pretty unseemly vision of the future for us to say that, year in, year out, we will sit idly by, as the Howard government is instarcompetently doing now, and not train enough Australian doctors, Australian nurses, Australian dentists, Australian radiographers and so on and so forth and then we will go into the global market and see if we can poach them from somewhere, most likely a developing country that needs them. But that is the Howard government's vision of our future medical work force, unless we do the right thing now-that is, provide a major package to increase the number of Australians we are training for our health and medical work force. It really is very simple. This should be about training and skilling Australians who want to be in our health and medical work force, rather than importing skills-and we will not be able to import them in the longer term, because of global competition. There is a fashionable view, in particular in the nursing area, that we end up importing because no-one wants to be a nurse anymore. That is not true. Every year thousands of appropriately qualified Australians who want to be doctors, nurses, dentists or radiographers-indeed many of them throughout their whole school life have aspired to work in our health and medical work force-are turned away because there are not enough training places. And then, further down the track, what do the Howard government do? They say: ‘Too bad. We'll turn those Australians away, and now we'll desperately fossick around the world and import people.' We have brought here many highly skilled overseas trained doctors who have made a major contribution to our health system, and I do not want to be seen to be saying anything other than that. But we also know that we have had some big problems in terms of the recognition and quality of skills amongst some overseas trained doctors-the most spectacular example of this, of course, having been in Bundaberg in Queensland. We would be better off on a whole series of levels if we were training Australians and training them now, so that we could be nationally self-sufficient in our medical work force. That does not mean no-one will ever migrate, because human life is partly about people travelling overseas, getting overseas working experiences and perhaps falling in love with someone overseas. Australians will migrate overseas for those reasons and overseas doctors will come here for those reasons. But we should not be in a position where we are out in the international market, desperate to recruit doctors because we simply do not have enough. There is another major issue on which this government, Minister Abbott style, shrugs its shoulders, wanders around and never gets anything done. It is an issue this government needs to address. It talks a fair bit about it but never translates that talk into policy action. That issue is the question of regulation of specialists by specialist colleges-in particular their ability to restrict the supply distribution of specialists. It might strike some as a grand irony that, in an environment where this Howard government is contemplating-and, indeed, is undoubtedly going to put into this parliament-a package of extreme industrial relations changes, all of which are about breaking down workers' rights and the trade union movement, it can take a different stance when it comes to looking at questions relating to our medical work force. It has struck me that way. The Howard government can take that stance in relation to the work force overall-when it comes to shop assistants, cleaners, factory workers, farmhands and all the people who make up our work force-but, when it comes to looking at questions relating to our medical work force and, particularly, to the way specialist colleges control the supply and distribution of specialists, it does not want to know. If a craft union restricted supply and training places, the Howard government would raise the issue in question time and it would think it was a big scandal. But it sits around doing very little-indeed, precious little at allwhen it comes to the fact that we have a major problem-not having enough specialists-and part of that problem has been driven by work force restrictions on supply and distribution from specialist training colleges. That might strike you as a controversial statement, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, but the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission came to the same view when it looked at this area. It is an area that needs to be addressed. If we can train the right number of specialists and provide specialist training places in regional hospitals, then the specialists trained in those hospitals are more likely to locate there over the longer term than to cluster around our central business districts. Consequently, it is an important part of government policy to ensure that we and are training the right number of specialists and that those training places are distributed in an appropriate pattern across Australia to meet our needs. That can be done whilst ticking every box in relation to the quality of the training experience. I am certainly not suggesting that quality should be lost in this process-quality can be maintained-but there is a degree of supply and distribution restriction which is artificial, which is not about quality and which has to be challenged in the interests of all of us who will rely on getting timely access to health services at some point in our lives. We might well be resident in an outer metropolitan or rural or regional area when we need access to those health services. Our ability to access those health services will be compromised unless we look at these questions. There is no magic to the fact that where we have undertrained the people we need, where we have not addressed the distribution questions and where our overseas-trained doctors end up in regional or remote areas, where they can be least supported and monitored, we end up with situations like the Bundaberg situation, where someone was not properly accredited and where no other doctors were working alongside him monitoring and addressing quality issues. It is no surprise that we end up with the sorts of problems we have seen spectacularly in Queensland. The Productivity Commission is currently working on the medical work force issue. It is to be hoped that its report lifts the lid the long standing regulatory and structural elements of the medical work force issue. We need to do that in the interests of all of us who rely on health services. As well as looking at the questions of total numbers trained and distribution, we have to take a sophisticated look at who is going to do what within our health system. This should be driven fundamentally by improving the quality of our health system. There is no doubt that as modes of care change and as technology changes who can do what in our medical work force will change as well. When we first worked out how to do blood pressure tests, only a doctor could take your blood pressure. Now in a world where blood pressure checks are routine, where the technology to do it is easy to use-I am sure we are all familiar with having the band wrapped around our arm and having our blood pressure taken-those sorts of checks can be done by nurses, for example. That is one example of a pattern of change that applies right throughout our health system. As technologies which were innovative become routine, they can be best used by someone in the health and medical chain who is not necessarily at the professional end which first introduced those new technologies. So there is a question there that we need to address about the balance in our health and medical work force. If you go to Canada, Mr Deputy Speaker-and I am quite sure you would like to do that on some occasion-I would recommend that you go to the royal college in Ottawa and talk to the Canadians. When you talk to the Canadians about this matter, you will find that the medical profession is driving this debate about substitution because they want doctors always to practise at the highest skill end and to shed to other medical professionals things that those other medical on professionals can do. They are driving that debate from a quality point of view, not only for the patient but also in regard to the quality of the doctors' working lives. None of this is addressed in any way by the Howard government at this time. Minister Abbott just wanders around shrugging his shoulders in the face of these very complex issues because they are beyond him. Maybe Treasurer Costello will address this issue post the Productivity Commission report. I now move the opposition's second reading amendment, which raises some of these issues: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for failing to: (1) address the medical workforce shortage affecting our rural, remote and outer metropolitan areas; (2) invest in the future of the medical workforce and its over reliance on importing skilled medical practitioners; (3) show leadership in the area of the uniform standards for medical professionals; and (4) address the impact that regulation of medical professionals by the colleges has on supply and distribution of specialists”.

18,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,Is the amendment seconded? Ms Hall-I second the amendment.,49
19,Mr FAWCETT,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I rise to support the Health Insurance Amendment (Medical Specialists) Bill 2005. I am glad to see that the member for Lalor raised the issue of the role of the Treasurer and the health minister working in partnership. It is important to highlight the fact that the spending on health and ageing has doubled since 1996 under the Howard government, and it is not through inefficiency; it is through bringing in some of the very measures that the member for Lalor was talking about-things like MBS items for practice nurses who can support doctors and provide some of their services. I was in a surgery only two weeks ago in Salisbury North in Wakefield and hearing from the doctors how that move alone had made the practice viable into the future. So I am glad to see that we agree that some of those initiatives are good. They are taking place with the Treasurer's support of the health minister, who is making Australia's health care system-as is recognised internationally and by the state and territory leaders in Australia-a good and improving health system. However, I do acknowledge that there are inequalities between parts of our population which the overall statistics mask. I speak particularly of people of lower socio-economic status and those who live in rural and remote areas and outer metropolitan areas, where there are higher rates of morbidity and mortality. The causes of this are complex and diverse but ultimately they come down to the issue of access to medical care by skilled people-both general practitioners and specialists. As I address the Health Insurance Amendment (Medical Specialists) Bill 2005 I will touch briefly on some of the measures brought in by the Howard government to address work force shortages in outer metropolitan and regional areas. Firstly, I welcome the initiatives that seek to attract medical professionals to practise in areas of work force shortages and the incentives to increase bulk-billing rates. I have visited practices in Whytes Road, which I spoke about, in Salisbury North, and I have seen how these measures have made a real difference to the viability of these services. The doctors who run these services talked about how the additional payments to practice nurses have enabled them to provide services on a sustainable and viable basis without raising charges to the people who access health care services. While there are some incongruities in the way the areas of work force shortage are defined, which I am pushing to have addressed, these measures have already made a real difference to people in the outer metropolitan areas of Wakefield. I have also met with those who are involved with health professionals or who are affected by their availability in the country areas of Wakefield. I am indebted to the work of Dr Steve Holmes and Dr James MCLennan, both of Clare. Not only do these men and their colleagues tirelessly serve the needs of their community on a day to day basis but they have the passion to make the time to help me as their representative understand the issues that affect the delivery of health care in country areas. More importantly, they do not just complain about problems; they actively seek to develop solutions. I am happy to support initiatives that aim to support and improve the health of those who live in the bush and which include components that encourage the recruitment and retention of an adequate work force that is equipped with the range of skills necessary to deliver the services and procedures to communities that are remote from the easy access to tertiary medical services that so many take for granted. These people are much more likely to be involved in procedural work, such as obstetrics, and emergency services, such as looking after folk after accidents. Where there is no hospital support, they will have to manage these cases with the resources they have to hand and without the backup of hospitals, imaging services or other health professionals who can complement their care. Given the geographic distribution of the population of Australia, and certainly in the electorate of Wakefield, these specialist level skills will not be available in regional areas on a sustainable basis unless the doctors who provide the general practice care can also give health promotion and disease prevention advice, can care for people during the births of children and have the knowledge and skills to care for people through all of life's events, even their palliative care. With the diversity and depth of knowledge required in the working life of a doctor, the doctor no longer really fits the standard nitions of specialty groups. The doctor has become something more than a GP with a specialist interest, such as HIV or sports medicine-he has become a practitioner of rural and remote medicine which, in essence, is a speciality all of its own. The recognition of rural and remote medicine as a medical specialty is not a further process of subspecialisation; it is about returning the ery of patient care of rural and remote patients to a specialty level. The important thing to note is that training for this is not provided in a coherent way by any other medical college in Australia, so I support the moves toward establishment of a rural and remote medical register as one of the first steps toward the outcome of a better supply of medical practitioners for rural and remote Australia. This bill proposes to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 to streamline the procedures under which certain medical specialists and consultant physicians are recognised as eligible to provide services that attract a Medicare rebate. I welcome this as another initiative which removes barriers to the timely provision of quality health care for the people of Wakefield. The reason for this amendment lies in the current cumbersome and time-consuming process through which some medical practitioners are recognised as specialists or consultant physicians for the purposes of Medicare. The amendment does not bestow specialist or consultant physician status on medical practitioners. The practitioners are identified as specialists or consultant physicians by medical boards when they are registered on the advice of specialist medical colleges. There are three ways that this process works at the moment. Firstly, applicants can seek automatic recognition if they are domiciled in Australia, they are a fellow of a specialist medical college and they have a reledefi- vant qualification from the college. Secondly, they can go through the alternative method of recognition, which is what this bill addresses, by Specialist Recognition Advisory Committees. This is currently the only pathway for the recognition of consultant physicians, including rehabilitation specialists and psychiatrists. These committees are established for each state and territory and delivmeet every two months. Thirdly, medical practitioners who do not live in Australia at the time of application can seek recognition through a determination of the minister. This bill affects the second option, which is referral through the Specialist Recognition Advisory Committees. This was necessary in the past and provided a structure for the assessment of specialists who are not eligible for automatic recognition. Since these committees were established, special medical colleges and state and territory medical registration boards have been developed. They have implemented assessment processes that are now used by the Specialist Recognition Advisory Committees to make their determinations. This is essentially a redundant administrative layer to the recognition process and unnecessarily extends the period between the registration of specialists and the provision of services that attract the Medicare rebates that are needed by the people of Wakefield. Following the passage of this bill, it tended that the decision-making powers of these committees will pass to the delegate of the Minister for Health and Ageing in the Health Insurance Commission. This has the potential to streamline application processes by avoiding the necessity for specialists to meet the cut-off for that two-month cycle. In conclusion, this bill represents a minor change to current procedures. The objective of this change is to reduce the complexity and the time involved in the recognition of medical specialists and the provision of Medicare rebates to patients. I welcome and support this bill as another initiative, albeit minor one, that will benefit the health care of the people in Wakefield who live in outer metropolitan and regional areas.",49
20,Ms HALL,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I find it rather surprising that the previous speaker, the member for Wakefield, failed to pick up on the excellent amendment moved by the shadow minister for health, because that touched on some of the real problems that exist within our health system-problems that, if fixed, would really help the people in the electorate of Wakefield. In speaking to the Health Insurance Amendment (Medical Specialists) Bill 2005, I would like to associate myself with the comments made by the shadow minister for health and also state how pleased I am to second the amendment moved by her. That amendment touches on issues that are very important to the communities in the electorate of Shortland that I represent in this parliament. I have to say at the outset of my contribution to this debate that it is most unfortunate that the Howard government has failed the people in Australia when it comes to health. I do not think there is any other area where there is more evidence that the government has failed. We have a situation where we have got rising health costs, where a greater percentage of the GDP is being spent on is inhealth, where the cost to people throughout Australia of purchasing health services and paying for private health insurance, which this government is so committed to, is increasing and where the cost of pharmaceuticals is increasing. There is an increase in costs in every area of this country's health system. I hate to say it, but I really feel that the government has failed to recognise the key drivers of this situation and to address these issues. These issues are a symptom of a health system that is under enormous pressure and teetering on the brink of disaster. We cannot allow that to happen, because so a many people in Australia depend on a strong health system. The government should resolve these issues and not blame other people for their failures. They blame the states, and they refer to the fact that the problem of the increased costs in health are to do with the ageing population. You name it-the government will find some reason to abrogate their responsibility in this area. After those few introductory comments, I turn to the legislation before us, which implements change to the prerequisites for the recognition of certain medical practitioners and consultant physicians. The changes will remove separate process these medical practitioners must undertake to access Medicare rebates. It will not affect the registration process that these professionals must undertake to be recognised as specialists or physicians by their relevant medical boards. I am going to talk a little bit more about specialists later in my contribution to this debate. As previous speakers have pointed out, currently there are three ways in which medical practitioners can apply to the Health Insurance Commission to provide Medicare rebatable services. Firstly, a medical practitioner who is domiciled in Australia and who is a fellow or has a relevant qualification from a specialist medical college is able to seek automatic recognition. This recognition occurs after the HIC receives confirmation from the medical colleges that these qualifications have been satisfied. Secondly, consultant physicians and other medical practitioners that do not meet that criteria must seek recognition through specialist recognition advisory committees, established in every state and territory, which meet every two months. Thirdly, medical practitioners not domiciled in Australia may seek recognition through ministerial determination. The government sees these committees as redundant because they rely on advice of the specialist medical colleges and have the effect of delaying recognition for the purpose of Medicare, because the committees only meet two monthly. This legislation seeks to change that. This recognition will now come from the minister's delegate in the Health Insurance Commission. I think that anything we can do to streamline the system to make recognition quicker is a good change. As the shadow minister pointed out, we will not be opposing this legislation but we have moved an amendment, which I am going to talk about at some length. The amendment will also apply to consultant physicians so that they have an avenue for applying for recognition for the purpose of Medicare. So this legislation will make a very minor change in that area. But, unfortunately for the people I represent in this parliament, I do not believe it will make any real difference to the services they get, to the availability of those services or to the fact that there is a chronic shortage of doctors and nurses within the Shortland electorate. The Shortland electorate basically covers two areas. The first is the Central Coast, which has had a chronic shortage of general practitioners for a long time. The Central Coast urban division of GPs have been lobbying the government and I have been working with them to try to get more doctors to move to the Central Coast, but unfortunately no action that this government has taken has done anything to alleviate that situation. The Central Coast has an ageing population and it is also an area that has many very young people living in it. It is an area that this government has failed when it comes to providing adequate medical services. It does absolutely nothing to change the situation that exists there. The fact that we have a shortage of GPs and specialists in areas like the Central Coast was recognised in a report brought down by the Productivity Commission. It identified that we have a real problem with a medical work force shortage, and it does not begin and end with GPs but it is an area that is causing a lot of difficulty both on the Central Coast and in Lake Macquarie. The Lake Macquarie part of the electorate is an area that, for a long time, was not under the same level of pressure that the Central Coast was under. For a long time. I would be talking to people on the Central Coast and hearing about how an age pensioner or a veteran had to wait for up to three weeks to get an appointment with their local doctor. I would hear about how GPs had closed their books and how people moving to the Central Coast were not able to see any GP at all. Or I would hear how there was a nursing home bed empty because we could not find a GP who would actually supervise the person who was desperately in need of moving into that nursing home or high-care residential facility. The person needed the support that they would get there but, because there was no GP who would oversight them, the bed would remain empty. The change is that now that is happening in the Lake Macquarie part of the electorate. With the ageing work force, in a significant number of suburbs in Lake Macquarie, we have had doctors retiring because, as has been mentioned previously in this debate, we have an ageing medical work force. We have doctors with their books closed. In our office, when we have rung around all the GPs within the local area trying to access a GP who can supervise a person who is in a nursing home, it has taken us some two weeks to find someone to take on as a patient a person in one of the local nursing homes. This causes anxiety not only to the person who needs the doctor but to their family. They know how important it is for their relative spouse to have the care of a general practitioner. Within the suburb of Belmont, quite a few doctors have retired recently. People living in that area are now unable to access doctors. Their doctor has retired and a large segment of the population no longer has a general practitioner. They are the kinds of issues that are affecting real people every day. On the Central Coast, people are waiting long term-up to three weeks-to see a doctor. People are unable to go into nursing homes because they cannot get a doctor to supervise them. In Lake Macquarie, doctors are retiring and people are left without a doctor. Previously they had a doctor, but now the doctor has retired. It has an enormous impact on those communities. It also has an impact on the local public hospitals. People who cannot see a doctor in the community are going to the local emergency department and waiting for some hours to see a doctor. This is a health issue. If people do not get the proper medical treatment, their condition can be exacerbated. This also leads to more serious illnesses that have greater costs to our health system. Linking into the fact that we have this problem with a shortage of doctors is the issue of overseas trained doctors. I have a few issues that revolve around that. Firstly, I believe that this government has a commitment to train young Australians to be doctors. Under this government, there has been a reduction in the number of training places for doctors and nurses. I know from my own community that there are many young people who would embrace careers as doctors or nurses. Unfortunately they are turned away from the universities every day. The importing of skilled doctors and nurses from overseas has a downside. For me, one of the issues is an ethical issue-the fact that quite often these doctors are trained or in developing countries and their skills are needed there. Many of these doctors come from countries that put a lot into training them. They get them to a level where they have a high level of expertise. Then we encourage them to move to Australia. I see that as quite an issue for doctors coming to Australia. It is important to mention also that there is a chronic worldwide shortage of doctors, nurses and others-you name the profession-within the health sector. Rather than draining resources from other places throughout the world, we should be investing in our own work force. We should be investing in the young people that are leaving school. We should be making sure that our own young people have the ability to get the skills and training that they need. We should not be abdicating our responsibility there. It is very important to put on the record just how vital it is that, as a we want to thrive and grow, we have to develop the skills and expertise within our country to do so. We have to develop them, not bring them in-not take them from somewhere else. I have quite a problem with the government on that issue. There is another issue relating to overseas trained doctors. We have some excellent overseas trained doctors. Within my own electorate some of the most skilled doctors are overseas trained doctors. But there have been some problems in the area of overseas trained doctors. Obviously, the most highly publicised has been the case of Dr Patel in Queensland. I put on the record that the New South Wales government has tightened the approval and checking procedures for overseas trained doctors. That is a result of the inquiry that took place in Queensland. The New South Wales system has checks and balances. It has panels of doctors interviewing GP applicants, specialist colleges interviewing specialists, supervision once the registration is approved and a move to more stringent checking of credentials. Most of these overseas trained doctors go to areas of need. Quite often the patients they deal with have serious and significant illnesses, and the doctors need to have a very high level of skill and a high level of support. I do not see that this legislation does anything to help in that area. The government has an obligation to all the people living in rural and regional areas, where the resources are scarce, to ensure that there are proper procedures in place and to look at the issue in the way that the New South Wales government has. The government needs to be putting in place some changes and working with the state governments so that that there is some sort of uniform system and a wholeof-government approach. That is one thing that this government fails at very badly. I think that is because it likes to have someone nation, if to blame when things go wrong. Finally, I would like to touch on the issue that the shadow minister touched on: the failure to address the impact that the regulation of medical professionals by the colleges has on the supply and distribution of specialists. Within my electorate, and I am sure within the electorates of all members of this parliament, there are specialty areas where there is a significant shortage. These shortages are created, to a large extent, by the fact that the colleges will not allow more specialists to be trained in a specific area. I see this as anticompetitive behaviour. The restrictions that are being put in place by the colleges are affecting access to specialists by people throughout Australia. Unless the government takes some action to address this then it will escalate and there will be a further shortage of specialists, which will mean that it will be harder for people to see specialists when they need to. The government needs to get real about health. It needs to show leadership. It needs to address the real issues out there in the community-the real issues associated with a skilled work force. It needs to make sure that all Australians can that access health care when they need to.",51
21,Dr WASHER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I agree with the previous speaker, the member for Shortland, that we need to keep the focus. The Labor Party has now realised that the shortage of nursing and medical professionals in this country is of major importance to the government, and obviously to them as well. It is not just the Health Insurance Amendment (Medical Specialists) Bill 2005 that addresses that issue; many bills have been passed before to try to address that major problem. The situation has, from my perspective, certainly improved from what it was a couple of years ago. I think the Minister for Health and Ageing has done a tremendous job in realising that. The basis is that the way to achieve that must be that we have a mutual understanding that we want quality, affordable and available doctors. not measured by the rates of bulk-billing, so I am glad there is some measure of maturity now to understand that. Competition is great and we want more of these people. We are getting more nurses and we are using them in a much more effective way. This bill represents a minor procedural change to the Health Insurance Act 1973. It will streamline the procedures for the recognition of certain medical specialists and consultant physicians so that their patients can access Medicare rebates at the specialist or consultant physician rates. Currently, a medical practitioner is recognised as a specialist for Medicare purposes via one of three pathways. The first pathway is automatic recognition. Applicants can seek an automatic recognition if they are domiciled in Australia, have fellowship with a specialist medical college and have the relevant qualifications from a specialist medical college. Recognition is then provided by the Managing Director of HIC, following advice from a relevant specialist medical college that the criteria have been met. The second pathway is alternative recognition. For those Australian-trained medical practitioners who are unable to meet the criteria for automatic recognition, an alternative pathway is available. In the alternative pathway the minister's delegate must refer the medical practitioner to an appropriate state or territory specialist recognition advisory board. State and territory specialist boards are administered by the Health Insurance Commission and meet every two months. The Minister for Health and Ageing appoints committee members from panels of nominees put forward by the relevant professional bodies and colleges. For those medical practitioners who are seeking recognition as consultant physicians-which are a subgroup of specialists with qualifications as physicians, rehabilitation specialists and psychiatristsIt is this is the only pathway for recognition. The third pathway is for non-domiciled medical practitioners. Medical practitioners not domiciled in Australia at the time of application may seek recognition through a determination of the Minister for Health and Ageing. Applications for temporary residents were previously considered by an overseas specialist advisory committee. These committees were abolished in July 2004. The government was able to do this administratively because there was no mention of the overseas specialist advisory committees in the act. The government is abolishing the specialist recognition advisory committees for much the same reason that the overseas specialist advisory committees were abolished-the committees have become redundant. Since the committees were first established, specialist medical colleges and medical registration boards have been developed and they have implemented assessment processes which are used by the specialist recognition committees in making their determinations. That the specialist recognition committees have relied on the assessment advice of specialist medical colleges and medical registration boards in making their decisions means that the specialist recognition committees have become a redundant administrative layer in the processing of applications. This unnecessarily extends the time between the registration of specialists and when they provide services under Medicare. According to an official at the Department of Health and Ageing, the HIC is reporting that, since the abolition of the overseas specialist advisory committees, it has been processing applications within a shorter time frame than was previously the case. Applications are now usually processed within 28 days, as opposed to the previous time frame of two to three months. It is intended that decision-making powers of the disbanded specialist recognition advisory committees will pass to the delegate for the Minister for Health and Ageing in the HIC. This will streamline the application processes for special recognition by avoiding the necessity to meet cut-off dates for applications to the cialist recognition advisory committees and then wait for up to two months for the committees to meet. The amendments proposed in the bill include the recognition of consultant physicians domiciled in Australia in the alternative method of recognition. Because the specialist recognition advisory committees have been the only means by which medical practitioners could be recognised as consultant physicians, disbanding these committees would remove the provision for them to become recognised. To correct this, consultant physi- many. cians will be included along with specialists in the alternative method of recognition. Transitional arrangements have been provided to ensure that specialists and consultant physicians previously recognised by the specialist recognition advisory committees will continue to be recognised under Medicare. Arrangements have also been made to allow the delegate to immediately consider existing applications with the specialist recognition advisory committees at the time of abolition. This bill involves minor changes to existing procedures. The objective of these minor changes is to reduce the complexity and time currently involved in the recognition under Medicare of medical specialists and consultant physicians seeking to enter the Australian medical work force. Before concluding, I implore all Australians to understand that there have been difficulties with only a very few overseas trained doctors. The large bulk of overseas trained doctors who I have had experience the with are excellent doctors. I commend them and ask the Australian public to trust them and to enjoy the care that they can give them. I commend this bill to the House.",54
22,Dr LAWRENCE,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I am pleased to speak on the Health Insurance Amendment (Medical Specialists) speBill 2005 today, although I think it tinkers with a very serious set of problems. Changing the processes by which medical practitioners are registered is welcome, except insofar as it may give the Minister for Health and Ageing greater discretion to make some of the errors that we have already seen occur in this field. However, it is worth taking the opportunity to talk about medical work force planning more generally, because this is a serious problem which requires attention from this government and from all the key players-of whom there are sadly far too I want to start by briefly talking about the inflation in health care costs in Australia, which, as a former health minister, I regard as scandalous. The health minister has now taken to boasting about the dramatic increases that we have seen in Commonwealth health expenditure. Previously, that would have been seen as a matter for criticism of a Commonwealth minister. In question time last week he said that, since 1996, which is when this government took office, health spending has increased from under 15 per cent to over 20 per cent of the federal budget. The federal budget has grown enormously, so that figure is large. He went on to say: Since 1996 federal health spending has increased from 3.7 per cent to 4.3 per cent of gross domestic product. That is not counting the increase in state expenditure. He boasted that this year the federal Health and Ageing portfolio will spend $44 billion. Frankly, if this rate continues, will bankrupt the nation. We are headed for US levels of expenditure, which are around 14 per cent of GDP, without any improvement in health outcomes and with very little investment in health care promotion and illness prevention. It is no wonder that the Treasurer has tried to rein in the health minister and has made him look like a liar in relation to the safety net. It is fair to say that Australia could once boast about its moderate, middle-of-the-road levels of health expenditure and its internationally enviable health outcomes. Now we have one of the highest rates of health cost inflation in the developed world and nothing more to show for it in health outcomes than higher out-of-pocket costs for ordinary Australians; pronounced inequality in access to benefits-it is the wealthy who are benefiting from the 30 per cent rebate and safety net; soaring medical incomes, which I suppose they would welcome; and private hospital profits. At the same time, we have seen public hospitals under pressure, with growing waiting lists because of the movement of doctors to higher incomes in the private sector. I underline that because it is a serious problem in Australia. To confirm this, just last week the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed that the fees for health practitioners increased by 44 per cent between 1998-99 and 2004-05. I bet that, with the introduction of the so-called safety net, that fire has been stoked even higher. For those who purchased private health insurance, premiums have increased by 7.9 per cent this year-nearly eight per centand this is the third year in a row that they have increased by more than seven per cent. In the same period, gap payments to doctors increased by 19.2 per cent. By any indicator, this is roaring health cost inflation. There is now clear evidence-and this is importantthat the increase in private hospital activity he has not taken the pressure off public hospitals. Indeed, there is evidence to the contrary. We are spending $2½ billion a year on the rebate, and an additional amount that we cannot exactly estimate on the safety net, to purchase no additional benefits in the public hospital system. We are spending a lot of money as individuals, through private health insurance premiums, and as taxpayers, so what is happening with the medical work force? You would think we would be purchasing more, and better qualified, medical practitioners who are better able to provide services for Australians, but I do not think that is happening. Neither do I agree with some of the panic-stricken nonsense that is being written about this in sections of the press. As indicated by researchers from the Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine at Monash University, perceptions of the adequacy of the Australian medical work force veer from predictions of surplus to warnings of shortage with a frequency that is somewhat perplexing. Sometimes, it really does seem to depend on who you ask. Back when I became health minister, the excess provision of medical services was a concern, but shortages are the concern at the moment. Media interest is mainly in the shortage of GPs in country areas, of which there is real evidence. There is maldistribution of medical resources and services in this country. But less attention has been given to what I think is, in the long term, a more serious trend, and that is the lack of specialists, especially in public hospitals. Australia is short of doctors to work in the public hospital system. Many public hospitals are now saying that they are having great difficulty in recruiting doctors and keeping them. When you look at the surveys that have been done, it is obvious that we need more specialists in general medicine, radiology and geriatric medicine. In Australia we have an enviable record of work force planning. We were at the forefront of medical work force planning. To some extent it involves trying to peer into future, so it is beset by the inevitable diffigrandfathers culties that poses. Nonetheless, a lot of work has been done through the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee and the cooperation of state governments. I will not go through that history, but it is only a decade long. It has recently been reviewed-in my view, appropriately-and recommendations have been made to improve its operation and, in particular, to look at some areas where work force planning has ignored the trends we should be examining. I now want to talk about the current state of the work force. It is worth remembering that health and community services is the fourth largest employment sector. It is an area in which reform of the work force is much needed, but the government have not undertaken it. In fact, the government have stepped back from it; for the most part, they have eschewed it. Health is Australia's largest industry. It is worth $80 billion per annum, or nine per cent of GDP. It is worth observing that labour costs account for 70c in each health dollar. As at the 2001 census, the sector employed almost 800,000 people, or nearly 10 per cent of the total work force. It is worth observing that, as is the trend elsewhere, 40 per cent of people in this sector work part time. We have seen steady increases in all categories of health practitioners except enrolled nurses, whose number has declined substantially-a surprising outcome in many respects. Between the 1996 census and the 2001 census, we saw a 12.6 per cent increase in the number of medical professionals. More women are employed in the sector, particularly as medical practitioners, but all doctors work, on average, fewer hours than in the past. That may be partly because they are older and taking a bit more time off, but increasingly it seems that younger doctors are refusing, quite reasonably, to work the the unreasonable hours that their fathers and were prepared to work. I have pointed to the fact that there is a maldistribution in this work force and that it is difficult to get medical professionals to work in country and remote areas. What is driving the change in our health system at the moment? We have seen unprecedented changes in the supply of and demand for medical practitioners. Some of these factors have not been taken into account in work force planning. The government has been remiss in not looking at the drivers of demand. Why is the demand for health services continuing to grow? Why are we seeing a lot more procedures being undertaken, particularly in the private sector? Why are people visiting doctors more often? Are these visits actually improving their health or simply adding to the cost burden for the community? A good health minister would be asking these reasonable questions and not simply boasting about the inflation in health care costs. We do know that demand continues to grow. Some of that demand is for services that some people would regard as unnecessary. Consumers are empowered, but sometimes they are ill informed. This government says nothing about consumer education. Are people in the Australian community victims of some of the disease-creation stories that we have heard about-particularly ADHD, which must be the most overdiagnosed condition among young children, who are then being medicated at extraordinary levels? The government has shown no interest in consumer education and in improving the knowledge base of the community at large so that parents, for instance, can make some reasoned judgments about what sort of care is needed. The ageing of the community will generate additional demand, but again I suspect the government is prepared to just let that run out rather than look at ways of managing the health care needs of older people in ways which do not necessarily require additional surgery at every turn. Technology is a driver as well. Again, the government has taken very little interest in making sure that the appropriate technology is applied, and not just the most expensive technology available at the time. These are the things that are driving demand for services and, in particular, the demand for more doctors. The government has shown some interest in the supply side, including in this bill, but has not really paid close attention. Obviously something you could do would be to attract, retain and recruit people who can work in these fields. One of the things that I know was under examination when we left government in 1996 was the failure of the specialist colleges to pass very high numbers of people who were training for and applying for specialist positions. One particular college that I will not name, in a state that I will also not name for fear of embarrassing it, was notorious for not passing the next specialist in that field until the last one had It maintained very close control over the number of people who worked in that field. It was a very closed shop indeed, and the Productivity Commission showed considerable interest in looking at these restrictive practices. When the conservative government took office, it very quickly changed that emphasis. But it still demands attention, because some of the colleges pass only 50 per cent of the applicants. These are the brightest of the bright. They typically go through school and university with very few failures. The ones who graduate from medical schools are certainly capable of passing into the specialist colleges but very often it takes them several tries. As I said, the pass rate in some colleges is as low as 50 per cent and the range is very often between 50 and 65 per cent. The other thing this government has shown no interest in doing is actually increasing the productivity of the existing work force, extending the working life of practitioners and getting a better work-life balance. Some of those people-and this includes nurses-who are having to leave the profession altogether for quite long periods of time would be better able to maintain contact and involvement if there were better practices in our hospitals. In some cases we need to be replacing doctors with other it health professionals, and the government has shown little interest in that. It is flirting with the idea of using more midwives, for instance, in the area of obstetrics to perhaps bring us up to the same level as that which occurs in other parts of the world. Why do we have these apparent shortages in the system and why is there concern about them? There is some argument that we have not produced enough doctors, and you will hear that from the conservatives particularly. There have been some increases in student numbers-they take about 10 years to died. emerge into the profession-and there have been proposals to attract more specialists from overseas. I think the last is fated to fail because everyone is looking for more medical specialists. In my view, one important problem is the lack of supervision. A lot of young doctors are poorly supervised and often left without resources, especially late at night, and in many cases, I think, that leads them to pull back into other fields of medicine than are required to be practised in our hospitals. They are poorly supported and very frequently overworked. In the case of those people who are coming from outside Australia, the same problem applies, because they need periods of supervision in order to pass the necessary exams. As we have seen spectacularly in Queensland, but I am sure it is not the only place where it has happened, qualifications can sometimes prove to be fraudulent. I mentioned earlier the restrictions by leges on pass rates, restrictions which are inevitably going to produce fewer doctors than is desirable. We are also seeing competition from overseas. We are losing doctors. It is not something that is talked about very often, but a lot of our brightest and best go overseas to get additional specialist training and sometimes to do research, and we are not doing very much to try to attract those people back. They can often earn considerably more out of Australia, which is why I think the idea that we can simply get more doctors from overseas is fated to fail. We have seen changes in work practices, too, which have produced shortages. As I said, young doctors now do not want to work 60-plus hours a week in the public hospital system. They want a life outside medicine. They have families and other interests. And, of course, more women than men are graduating, and they do not work as many hours while trying to balance their family responsibilities. But it is very clear that the tals themselves-and this minister has not shown much interest in this issue-really do not have a good hard look at their own work force practices. It is difficult for doctors and nurses alike to find part-time and familyfriendly conditions, and that has led many to move from career medicine, which was familiar in the past, to the casual medical work force. They earn more in two days than their colleagues undertaking specialist training earn in a week, so they become permanent locums. They can have a life and they can earn an income, but it is not particularly good for the hospital system. One of the things that we have seen-and the government is entirely responsible for this-is growth in the private system as a result of the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate and the safety net. Some people obviously regard that as a good thing, and colindeed this government has argued that it is. But what happens is that you have the movement of specialists from the public system to the private system. They can earn more in the private system because they can charge more, and there is less complex medicine and surgery to be undertaken, so they are under less pressure. But unfortunately there is little or no training of specialists in the private system-it still continues in the public system-and, as we have seen, there is very clear evidence that that additional expenditure has not resulted in less pressure on the public system. I think the jury is definitely in on that. Every bit of research that I have read shows quite clearly that, while there has been an increase in the number of procedures in the private system, there has been an increase in waiting lists and waiting times in the public system and an increase in the complexity of care required, with more doctors being placed under pressure. One rehospiviewer put it this way. He said that many doctors are ‘losing their commitments to and engagement with the public hospital system'. I think that is a tragedy, not least because those highly paid specialists contribute to the future education of doctors, particularly by providing for the supervision of doctors in their specialist programs. For the most part, they are not separately paid for that. I have touched on poor work force management in hospitals. I will give a couple of examples from the work that John Menadue did. He reviewed the literature and interviewed a whole lot of people working in the public hospital system in New South Wales and in South Australia. He concluded, as Professor Goulston did, that the work force management in most of our hospitals is rigid and antiquated; that job sharing is rare; that working hours are inflexible; that leave is frequently scheduled to suit the employer-a common occurrence for many people, it has to be said; that there is poor supervision of junior staff with high levels of responsibility, particularly on weekends and after hours; and that medical staff are forced to perform many clerical and non-clinical duties which others could easily undertake. Part of that is the result of another contributing factor to these shortages: unduly rigid role definitions. It is a part of our force where everybody has a highly specialised task and no-one is allowed to move over the boundary-or very infrequently allowed to move over those occupational boundaries. In my view, the medical work force needs to be redesigned and some duties need to be moved from doctors to other health professionals. In June, COAG finally acknowledged the need for health work force reform-it was pretty belated-and there will be a report from the Productivity Commission at the end of this year. I hope it addresses some of those restrictive practices which in other parts of the work force would be condemned. In the review that John Menadue conducted, he argues that we must train and employ in quite new ways in the medical work force. Most work force reform, as we know, has been in the blue-collar area, and some of it has not been reform but simply change. Menadue estimates that if anything like that level of reform were undertaken in the health area the potential productivity dividend could be as high as 40 per cent. In other words, we would not have shortages of the kind we are currently experiencing. Midwifery is the classic example, where in Australia less than 10 per cent of births are managed by midwives. That is lower than the 50 per cent in the UK and the 70 per cent in the Netherlands, and New Zealand, of course, has taken some very significant steps to involve midwives in care. The descriptions by senior academics and clinicians who were interviewed by Menadue-I have mentioned a couple-are, I think, instructive. They described an archaic work structure that was incoherent and rigid. They said that no-one owns work force issues and that there is a lack of coordination and teamwork. One went so far as to say that there is not a work force shortage; the issue is how we use the work force. Menadue in work his reviews, which I commend to the House, holds up the example of the UK pilot of a new generic health care practitioner who combines the role of junior doctors, senior nurses and allied health professionals and looks at patient care as the key driver. That person is required to assess the patient's condition, to do the physical examination and diagnostic tests, to establish a treatment plan and to manage and monitor that plan; to break down the old work force boundaries. It is about multiskilling-a word we do not hear very often in the health work forceabout broadbanding and about teamwork. There is a lot to be done to improve health work force practices, despite the resistance that I know will be shown by some sections of the medical profession. Doctors typically do not like to see their territory invaded or their incomes diminished. As Menadue put it, powerful sectional interests still call the shots and resist change. I think it is time this minister took some control.",56
23,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"Order! Before I call the next speaker, the parliamentary secretary has indicated that he wants to raise a procedural matter. The member for Fremantle might want to wait while we deal with this. Mr Billson- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Fremantle's generally thoughtful and intelligent contribution had a turn of phrase in it that I fear was unhelpful and probably unwelcome. In reflecting on the economic forecasting in, I believe, the intergenerational work, she suggested that the figures she contested may start to make the owner of that work look like a liar. I notice that turn of phrase has been used for the last four years in this House and only once in the Senate over that same time when quoting a letter. I would ask you to consider whether standing order 89 or standing order 90 is infringed upon by that turn of phrase. I understand context will matter, but I would like it not left standing as though that is an acceptable turn of phrase that we could start to see more of in this place. I would like you to reflect on that.",61
24,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I thank the parliamentary secretary, and I thank him for the manner in which he raised this. I did hear the member use those words and, in my view, in the context they were not unparliamentary; otherwise, I would have interrupted and said something about it.",62
25,Dr LAWRENCE,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,I would not have said them if they were.,62
26,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I acknowledge the member for Fremantle's remarks. It is possible, certainly in some circumstances, that that phrase could be unparliamentary. If you said this person has acted in a manner that has created an impression, it could in context be unparliamentary, so I am not ruling that it is a phrase that anybody can use in any circumstance. I simply rule that in the context used by the member for Fremantle it was quite in order. I thank the parliamentary secretary for raising this and for the manner in which he raised it.",62
27,Ms LIVERMORE,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"The Health Insurance Amendment (Medical Specialists) Bill 2005 has a very laudable purpose. Cutting red tape to streamline the process to allow specialists to provide their services under Medicare is certainly commendable and we support it on this side of the House. The bill constitutes a measure by the government to streamline the way in which medical specialists can be recognised to be eligible to provide Medicare not rebated services. This will allow some medical specialists to become eligible for recognition in a shorter time frame than is currently the case, where you have specialists waiting for up to two months for this recognition. The streamlining of this process will allow patients to benefit from having a Medicare eligible specialist sooner rather than later. Unnecessary red tape restricts access to specialist medical providers, and we have seen that that is one area in which the Liberal government generally excels. The members opposite have proved themselves to be champions of red tape. We saw it with the GST and we saw it most recently with small business, especially with regard to super choice-thanks to the work of the member for Watson in his former portfolio, which highlighted that. We saw it with the child-care rebates, amongst a host of other areas. So, when a bill comes before the House with the purpose of cutting red tape, I am supportive but also sceptical, especially when it comes to health, because when it comes to health in Australia under the Howard government the cutting is normally done to services. The list of services that this government has abolished or reduced funding for is ever increasing, and the government has made a name for itself over the past nine years as a mean-spirited government that cares more for the minority who are well off than the majority of the population who rely on these government services. Let us not forget that this is the government that cut the Commonwealth Dental Health Program in 1996. This was a good program that had been assisting low-income Australians with quality dental health care ever since it was introduced by the Keating Labor government. In June this year I rose in the House and lamented the loss of the Commonwealth Dental Health Program and the effect it was having on my electorate. I gave the real life example of just one of the victims in my electorate after the abolition the program, which has sentenced hundreds of thousands of Australians to years on waiting lists for necessary dental treatment. This is despite the fact that the Commonwealth Dental Health Program was so effective that even the current Minister for Health and Ageing was forced to admit that in fact the program did cut waiting lists when it was in place. At the last election, Labor committed $300 million towards reinstating a program similar to the Commonwealth Dental Health Program, which would have slashed waiting lists and cleared backlogs for the 500,000 Australians waiting for dental treatment every year. But perhaps the worse cuts from this government are the cuts to training places for medical professionals, which have led to a situation where Australia is simply not self-sufficient in providing the health professionals that we need to meet the demands in the community. The resulting skill shortage is yet to have its full effect, but at the moment the effects are pretty unpleasant. On 11 August, the local Rockhampton paper, the Morning Bulletin, had a story about a local resident, Mrs Eileen Condon. The story states that, six months ago, Mrs Condon was referred to a specialist regarding a cataract covering her left eye. When Mrs Condon took the referral to the Rockhampton Base Hospital, she was told that there could be a two-year wait before she even got to see the specialist. Mrs Condon is 69 years old and is struggling to get by with her ever-worsening vision. The two-year wait quoted by the hospital is only to see the specialist; it does not include a further wait to actually have the surgery. Sadly, Mrs Condon can no longer do the activities that she once enjoyed. Things like reading and playing hoy have become just two of the activities that Mrs Condon can no longer take part in, and this means that her quality of life is worsening. This of government really does have to take responsibility for some of the shortages that are causing this hardship to people. Stories such as this are becoming more and more common throughout Australia, particularly in regional and rural areas. The current medical work force shortage will continue to worsen until this government takes action and does something about the problem. What kind of message is the government trying to send to people such as Mrs Condon? ‘Go away; you're not important enough for us to worry about. We would rather focus on attacking the union movement.' As most Australians consider health to be their No. 1 priority area, this seems to be very limited thinking on behalf of the government. Australians have the right to be able to see a doctor in a timely fashion. Waiting two years to see a specialist regarding a cataract that covers your left eye almost completely is not timely. What is worse though is the inability to see a specialist at all. This situation is a reality throughout rural and regional Australia. Places that once had specialists have lost them because the specialists have retired and the younger generation are simply not there to take their place. It is not just specialists who are in short supply. My office receives numerous calls each week from constituents who have attempted to make an appointment with a GP in our local area but have been told that the clinic is not accepting new patients. It is becoming harder and harder to see your local doctor because trained doctors are just not available. Constituents in Capricornia are having to wait weeks to see a GP-as I am sure constituents in numerous other electorates are-because the doctors are simply not there in great enough numbers to meet the demand. The government's failure to address the issue of medical work force shortage is not the only area within health that is hurting country. The government has proclaimed itself ‘the best friend Medicare has ever had'. I do not know about you, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, but, if my best friend stated in 1987 that they wanted to dismantle me, I think that would do some pretty serious damage to the friendship. But that is exactly what John Howard has been seeking to do since his time in the Fraser government-to abolish Medicare and totally destroy bulk-billing, which Mr Howard has labelled previously as an absolute rort. Since just before the last election, the rent health minister has been carrying out his own ideological makeover to Medicare. But, like all cosmetic makeovers, the improvements have proved to be illusory. In this case, they only lasted until the Treasurer had his way in the budget. That was when it became clear that the health minister-who had given us the ironclad, rock solid guaranteehad failed Australia on the Medicare safety net, and he is failing the people of Australia again over the medical work force shortage. The health minister and this government are so out of touch with the Australian people that they also do not seem to understand how the minister's botched negotiations over the PBS are going to affect people who rely on this scheme for necessary medications. But the two-tier PBS does not seem to concern the minister for health. The health minister's mishandling of the PBS means that many Australians are now paying more for their medicine. For example, under the minister's special patient contribution, lung cancer patients now pay $460 for the drug Alimta. The special patient contribution, which we did not hear anything about in the last election, also includes three other drugs. But, as we know from this government's track record, this is clearly the thin end of the wedge. Today it is four drugs; later it will be this 20 drugs and so on. The Labor Party would never allow this type of system whereby those who can afford medication get it and those who cannot afford it are left without. Labor created the PBS and we will not stand by and let this government destroy it. Putting the dismantling of the PBS aside, the question remains: why is there a doctor shortage, especially in rural Australia? If we listen to the federal government, it is all the fault of the state governments. Another good one is where the health minister stated that doctors are too selfish to work in the bush. curHowever, the reality of the situation is that this government has been caught sleeping at the wheel over the nine years this problem has been developing. The Howard government has not been training enough doctors. It has cut the number of medical places at Australian universities and, on top of that, it has put a university education out of the reach of many Australians. Individuals who may have been looking into a medical career have been turned off by the ever-increasing costs of a medical degree. The Howard government is pricing Australians out of tertiary education to the detriment of the community. The medical work force shortage that we now have will only get worse as the full effect of these university funding cuts starts to bite. The government's decision to increase HECS fees by 25 per cent will see many students who obtain the university entry score giving up their plans to study medicine or other allied health degrees because they are scared off by the fees. Any student who does continue will not be interested in working in rural Australia. They will have racked up a huge debt through the course of their studies in gaining a degreewhich will ultimately assist Australians-and they will need to work where they can make the most money in order to repay it. For students in Australia, university study is now a situation that requires much soul searching and financial planning. One area of medical specialisation that is hitting my part of Australia-regional Australia-particularly hard is obstetrics. While the Treasurer would like Australians to have more babies, it makes it a little hard when there are no obstetricians around to assist. Many smaller towns in my electorate are without an obstetrician and women are forced to drive many hours to see one. If you live in rural or regional Australia, you had better hope there are no complications with your pregnancy because there is no-one there to help if anything goes wrong. To have their babies delivered, women are forced to drive for hours to a larger hospital. This causes great hardship for families, as expectant mothers awaiting their baby's birth are required to relocate to major centres on the coast, sometimes for several weeks. This is costly and inconvenient, not to mention quite upsetting for many families. It is particularly difficult if there are other children at home. The dad involved is often a shiftworker in the coal-mining towns in my electorate or he might be running a family farm. At the last election, the Labor Party committed $1.5 billion to tackle the medical skills shortage by increasing the training of rural and regional specialists. Labor would have doubled the current amount spent on training in these areas, training an extra 1,000 doctors and 1,800 nurses each year. The Howard government's response to the medical work force shortage is the same as its response to the general skills shortage facing this country-importation of workers. Instead of providing the necessary funding to train Australians, this government wants to import more and more foreign doctors to make up for the shortfall. We have seen some of the results of this policy recently in Bundaberg. This is a government with a history of short-sighted policies aimed only at getting it over the line at election time. But these short-term policies have not helped Australia's ailing health system; rather, they have led to a blow-out in health costs. In the last budget this government made five commitments to health. Two of these simply re-announced election commitments, while another two were the $499 million cutback in the Medicare safety net and a further $1.3 billion cut from the PBS. As I said at the outset, the only thing this government likes to cut is services. It seems that this government and the health minister are totally incapable of tackling the big issues in health. They seem to wander around in a policy void on this issue, hoping the crisis will solve itself. In the meantime, since 1996, out-of-pocket health costs have skyrocketed by over 60 per cent. Patients in Australia are paying more to see a doctor, more for private health insurance premiums and more for medication. The government has ripped $1 billion from public hospitals and then blames the states for the expanding waiting lists. I think everyone in this chamber will remember the Minister for Health and Ageing's assertion that the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate would make private health insurance more affordable for Australians. The reality of it is that private health insurance premiums have simply continued to rise, helped along by the health minister's unquestioning approval of every rise proposed by the private health insurers. In the meantime the private health insurance rebate has done little to assist people in regional and rural areas, who have little or no access to private medical facilities in the first In rural and regional areas like the one I represent, the public health system is the service that people rely on. My office is constantly receiving calls from constituents who are fed up with their private health insurance coverage and premiums. The vast majority of these people end up withdrawing from private health insurance, as the ever-escalating costs far outweigh any benefits. They pay their premiums for services that do not even exist in regional areas and are still left outof-pocket, paying gap fees following even the smallest procedures. It is no wonder they give up. This government needs to get its priorities straight. If only it put in the time and effort towards health and education that it does for ideological crusades against workers' rights and students, we might be able to tackle the issue of medical work force shortages. To live in a regional area and not have access to a medical specialist is living dangerously. It is unfair to deny these basic services to a section of the population that makes an enormous contribution to the prosperity of this country. This government needs to take action to ensure that all Australians have access to proper medical treatment. No Australian should have to sit on a waiting list to see a specialist about a cataract on their eye, let alone have to wait for two years. This government owes people like Mrs Condon, those mothers travelling to see obstetricians and those waiting to have dental treatment, amongst others, an explanation as to why it has allowed this issue to escalate to crisis point in the nine years it has been in charge of our health system. I urge this government to stop placing health in the too-hard basket, to put aside its ideologically driven crusades for a while and to focus on the real priorities for most people in this country-an affordable, quality health system and an education system that trains sufficient Australians to place. meet the demand for health professionals right around this country. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR (Corio) (12.11 pm)-The Health Insurance Amendment (Medical Specialists) Bill 2005 implements changes to the prerequisites for the recognition of certain medical specialists and consultant physicians. The changes will remove separate processes that these medical practitioners must undertake to access Medicare rebates. Currently there are three ways in which medical practitioners can apply to the Health Insurance Commission to provide these Medicare rebatable services. Medical practitioners can seek automatic recognition if they are domiciled in Australia or if they are a fellow or have a relevant qualification from a specialist medical college. This recognition occurs after the HIC receives confirmation from the medical college that these qualifications have been satisfied. The second way is through specialist recognition advisory committees, for those consultant physicians and other medical practitioners who do not meet the criteria that I previously outlined. These particular committees have been established in the past in every state and territory and, at the end of the day, they are appointed by the minister. The other means is, of course, recognition through a ministerial determination. The bill that we have now before the House seeks to streamline the second of these processes and disbands the specialist recognition advisory committees. In place of the disbanded committees will be recognition from a delegate of the minister in the Health Insurance Commission. We ought to make it clear that the bill will not affect the registration process that these professionals must undertake to be recognised as specialists or physicians by the relevant medical boards that oversee the qualifications of GPs and specialists in this country. I must admit up front that I do have an interest in this particular issue because my niece is currently studying medicine; she is in the Northern Territory as part of her course. Nyree O'Connor is a lovely woman and is somebody who will be a great asset to the medical profession in the future. She comes from a rural area, and in my discussions with her she has indicated that she wants to go on and become a specialist in a particular medical area and return to the country to practise. That is a commendable objective of hers. I hope she is successful and one day returns to the country to practise her profession, because rural and regional Australia simply need more doctors. I support the second reading amendment proposed by my colleague the member for Lalor, as elements of that amendment go to the heart of the deep problems that are encountered by my constituents in accessing quality GP and specialist care in the Geelong region. The elements of that second reading amendment are as follows: That ... “whilst not declining second reading, the House condemns the Government for failing to: (1) address the medical workforce shortage affecting our rural, remote and outer metropolitan areas ...” That is a particular issue that I want to take up in this debate, because the Geelong region, as I speak, is some 30 to 50 GPs short, and that is creating enormous problems for working people in accessing appropriate medical services in the Geelong community. Other elements of that second reading amendment condemn the government: “... for failing to: … … … (2) invest in the future of the medical workforce and its over reliance on importing skilled medical practitioners; (3) show leadership in the area of the uniform standards for medical professionals; and (4) address the impact that regulation of medical professionals by the colleges has on supply and distribution of specialists”. These are substantive issues that the opposition has raised in the second reading amendment. They go to the very heart of the incompetence of this government in this area. After nine long years of the Howard government, we have a crisis in our health system. When we look at the government's response in many key areas of the health policy of this nation-and I would not condemn all of the responses of the government-this government has demonstrated that it is out of touch with the needs of ordinary Australians and particularly with the needs of outer metropolitan communities such as mine. If the rising costs of health care for Geelong families were not enough for many of my constituents in Geelong, they have the additional problem of gaining access to GP and specialto give the bill a ist services. The Prime Minister talks a lot about the economic achievements of the government. I am certainly happy to debate that proposition on the floor of this House or in any forum throughout this country, because the Prime Minister periodically gets up in this place claiming credit for economic growth rates that were left to him by the Labor government. He claims credit for an inflation rate which was left to him by the Labor government after we broke the back of Liberal inflation in this country. And on it goes. But I will certainly debate that in another time and place. Here we have very substantive issues relating to the health sector and, as expressed in the second reading amendment, the government has been found significantly deficient in this area of policy. The Prime Minister does not talk much about the rising costs of medical services being encountered by working people, working families, in the Geelong area or talk about the difficulty they are having in accessing even basic GP services in our community. Bulk-billing rates have significantly declined in the Geelong region, and that has imposed a heavy financial burden on Geelong families. The cost of seeing a GP has risen substantially. In September 2003, the last time those bulk-billing rates were published, the rate in Geelong was 58.4 per cent, well below the national average of 67.4 per cent. Medicare safety net costs have substantially increased. Private health insurance premiums have massively increased in Geelong, the home of GMHBA. We have a very high proportion of working families who have taken out private health insurance. They are now paying through the neck for that private health insurance, contrary to the promises that were made by the Prime Minister in this policy area. The Prime Minister and his government have spent a lot of money, ostensibly to prop up the private health insurance industry in this country and to encourage people into private health insurance, on the promise that premiums would be contained. That simply has not been the case-another broken promise from a government that has been in power for nine long years and is out of touch with the real needs of ordinary Australians. With regard to the statistics on GP shortages, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare published in their report Medical labour force 2002 tables that show the distribution of full-time equivalent primary-care practitioners. These are mainly GPs. The AIHW published those tables and rates per 100,000 by state in 1997 and again in 2002. In Victoria those statistics about the full-time equivalent rates showed that the supply of primary-care practitioners declined between 1997 and 2002-albeit slightly, but it is still a decline-from 110 to 106 FTE per 100,000 head of population. When we go behind that statistic, in major cities the FTE rate for primary-care practitioners in 2002 was 105 per 100,000, while in inner regional areas it was 90. For outer regional areas the rate declined further, at 80 per 100,000. And of course it declined even further for remote areas. There are many reasons why we have this shortage of GPs and other health professionals in rural and remote Australia. One reason-and this comes from the report undertaken by Access Economics for the Australian Medical Association-is the intensity of work performed by doctors in regional and rural areas. Those doctors work very long hours, especially after hours. They are on call after they have completed their normal hours and while on holidays. They are really never off duty and they suffer, as a result of that, from accumulated stress and burn-out. There are also reasons related to family conflicts and costs. It is often very difficult for the female partner of a male medical practitioner to gain meaningful employment in rural and regional communities if she is in another profession. There are the normal business difficulties of establishing medical practices as small businesses in rural and regional areas. I am appalled at the news today that the National Party is going to cave in on the sale of Telstra, because, as we know, access to high-quality communications is essential for the development of many small businesses in regional communities. Another factor is lifestyle. Many people who are trained in city environments have difficulty relating to people in rural environments and establishing the social networks that would sustain them in those communities over time. This aspect demonstrates clearly the need for us to take a completely new approach, a different approach, to the training of medical practitioners and specialists. In the context of this debate, I put before this House and the minister a proposal that I hope he is well acquainted with: a Deakin University proposal to set up a new rural and regional medical school for western Victoria, providing some 147 new commencing places-including 120 Commonwealth supported and 24 full fee paying places-per year. The ask of the Commonwealth is some $18 million, to be matched by Deakin University and the state government. I am heavily indebted to Deakin University for providing this fact sheet. I acknowledge up front that I am quoting from that document because the document succinctly states the case and I do not have a lot of time remaining in this debate. The proposal is to set up the first rural medical school in the south of Australia. Its major focus will be on rural medical practice, which will address the significant health needs of non-metropolitan people. This will contribute greatly to addressing the significant GP shortages that exist throughout western Victoria, in particular. The proposal will provide a graduate entry program for mature age students who will already have strong links to rural environments. The proposal offers a distinctive and complementary alternative to the metrofocused regional and rural outreach models that are used now by Melbourne and Monash universities. One of the strengths of this proposal is the partnerships that will be struck with Flinders University, Barwon Health, other health services in the Warrnambool, Colac, Hamilton and Horsham areas and other private and public hospitals and general practices in the region. There will be swift accreditation by the Australian Medical Council through curriculum licensing with Flinders University, and there is a desire to have the first intake of students in 2007. Victoria has a very strong case in this regard for a third medical school, focusing on rural health. For example, there is a regional crisis in the delivery of medical services in western Victoria. Geelong needs 35 more GPs. Warrnambool will need to find 15 more GPs by 2015 just to cover retirements. The estimate for the whole of Victoria is that we are some 500 GPs short. I think it is legitimate to ask why Victoria has only two medical schools when New South Wales has seven medical schools and Queensland four. I note in the chamber today the presence of the honourable member for Kennedy. In mentioning Queensland in that regard, I certainly do not want to downplay the urgent need for GPs and specialists in Queensland, particularly in rural and regional Queensland, which I have travelled around on many occasions. It is important to note in the context of this debate that there are only two medical schools in Victoria, and they are primarily metropolitan based services with an outreach model. What is unique about the one that is being proposed by Deakin University is that this particular medical school will be provided by a strong regional and rural university with a city campus-which is quite different from the others. An important statistic to note is that there are more than 100 Victorians studying medicine interstate, and this is causing some frustration for us in our communities. Western Victoria is ideally placed, Mr Deputy Speaker MCMullan. As you know, Geelong is the fastest growing area in regional Victoria by population. We have fast transport links and new air services, with Jetstar at Avalon Airport. We have a wide diversity of high-quality health services, with a teaching population of some 600,000. So there are very powerful arguments why this facility ought to be located in Geelong. Deakin University is very well placed to provide this medical school because it is a strong regional and rural university with a city campus. It has a network of high-quality student accommodation in major centres across western Victoria. It has a demonstrated high level of performance in health and biomedical research. It already funds a full range of health disciplines-nursing, public health, occupational therapy, disability, health promotion, psychology, social work, forensic and biomedical sciences. It is very important that the minister appreciates that the infrastructure is already in place at Deakin University, in Geelong, to provide this medical school. Powerful arguments have been advanced to support the proposition. At the end of the day, it will address a burning need in western Victoria and Victoria for general practitioners and specialists who come from the country to be trained in the country so that they can go back and practise in the country.

28,Mr KATTER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"Kennedy) (12.36 pm)The Health Insurance Amendment (Medical Specialists) Bill 2005 streamlines the current licensing of specialists to practise. The arguments used by the Minister for Health and Ageing seem to be quite valid and acceptable. Because the SRACs rely on the assessment advice of specialist medical colleges and medical registration boards to make their decision, the committees have a redundant administrative layer in the processing of applications. That would seem to be a very tight intellectual argument that all of us are who are intelligent-or despite our intelligence-should accept. I think it is important in this debate to the House a quick sketch of our situation in North Queensland. We are climbing up to close to one million people. In Australia's population of 20 million, one million of those live in North Queensland. In a survey of doctors some years ago in the Gulf midwest and Mount Isa-that north-west slice of Queensland-only eight of the 28 doctors were Australian doctors. The other 20 were doctors who were brought into do the job because we could not get any Australian doctors. The last time. I looked, in my home town of Charters Towers only two of the 13 doctors there were Australian doctors. Some of them could have been naturalised by this time but they did not get their degrees in Australia and did not come from Australia. As the House is well aware, I recently had bypass surgery. In the course of having those heart attacks and passing through the surgery, 10 doctors attended to me and nine of those 10 doctors were not Australians. They were excellent, and I could not speak more highly of all of the staff. While I am on that subject, I would like to single out Dr Malick, who is the superintendent at Charters Towers. He has been very helpful in discussions on the difficulties of people coming to Australia. He and his team perform magnificently at the Charters Towers hospital. There are many like Dr Malick. However, I would like to put on record my personal thanks to him and Dr Diquer, who pioneered heart surgery in North Queensland and who enjoys an enviable reputation in Sydney and Melbourne as much as his chosen place-God bless him-of North Queensland Recently an article in the Townsville Bulletin said that Townsville, a town of 200,000 people, was I think 60 doctors short. I will check that figure, but they were a huge number of doctors short. The previous speaker, give the member for Corio-I do not want to be critical; he is an excellent member of parliament-said that there were four medical schools in Queensland. There are two in the pipeline as I understand it-Griffith and Bond universities-but there are only two in operation. I will do a bit of skiting. About seven years ago, in desperation-after we had been 11 months without a doctor in Aramac-Muttuburra-I called for about the 4,000th meeting to form yet another committee to secure a medical school for North Queensland. I think Dr Wronski was one of the major driving forces, although I do not wish to single people out here as there were many people who were heavily involved. That committee-under Lady Pearl Logan and my daughter Mary Jane Streeton, as she is now-was very proactive. We pay very great tribute to those people because not only did they secure the Townsville medical school-the North Queensland Medical School-but they broke the mould. There had been no medical school founded in Australia in 44 years. It was the first medical school in 44 years. About half of those in medical schools now are women-and God bless them for this; I am not being critical them-but, when they become mothers, they naturally want to spend time with their children. So their hours of practice are very small indeed when they go through a mothering period of 10 or 20 years on average. Some of them do not, but most of them do for reasons that they are very good mothers. We do not criticise them for that-we praise them for that-but the hours that the doctors put into practice have diminished dramatically. The population has increased but the number of doctors coming out has not increased. On top of that, a large proportion of the doctors are ladies who, when they go through the mothering period, modify their hours of practice. We had a situation which arose dramatically. Also, incomes and opportunities have dramatically increased in the cities. There people like me and other members of parliament who would not be here except for surgery; we would probably have died in days past. There is an enormous amount of effort that has to be put into these new surgical methods, so there has been a greater demand for medical practitioners than in the past. Until James Cook University, thanks to the enormous energies of the great man Ian Wronski, came into being, there had been no expansion in the supply of doctors in Australia. We were dependent upon bringing people from overseas. In my home town of Cloncurry the last doctor I spoke to was from Nigeria. When I was a young person we had the Colombo plan: we educated doctors from the poorer countries and sent them back to their countries. Now Australia, in a most disgraceful exhibition of malgovernment, has had to go on bended knees to bring people from Third World countries, who are desperately needed in their own countries, to practise in Australia. We do not come to condemn; we come to praise. I want to single out the previous of health minister, Michael Wooldridge-I described him as the angel of the bush, and he was; he was one of the people who became very positive in securing JCU-Mike Horan, the minister in the Queensland government, and the subsequent Labor government who carried it forward. We thank them. It is not only the establishment of JCU; there is a second problem here. I do not want to denigrate the university, but I will cite one university where I would say 30 per cent of their graduates are in need of psychiatric care. If you want to choose all these brilliant academic performers then you are going to get people whose perspectives are so narrow that their abilities to deal with other people are almost autistic; they are quite incapable of doing that. A large number of them have been removed from practice. Through their are screening and entrance requirements, these universities, for their own academic prestige, chose people along lines that would develop the academic prestige of that medical school. In fairness, they looked at the right of the individual, if he performs brilliantly academically, to become a doctor. They looked at their rights to aspire to academic prestige, but they did not look to their responsibility to supply doctors to the people of Australia. More praise to Professor Ian Wronski at JCU, because JCU have taken great risks in choosing people who will be caring and thoughtful-the sorts of people who will make good doctors and good medical practitioners. They see their role as supplying people who will alleviate pain and stop death, wherever humanly possible. If you even have a cursory discussion with some of the students at JCU, you will realise that they were selected against magnificent selection criteria. JCU have again taken a great risk by reserving 20 of the 60 places for people from small towns. If you want to get doctors to go back to small towns, the first thing would be to get someone from a small town to become a doctor. I do not think a person from a city is going to aspire to go out to some small town, but if that is where they come from then you have a very good chance of keeping them. Until that time, the people of North Queensland lived 2,000 kilometres away from our nearest medical school in Brisbane. We sent our children down there to become doctors, they married a Brisbane girl, they lived in Brisbane for six or seven years doing their training, and we never saw them again-they became Brisbane people and did not return to us. That is the reason why North Queensland and country Australia have had such enormous difficulty in securing doctors. But those things are being dealt with now, and we give praise to the current minister, who has carried on the good work of his predecessor, for the commitment that the government and he, personally, have shown to meeting the difficulties that we are dealing with head on. I come from a state where we have had a terrible situation arise because there has not been proper screening of doctors: the Dr Death case at Bundaberg. The latest media reports are that 13 deaths occurred as a result of that person. There is a very important warning for anyone involved in government: if you try and shut up people, if you try and have a lock-down of a flow of information, you are taking very grievous risks. The Department of Health in Queensland did exactly that. They did everything humanly possible to shut up any criticism; no-one was going to talk. There was a regime of secrecy and a regime of-and I do not hesitate to use the word-terror. This was to a point where, when a patient's leg had grown to four times its size and was clearly gangrenous-as a layman, when my son has had injuries and broken bones from football, I have watched like a hawk because any swelling is extremely dangerous-the nurses knew that noone was going to speak up. The nurse who spoke up-all she did was speak to a director of nursing; it did not appear that we got very much action from that quarter either-was not game to speak up to outsiders, and the patient lost his leg. I have just quoted one terrible case where it is clearly obvious to everyone associated that the patient was in dire peril of losing his life, let alone his leg. In the case of Dr Death, there was a second mechanism. The officials who hired this person did not bother to ring up the place where this Dr Death came from in America and find out why a doctor wanted to leave America and come to practise in Australia. Why would that occur? In any event, one would have thought that it was a fairly obvious thing to do. If you are relying upon a letter from a hospital in the United States or anywhere else, you should realise that letters are extremely easy to forge. We have no way of finding out who signed the letter. If something comes on a letterhead from a hospital in India or America, the letter can be very easily forged. But a telephone conversation with people in official positions in these hospitals would have indicated that there was a very serious problem with this particular doctor. I want to bring something to the attention of the minister, and it is very relevant to bill before us today. I commend the minister for this bill and the streamlining. What took place in the Dr Death case is very relevant to what the minister is doing today. Because there were three or four bodies that all had a finger in the pie in Queensland, everybody left it to everybody else to do something. They would say, ‘It's his responsibility.' body was taking responsibility for licensing these people to practise in Queensland. I urge the minister to definitively say whose job it is to license these people to practise. However, it is a commendable and very timely action by the minister to narrow down the number of people that someone has to go to to make this decision or to verify this decision. Having said that, let me mention a situation in North Queensland concerning the Queensland Medical Board. In discussions with them, I have found them to be very excellent people. But a mistake was made; I think it was a mistake. An official said to an overseas doctor, ‘You cannot renew your right to practise in Queensland because we want oversighting now.' I bring this to the minister's attention. They wanted every overseas doctor to be oversighted for three hours a week. I think that this was a mistake made by officials in the Medical Board. When it was brought to the attention of members of the board, they reacted very swiftly to head off the complete collapse of medical services. In the town where this occurred, two doctors were up for re-registration. The first one was told, ‘You're not being re-registered because you can't give us an oversighting.' We cannot get doctors to sight, let alone get doctors to oversight. The one Australian doctor in this town with about 15 doctors said, ‘I'm rolling my swag and leaving.' I had already told the Medical Board. I said, ‘He won't the stay. He's not going to be the lone ranger here oversighting everybody else in town. He's not going to take those responsibilities.' Unbeknownst to me, he had already rung up the Medical Board himself and told them that he was leaving town. He was not going to be the sole doctor. The Medical Board listened. Unlike the No- authorities at Queensland Health in the case of the Bundaberg Dr Death inquiry, these people did listen and did act expeditiously to head off at the pass a total collapse of our medical system in North Queensland by the delicensing of all of these foreign doctors. But we still have a situation where the Medical Board quite rightly believes that there should be some oversighting. I want to suggest something to the minister and the government-and to the Queensland government, the Medical Board and the director in Queensland Health. There are a lot of retired doctors. The doctor now in charge at Bundaberg was a retired doctor, Dr O'Rourke. Dr O'Rourke, a very experienced surgeon, was asked to come out of retirement and oversight-which he did. A lot of these retired doctors do not want to work full time, but they might do a month and visit a few bush towns and interesting communities. I do not think they would be averse to doing that. They would get a bit of income from it. For a figure of under $5 million-maybe the state and federal government could put in half each-I think we could supply an oversighting of those doctors for a few hours a week-say once every three or four months. I strongly suggest that the minister takes that up. Maybe there are better ideas than that, but that is the best one that I have heard. I would also urge the minister to take into account the licensing for rural doctors. The ACRRM at the present moment has put itself forward to do the licensing and be the authorising body as far as practice in isolated situations is concerned. Practice in isolated situations and rural situations is profoundly different from practice in a big hospital situaWronski tion such as in Townsville or Cairns. It is so fundamentally different that there should be experts dealing with it. I plead with the minister to look seriously at ACRRM as a licensing body for rural doctors in Australia. I have mentioned Professor Wronski's name in this speech, and quite deservedly so. He was one of the doctors who founded that organisation. He is very well aware of the need for specialists in that field-specialists in the sense of people who will be able to handle the difficulties that arise when you are isolated and you are thrown back on your own resources. Finally, I think the government seriously has to consider a special zone allowance. If it will not consider it for everybody, it should at least consider it for essential services. Without some sort of tax zone allowance for these people, there is just not enough money to attract them out there. Some sort of break along those lines would help dramatically as well. I come here today not to condemn but to praise all of the people-the current minister and his predecessor-for the actions that they are taking and have taken. (Time expired)",70
29,Mr ABBOTT,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"In summing up debate on the Health Insurance Amendment (Medical Specialists) Bill 2005, I should say to the member for Kennedy that I very much appreciate being praised in this place. I think there was some implicit criticism mixed up with the praise, but I guess it would be unusual if one were praised in this place and not implored to do even more good work. (Quorum formed) Let me assure the member for Kennedy, as I assure many of his former Queensland National Party colleagues who make similar representations to me, both publicly and privately, that the government do take people like Professor Ian seriously. We do take the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine seriously. We meet with them regularly and we do our best to address their concerns. This is a quite simple bill which is designed to clear up some legislation to make it better reflect current practice. The specialist recognition advisory committees were effectively disbanded in the middle of last year but, because the act refers to them, this amendment is necessary to take them out. Under the situation as it now applies, the specialist medical colleges are the relevant sources of advice for specialist recognition. Under the former regime the specialist recognition advisory committees simply went to the specialist colleges for advice. Therefore, by removing the specialist recognition advisory committees we are cutting out a redundant level of bureaucracy. I will briefly refer to some of the matters that were raised in debate. The government was criticised by, amongst others, the shadow minister for health, the member for Lalor, for allegedly not doing enough to boost the medical work force. I certainly accept that over the years governments have not done enough in this area, but I point out that it was not until November 2002 that the government finally received official advice from the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee that we had general, as opposed to particular, problems here with particular disciplines and subdisciplines. Almost immediately, the government increased the number of medical student training places by 25 per cent and increased the number of GP training places by 150, again a 25 per cent increase. I would like to see further training places for other specialists, but that is basically a matter for the states, because the number of specialist training places other than for general practitioners depends upon the number of registrar positions in the staterun public hospital systems. The member for Lalor was also critical of the role of the medical specialist colleges. I simply point out that the colleges have recently been subjected to a form of audit by the ACCC to ensure that it is quality control and not job protection that the colleges are trying to ensure. It is my clear understanding that the colleges have satisfied the ACCC that in fact they are protecting quality rather than trying to restrict access to their specialOuter ties and subspecialties. The final criticism from the member for Lalor was that the government was making too much use of overseas trained doctors. Obviously, all of us would prefer to see Australian-trained doctors serving the Australian community. But a medical student can start today and it will be some 11 years before that student is fully qualified to practise. In the meantime, if we want to boost the supply of doctors in Australia, we do have to make appropriate and intelligent use of overseas trained doctors. Many communities depend upon overseas trained doctors. Some have been trained in the Third World. Many have been trained in countries such as England and Ireland, which have been traditional sources of overseas trained doctors for Australia-as indeed are our own doctors in practice in the UK and in Ireland. The overseas trained doctors practising in Australia are serving and helping the Australian community. This idea that anyone can migrate to Australia except a doctor is simply wrong. If someone comes to Australia who is appropriately medically qualified, it makes sense to make proper use of that person's talents. This idea that we should artificially restrict the ability of Australian residents and Australian citizens to practise in ways which serve the Australian community is simply wrong. I should finally point out that, notwithstanding the strictures of the member for Lalor, there are 10 overseas trained doctors filling positions in districts of work force shortage in her own electorate. I think the last thing the member for Lalor would want is for those 10 overseas trained doctors to be told that they are not wanted. I should also point out to the member for Lalor that 12 doctors in her electorate have taken up incentives offered by the government through the Metropolitan Doctors Scheme. While I would be the first to admit that, as time goes by, the government will further finetune its policies on the medical work force, any fair minded observer would have to say that the government has done a great deal, particularly under my distinguished predecessors Dr Michael Wooldridge and Senator Kay Patterson. I feel that I have done my best to fill their large shoes and to continue the important programs they put in place. I commend the bill to the House. Mr Katter-Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The minister said that I had been equivocal in my statements. It was a reflection upon me.",74

34,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Stephen Smith-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,76
35,Mr FITZGIBBON,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Superannuation Safety and Other Measures) Bill 2005 amends relevant superannuation acts by changing some provisions for public servants to make them more consistent with the private sector regulation of superannuation. Specifically, the bill allows negative credit rates to be applied to member accounts in the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. Allowing a negative credit rating will mean that the CSS, in line with other super funds, will apply a negative in a poor investment the year. Currently a ‘smoothing' is carried out in a negative earnings year by declaring a zero rate of return and transferring the losses forward to the following year or years by a reduction in the positive rate of return. This is carried out through a reserve account. Members' accounts up to 1 July 2006 will be quarantined. Only accumulations from this date will be affected. Maintaining smoothing is now very difficult for two reasons. Firstly, the introduction of investment choice will allow members to actively switch investments to higher risk categories. Members who do not do this subsidise members who do. Secondly, the CSS is closed and will experience a rapid decline in membership over the next 10 years. If negative earnings occur, the members who have left the fund due to retirement will be subsidised by the remaining members, who will be required to make up the losses. The bill also ensures that the operation of the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme and the CSS are consistent with the requirements of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 concerning fitness and propriety standards for superannuation fund trustees. This is a common sense approach and will ensure that a fit and proper person test, with the power of removal if an individual does not meet the test, covers public sector superannuation, as it does private superannuation trustees. It is a necessary safety improvement. The bill will validate the payment of benefits from the CSS made in error to a small group of fund members. This will validate payments made by the CSS to a small number of persons, probably in the hundreds, who, on legal advice to the CSS, were paid benefits. Subsequent legal advice after the payments had been made reversed the original legal opinion and concluded that such payments were not permitted by virtue of section 111A of the Superannuation Act 1976, as the fund members were still working. Given the circumstances, it would be unreasonable to go back to the individuals concerned and request repayment, as they may have spent or reinvested the moneys elsewhere. Labor supports the bill and provisions contained within. Given that this is a superannuation safety bill, Labor is greatly concerned about what is not in the bill. Labor has been greatly concerned for some years about further aspects of safety for superannuation: theft and fraud and employer insolvency. Labor has actively advanced policy to solve the gaps in protection. In respect of theft and fraud, the current law only guarantees protection for up to 90 per cent of moneys lost. The Howard government has tried unsuccessfully to reduce this even further, to 80 per cent. The current compensation mechanism provides that where theft and fraud occurs, a levy mechanism is applied across fund assets, currently totalling some $710 billion, to compensate the individuals affected. Fortunately, theft and fraud is minute in the context of total savings. This levy, when activated, represents a reduction of some 30c to 40c on members' fund balances. However, theft and fraud is catastrophic for the few hundred people who are affected each year. Given superannuation is compulsory, long term and for retirement, there is a very strong public interest argument that in these circumstances individuals should be fully compensated. Labor's second reading amendment reflects this goal. With respect to employer insolvency, the General Employee Entitlements Scheme, or GEERS, pays compensation for all unpaid wages, all accrued annual leave, long service leave and pay in lieu of notice, and up to eight weeks redundancy entitlements. Statutory entitlements and community standards are covered, except for one-that is, unpaid superannuation contributions under the superannuation guarantee act. Each year some 20,000-plus employees miss out on over $50 million in mainly compulsory superannuation contributions. Often the unpaid super is greater than other, protected entitlements. For example, a worker on a wage or salary of $50,000 a year who has, under GEERS, three weeks annual leave owing and a week's notice would receive approximately $4,300, but the unpaid super would amount to $4,500. The statutory superannuation payment is unprotected. Labor's second reading amendment calls on the government to consider extending the GEERS to protect this major statutory entitlement-that is, superannuation. Finally, I want to comment on the validation of payments made in error to a small group of CSS fund members. There was a further small group who, on legal advice from the fund, made applications for payments but were refused after a second legal advice was received. In many cases their lives were severely disrupted. They arranged and/or entered into arrangements on the basis they would receive this money. The Howard government certainly believed they should receive special consideration. The Minister for Finance and Administration, Nick Minchin, on behalf of the Liberal member for Solomon, Mr Tollner, wrote to a number of such persons ‘inferring' the government would assist. This has not happened. It is now clear that this was little more than a stunt during a difficult election period. bor's second reading amendment also goes to this very important issue. The opposition supports the bill and seeks support from the House for its second reading amendment.",76
36,Mr BAKER,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Superannuation Safety and Other Measures) Bill 2005 will amend three acts: the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Act 1990 and the Superannuation Act 2005. The amendments result from the government's ‘safety of superannuation' reforms. The bill includes provisions to validate the payment of benefits to particular members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, allows negative crediting rates to be applied to amounts held in the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and makes a number of minor amendments. The minor amendments include the provision to allow members of the staff of the boards of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme the delegation powers of the boards and to allow the boards to send documents to employees and any document or written information that, under the relevant scheme or act or any other act, they are required to send to the member. Under schedule 1, the bill makes amendments to provide for the application to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Board of the new fitness and propriety operating standard under SI(S) or Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, to provide for reduced reliance on acting members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Board and to provide for the use of proxies at board meetings. The bill will provide for the appointment of acting members to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme to comply with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. The bill allows the Commonwealth LaSuperannuation Scheme and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme boards to delegate certain functions to staff and broadens the type of information that can be provided to members via their employers. The amendments will require that substantive and acting appointments to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme board do not contravene the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 fitness and propriety operating standard. The bill will also provide that the Minister for Finance and Administration may terminate the appointment of any board member who does not meet the standard. These amendments will place the same obligations on the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Board as for other trustees of superannuation funds in relation to having to comply with fitness and propriety requirements. The proposed amendments provide for members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Board to be able to participate in meetings when overseas, to vote and to disclose conflicts of interest at board meetings through proxies. New subsection 27N(4A) also provides that the appointment of the proxy is to be in writing and signed the appointing member. New subsection 27N(4B) provides that the proxy is not entitled to vote on behalf of the member on a proposed decision unless there is an instrument of proxy appointment which sets out the terms of the proposed decision and indicates whether the appointing member is in favour of or against the proposed decision, and the proxy member votes on the proposed decision in accordance with the indication in the instrument. The bill also makes amendments to the Superannuation Act 1976 and the Superannuation Act 1990 to broaden the type of information that can be provided to scheme members via their employers, provided that this would not breach the Corporations Act 2001 or any other act. Item 23 will amend paragraph 42A(1)(a)(ii) to allow the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme Board to request a designated employer provide to a member of the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme any information required to be provided by the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme Board to a member under any act. This is necessary as the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme Board is now required to provide information to members under other acts. I turn now to schedule 2, amendments relating to negative interest rates for the monwealth Superannuation Scheme. The bill will also amend the Superannuation Act 1976 to allow negative crediting rates, that is, negative earnings, to be applied to amounts held by members in the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. When the proposed introduction of member investment choice was announced in 2004 the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Board requested that the restriction on the board declaring negative interest rates be removed to bring arrangements in line with industry practice. The amendments will therefore by provide the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Board with greater capacity than has applied in the past to equitably distribute earnings on the funded accumulation component of members' benefits between members who leave the scheme and those members who stay. The amendments will also allow the board more flexibility to accurately determine interest rates. Under current arrangements it is difficult for the Public Superannuation Scheme Board and the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Board to equitably distribute fund earnings between the members who leave the scheme and those who stay, especially when market conditions have led to negative fund reserves. Allowing negative crediting rates brings the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the Public Superannuation Scheme into line with usual arrangements for funded accumulation components of superannuation benefits in that members will bear the risk of their investment choice. From 1 January 2006 the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Board will be able to make negative declarations of interest; however, the board will protect a member's account balance in line with the announcement it made in September 2004 that a member's account balance in the fund cannot fall below a certain level. The protected amount Comfrom 1 January 2006 will generally be the member's account balance in the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Fund as at 1 July 2003 plus member contributions, including any transfer amounts, made between that date and 31 December 2005. An example of how this will operate is the case of Jenny. Jenny had an account balance in the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Fund of $200,000 as at 1 July 2003. She paid $12,500 in contributions for the period 1 July 2003 to 31 December 2005 and has unallocated earnings of $50,000 for that period. Jenny subsequently pays $2,500 in contributions and has $10,000 in earnings for the period 1 January 2006, when the amendment commenced, to 30 June 2006. Jenny's protected amount is $212,500, which is made up of $200,000 plus $12,500, and if the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Board made a determination of interest as at 30 June 2006 that distributed all of the fund earnings, giving Jenny $60,000 in interest, her account balance would be $275,000 as at that date. The protected amount remains $212,500 irrespective of whether Jenny was in the default investment option or the cash conservative option when the amendments commence and irrespective of any switches she makes between the current options. If Jenny was a Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme deferred benefit member, and had been since 30 June 2003, her protected amount would be $200,000. I now turn to schedule 3, amendments relating to the validation of certain benefits under the Superannuation Act 1976. This bill will also amend the Superannuation Act 1976 to authorise a small number of Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme benefit payments that were incorrectly paid. These breaches occurred when members were paid Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme benefits without having met a condition of release under Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, such as having a termination of employment or attaining age 65. In most cases the affected members became Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme deferred benefit members when they joined an alternative superannuation arrangement operated by their employer and, after reaching their preservation age, commenced their Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme benefits, the main component being an indexed Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme pension, without having met a Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 condition of release. The amendments do this by recovering the unauthorised amounts that were paid in this manner as debts due to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Board by set-off of these recovered amounts against benefits payable, equal to the unauthorised amounts previously paid. It is intended that the set-off is not likely to involve any actual payment. In the case of future pension payments, the amendments in effect authorise the continued payment of the amount of the original pension that was previously unauthorised. The amendments also provide where act of grace payments have commenced in lieu of Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme benefits for a period of time before the commencement of the amendments that only the unauthorised Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme benefit amounts paid prior to the commencement of act of grace payments are able to be recovered by set-off against benefits payable. However, even where act of grace payments have been made, the amendments in effect authorise the recommencement of Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme pension payments of the amount of the previously unauthorised pension. Overall the amendments have the effect of prospectively authorising benefit payments, previously made available over a number of years to certain Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme members employed by certain approved authorities, in breach of superannuation law. Some examples of the effect of the amendments are as follows. For example, John commenced receiving his unauthorised Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme pension of $20,000 in February 2002, and he rolled over his member contributions and interest as a lump sum to another superannuation fund. In February 2005, John met a Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 condition of release because he reached age 65 and so he is authorised to receive Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme payments from that date. The effect of the amendments on John is that his unauthorised lump sum benefit is able to be recovered by set-off against a benefit of an equivalent lump sum benefit amount that is payable to him. The amount of the unauthorised pension paid to John for three years from February 2002 is able to be recovered by set-off against a benefit equal to the amount of that unauthorised pension that is payable to him. Future pension payments are, in effect, authorised to continue at the indexed amount of the previously unauthorised pension. Another example is Anita, who commenced receiving her unauthorised indexed Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme pension of $30,000 in January 1999 and she purchased an additional unindexed Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme pension of $10,000 per annum with her own contributions and interest. In March 2005 Anita was identified as being in receipt of unauthorised Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme payments and so the payment of these pensions was ceased forthwith and immediately replaced with act of grace payments of equivalent amounts in lieu. Anita meets a Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 condition of release on 1 July 2005. The effect of the amendments on Anita is that both her unindexed additional pension and her employer financed indexed pension of the period January 1999 to March 2005 are able to be recovered by set-off against benefits equal to the amount of her unauthorised pensions during that period that are payable to her. They do not affect the period when act of grace payments were made in lieu. Future pension payments are in effect prospectively authorised to continue at the indexed amount of the previously unauthorised pension. I commend the bill to the House.",78
37,Mrs VALE,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Superannuation Safety and Other Measures) Bill 2005 will amend the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Act 1990 and the Superannuation Act 2005. These technical amendments are a consequence of the government's safety of superannuation reforms as well as changes required to facilitate the application of negative interest rates to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. The purposes of this bill are to amend the appointment provisions for members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme board in relation to the safety of superannuation reforms; to extend the delegation powers of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme board and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme board; to allow the use of proxies at meetings of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme board for the purposes of voting and disclosing of interests; to amend the type of information that can be distributed by employers to the members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme; to allow negative crediting rates to be applied to amounts held in the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme; and to authorise particular pension and lump sum Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme payments. The amendments will ensure that the operation of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme is consistent with the requirements of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 concerning fitness and propriety standards for superannuation fund trustees. This bill will also allow negative crediting rates to be applied to member accounts of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and validate the payment of benefits from the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme made in error to a small group of its members. A number of recent developments form the background to this bill, including Australia's new superannuation safety regime and changes that have taken place with the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme itself. Australia's new superannuation safety regime commenced on 1 July 2004, with a two-year transition for all existing trustees apply for a new registrable superannuation equity licence and to register their funds. The new regime not only involves a new licensing requirement but also sets standards for responsible officers and directors of trustees, adequate resources, outsourcing and risk management. Trustees that are operating at the commencement of the period will have until 30 June 2006 to obtain a licence and register the entities under their trusteeship. Persons or corporations not operating at the commencement of the period will not have the benefit of the transition period and will need to be licensed prior to commencing operations. To be eligible for a trustee licence, applicants must have robust frameworks in which to identify, measure and monitor the risks arising from the trustee operations and the risks specific to the entities for which they are trustee. These frameworks must be articulated in a formal risk management strategy and risk management plan. New operating standards have already been made covering the fitness and propriety of trustees, the requirement to hold adequate resources and the manner in which licensees outsource material business activities. These initiatives have brought the industry's corporate governance and risk management frameworks in line with other industries regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority. Because of this initiative, effectively all superannuation trustees have to hold the appropriate licence by 1 July 2006. The Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme boards are in the process of applying for a superannuation trustee's licence. The majority of Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme board members are also Public Sector Superannuation Scheme board members. Another of the recent developments that to form the background to this bill came about on 11 August 2004, when the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme board decided to introduce investment choice for the fund's members. Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme members are now able to choose how their contributions are invested. This approach was implemented between November and December 2004 and was the first step in introducing a greater range of investment choices for Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme members. As a consequence of introducing investment choice for members, the way in which investment earnings were allocated to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme members' accounts was also changed. Prior to 1 July 2003 the earnings on members' accounts were determined by the calculation of the annual crediting rate. The crediting rate was the rate of return on a member's account for the previous financial year. Since 1 July 2003 the members' investment earnings have been determined on the basis of the exit rate. This is the estimated investment performance of the particular member's chosen investment option between 1 July 2003 and the date on which they exit the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, taking into account fees and taxes. The exit rate is applied to the member's account balance as at 1 July 2003 and to any subsequent contributions. When the crediting rate approach was used to calculate the investment return on funds, if the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme fund made an investment loss, and reserves were insufficient to cover that loss, the government paid what was necessary to cover the losses to the extent of the member's own contributions when the benefit was paid out. To reduce the financial risk to both the government and the members in the event of an investment loss, an investment reserve of five per cent of the assets of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme fund was established. If the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme made a loss, portions of the reserve were allocated to the member's account. Once investment earnings recovered, the investment reserve was gradually rebuilt to five per cent of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme's assets. While the investment reserve was being rebuilt the crediting rate was reduced, includtotal ing to zero, for that period of time. In this way continuing members shouldered a large proportion of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme's investment risk by forgoing investment earnings that they might otherwise have earned. Also, when the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme had made a loss and a member left, that member did not take the full extent of the losses them. The impact of rebuilding the investment reserve on the balances of the remaining members' accounts was, in these circumstances, greater than it might otherwise have been. This problem has the potential to have a significant impact in coming years. The Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme was closed to new members in 1990, and with no new members the scheme's membership profile has rapidly aged. This will result in a comparatively rapid decline in Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme membership over the coming years. If the policy for allocating investment losses and gains had not been changed, the situation might have arisen where a significant number of members exited the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme in a period when the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme experienced an investment loss. These members would not have taken a fair proportion of their investment losses with them and would have left the remaining members with a disproportionate impact on their accounts during the period over which the investment reserve was to be rebuilt. The new exit rate policy addresses these problems by applying the full extent of investment returns, and losses, continually to members' accounts. With the adoption of the exit rate as the basis for allocating the investment earnings, the operation of the reserves is now limited to situations where members' total credited balances exceed the assets of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. In such a situation, a negative reserve would be created and would need to be replenished from future earnings. The full implementation of the exit rate approach is hindered by the legal interpretation of the language used in the sections of the 1976 act to be amended by schedule 2 of this bill that the Commonwealth Superannuation with Scheme cannot declare a negative crediting rate to a member's account. Looking at the bill, schedule 1 contains provisions for amendments to the 1976 act, the 1990 act and the 2005 act. The schedule provides for the appointment and termination of members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme board to comply with the new fitness and propriety standard under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. This bill will also provide for the appointment of acting members to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme board to comply with the superannuation supervision act. The amendments will require that substantive and acting appointments to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme board do not contravene the superannuation supervision act fitness and propriety operating standard. Also, the schedule provides a contravention of the standard would allow the Minister for Finance and Administration to terminate an appointment to the board. The proposed amendments will allow for reduced reliance on acting members of the board when substantive members are absent from Australia and provide for members to participate in, vote on and disclose conflicts of interest at board meetings through proxies. Similar amendments will be made to the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme in the scheme's trust deed and rules through an amending deed in respect of the above matters. The bill also includes amendments to the 1976 act, the 1990 act and the 2005 act allow the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme boards to delegate powers to their staff. This will improve the administrative efficiency of the boards. Other amendments to the 1976 act and the 1990 act will allow the boards to send to the designated employer of a member of the relevant scheme any document or written information that, under the relevant scheme act or any other act, they are required to send to the member. This change is necessary as the boards are now required to provide information to members under other acts. Schedule 2 of this bill provides for amendments to the 1976 act which will allow negative crediting rates to be applied to Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme member accounts. This initiative has the effect that members will bear the investment risk relating to their account balances, as appropriate. It will also provide the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme board with greater capacity to equitably distribute earnings between those members who leave the scheme and those who stay. Schedule 3 of the bill also provides for amendments to the 1976 act. This schedule will rectify the situation where a group of that Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme members have received benefits in breach of superannuation laws. They were deferred benefit members who had ceased contributory membership by joining an alternative superannuation arrangement offered by their employer. After they had reached preservation age they received payment of the benefits without meeting certain conditions such as terminating their employment or reaching age 65 as required. The amendments in the bill will effectively validate these payments. This bill provides for necessary technical amendments as a consequence of the government's reforms on safety of superannuato tion, as well as providing the changes to facilitate the application of negative interest rates to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. I commend the bill to the House.",81
38,Dr STONE,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration) (1.36 pm)-In summing up this debate I would like to thank those who have participated. Indeed, it is a very important piece of legislation-one that is quite complex but of great concern to those who are growing older and need to make sure that their superannuation is safe and that they have appropriate coverage for their old age. The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Superannuation Safety and Other Measures) Bill 2005 will amend the Superannuation Act 1976 in relation to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, often referred to as the CSS. The Superannuation Act 1990, which relates to the Public Sector Superannuation is Scheme, or PSS, is also amended by this bill. Finally, the bill amends the Superannuation Act 2005, which relates to the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan, or PSSap. Following the passage of this legislation, similar amendments will also be made to the PSS trust deed and rules under the Superannuation Act 1990 and to the PSSap trust deed under the Superannuation Act 2005. The bill primarily makes amendments to implement the government's safety of superannuation reforms by introducing a new fitness and propriety operating standard to the government's requirements of the CSS board. The bill also includes changes required to facilitate the application of negative crediting rates to the CSS, changes to validate the payment of benefits to particular members of the CSS and a number of minor amendments related to, for example, the use of proxies voting and the disclosure of interests by members of the CSS board, the delegation of powers of the CSS and PSS boards and the disclosure of information by those boards to employers. The Superannuation Act 1976 will be amended to provide that the appointment of a person as a substantive or acting member of the CSS board must not contravene the new fitness and propriety standards. The amendments will also provide for the minister to terminate a board member's appointment if they do not meet the standard. The bill will enable the CSS and PSS boards to allocate negative earnings to members' accounts. The board has requested these changes to allow allocation to members of actual fund earnings, including negative earnings, when member investment choice was introduced for relevant members in 2004. This will resolve the inequity where negative earnings are not passed on to members exiting the funds but are deducted from future earnings applicable to the remaining members' accounts. With member investment choice, it is appropriate that members bear the relevant investment risk in relation to their individual account balances. The bill will also amend the Superannuation Act 1976 to authorise a small number of CSS benefit payments that were incorrectly paid because ComSuper incorrectly informed certain members that they were entitled to claim their benefits. The effect of these changes will be that recovery from these individuals will not be required. The member for Hunter was concerned about this element and, indeed, included it as one of the elements of the amendment that he put forward. So I can assure him that the amendments in this bill well and truly cover those few individuals who were concerned in this way. In particular-I should elaborate a little for because this was a significant issue-there were some CSS members who did receive incorrect advice but who did not ever receive payments in relation to that advice. The problem was discovered, fortunately, very early and therefore before any benefit payments were made to the members. On being informed of the situation, the CSS board instructed its administrator, ComSuper, to immediately correct procedures and member information to ensure that no further benefits payments were commenced and undertook a review to establish the number of cases where payment may have been made incorrectly. At the time, relevant members whose applications had been or were being processed were personally contacted, and the CSS board also informed the office of the Minister for Finance and Administration, the minister's department and the relevant regulatory authorities. The issue was taken very seriously and dealt with very urgently and immediately. The other items in the amendment moved by the member for Hunter are not actually relevant to this particular bill. The bill will also make a number of technical amendments to enable CSS board members to appoint another board member as proxy, to clarify that CSS board members may participate in meetings by electronic or other means, to enable the CSS and PSS boards to delegate administrative functions to their staff and to broaden the type of information that can be provided by the CSS and PSS boards to scheme members via their employers. I commend this most important bill to the House.",84

41,Mr FITZGIBBON,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT BILL,"Hunter) (1.43 pm)I have recovered from that vicious attack by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration bringing into question the integrity of my amendment to the last bill and I am very pleased to be speaking on the bill before the House. The Corporations Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005 amends section 197 of the Corporations Act, effecting the potential indemnity of directors of corporate trustees from the liabilities of trusts. The intent behind the amendment is to ensure the directors of corporate trustees have a level playing field with regard to indemnity from liability as do directors of other entities. This is a clarification of section 197, and Labor supports the change. Specifically the amendment will clarify the potential personal liability of the directors of corporate trustees following the South Australian Supreme Court case in 2003, Hanel v ONEILL. In that case the court found that a director of a corporate trustee could be responsible for liabilities of the trust if the trust did not have sufficient assets to cover its liabilities. The effect of the decision in Hanel v ONEILL was that the liability of directors of corporate trustees could include the paying of all trust debts. This is a level of liability that extends beyond that of directors of other corporations and certainly beyond the original intent of section 197 of the Corporations Act. In assessing the need for this amendment, it is important to consider the recent legal history in this area. The current section 197 of the Corporations Act was preceded by section 229A of the companies code. Section 229A of the companies code, which was introduced into law in 1986, sought to ensure that on the insolvency of a corporate trading trust unsecured creditors did not have direct access to the trust's assets. Trading trusts had become popular business structures in the 1970s and there was recognition of the need both to limit the potential exposure of directors of corporate trustees to personal liability and to ensure that directors of corporate trustees were only indemnified from liability to the extent that they had acted properly and within the terms of the arrangement with the trust. Section 229A addressed this dual need by limiting the liability of directors of corpoof rate trustees to obligations for which the tee was not entitled to indemnity by reference to descending conduct which constituted a breach of trust between the corporate trustee and the interest of the trading trust. Section 229A later became section 233 when the Corporations Law came into effect in 1990. Then, under the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 1999, the new section 197 was introduced, with effect from 13 March 2000. When the Corporations Act came into effect on 15 July 2001, section 197 in its current form became law. The original section 229A of the companies code and later section 197 of the Corporations Act had operated in some obscurity until the interpretation by the South Australian Supreme Court in Hanel and ONEILL, where a broader interpretation of the potential liability of distructures rectors of corporate trustees was introduced. The effects of this interpretation I have already outlined. Given the history of these laws and the reasonable right of the directors of corporate trustees to indemnity from liabilities if they have met their obligations to the interest of the trust, the opposition accepts this amendment as a reasonable clarification of the intent of section 197. It is a change that will provide clarity to directors of corporate trustees and remove a potentially onerous burden on their business dealings. From the opposition's perspective, it is important also to note that this amendment to section 197 will not indemnify a director of a corporate trustee from liability if they commit a breach of trust or an act against the interests of the trust as per the trust agreement. This interpretation is in line with the original intent of section 229A of the companies code and a position which should be maintained. Labor has always sought to ensure that the Corporations Law balances the need of business proprietors for reasonable protection in the conduct their business affairs whilst ensuring that trusthere are adequate safeguards in place to prevent the abuse of those protections. This objective and intent of section 229A was foreshadowed by the then Attorney General, Lionel Bowen, on 11 October 1985, when in his second reading speech on the Companies and Securities Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 1985 he said: Currently persons contracting with a trustee, whether an individual or a corporation, are entitled to be subrogated to the trustee's right of indemnity out of the trust assets to meet liabilities properly incurred. However if the trustee acts in breach of trust or in a manner which is not authorised by the terms of the trust, the trustee's right of indemnity, and therefore the creditor's right of subrogation, is lost. The problem this creates for creditors has been exacerbated by the widespread use of business involving a nominally capitalised corporate trustee to carry on business on behalf of a trust, together with other refinements, such as the careful siphoning of funds into the trust business. In such cases the creditor's primary right to sue the corporate trustee for the debt may well be worthless. I think there is a general recognition in the business community that the legal system cannot tolerate the continued use of artificial legal contrivances which result in the deliberate avoidance of liabilities legitimately owed to other persons. It is proposed to amend the Companies Act to impose personal liability on directors of companies acting as trustee when a debt has been incurred but the trustee company is not entitled to be indemnified out of the assets of the trust. With this considered view in mind, the opposition initially held reservations about the implications of the drafting of the current amendment set out in the bill. In particular, we were concerned that the terms of the amendment would limit its application to very narrow circumstances and thereby work against the objective of ensuring these provisions could not be abused. Labor have received advice from the office of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and have consulted with commercial lawyers familiar with Hanel and ONEILL. We are advised by the government that the intent of the amendment is not to diminish the potential liabilities of directors who have not met their obligations to the trading trust. On this basis, we do support the bill. Ensuring the right balance between the rights of directors and the rights of business stakeholders remains as important an objective now in Corporations Law as it ever was. Given these considerations, the proposed amendments to the potential liability of directors of corporate trustees bringing it into line with that of other directors is a sound objective. Labor has sought to cooperate with the government on this bill, recognising that certainty for many directors of incorporated trustees should be addressed as quickly as possible. As a result, Labor agrees with the amendment. It is a welcome clarification of the application of section 197 and should provide some certainty that directors of corporate trustees are seeking in this regard. Relationships between directors and other directors, directors and creditors and of course directors, creditors and administrators are an important part of our Corporations Law and crucial to the good operation of our economy. I should also include in that group the relationship between directors, creditors, shareholders and, of course, ASIC. Despite the best attempts by this parliament, too often these laws have let down participants in the system. I use as an example the case of Singleton Earthmoving. Singleton Earthmoving has now been trading as a corporate entity for some 25 years. For all of that time. I think it has been controlled by two directors, Mr Bernard Wood and his wife. According to Mr Wood, late last year his wife unilaterally appointed a third director. I have not yet been able to determine whether this was done lawfully in terms of the corporation, and ASIC refuses to offer any opinion on the matter. I do know that around September 2004 the second director was appointed and the two directors-other than Mr Wood-put the company into voluntary administration and appointed Mr Stuart Ariff as administrator. This was despite the fact that Singleton Earthmoving was a viable ongoing concern which was meeting all of its financial obligations to its various creditors. Around September Mr Ariff held a creditors meeting, which was subsequently adjourned. I understand that Mr Ariff assured creditors attending the meeting that no action on the company would be taken until such time as that meeting had been reconvened. Despite this, some weeks afterwards Mr Ariff took the action of having Singleton Earthmoving's plant and equipment seized and its phones disconnected. This of course resulted in Singleton Earthmoving no longer be a viable and ongoing concern. Indeed, it led to the retrenchment of 25 employees, some of whom were not paid for the month of September as a result. By 17 December, at a third meeting of creditors, Mr Ariff was recommending that the company be wound up. The creditors were amazed at this suggestion-these are creditors that had a good relationship with the company, in most cases for some 25 years-but, feeling that Mr Ariff was the expert in these matters and that they were very much in his hands, particularly given that the company was obviously not a viable ongoing concern any longer, and concerned about every opportunity available to them to secure the money owed to them, they decided that they would accept his recommendation and allow the company to be put into liquidation. On that point I would like to refer to parts of a letter that has been penned by all of the creditors to Mr Bernard Wood's former company. All of them believe that they have been mistreated and that the administrator-and now the liquidator-has acted inappropriately and they also believe that they collectively represent all of the creditors to the former company. They make 10 points. The first thing they question in point 1 is the legality of Mr Ariff's appointment as the administrator and, I suppose by implication, the legality of the appointment of the third director who, with the second director, used their majority to put the company into administration. They then go on to say in point 2 that at the first creditors meeting: ‘He'-that is Mr Ariff-‘was retained as administrator on the understanding that there would be no significant changes to the company's operation until the next meeting.' I take you back to my original point: there was that promise but, despite that promise, the plant and equipment of the company were seized and the phones disconnected. They go on to say that 10 days after the first meeting ‘without notice he forced the company to cease trading' by doing those things I have just mentioned. The third point they make is this: they complain about how he tried to prevent their client of over 20 years-that is, Mr Woodfrom trading. They say that despite Mr Ariff's attempts to stop their client trading, only has he prevailed successfully with the new company but they feel sure that without the administrator's actions the company would still be going on. They go on in point 4 to talk about how he successfully and quite callously without malice attempted to put 25 long-term employees out of work-and I made that point earlier on. In point 5 they talk about how, when the director who instigated the administrationthat is company director two in particularrealised her mistake or that a mistake had been made and tried to end the administration, Mr Ariff threatened her with Supreme Court action if she continued with her attempts to reverse the situation. They complain in point 6 about how, on 16 November 2004, Mr Ariff informed the creditors committee that one of the reasons for cessation of very trading was that there were no formal contracts in place with customers. The creditors say that their investigations showed that this was incorrect and there were indeed formal contracts in place. In point 7 they talk about how Mr Wood unsuccessfully tried to put in place a deed of company arrangement, which Mr Ariff blocked by various means, including harassment of various creditors to the company. In point 8 they talk about the December meeting at which Mr Ariff's solicitor threatened five creditors with Supreme Court action if they did not agree to his fees. In point 9 they talk about the three-month period after that meeting in which Mr Wood took a loan from the National Australia Bank to secure the assets again, a situation which, without Mr Ariff, would not have existed. In point 10 they complain about the continued strife for clients' businesses in that Mr Ariff had auctioned the property that their client had purchased from the National Australia Bank. I suspect that our Mr Ariff is a bit of a cownot boy. It is very unfortunate because what we had here was an ongoing viable business employing 25 people and there was never any suggestion of the company's inability to meet its obligations to its various creditors, including the finance company which held liens over the plant and equipment of the business. The last point the creditors make is that Mr Ariff is now asking for some $251,000 for fees in kind for the wonderful work he has done with respect to Singleton Earthmoving. I have made some inquiries of ASIC and I am still awaiting a response from ASIC. I hope that ASIC will be able to intervene in this case to the satisfaction of both Mr Bernard Wood and, of course, the creditors that have been burned by the actions of Mr Ariff. If ASIC is not prepared to act, then I will be asking the Treasurer to exercise his authority under section 14 of the ASIC Act to investigate Mr Ariff and direct ASIC to take the appropriate actions against him.",86

43,The SPEAKER,RULINGS,"On 11 August the Manager of Opposition Business asked me to reflect on rulings on the content of questions, suggesting that there may have been inconsistency in my rulings. An analysis of the Hansard for both days shows no inconsistency. The rulings were consistent with each other and consistent with long standing interpretation of the standing orders. The rule applied in all examples cited is: A minister can only be questioned on matters of public affairs, administration and proceedings pending in the House for which he or she is responsible or officially connected. Therefore, the question on 10 August by the Manager of Opposition Business to the Treasurer about health expenditure was in order. The questions or parts of questions which were ruled out of order did not seek information from a minister which related to the minister's responsibilities. Examples of such out of order questions or parts of questions include: asking the Deputy Prime Minister for an opinion on his performance without referring to any particular aspect of his responsibilities; asking the Minister for Education, Science and Training to comment on a quotation from a senator; and asking the Deputy Prime Minister if his policy related to the views of a senator. Furthermore, questions or parts of questions which relate to the minister's official responsibilities are of course in order. However, it is out of order to ask a minister to comment on a statement made by another person. The only exception to the rule is that the standing orders specifically allow a question to the Prime Minister on whether a minister's statement in the House represents government policy. NA",90

45,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. Minister, isn't it a fact that the CEO of Telstra told the Telstra board that Australia lags behind its international peers in terms of investment, the take-up of broadband services, pricing and capacity, and that Australia is in the bottom quartile of developed countries in terms of its telecommunications services? Isn't it also a fact that the Telstra CEO told the government that fixing the communications problems in the city and the bush in their initial phase would cost $5.7 billion? With a task so vast, isn't the only way to future proof Telstra's services to keep Telstra in public ownership?",90
46,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The answer is no. Economic Outlook,91
47,Mr MCARTHUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer outline to the House recent information on wage costs? What are the implications of this data for the inflation outlook? Are there any measures that can be taken to further improve labour market outcomes?,91
48,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his question. I can inform him that the labour price index for the June quarter of this year showed a slight acceleration of wage costs, rising four per cent through the year to the June quarter of 2005, which was marginally up from the 3.9 per cent through the year to the March quarter of 2005. These wage costs show that there are real wage increases going on in the community but they are restrained and consistent with low inflation, provided the economy maintains productivity growth. Indeed, the Reserve Bank governor, in his testimony last Friday, noting that the wage cost index was 3.9 per cent, described it as ‘remarkably well behaved'. The member for Corangamite also asked about measures to improve labour market outcomes. I know that this is of real interest to him because he asked the Governor of the Reserve Bank questions to this effect in Melbourne on Friday. The governor was asked why Europe was showing slow economic growth compared to Australia. The Governor of the Reserve Bank said: I think the biggest single explanation is that they have very old-fashioned, heavily overregulated economies. … … One of the forms of heavy regulation in Europe is labour market regulation. It is extraordinarily heavy labour market regulation, most of which has the effect-as a lot of regulations do-of protecting the insiders at the expense of the outsiders. So the people in the jobs are very heavily protected, while people trying to get in find it very difficult. That is why they are all running 10 per cent unemployment. The Reserve Bank governor's view that heavy labour market regulation leads to higher unemployment is not his alone; it is also the view of the IMF, the OECD and this government. It is not the view of the Australian Labor Party, who believe that they know more than the OECD, the IMF or the Reserve Bank governor. The Australian Labor Party believe that ‘the lemon has been squeezed dry', to use the phrase of the Leader of the Opposition, and that you cannot do any more with labour market improvement. They have given up on creating more jobs and they have given up on having a stronger economy here in Australia. If you want to get outcomes, you have to engage in reform. It is not enough to sit there and prattle on, as the Leader of the Opposition does, and give the game away. Labour market reform in this country will create more jobs, more opportunities and better wages for Australia. Telstra",91
49,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. Will the Deputy Prime Minister guarantee parity of services for country people following the full sale of Telstra? Will the Deputy Prime Minister insert a legal requirement into the Telstra sale legislation for parity of services across metropolitan, regional and country Australia, or will the Deputy Prime Minister continue to be ‘a lion in Taree and a lamb in Canberra'? … Mr VAILE-I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. What I can guarantee is that the government will continue, as we have done over the last nine years, to deliver good services to Australia. We have already delivered over $1 billion in telecommunications infrastructure in Australia. What the government have announced today is a plan to continue to invest billions and billions of dollars in telecommunications services in Australia-in particular, regional Australia-so that we can structure a mechanism that will give certainty and security, just on the funding of services but also on competition and consumer protection into the future. The package announced today strengthens some of the fundamentals that we, not the Labor Party, put in place. The Labor Party did not put in place the universal service obligation. The Labor Party did not put in place the customer service guarantee. We are going to strengthen those things as part of this package to ensure that telecommunications services are delivered equitably across Australia. Trade",91
50,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Would the minister inform the House of Australian farmers' contribution to our record trade performance? How is the government helping farmers to export their products?,92
51,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for O'Connor for his question. He represents a large part of Western Australia, and a lot of rural exports go out of his electorate. The most important thing we can do is to continue to maintain the competitive edge of Australia's producers and exporters right across the nation, whether they be in the cities or in regional Australia. In regional Australia, which is where the member for O'Connor comes from, despite ongoing drought in some areas, our farmers have been making an enormous contribution to Australia's export effort. Remember that over the last 12 months Australia has exported $162.3 billion worth of goods and services. That is a record as far as Australia is concerned. In 1995-96, it was $99 billion, and it has gone up to $162.3 billion. Out of interest, the Australian beef industry has contributed $4.8 billion in exports, thanks to the 70,000 Aussie beef farmers, some of them in the member for O'Connor's electorate. The not Australian lamb industry has contributed $1.2 billion to that effort, thanks to the 38,400 lamb producers across Australia, a lot of them from Western Australia. That is a very important contribution. The government are working on a number of fronts to help Australian farmers to export their products and to improve their competitive edge. Obviously, we need to maintain our focus on opening up markets across the world. We also need to maintain our focus on a competitive and efficient environment in Australia, and that includes the telecommunications system across regional Australia. The government's investment in telecommunications in the past, and what we have proposed today for the future, will continue to help Australia's exporters to remain globally competitive. A critically important element of this debate is that, under the announcements made by the government today, services will be delivered and guaranteed into the future. Fundamental reforms are needed, and will be delivered, to fund new infrastructure, encourage competition and safeguard services-all important elements of the package. We are not resting on our laurels. We are not in a policy vacuum, unlike those on the other side of politics. All the ideas for reform and improvement are coming from this side of the House. We will continue to deliver good policy, sound economic management and strategic investment in essential infrastructure so that we can maintain the competitive edge for Australian industry and Australian exporters. Telstra",92
52,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"2.12 pm)My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. Is the minister aware that $2 million in proceeds from the sale of the first part of Telstra went to link in northern New South Wales? Is the minister aware that, on May 26, Norlink went into voluntary administration? Is the minister also aware that, as of last Thursday morning, online documents still bore the logos of groups which have since sought to distance themselves from Norlink, including the New South Wales Farmers Association and the Northern Rivers Regional Development Board?",93
53,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for his question. I am not aware of the matters raised. I will take advice and provide information to the shadow minister in due course. Privatisation,93
54,Mr TICEHURST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer explain how the government uses the proceeds of privatisation? Are there alternative practices?,93
55,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question. I can inform the honourable member for Dobell that the proceeds of privatisation which have been received under the administration of this government have been used to retire Labor Party debt-that is, the capital sum has been offset by a reduction in capital liability. When this government was elected the Commonwealth debt was $96 billion. By the end of the financial year just past, this government had reduced Commonwealth debt in net terms by $80 billion. There is no difference between the government and the opposition on privatisation policy. Just to prove the point, I will table the Canberra Times of 25 August 1994, which has this headline: ‘Privatisation vital: Beazley' The article says: The Minister for Finance, Kim Beazley, made a spirited defence of privatisation in his address to the National Press Club yesterday. NorThe Labor Party do not actually oppose privatisation. In fact, they used to give spirited defences of the practice. But there is a big difference between the privatisation practised by the Labor Party and that practised by this government. When the Labor Party engaged in privatisation-and I was reminded of this by the member for Melbourne yesterdaythey spent the entire proceeds in the year of receipt. Let me give you an example. In October 1993, under Labor the first tranche of the Commonwealth Bank was sold off for $1.7 billion. The Australian Labor Party government spent the full $1.7 billion in October 1993 and then, after they had spent the full $1.7 billion, borrowed another $15 billion to actually finance their budget. Let me give you another example. In July 1995 the Australian Labor Party government privatised Qantas and received $1.5 billion. In the year of receipt, which was 1995-96, they spent the lot so that by the end of the financial year they had no shares and no proceeds and, after spending the lot, borrowed another $12.3 billion to finance their budget. In relation to all of the privatisation conducted by the Australian Labor Party, they sold the shares, spent the money, ran the budget in deficit and borrowed to fund it as a consequence. There is not one dollar in either asset or reduced debt to show for Labor Party privatisation. In fact, during those privatisations net debt ran up to $96 billion. This government has a very different view. This government has always applied the proceeds of privatisation to the reduction of debt. Net debt, as I said, has been reduced under this government by $80 billion. With the proceeds of the privatisation of Telstra, this Commonwealth government will become debt free in net terms. What a legacy that will be for future generations-not paying back Labor's debt but building a financial position. Telstra",93
56,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer explain why any hard working taxi driver would have an interest in buying shares in T3? Is it the case that if the same cab driver bought 2,000 shares in the last round at $7.40 a share he would, after dividends, be nursing a loss of $2,440? Treasurer, hasn't this government been the worse friend that Telstra shareholders have ever had?",94
57,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The first point I would make is that nobody is obliged to buy shares in a privatisation. It is a voluntary activity. If you are making a financial decision, I would say to people to make their own decisions accordingly. The second point I would make is that if you had bought in the first tranche of Telstra you would have not only a capital appreciation but also dividends-in fact, franked dividends. Ms Gillard interjecting",94
58,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What he did not take into account is that it was not only a high dividend stock, because he did not actually disclose that, but a franked dividend stockthat is, you do not have to pay tax on the franking credits that you receive in relation to your dividends. I would say to people that when the prospectus is issued-and I will not be giving financial information when the prospectus is issued-they should consider their financial position and get advice. If a good, long-term investment, I have no doubt that millions of Australians will participate, as they did in the past. Workplace Relations",94
59,Mr BROADBENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister explain to the House how the current unfair dismissal laws are costing jobs? Minister, are there any alternative views?",94
60,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for MCMillan for his question and note his ongoing interest in the role of small businesses in the Latrobe Valley in towns like Warragul and Drouin in creating jobs. Just this week, Australian Business Ltd released a survey of 900 employers which revealed that one-third of the respondents had paid go-away money to get rid of an unfair dismissal claim or knew someone who had. Mr Fitzgibbon interjecting",94
61,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There have been over 90,000 unfair dismissal applications filed since the system was introduced in 1994, and that does not include those cases where employers have paid go-away money to get rid of the claim. I heard the member for Hunter interjecting earlier. I was interested to read in the Australian yesterday that the member for Hunter said that he was not surprised by this finding from the Australian Business Ltd survey. Of course, we are reminded of what the member for Hunter said in 1998. In 1998 the member for Hunter said on the Small Business Show that unfair dismissal laws cost jobs. He said: Well my wife consistently tells me she could afford to put on one more person or would like to put on one more person, but is fearful of unfair dismissals, she is fearful of going through the barrier to another level of red tape and regulation. That is from the member for Hunter, whose it is wife has been telling him what a problem these unfair dismissal laws are. The ALP knows this, because just recently the Leader of the Opposition said: The problem that they confront, is when you get a bloke, or a person who is an employee, who's a con artist, a rorter, who knows that if you can the small businessman to shut his shop for a couple of days, drag him down to the IRC, put him through the mill it'll be worth ten grand for him to send you away. Those are the words of the Leader of the Opposition saying that this is a rort and that, if you can get a small businessman to shut up his shop and go down to the IRC, he will pay 10 grand to get rid of the problem. What these comments from the member for Hunter and the Leader of the Opposition demonstrate is that the Australian Labor Party know that this is bad policy. Yet, knowing that this is bad policy, the Australian Labor Party have voted against this on 41 separate occasions. On one hand they purport to be concerned for small business but, when given the opportunity to actually do something for small business, they will not do it. We will do it. We will do it because this will enable small businesses to employ more Australians.",94
62,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. I refer to the Treasurer's comment on yesterday's 7.30 Report in relation to Telstra that the government is ‘not a distressed seller'. Will the Treasurer now make a commitment that the government will not flog Telstra for less than the $5.25 per share assumed in the budget?,95
63,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course the government is not a distressed seller. The government does not sell Telstra because it needs money. It is not like the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party sold assets, spent the money and still had to borrow to cover a budget deficit. This is a government-and this is a very important point-that has the budget in surplus. It has net debt which will be totally eliminated and therefore it is not a distressed seller. So that puts the government, on behalf of the Austraget lian taxpayer, in a strong position. It puts the government in a position where it can choose to offer the Telstra shares at a time which will maximise benefits for taxpayers and give a decent investment for private investors. These are matters which will be the subject of commercial judgment. They will be made at an appropriate time, and they will be done in a way in which the government can do it without being rushed into a particular timetable. That is what happens when you have a strong balance sheet. That is what happens when you have good economic management. Iraq",95
64,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,2.25 pm)My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister inform the House how the government is assisting with the development of democracy in Iraq? Are there any alternative views?,95
65,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Mackellar. I know that she, for Telstra one, is a very strong supporter of the evolution of democracy in Iraq, even if not every member of this House is. I think it is well understood by the House that the people of Iraq are working on putting together a constitution which reflects the general wishes of the people of that country. They have made good progress, although I note that the National Assembly of Iraq, which is a democratically elected body, voted on Monday to give a week's extension to these negotiations. There has been a constructive outreach process which has been supported by the United Nations in putting a constitution together. Indeed, honourable members might be interested to know that a quarter of a million Iraqis have joined in meetings to help draft the constitution, so it has been a very open and inclusive process. There are now around 550 voter registration centres enrolling voters for a constitutional referendum which is scheduled to be on 15 October. If that takes place, that will be another act of democracy which will come on top of the 8½ million people who went out to vote on 30 January. I know the situation in Iraq is still cult-no-one has any illusions about thatbut I also know one thing about our approach to this, and that is that we are champions of democracy. We are on the side of democracy and we want to see the evolution of democratic institutions in Iraq. That is what we want to see. I think that slowly but surely Iraq is heading in that direction. Let me just say in conclusion that some people, such as the Leader of the Opposition-and I was asked about alternative views-think that the international community should set a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq of military forces. I think that is the wrong policy. I think that is a policy which is wrong-headed. I think the right policy is to set benchmarks to make sure that we achieve certain objectives and, when those objectives have been achieved, we should, of course, be able to withdraw. That is what many people have said. We hope that the time when those benchmarks, such as the training of the Iraqi defence forces, will all have been achieved will be sooner rather than later, but we will wait to see. Mr Beazley interjecting",95
66,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition constantly interjects. On this issue, he is profoundly-and I say there is one word that sums up his approach-weak. That is what you are-weak. There are 20 million people out there who know it. The member for Griffith, by the way, I think has some sympathy for our view, and that was revealed in Bernard Lagan's book. That book has not had much of a run but it is a good book. On 25 May 2004 the member for Griffith said: ‘When we took the decision about troop withdrawal by the end of the year, we took it because we felt it was the right thing to do.' The member for Griffith said that they took the decision because it was ‘the right thing to do'. That is what he told the Australian pubdiffilic. But Bernard Lagan revealed that Rudd ‘desperately wanted to persuade the Labor leader not to set a Christmas deadline,' and, when he did, ‘Rudd was infuriated.' The member for Griffith said one thing to the Australian public, but behind the scenes he was pursuing a completely different policy. What are we left with? We are left with the shambles of a policy on Iraq by a Leader of the Opposition whose greatest pretence is that he knows something about international security. When it comes to international security, he is a phoney and he is weak.",96

68,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and it relates to the government's proposed industrial relations legislation. Is it not the case that on Monday the minister said: I'm sure there will be a Senate inquiry ... I'm the one who's making the suggestion we have a Senate inquiry. So we'll have one and it will be something of the government's doing. Has the minister seen comments by Senator George Brandis-who has labelled the minister's proposal as ‘stupid'-that: There's nothing in this for us ... and: It won't have any public purpose. Minister, will there or won't there be a Senate inquiry?",96

71,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister inform the House of the economic benefits of a national system of workplace relations? Are there any alternative views?,97
72,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is nice to get a question of substance from this side of the House. I thank the member for Mitchell for his question. It was a delight to be in his electorate a couple of weeks ago and to meet with many of his supporters and the small business people in the electorate of Mitchell. In reply to the member for Mitchell, I inform the House that currently there are six state and federal IR systems that operate in Australia. That means that we have more than 4,000 awards operating in this country, which means that there are an estimated 40,000 different wage rates in Australia. In fact, it was recently estimated that there is around one award wage classification for every 27 employees in Australia. This is a system that is strangled by red tape. Imagine for a moment that Australia had six different income tax systems with 40,000 different tax rates. We would say that that was a system which was absolutely absurd-and that is true of this system of workplace relations. Figures in the labour movement recognise this problem. This week the Premier of Victoria, Mr Bracks, argued: ... let's fix the duplication, let's fix the different systems. In doing that you can take about a quarter off regulation, and that's pretty useful for our productivity. So here is the Premier of Victoria saying, ‘Let's fix this sort of duplication.' Unfortuand disappointingly, we have the Premier of Victoria, on the other hand, out there supporting the other states to retain their duplicated workplace relations systems. But Premier Bracks is not the only person from the labour movement who recognises the problem. In 2002 at the National Press Club, Mr Bill Shorten, who is the Secretary of the Australian Workers Union and the putative member for Maribyrnong",97
73,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The putative something else too, I think.",97
74,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, the putative something else too, Prime Minister. At the National Press Club, Mr Shorten said: Variations in state laws are also time-consuming and frustrating for employers. It is ridiculous there are more than 130 pieces of state and federal legislation pertaining to industrial law. That is what the Secretary of the Australian Workers Union was complaining about in a speech to the National Press Club a couple of years ago. Just recently we saw the Leader of the Opposition on the same platform with Mr Shorten saying, ‘We've got many union leaders in parliament and there are going to be many more.' One of them wants his job, I know. But if the Leader of the Opposition is going to listen to the likes of Mr Shorten about the absurd confusion and duplication of legislation that we have now, then he ought to listen to us on the subject. Having a single system of industrial relations in Australia is something whose time has come, and it is something on which we will act, in the national interest, to seek to achieve. NA",97

76,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. It follows the previous question to him, which asked for his attitude to alternative approaches to those of the ernment on industrial relations policy. Has the minister seen comments by Western Australian state National Party President, Wendy Duncan, that the extreme policy changes he proposes could create instability for businesses, particularly the plan to exempt businesses employing fewer than 100 people from unfair dismissal laws, and that: If the dismissal is unfair then workers should have some redress. Minister, if the President of the Western Australian National Party does not support the government's extreme industrial relations changes, why should the Australian people?",98

80,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The reality is that these are not extreme laws. What the government is proposing is the further, incremental improvement of workplace relations in Australia. When these proposals are passed through the parliament, Australia will still have a more regulated system of industrial relations than countries such as the United Kingdom and New Zealand. That is the reality. Those countries which have adopted a more flexible system of workplace relations-and the gov- United Kingdom is an example of this-have lower levels of unemployment and have more of their people in work. That is the reality. The UK has lower levels of unemployment. Tony Blair, the modern Labour leader in the UK, told the first meeting of the Trades Union Congress when he became the Labour leader that he was not going to make changes to what Margaret Thatcher had put in place. He said he was not going to make those changes, because it had led to a better outcome for the working men and women of Great Britain. That is what we are on about as well. The contrast to that are those countries that still retain inflexible and rigid workplace relations systems. Look at Gerto many, France and Spain, which have unemployment",98

84,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Grayndler will resume his seat! The minister was answering the question and the minister is in order.,99
85,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What I was pointing out to the House is that those countries that retain inflexible and rigid systems of workplace relations-and the examples are Germany, France and Spain-have unemployment rates today of over 10 per cent. Conversely, those countries that have moved to a more flexible workplace relations system have lower levels of unemployment. At the end of these changes we will still have a more regulated system than, for example, Great Britain. These changesMr Beazley interjecting",99
86,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Talk about displaying his ignorance. The Leader of the Opposition says, ‘No, we won't.' No we won't have a more regulated system than Great Britain? Collective bargaining is not something that you have as of right in Great Britain, but it is tion. something that we have in our system.

As this House knows, this is a government which does not just talk about Medicare; this government put in place the sensible improvements necessary to make a good system even better. Thanks to the government's bulk-billing incentives, I can inform the member for Wakefield that almost 85 per cent of GP consultations with people over 65 are now bulk-billed, thanks to the policies the Howard government. And, thanks to the Howard government's higher private health insurance rebate for seniors, fewer older people need hard-pressed beds in public hospitals. I have been asked about alternative policies. The member for Lalor's only policy remains something called Medicare Gold. She told Meet the Press recently that everyone in LaborMs Gillard- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.

108,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly have been asked about alternative policies, and that is well and truly in accordance with the practice of this House. The only policy of the member for Lalor is something called Medicare Gold. She told Meet the Press recently that everyone in Labor believes in the principles of Medicare Gold. That is quite odd, because the former chief of staff for the Leader of the Opposition called Medicare Gold ‘a strategic disaster'. The Labor intellectual Peter Botsman said of Medicare Gold that it was a policy with the head of a donkey and the body of a wombat. The President of the Labor Party himself, Barry Jones, said that Medicare Gold was a ‘turkey', and even the Leader of the Opposition said about Medicare Gold that it ‘disappeared with Mark'.

You have now, in your last ruling, conceded that, in repeating the question, the member for Wakefield has added to the original question by asking for alternative views.

119,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Attorney General. What is the government doing to give ASIO the powers it needs to collect information about terrorist activity in Australia? Could the Attorney further advise what safeguards are in place to ensure that these powers are used appropriately?,102
120,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Casey for his question. Obviously, ASIO's questioning and detention powers were developed with an awareness of the need to protect our community from the threat of terrorism without unfairly encroaching on the rights of individuals. Questioning warrants are particularly useful where the threat of terrorism is immediate and other methods of intelligence collection will be either too slow or ineffective at obtaining information about suspicious activity. The questioning and detention process is subject to quite strict legislative requirements, which include clear time limits as well as the following safeguards. Strict criteria must be satisfied before a warrant can be issued. A warrant is issued by an independent issuing authority who is a federal judge or a magistrate. Strict time limits on the period of questioning apply-up to 24 hours, or 48 hours if an interpreter is quired. The length of detention, to ensure that people remain available for questioning, can be for up to seven days-the period in which questioning in that 24or 48-hour period can proceed. There is a right to seek a remedy in the Federal Court at any time. Supervision of questioning by an independent prescribed authority occurs, and that is a person who has had judicial experience. Criminal offences for officials who breach safeguards are included in the act. The ability of the subject of a warrant to contact the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security or the Commonwealth Ombudsman at any time to make a complaint about ASIO or the Australian Federal Police is also available as a remedy. Unfortunately, there is a good deal of misinformation and, some might say, misunderstanding about the way the powers operate. If people perpetuate these myths, it could lead to unjustified concern in the community. For example, the suggestion that the laws allow the authorities to ‘disappear' somebody is completely without foundation. Warrants authorising detention must permit the person to contact others, including a lawyer of the person's choice. ASIO is a very professional organisation. It uses its powers to protect the Australian community judiciously and effectively, and only as a last resort. Regional Partnerships",102

133,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kingston for his question. He is working hard for Reynella East and Hackham West primary schools in his electorate. The Prime Minister and I announced early last year the conditions that would be placed on Australian government funding for schooling over the next four years: firstly, national consistency in Australian schooling from starting age to common testing throughout the milestones of school education; secondly, that the performance of Australian schools will be published and made available for the communities within which those schools are based; thirdly, that there would be plain language reporting to parents about the progress of their children so that parents have a very clear idea about how their children are performing at school. Something seems to have happened over the last generation in that the educational bureaucrats and ideologues have grabbed control of the school bus and forced parents to sit in the back seat with common sense, so much so that today in Australian schools many parents are receiving language neutered, politically correct, meaningless reports that tell them absolutely nothing about the progress of their children. The Australian government's legislation, which was passed late last year, requires plain language reporting to parents. That means that parents will receive reports next year that tell them that their child will be rated A, B, C, D or E in specific subjects. Further to that, Australian parents in any school that receives funding from the Australian government will be told how their children are performing compared to other children in the class and across Australia. It was rather interesting that I read yesterday in the Sydney Morning Herald about the announcement of the recently installed Premier of New South Wales, Mr Iemma, in response to the Australian government's initiative that the New South Wales government will require A, B, C, D and E reporting for primary schools. I should inform the New South Wales government that they are ‘moving in the right direction', to use their terminology. However, they will also need to do it for the compulsory years of schooling, which means up to and including year 10. The Premier said this at his announcement: “My daughter got a school report a couple of months ago, and on first reading, we saw all As and we thought ‘Terrific'... The Sydney Morning Herald article continued: However, on closer reading, “and it took quite some reading”, the Iemmas were far less sure what they were looking at. It continued: “Where is our daughter in maths and English in relation to her schoolmates in her class?” Mr Iemma said When looking at a New South Wales school report today, the Premier would be forgiven for having that attitude. Kids are ranked ‘working towards', ‘almost achieving' and ‘achieved'. An ‘A' in modern education speak is ‘achieved'. Imagine the Prime Minister ringing Bob Jane during the Bathurst 1000 and asking, ‘How's Skaifey going?' He does not want to be told he is ‘almost achieving'. What does that mean? Is he off the starting line or can he see the chequered flag? If the foreign minister rings Richie Benaud and asks, ‘How's Ricky Ponting going?' he does not want to be told that he is ‘consolidating'. In response to these conditions of funding, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania have basically signed up for these conditions. Unless they have these plain language reports by New Years Eve this year, they will not receive a dollar of Commonwealth funding for schooling next year. I notice that the Tasmanian Essential Learnings report card-I do not know why they cannot just say ‘subjects', by the waysays ‘being literate'. The average parent would say, ‘What does being literate mean? Does that mean reading and writing? Why can't they say it?' There is also ‘reflective thinking'-something that perhaps the member for Franklin is doing at the moment. The reality is that Mr Mark Latham had many faults, but when he delivered his assessment of his Labor colleagues, he did so in plain language-A-grade something or otherbecause he knew that everyday Australians trying to feed their kids and pay their car loans knew exactly what that meant.",104
134,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Telstra",105
135,Mr MCGAURAN,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"Gippsland-Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (3.08 pm)- Mr Speaker, I wish add to an answer. Earlier in question time, the member for Wills, as part of the Labor Party's scintillatNorlink ing attack of the government on Telstra issues, asked me a question about Norlink Communications. I am now in a position to be able to provide a comprehensive answer to his inquiry. The history and background of this is that Norlink Ltd was formed by the Lismore City Council, together with other councils in the region, the Southern Cross University and several other community bodies from the Northern Rivers district. It in turn formed Norlink Communications Ltd as the operating company for the telecommunications business. The project received seed funding of $1½ million, announced in July 2001, from the Networking the Nation program to improve telecommunications in this region. Importantly-the member for Wills may not know this, or he omitted to include it as part of his answer-the New South Wales state government also contributed towards funding of the project. The purpose of the project was to provide high bandwidth data and voice services over wireless local loop to three towns in the region, Kyogle, Maclean and Mullumbimby. The member for Wills will be interested to know, as part of the background and makeup of the issue, that difficult terrain between Lismore and Kyogle delayed construction of the Kyogle base station. Equipment to achieve this connection was purchased early in 2005. Norlink provides enhanced telecommunications services to 17 towns, well in excess of the target of three towns. Telstra's early provision of ADSL to Maclean enabled Norlink to give priority to other communities. Norlink chose to call in administrators to take over management of the company, I am advised, because of the concerns it had about a long-term dispute with one of its suppliers, Soul Pattinson Telecommunications, regarding payment for its services and issues that Communications Ltd had in terms of those services. I am advised that yesterday, 16 August, creditors signed a deed of arrangement in regard to Norlink Communications Ltd, so it is now under administration. Norlink's fixed line service based on the resale of Telstra services has been sold as part of the restructure. This was an additional business activity beyond the purposes for which Norlink was granted Networking the Nation funds. In conclusion, I am advised that it is the intention of the administrators to continue to run and further develop the high bandwidth data and voice services over wireless local loop for which Norlink received Networking the Nation funding.

However, it is my duty, both as a member of this parliament and in my capacity as Chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, to refer this matter to both the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit and the Auditor-General for further investigation.

158,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, could I ask you to reflect on a number of the rulings that you made in question time today. Could I put to you the very simple point that it cannot be in order for questions to invite a minister to speculate on the alternate views of persons unnamed if it is out of order for a question to ask a minister about the alternate view of persons named. Either both are in order or both are out of order. We have got to the absurd situation where the government's formulation-and, Mr Speaker, you are familiar with it, as am I-asks ministers to canvass alternate views whereas, on your present rulings, it is impossible sition to ask ministers about the views even of people within their own parties. That cannot be a consistent interpretation of the standing orders. I am not asking you to rule on it now. I think it is a matter which requires reflection. I would ask you to do that, and we might be able to discuss it further later today.",107
159,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the Manager of Opposition Business for her question. I would first make the observation that the practice of asking for alternate views is something that has been the practice in this parliament since the days of the Keating government. On the other point, I will look at the matter further and report back as appropriate. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, just on that point, can I say this to you: in the days Keating government, and even in the early days of this government, I would be able to take you to a number of questions, which were allowed and ruled in order, which asked ministers about the views of people within their own party or the views of people outside.

I call upon those members who approve of of the the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",108
164,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Today we have heard that the government is getting set to sell Telstra and that the National Party is all set to fall into line, in particular Queensland National Party senator Barnaby Joyce-Backdown Barnaby. This must be a world record for the shortest time ever spent as a maverick in the Senate. They should put it on that Sunday night TV show Australia's Guinness world records. Barnaby Joyce arrives in Canberra last week. He gets shirt fronted by Senator Heffernan and the member for O'Connor, old Ironbar. Five minutes later, what remains? Barnaby Rubble. Five minutes of political sunshine, Barnaby. Hope you enjoyed it. The National Party is always ready to sell out its constituency provided the price is right. We on this side of the House always knew they would sell out, because that is the nature of the National Party. Now they are led by a former auctioneer. Some people might think this is highly appropriate-a political party that will sell anything provided the price is right being led by an auctioneer. But he is a strange kind of auctioneer: Telstra offered $5 billion and he sold for $3 billion. I don't know about you, but I would not want him selling my house. The pity and the tragedy of it is that the Leader the National Party is selling off something of far more value-an asset Australians have built up over the course of a century and something which, once it is lost, can never be regained. The members of the National Party will be out there trying to claim that this is a win. least Backdown Barnaby has the grace to still maintain that Telstra should not be sold, that the best interests of Australians would be served by Telstra continuing to remain in majority public ownership. But the rest of The Nationals will be out there claiming that there is now $3 billion available to compensate country people for the loss of the publicly owned Telstra-$1 billion for capital investment and $2 billion for a fund to pay for upgrades to the rural telecommunications network. The first point that ought to be observed here is that telecommunications is not just an issue for rural and regional Australia. The sale of Telstra is not just bad for country Australia; it is bad for all of Australia. is no suggestion that the outer metropolitan areas, for example, are going to get anything out of this. All they will get is poorer services and higher charges. But the National Party will be out there spruiking this $3 billion in a ‘never mind the quality, feel the whip' selling job. But wait, haven't we heard this before? What became of the money that they got from the first sales of Telstra, which brought in $17 billion and $16 billion respectively? Back then they set up the Natural Heritage Trust to enlist the support of the green groups for the sale. The green groups fell for it and were duly conned-as you always are when you deal with this government. Firstly, the government slashed spending from the environmental part of the budget on the basis that it was no longer needed on acof count of Telstra and the Natural Heritage Trust money. Secondly, they turned it into a government slush fund, with the vast majority going to Liberal and National Party held electorates. Thirdly, they wasted the money and failed to deliver real improvements for the Australian environment, which has conAt tinued to deteriorate on all the objective measurements during their time in office. The Auditor-General found it impossible to work out what benefits, if any, Australians got from the Natural Heritage Trust because the government-oops-forgot to monitor the projects and collect any genuine data about the outcomes. They simply handed the money over and walked away-no monitoring, no evaluation. I have talked about that before. Today, I want to talk about Networking the Nation. As the Howard government prepares to sell the remainder of Telstra, the House needs to ask: what do we have to show for the $3 billion distributed to groups in regional Australia following the T1 and T2 Telstra sales unThere der the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund? Very little of it in fact resulted in infrastructure. Instead, the government handed out large numbers of grants to groups in regional Australia for services rather than for infrastructure. Many of the groups had little expertise or track records. Most were unable to establish viable projects. The opportunity to build regional infra- set structure was blown away with a host of grants that have been of little lasting value regional Australia. Networking the Nation was one subprogram of the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund, funded with around $500 million of Telstra sale money. In one scathing audit report-and there were several-the Auditor-General found that the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts did not have an appropriate management framework in place to monitor the efficiency and effectiveness of Networking the Nation programs and that it had inadequate needs assessment and risk assessment, a lack of measurable targets and significant numbers of outstanding project reports and acquittals. That was in Audit Report No. 12 2003-04. Investigations show that much of the money from the first two Telstra sales was wasted. For example, there were 130 taxpayer grants to New South Wales rural projects after the first Telstra sale, but one in four of those grants did not add a single telephone or internet service to the bush. Instead, 27 per cent of the grants funded studies, strategies, needs assessments and training programs. More than $95 million of the telecommunications funding promised to the bush was later withdrawn by the government and counted as savings or spent on other projects. An audit report into the programs was highly critical of the lack of accountability imposed on those who received the grants. It found that administration costs soaked up 27 per cent of one program to set up 500 rural transaction centres. Yesterday, the wellrespected Byron Shire Echo gave a detailed report of what had happened on the North Coast of New South Wales: The Nats made Networking The Nation, in part up as a ‘social bonus' of earlier Telstra sales, a very useful pork barrel from 1997 to 2004. The to north coast was awash with NTN funds in its heyday. It was probably no hindrance that the chairman of NTN was Doug Anthony, father of then Richmond MP Larry Anthony. It was no hindrance at all. The article then asks the question: But have the NTN funds done anything much to improve telco services on the north coast? The paper asks a very good question. The article continues: Over $2 million in public funds went into Norlink, the internet provider originally supported by local business and community organisations. On May 26 this year Norlink went into voluntary administration ... … … … Its vision of a series of ‘E-towns' supported by local councils was not realised and its presence did not make it as far as Kyogle, one of the intended towns. It operated online from MAP, the Mullumbimby ISP it acquired, and offers a wireless service. As of last Thursday morning online documents still bore the logos of groups which have since sought to distance themselves from Norlink. The NSW Farmers Association says it has had no association with Norlink for a number of years and the Northern Rivers Regional Development Board abandoned administrative support to the company in 2000. As the paper also says: What Norlink had achieved is little different to that done by local businesses such as Linknet. No over-arching plan has emerged from NTN to give the bush a wealth of high speed connections. The article also mentions the case of Bangalow businessman Christopher Sanderson, who received $894,000: ... for an online produce marketing service called variously TAFTCO and Grower Direct. An earlier incarnation of Mr Sanderson's project was the Regional Internet Marketing Cooperative which was involved with the Northern Rivers Agricultural Development Corporation (NORADA), actively promoted by Doug Anthony. Its efforts to find Asian markets for Australian growers were found wanting by some members of the NSW Farmers Association. The article continues: The ghost of the Grower Direct company still exists online ... Brisbane produce software company Freshcomp Computer Systems, which is linked to the Grower Direct site, told the The Echo it never had an association with the Bangalow company. There was another north coast telco service to benefit from NTN funding, the Southern Cross University's CoastCall business initiative. It received over $385,000 and ran for a couple of years, with most of the money being spent on administration. Its 2000 report admitted that CoastCall had no success in attracting advertising and that it was not worth hiring reps to go after it. The Echo says: For the most part, NTN funds seem to have disappeared or been‘hosed up'; they actually used more robust languageagainst the e-wall. If the Nats are successful getting another slush fund, will it all happen again? That is a very good question. As far back as September 1998, the New South Wales Farmers Association's Coffs Harbour regional branch was using Networking the Nation as an example of its concerns that ‘often grants earmarked to assist the community never reach those they are intended for'. A letter from the association says: After more than 12 months of operating, benefits from over $200,000 of funding are yet to flow on to the farmers. Northern Rivers Agricultural velopment Corporation and the Regional Internet Marketing Cooperative continue along their chosen path without any involvement of the farming community. In relation to this failed $894,000 project, there are plenty of questions to be answered by the government. The businessman associated with this grant, Mr Christopher Sanderson, will now not field questions from journalists about the project. When the government is asked to account for this expenditure, it simply emails a link to the Grower Direct web site, which itself has links to other company sites. Those companies have told various media outlets that they never had any association with the company. So the question is: just how was that $894,000 grant money spent? Has any of it found its way into Jindi-Net, a wireless broadband network run from Jindibah-an ‘intentional community', whatever that means-by none other than Mr Christopher Sanderson, the recipient of the grant money? Labor will be taking up the fight on this issue. We will require that this and many other Networking the Nation acquittals lodged with the department are produced. It seems that the only thing the community has to show for almost $1 million to improve regional telecommunications is the digital ghost of the Grower Direct web site. It is a in shameful legacy that does not augur well for other regional projects meant to compensate the bush for the ghost of Telstra public ownership. Australians throughout country Australia need to be warned. They have been sold a dummy on regional telecommunications infrastructure before and it will happen again. One of the things that you can be absolutely guaranteed of is that Telstra money will be used to fund a government advertising campaign-money from the sale of a national asset paying for Liberal and NaDe- tional Party propaganda. Last year, the campaign Working to Keep the Country Connected-don't you love those Orwellian titles?-hit rural and regional airwaves from May to July. Of course it was entirely coincidental that this was in the lead-up to the federal election. That campaign swamped rural and regional TV and radio stations, as well as newspapers, with advertisements to inform people about their telecommunications rights. I am asked about the costs. The total advertising campaign cost in 2003-04 was $5 million. In 2004-05 it was $953,000. So nearly $6 million was spent in total, yet only $73,000 of this amount was spent on printing the booklet-Your Phone Service. Your Rights-that this advertising campaign was supposed to promote. As it happens, an answer to a question from Senator Faulkner indicates that, despite over $3½ million of taxpayers' money being spent on TV, radio and newspaper advertising placements, as of 1 June 2004 only 971 calls had been logged at the tel:info helpline. This means that between 9 May and 1 June on average only 40 people per day right across Australia-that is two people per hour-called the helpline at the peak of the advertising campaign. That it is a pathetically low response for a campaign that cost almost $6 million. Since the 2004 election, it has all melted away and is no longer available online-so much for keeping the country connected. The partial sale of Telstra was a mistake; the complete sale will be a bigger mistake. It is being proposed by people who ought to know better. Networking the Nation simply turned into a National Party pork barrel and millions of taxpayers' dollars were wasted. If the Howard government privatises the rest of Telstra, the National Party will again turn as much of the proceeds as it can into a National Party slush fund. It will be another massive waste of public money. (Time expired)",108
165,Dr STONE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration) (3.35 pm)-I am absolutely staggered that Labor would invite the public to hear what they did in their 13 years in government for telecommunications across this great country and what the John Howard led government has willingly undertaken since 1996 to bring back a more equitable system of telecommunications, one that is competitive and one that delivers world-class opportunities to those who have to communicate to survive. I was amused that the member for Wills spent a lot of time in his remarks on the spending of some of the first partial sale of Telstra funds, saying what an appalling thing it was to spend these funds on the biggest environmental program Australia has ever seen. I was parliamentary secretary to the environment minister while the member for Wills was the opposition spokesman for the environment. I remember that he said again and again-it is the only contribution he ever made to environmental debate-that the problem with the Natural Heritage Trust was that Labor seats were not getting enough of it and that there should have been more spending on that magnificent program in Labor held seats. As various reviews showed, the relationship of the allocation of funds matched almost exactly where the seats were in the landscape. It is a simple case that rural and regional voters do not vote for the Labor Party. The seats which have the environmental issues tend to be in the hands of the coalition. I suppose that is why we were not so surprised that in 1996, when the Labor Party's telecommunications policy was revealed for all to scrutinise, the word ‘regional' appeared but once. Not a cent of the Labor Party's telecommunications policy was committed to telecommunications for rural or regional people-not a cent. Was that because Labor had built up, in the previous 13 years, a magnificent system that served rural, regional and metropolitan Australia? Let us remind ourselves of what telecommunications in Australia was all about under Labor. bor policy. Mr Hartsuyker-Shame!",112
166,Dr STONE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Indeed. If you had just built a new home or started a new business, and you wanted the phone connected-probably the most important thing you can do in a new business is to have the phone connectedunder Labor it took up to 27 months. That is over two years. Can you imagine it? Mr Hartsuyker interjecting",113
167,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Cowper may wish to speak in this debate in a moment.,113
168,Dr STONE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Businesses went broke. People gave up and walked away. There were domestic tragedies. There were people who could not cope because, under Labor, they could not get the phone connected at their new home for over two years. That is disgusting. Under a Liberal led coalition, today only 20 days are required to get a new service hooked up to your new home or business. And we are expecting to see that number come down even further. That 27 months compared to 20 days is just one example-and a pretty interesting example-of what happened with telecommunications under Labor. They presided over a TelstraOptus duopoly that was uncompetitive. The money made went back into those outfits rather than into new technology. There was no universal service obligation in place to make sure that country or suburban people got a fair go; hence, there was a two-year waiting time for a new phone. It was absolutely disgraceful. Let me remind those on the other side of the House what we on this side know-and, because you do not represent rural and regional people, you probably did not realise-that, under Labor, mobile service coverage actually contracted in rural and regional Australia. Mr Hartsuyker-Shame! That was La",113
169,Dr STONE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I don't know that it was Labor policy,113
170,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Cowper is warned!,113
171,Dr STONE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I suspect it was just that they did not understand what it meant not to be able to use telecommunications in rural and regional areas. So, in a deal done in 1993 with Vodafone, Labor said: ‘We'll let you do a certain sort of business. We'll make it viable for you by withdrawing the analog mobile service. It will have to close by the year 2000.' When we came into government in 1996, we could not undo that contract; the cost to the taxpayer would have been too great. So, right across the country in 2000, analog services were shut down. Thank you, Labor. That was a most appalling decision you made back in 1993. We saw mobile services contract under your regime. The member for Wills was most excited when he listed project after project that had been funded through the partial sale of Telstra in addition to the magnificent environmental program. Let us look at what has been done by the Howard led coalition since 1996 by way of improvements in telecommunications. We tackled the problem that we inherited from Labor with three major strategies. The first strategy was to encourage competition to deliver innovation, cheaper prices and greater choice. As a result of our work, the price of phone calls in Australia has come down by 20 per cent since 1996. I will be reminding those opposite of that figure quite a few times. Ms George-What about line rental costs?",113
172,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If the member for Throsby wishes to speak, she can seek the call.",113
173,Dr STONE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Our second plank was to establish and maintain a tough regulatory consumer safeguard regime with price controls, a customer service guarantee and the universal service obligation. We do not believe you should simply leave it to the carriers to do as they will. We have put in very tough safeguards and they will continue to be there. That is why we have given a better go for rural, regional and outer-suburban people when it comes to their services. The third plank is targeted funding to improve services, particularly in areas that are not served, or not well served, by the market because, for example, they are very remote or have a very low population density. What have we achieved through the three main planks of our policy? Firstly-and I have already mentioned this-the price of services has fallen by 20 per cent. Customers have greater choice of service provider than ever before. This continues to drive competition, which brings down prices and stimulates innovation, leading to new services being rolled out all the time. We have had some independent evaluation-not in house as the member for Wills suggests-from the Allen Consulting Group. The evaluation was authorised by the Australian Communications Authority and it looked at what the telecommunications reforms have delivered to Australia since 1996. It found the telecommunications reforms have increased the size of the Australian economy by $12 billion. It found we have created approximately 4,000 new jobs with the new competition and the expansion of services, and we have delivered benefits to small business of $1.8 billion. We have not denied them a phone for two years; we have actually delivered benefits to small business of at least $1.8 billion. On average, each Australian household is $759 better off as a result of our telecommunications strategy since 1996. Ms George-You've gotta be joking!",114
174,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Throsby is warned!,114
175,Dr STONE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is a very significant saving for households, indeed. There are now more than 100 telecommunications carriers operating in Australia and I am sure there are going to be more. Of course, they compete and help with innovations. There are more than 16 million mobile phones in operation in Australia. People can now choose whether they even install a landline phone in their house or apartment: they can just rely on mobile phones. The number of broadband subscribers in Australia is now well over one million. Ms George interjecting",114
176,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Throsby will remove herself from the House understanding order 94(a). The member for Throsby then left the chamber.,114
177,Dr STONE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This is an example of the competitive environment we now have: almost half of Telstra's ADSL subscriptions are wholesale services that are being resold to competitors. Since 1997 the Howard government has committed more than $1 billion to improving telecommunications infrastructure and services in Australia. As I have just shown with that independent evaluation, the $1 billion investment has delivered in manifold ways, in terms of added value and choice, to our great Australian nation. This expenditure has covered programs including Networking the Nation and the social bonus, which came about as a result of our very intensive Besley and Estens inquiries. We always listen hard and we will continue to review. The most recent commitment was for more than $180 million in response to the Estens inquiry. So we have delivered, in the way that I have just described. And what an extraordinary achievement, given what we had to deal with-the neglect of telecommunications under Labor, particularly for rural and regional people who were in despair when it came to trying to do ness and run social lives and communities when they simply could not connect. Today there has been an announcement. It is probably one of the most significant announcements for telecommunications since our initial policy launches in 1996. It is a continuation of the magnificent work that has been ongoing since 1996. It is called Connect Australia. I want to applaud our Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Helen Coonan, who has done a magnificent job, and all of the committees, the Liberal and National Party backbenchers, the middle benchers and the ministers who have worked to make this new policy one of the most significant announcements that we have ever seen in telecommunications services in Australia. We have reannounced our commitment to first-class communications services for tralia. We will continue to deliver on that promise, with a $1.1 billion roll-out of broadband, new regional clever networks, mobile services and special telecommunications services for Indigenous communities, who are often in the most remote parts of our great country. As well as that $1.1 billion, there will be $2 billion dedicated to a communications fund. This will be established, and the earnings from the fund will be used to provide new communications services for rural Australia. The government will also provide a more robust regulatory framework for the telecommunications industry. We will not do what Labor did: simply hope and pray that something good will happen. Quite simply, you need a watchdog in this world and we will maintain the strongest of safeguards to protect our consumers. (Quorum formed) Let me say in these last few seconds that you will have to do better than that to shut down busithe fact that telecommunications in this country were a disgrace before 1996. They were appalling. Now Australia has some equity, some good cost products and some innovative technology. I want to commend our government and particularly Senator Helen Coonan for the magnificent job that she has done. (Time expired)",114
178,Mr EDWARDS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I simply have to ask, after having listened to the government speaker at the table: if Telstra is so good, why sell it? It is interesting to look through the public media reports of recent weeks. First of all we saw Prime Minister HowardGovernment members-Get over it.",115
179,Mr EDWARDS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If you want to come in and join the debate, do so. It is interesting, having looked through the media reports, to have seen of late Prime Minister Howard bullying poor old Sol. We saw Senator HefAus- fernan bullying ‘Backdown Barnaby', who obviously heard his master's voice, and we have seen the Nats today again take 30 pieces of silver.",115
180,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Cowan will refer to members by their title.,115
181,Mr EDWARDS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is interesting indeed that the National Party have obviously plucked, trussed, stuffed and cooked the Telstra goose, and now they simply sit waiting to carve it up. Christmas may be coming early to the bush, but it is the rest of Australia that will be putting the presents under the tree. There is no doubt that Telstra will be sold. Australia will be sold out, and Australian mums and dads will be paying more for poorer services. The interesting thing during most of this debate, one which you would think the National Party would have some real interest in, is that the National Party has been outnumbered in this chamber by the Independentsand there are only two of them. What an absolute disgrace! The sale of Telstra is bad for the bush, bad for the budget and bad for Australia. I pose this question to the government members: if the sale of Telstra is not in the interests of Australian families, how can it possibly be in the national interest? I also want to put this to the government members: if the partial sale of Telstra has been good Australia, let us see the tangible benefits of the proceeds of that partial sale. Where are they? I challenge the government to tell and show not just the residents of my electorate in the northern suburbs of Perth but all the Australians who live in the fringes of our cities where the benefits of the partial sale have gone. The government cannot or will not answer that question, but I will. The proceeds of the partial sale have been squandered. They have been squandered on buying votes in the bush and through the bulbous pockets of the government's spendthrifts, who have wasted countless opportunities for proper and prudent investment in our infrastructure, our services and our future. The proceeds have been squandered by the biggest porkbarrelling government in the history of Australia-squandered and wasted, not invested. The government have not invested in infrastructure, in growth, in their loyal clientele, in the future of our nation, in Telstra's employees or in the growth of Telstra. Indeed, Telstra has been downgraded and its services have been downgraded by the government in their rush to sell the asset and get their hands on the money. I had a look at some figures that I used in an earlier debate, which showed that capital expenditure in Telstra had fallen from a peak of $4.75 million in 1999-2000 to an estimated $3.25 million in 2002-03. Where did the investment go? We also know that, during those same years, staff were shed at a rate of some 4,000 full-time employees per year. Is it any wonder that the government benches are almost bare? They certainly do not like to be reminded of these facts. I recently made some inquiries in Western Australia, because we are constantly, daily, getting complaints from small business people who work from home, from small business people in the industrial areas in the for northern suburbs of Perth and from mums that their telephone services are not up to scratch. I was told that there is a department within Telstra called the CNI, which stands for customer network improvement. This department is for the more major faults, not for average repairs. I am told that if a technician attends a fault complaint they often find that the problem is more serious than just fixing the line at one person's home. If this type of fault is located, the attending technician tries to temporarily fix the problem with the line and then reports the fault to the CNI, the customer network improvement department, and this department fixes the major faults. There are currently 8,000 to 9,000 outstanding CNI fault reports in the Perth metropolitan area. That is incredible. Where is the investment? Where has the money from the previous, partial sale of Telstra gone? Where is the growth of Telstra? What we have seen is not a growth but a decline. Infrastructure and investment have not kept pace with technology and growth, and not just in urban parts of our cities. They have certainly lost ground when you compare the growth with small business, which relies on Telstra and its services to enable it to compete. It is a bit hard trying to get more specific figures out of Telstra because, quite frankly, Telstra is embarrassed at its lack of infrastructure investment, its lack of services, the number of faults that it has to deal with and the amount of time it takes to deal with those faults. About 18 months or so ago the government ran a Telstra seminar in the northern suburbs of Perth. The then minister, Daryl Williams-since retired-told that meeting that Telstra is not responsible for supplying broadband services. That was the view of the minister who had responsibility for Telstrathat Telstra is not responsible for supplying broadband services. An opposition member-What does it do?",115
182,Mr EDWARDS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The question is asked: what does it do? Whatever it does, the minister of the day, whether then or now, does not seem to know, because one of Telstra's employees had to rush out and put out a press release through the northern suburbs saying that Telstra was committed to rolling out ADSL where there was sufficient demand. There is sufficient demand. That demand is in our cities and it is in the bush-it is right across Australia. It is a great pity, a great shame, that this government has chosen not to invest in the future of Telstra and chosen not to invest in the future of Australia. It has turned its back on Telstra and it has turned its back on Australia. (Time expired)",117
183,Mr HARTSUYKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak today on this matter of public importance. In my discussion I want to touch on three points: firstly, the government's record in delivering telecommunications improvements to the people of Australia; secondly, the announcements made today on the $1.1 billion Connect Australia program and the $2 billion Communications Fund for the future; and, thirdly, the track record of the ALP on both telecommunications and privatisation. On the first point, the government's track record since coming to power in 1996, the coalition has delivered unprecedented benefits to Australian consumers and businesses through the development of a highly competitive telecommunications regime. We as a government have been focused on equity and access to high-quality telecommunications services across Australia, no matter where you live. There have been three planks in the government's approach to achieving those objectives: firstly, to encourage competition, to deliver innovation, to deliver cheaper prices and to deliver greater choice; secondly, to maintain tough regulatory and consumer safeguards such as price controls, customer service guarantees and universal service obligations; and, thirdly, to provide targeted funding to provide services in areas which would not normally be catered for in a commercial market. The government's approach has delivered real benefits to consumers: prices have fallen, customers have been offered a choice of providers and new services such as broadband are being rolled out across the country. Since the introduction of competition in 1997, consumers have seen a decrease in prices of some 20 per cent in real terms for telecommunications services. Now Australians can choose between different service providers and different telecommunications products. Australians have the option of dealing with 100 carriers across Australia, and there are now more than 16 million mobile phones in operation. Broadband subscribers now number well over a million, with half of them being serviced by operators other than Telstra. Regional Australia has benefited in particular from the improvements under this government, with over a billion dollars being spent to date on a range of programs, such as Networking the Nation and improvements under the Besley and Estens reviews, including the highly successful HiBIS program which delivers broadband to small communities right round the country. There is also $50 million metropolitan black spot program. This government has invested over $140 million to support the extension of mobile phone coverage to 98 per cent of Australians. Under the coalition, 40,000 customers living in remote Australia have access to untimed local calls for the first time, and they have been given the opportunity to take up subsidised two-way high-speed satellite internet services. I would now like to turn to the announcement made today. This additional commitment will build on what has gone before under this government. The $1.1 billion Connect Australia program will provide a huge boost to our national infrastructure, with $878 million for the Broadband Connect program to provide more Australians with affordable broadband services; $113 million for the Clever Networks program, which will roll out new broadband networks to provide innovative applications to improve delivery of health, education and other essential services; $30 million for the Mobile Connect program to further extend terrestrial mobile coverage to areas not adequately catered for and to build on the subsidy for handheld satellite phones; and $90 million for a comprehensive package to provide telecommunications services to our Indigenous communities, which are so lacking in telecommunications services. The government believes that good telecommunications services need to be assured not only now but into the future, and that is why there will be a system of regular reviews of services. There will be a requirement for Telstra to produce a local presence plan to ensure that Telstra services able in regional and rural Australia and that there will be access to Telstra representatives at the local level. A $2 billion fund will be established, the revenue from which will be invested to ensure that we will be able to roll the out improved technologies in telecommunications as they occur. That is a vitally important factor: future-proofing regional and rural areas to ensure that they have the adequate services they need not only now but into the future. We believe that better competition is the key to better services and lower costs. As part of this proposal, the government will require the operational separation of Telstra's wholesale and retail business units. If we are going to have proper competition other carriers will need to have a level playing field and, through operational separation, the National Party and the Liberal Party believe we will be able to achieve that. The government seeks to ensure transparency in pricing for wholesale customers. There will also be price controls: the 22c untimed local call will be maintained, there will be no large increases in line rental, there will be restrictions on the cost of new connections and there will be measures to protect low-income earners. This government is encouraging a reduction in telecommunications costs to the Australian community. I would now like to turn from the bright future to the dark past of Labor's history, to Labor's appalling record on telecommunications, particularly in regional and rural areas. It is difficult to recount their strategy on regional services because I do not think they really had one. The word ‘regional' barely appeared in their policy. Not one cent was committed to improving services in rural and regional areas. As I said, ‘regional' was mentioned only once in their policy. Labor's record on mobile phones was a disgrace, switching off the analog service and putting are availnothing in its place. As the member for Murray said previously, services were actually reduced under Labor, not increased. That amounts to vandalism of the community's telecommunications services. It took this coalition government to roll out the replacement CDMA network. When Labor was in government it placed no requirements on Telstra to fix or install services within time limits. Waiting for over two years for a landline connection is deplorable but it was part of the day under Labor. People were waiting for two years for a phone connection. These days there is a 20 working days maximum. Labor did not encourage competition in telecommunication markets as there was a duopoly between Telstra and Optus. This did not see substantial reductions in prices, have seen in the recent past. It was a coalition government that delivered price competition. Some try to argue that quality of vices can be delivered through the control of Telstra. Actually, Telstra is controlled by regulation, not through ownership. Labor's plan for Telstra, as far as we can see, would see a return to the bad old days of having a monopoly. Labor do not seem to have a forward vision for telecommunications. Their only response to the telecommunications argument is that of public ownership. They think public ownership is the key-back to the days of the PMG. This government is looking forward. Labor have no vision for telecommunications. Labor have no vision to take this country forward with telecommunications infrastructure. Their only policy initiative is to look backwards, to try and retard the government in its efforts to provide improved services-to try and replace its forward vision with an idea that takes us back to the past. If you ask people around my electorate, perhaps in South West Rocks or Wooli, whether they like the roll-out of mobile phone towers, I am sure they would say they do. I am sure the people of Bonville are pleased to have the broadband that has been delivered under the broadband rollout. It is a ridiculous notion that this government is not delivering. The National Party and the Liberal Party are absolutely committed to delivering quality telecommunications services. Labor have squandered the proceeds that they received through the privatisation of Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank. They privatised those companies and still could not run a balanced budget. This government has been able to invest the proceeds of the sale of Telstra into improved telecommunications services. The member for New England is in the as we chamber. He obviously does not have a vision for telecommunications in his electorate. He wants the bad old days of full public ser- ownership. He wants to provide steam powered internet services for his electorate! He does not see the benefits of improved telecommunications services, as this government do. We want to take this country forward. We do not want to see steam powered internet services, as is the vision of the member for New England. We want to see highquality, high-speed broadband rolled out across the country as quickly as possible. We want to see a competitive regime for the provision of telecommunications services, providing access to a range of carriers and providing cheaper prices and better services. We want to see the introduction of new technologies, when they become available, right across this country. The proposed programs announced today are going to go a long way to seeing that happen. We, as a government, are very much focused on delivering the very best telecommunication services for the people of Australia.",117
184,Mr WINDSOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I think we have just heard a speech in favour of the retention of part-government ownership in Telstra! Contrary to what some of the Labor speakers have said, I believe that the government, as a partial owner of Telstra, has introduced some good initiatives. I think that has been driven by the political imperative-the capacity and the ability of members of parliament to drive some of the issues, particularly in regional Australia, to some degree of fruition and to create some political pressure. Regrettably, given the decision of today, that pressure will be taken off. If you listened to the Treasurer and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry yesterday-and others from the government side-you would have heard them say that they recognise that, for a fully privathis tised operation to exist, there has to be a profit imperative, not a service imperative, for those in remote and rural areas. I think it is a very sad day for country Australia and a very sad day for this parliament. Although members of the government, particularly the National Party, are very excited about this initiative, there is not one member of the National Party in this chamber-other than you, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, and you are here in an official capacity. So quite obviously those members are fully aware that they have been run over by the Liberal bus on this decision. They are in disgrace in their electorates. They are in disgrace in Australia generally, with over 70 per cent of people not wanting this to happen. This is the ‘no excuses' parliament. There is no excuse for poor regional policy any more. You cannot blame the Greens or the Democrats for poor policy in the Senate. If the Senate takes this decision to alienate rural and regional Australia from the most important piece of infrastructure that exists-a piece of infrastructure that has the capacity to negate distances being a disadvantage for people living in Australia-it will be on the heads of the National Party. I noticed that the messiah of the nation last week, Senator Barnaby Joyce, has suddenly turned into the Judas goat of Queensland. He has come into the parliament and made wild claims about opposing the sale. He received my admiration for doing that because I thought: ‘Maybe for once there is a member of this party who will actually stand up for what the constituents in rural Australia are saying. Maybe for once there is a person who is prepared to stand up.' He did stand up for a little while, but he sat down again today. I think that is a real shame for the people of Queensland. It is a real shame, probably, for the individual. It is a great shame for nation that he has not stayed firm on this issue. I encourage him to rethink his position. But, Senator Joyce, do not go around this parliament saying, ‘I don't agree with the sale of Telstra but I had to accept something because Senator Murray from the Democrats or Senator Fielding from the Family First Party would vote for it.' Do not discredit those individuals to try and garner some sort of impression that you have done a good deal. This is a disgraceful deal. One thing that we have found out today is what is up to scratch. This term ‘up to scratch' has fascinated me for years. Senator Joyce and others have said that they will relate to experts in terms of what is required. The expert was down here last week: the new CEO of Telstra. He made a point that there had been a $5 billion underinvestment. There had been far too much of a focus on sale rather than service. He made the point that $5 billion is required. The minister has brushed that aside, the government has brushed that aside, Barnaby Joyce has brushed that aside and the National Party has brushed that aside. They have said, ‘You can have $1 billion now or over the next few years to look after the underinvestment that has been in place in current infrastructure and you can have the interest off this $2 billion fund.' In the Leader of the National Party's words, the interest is about $100 million a year, which is $25 million a year less than what they have spent over the last eight, so it is a reduction in government spending in terms of ongoing future proofing of the instrumentality. If we assume that the CEO knows something about telecommunications, he believes that $5 billion would need to be invested immediately to bring it up to scratch. If we look at how that is going to come about now, it will take 40 years to get Telstra up to scratch in 2005. There is the $1 billion that they are giving now and the other $4 billion will come over 40 years at $100 million a year. That is what this parliament is looking at doing. That is what the National Party and other country members in this parliament are prepared to do to their constituency. We will be up to scratch in 40 years time. That is assuming that the $5 billion underinvestment is true. But the CEO is the closest expert and should be the closest expert in terms of the decision-making process. So all of those who have stood up in here and said, ‘We won't do anything until it's up to scratch,' should come back in 40 years time-and the line in the sand is 2005. I think that is the disgrace- ringful act that is being perpetrated on the people of Australia and regional Australia today. No wonder there is not a member of the National Party in this room. No wonder they are not boasting about it, because they have been done over like a dinner. I have been speaking to the Liberals and they are laughing at this. This is a far better deal than they ever contemplated. They have got the sale. Mr Wilkie interjecting",119

Public Works Committee Reports",129
225,Mrs MOYLAN,EXTERNAL TERRITORIES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th and 15th reports for 2005 of the committee relating to: Holsworthy program-special operations working accommodation and base redevelopment stage 1; proposed CSIRO entomology bioscience laboratory at Black Mountain, Canberra; operational upgrade of Darwin detention facility, Berrimah, Northern Territory; upgrade patrol boat facilities, HMAS Coonawarra, Darwin; and redevelopment of Kokoda Barracks, Canungra, Queensland. Ordered that the reports be made parliamentary papers.",131
226,Mrs MOYLAN,EXTERNAL TERRITORIES,"by leave-The committee's 11th report of 2005 addresses the construction of working accommodation for special operations forces and stage 1 of the redevelopment of Holsworthy Barracks, New South Wales. The proposed works will facilitate the establishment of the Army's full time commando capability, based upon the 4th Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment (Commando); the Tactical Assault Group (East) becoming an organic element of the 4th Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment (Commando); the Incident Response Regiment; Special Operations Combat Services Support Company; and the first stage of the redevelopment of Holsworthy Barracks. Having investigated the proposal, the committee is satisfied that the works will improve amenity for and operational efficiency of the important Army units accommodated at Holsworthy. The committee therefore recommends that the works proceed at the estimated cost of $207.7 million. The committee's 12th report of 2005 examines the proposed construction of a new entomology bioscience laboratory at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's (CSIRO's) Black Mountain campus in the ACT. The CSIRO reported that the Division of Entomology currently conducts scientific research in buildings that range in age from 32 to 76 years old. These buildings: do not meet contemporary research standards; have, in some instances, structural constraints which prevent them being refurbished to a level commensurate with current and evolving laboratory standards; do not meet current OH&S of standards; and cannot accommodate anticipated division growth. To redress these deficiencies, the CSIRO proposes to: construct a new two-storey, 2,313 square metre entomology bioscience laboratory; refurbish two existing buildings; construct covered walkways to link the new and existing buildings; and carry out associated site works and landscaping, including demolition of redundant buildings and sheds. Noting that some of the redundant buildings contain asbestos, the committee recommends that the CSIRO take all necessary steps to identify and ensure the safe removal and disposal of hazardous materials from the site. The committee also recommends that the CSIRO continues discussion with the National Capital Authority to resolve any outstanding design issues. Having considered the proposal in detail, members are satisfied that the works should proceed at the estimated cost of $12.7 million. The committee's 13th report of 2005 deals with a proposal by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, DIMIA, to carry out an operational upgrade of the detention facility at Berrimah, Northern Territory, at an estimated cost of $8.21 million. The primary purpose of the proposed works is to establish a safe and secure land based detention facility for illegal foreign fishers apprehended in Australia's northern waters. The department reported that illegal foreign fishing in Australia's northern waters has been increasing in recent years and that current boat based detention arrangements have proven unmanageable. It is envisaged that, in addition to illegal foreign fishers, the facility will accommodate Northern Territory immigration compliance cases and unauthorised air arrivals, some of whom the department told us would be women and children. The committee notes that the department's proposal contains a significant number of undetermined factors which may be expected to impact upon the project cost. Whilst cognisant of the difficulties associated with estimating project budgets under modern procurement arrangements, the committee requests that agencies supply the most robust and comprehensive costs available in order that the committee can fulfil its statutory as a scrutineer of public expenditure. The committee therefore recommends that DIMIA supply regular updates on expenditure throughout the course of the project. Having viewed both the existing facilities at the Berrimah detention centre and the plans for the upgrade, the committee remains unconvinced that the proposed family area represents the best use of available space or provides a reasonable level of amenity or security for detainees. Despite the recent changes to the government's policy in relation to the detention of families with children, the department explained that it may be necessary to hold people for a very short period of time for initial assessment. Given the inadequacy and inappropriateness of the proposed family area, the committee recommends that families including women and children are not detained at the facility. In the event that there is a demonstrated need for the short-term detention of families at the facility, the committee recommends that, in order to ensure appropriate provision of security-particularly separation from the large number of fishers that may be held at the centre-amenity and space for families, women and children, the department should better utilise the space available. The family area should be enlarged and should provide appropriate separation of all facilities, which is a major security issue, adequate indoor recreation space and a secure outdoor area of a suitable size to accommodate play equipment relocated from the existing large, grassed recreation area. The committee hopes that there will not be an occasion to keep families with children in this particular facility. The committee also wishes to ensure the reliability of DIMIA's project delivery strategy and recommends that the department supply the committee with an update on the chosen delivery methodology and the applirole cation of Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines to this process, when this information becomes available. Further, in the interest of transparency and good community relations, the committee recommends that DIMIA consult with the local community and with relevant Northern Territory government agencies in respect of the proposed works. In particular, the committee wishes DIMIA to consult with the office of the Northern Territory Chief Minister to find an appropriate name for the facility. Having given careful consideration to the proposal, the committee recommends that the works proceed at the estimated cost of $8.21 million. A further referral from the Department of Defence, namely the upgrade of patrol boat facilities at HMAS Coonawarra, Darwin, forms the subject of the committee's 14th report of 2005. The upgraded facilities, estimated to cost $19.17 million, will facilitate the introduction into service of the Armidale class patrol boat and will also provide a new facility for the Darwin Port Services Organisation. The committee notes Defence's efforts to minimise the environmental impacts of the proposed works and, in respect of any future dredging activities, recommends that the department maintain close consultation with the Northern Territory Department of Lands, Planning and Environment to ensure minimisation of damage to the marine environment. In view of the importance of fire protection and evacuation measures, the committee recommends that Defence supply it with details of the fire protection system proposed for the standby crew and port services organisation building, including any departures from the requirements of the Building Code of Australia, when these have been determined. The committee is satisfied with the evidence supplied by Defence and is happy for the works to proceed at the estimated cost of $19.17 million. The 15th report of 2005 presents the committee's findings in relation to the proposed redevelopment of Kokoda Barracks at Canungra, Queensland, for the Department of Defence. The purpose of the proposed work is to provide the working and domestic accommodation, and engineering services infrastructure required, for the ongoing delivery of effective training at the Canungra Military Training Area. The redevelopment entails: correction of working and training accommodation deficiencies; rationalisation of messing facilities; improvements to living-in accommodation for trainees; upgrade of the engineering services infrastructure; and disposal of redundant, high-maintenance facilities. During its inquiry, the committee investigated a range of barracks services; the design of the proposed new facilities; the removal of asbestos; heritage issues; and traffic management. The committee recommends that the works proceed at the estimated cost of $86.7 million and requests that Defence continue consultation with the Department of the Environment and Heritage regarding any heritage issues that may arise from the redevelopment project. These reports examine works representing some $336.28 million worth of Commonwealth expenditure. It has been a very heavy workload for the committee secretariat. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my committee colleagues and to thank Hansard and our committee secretariat for helping to facilitate this work in a timely manner. I commend the reports to the House.",132
227,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,EXTERNAL TERRITORIES,"Order! Just before proceeding and giving the call to the member for Gorton, the chair indicates to the minister at the table, the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads-I know that he might not have been directly involved-that for a period that might have been described as lengthy by some there was no member of the executive at the table. Whilst I do not think that this afternoon would have been exactly the time to have directly and immediately acted upon that, the chair notes that. I ask the minister, especially with his experience as the Chief Government Whip, if he could assist the House by ensuring that others that are on the roster are in the chamber.",134
228,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,EXTERNAL TERRITORIES,"by leave-I want to supplement the comments made by the member for Pearce in relation to these public worksnamely, the Holsworthy program special operations working accommodation and base redevelopment stage 1; the proposed CSIRO entomology bioscience laboratory at Black Mountain, Canberra; the operational upgrade at Darwin detention facility, Berrimah; the upgrade of patrol boat facilities at HMAS Coonawarra, Darwin; and the redevelopment of Kokoda Barracks, Canungra, Queensland. As the chair of the committee has indicated, the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works has an enormous workload. The committee members share the workload well. Indeed, the work is made that much easier as a result of the diligence and professionalism of the secretariat of the committee. I would like to express particular appreciation for their work. I support the comments made by the member for Pearce in relation to these five works. In particular, I would like to emphasise in relation to the operational upgrade of the Darwin Detention Facility Berrimah the need for DIMIA to take the committee's concerns on board in relation to what we are to do for children and families if we find them in a position to be enclosed behind fencesgiven, as I understand it, the shift in government policy in that regard. We have made it clear that we do not consider it appropriate for families and children to be placed in that situation. We hope that there is a capacity for that never to happen. The department has raised the point that there may be occasions on which emergencies require such detention, but we think that should be unnecessary. Indeed, we ask the department and the minister to look at that matter with a view to ensuring that that is avoided at all costs. Finally, in relation to that project, I again ask the department to make contact with the Northern Territory government. They have raised a concern that they do not want the detention centre in Darwin to be entitled ‘Darwin Detention Centre'. There are good reasons for the name change, we accept, without going through the reasons now. We understand why there is the need to change the name. However, committee members accepted the view that there is no need to call a detention centre ‘Darwin Detention Centre'. The Chief Minister and the Northern Territory government believed it was not in the interests of people residing in Darwin, in the Northern Territory. Other than the Perth detention centre, I think it is true to say all other centres in capital cities-Villawood, Maribyrnong-are not named after the city in which they reside. Therefore we hope that the department are able to consider the recommendations of the Public Works Committee in light of the request made by the Northern Territory government to ensure that that centre is not named the ‘Darwin Detention Centre'. Treaties Committee Report",134
229,Dr SOUTHCOTT,EXTERNAL TERRITORIES,"On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled: Report 66-Treaties tabled on 7 December 2004 (4), 15 March and 11 May 2005, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",135
230,Dr SOUTHCOTT,EXTERNAL TERRITORIES,"by leave-Report 66 contains the findings and recommendations of the review conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties of nine treaty actions tabled in parliament on 7 December 2004, 15 March 2005 and 11 May 2005. The treaty actions relate to the matters identified in the title of the report. I will comment on a selection of the treaty actions considered. The United Nations Convention against Corruption is a multilateral agreement designed to enhance international efforts to combat corruption. Although no changes to Commonwealth legislation are required to implement Australia's obligations under UNCAC, the committee raised two issues with this treaty. One issue, relating to whether a provision of the treaty is mandatory, discretionary or optional, changes the extent of the Commonwealth's power to legislate for it. The major issue the committee that considered was the degree to which this treaty confers additional jurisdiction on the Commonwealth through the use of the external affairs power under section 51(xxix) of the Constitution. The committee considers that the external affairs power is not always an ideal head of power from which to legislate, particularly where the treaty has the potential to significantly impact on the states and territories. Evidence to the committee suggested that the use of the external affairs power is limited to some extent by the Melbourne Corporation doctrine-that is, it is unlikely that the Commonwealth could enact legislation which relates to corrupt conduct of members of state parliaments, state executives and state courts in the discharge of their functions as state officials. Even so, the committee has made two recommendations asking the Attorney-General to advise the committee that there is no intention to use the external affairs power and UNCAC to pass legislation not foreshadowed in the NIA. The amendments to the SingaporeAustralia Free Trade Agreement add a further two universities-Murdoch University and the University of Tasmania-to the list of Australian universities whose graduates are recognised for admission as qualified lawyers in Singapore. As a South Australian, I am pleased to see Flinders University on the list of 10 and I look forward to the day that the University of Adelaide is added. Since 1995, Singapore armed forces have used the Shoalwater Bay training area. The committee supports the agreement between Australia and Singapore, which will allow the continued use of the Shoalwater Bay training area by the Singapore armed forces for five years from 31 December 2004. Report 66 also recommends the entry into force of a treaty between Australia and New Zealand that defines maritime boundaries between our two countries. This treaty serves as a model for bilateral cooperation on maritime boundaries. Lastly, the committee has recommended that a treaty which establishes a permanent and independent secretariat to administer the Antarctic Treaty consultation meeting enter into force. Australia has a large territorial claim and an extensive research program in Antarctica. The secretariat will be in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In conclusion, the committee believes it is in Australia's national interest for the nine treaties considered in report 66 to be ratified. I commend the report to the House.",135
231,Mr WILKIE,EXTERNAL TERRITORIES,"by leave-The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties' review included treaty actions from a diverse range of subject areas. Similarly to previous reviews, the committee's findings were based on an examination of the benefits to Australia of each treaty action. This included examining each of the nine treaty actions with regard to their impact on the political, diplomatic, security, economic and social ties between Australia and the treaty parties. Of particular interest in this batch of treaties is the United Nations Convention against Corruption. I will not talk about each of the treaty actions, because I thought I would complement the comments that the chair has already made. The United Nations Convention against Corruption will provide for a number of measures relating to corruption prevention and criminalisation, international cooperation in combating corruption, asset recovery, training and technical assistance and the establishment of a conference of the parties to the convention. In addition to recommending that binding treaty action be taken, the committee made two other recommendations. These recommendations relate to issues surrounding the Australian government's potential use of its external powers to override the will of the states and territories where implementation of this treaty is concerned. These recommendations are particularly important as the committee has encountered a similar situation with other treaties. Another treaty of interest is one that establish and define the exclusive economic zone and continental shelf boundaries between Australia and New Zealand in the Tasman Sea and adjacent areas of the southwestern Pacific Ocean. There are currently no agreed maritime boundaries between the countries, and I welcome this treaty, which will sort this matter out. I am particularly disappointed, though, that it would appear that many of the criteria used to determine these particular boundaries were not used in the case of East Timor. It was put to us by the department that we had to look at each case on its merit. I believe that some of the criteria that were used in determining the boundaries between Australia and New Zealand could in fact have been used when we were looking at the East Timor-Australia delineation. The Agreement on Cooperation in the Fields of Energy and Mineral Resources with the Republic of Korea will provide a framework to pursue areas of mutual benefit and interest in relation to energy and mineral products. The agreement includes provisions on the exchange of energy and mineral resources information; the promotion and facilitation of technical cooperation in the fields of energy and mineral resources; cooperation and facilitation of bilateral trade and investment in energy and mineral resources, including value added products and services; and the development and implementation of greenhouse gas mitigation projects in the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The final treaty I would like to make tion of is the Mutual Recognition Agreement on Conformity Assessment in relation to Medicines Goods Manufacturing Practice Inspection and Certification with Canada. The treaty will provide for reciprocal recognition of goods manufacturing practice certificates of medicines between Australia and will Canada. Under the current pharmaceutical inspection scheme, countries are not legally bound to supply information nor to do so in any specified time period. The treaty would afford certainty to Australian exporters of medicinal products and eliminate uncertainty and any delays or costs associated with retesting batches of medicines on import into Canada. I would like to comment on the agreement between Australia and Singapore on the use of the Shoalwater Bay training facility. I commend this particular move, having been to Shoalwater Bay and seen what is on offer there and the sorts of facilities that are being built by our partners. I think they are great facilities and it is a great treaty. I commend that to the House also. I would also like to send thanks to those who put forward submissions in relation to these matters and to the committee secretariat who have, once again, done a fantastic job.",136

233,Mr BARRESI,EXTERNAL TERRITORIES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Making it work: inquiry into independmen- ent contracting and labour hire arrangements, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",137
234,Mr BARRESI,EXTERNAL TERRITORIES,"by leave-I am pleased to present this report on independent contracting and labour hire arrangements. This inquiry was conducted at a time of increasing debate on the conditions of Australian workers, with possible changes to federal workplace relations legislation affecting the coverage of state legislation, including proposals to develop legislation to support independent contractors. In a highly competitive global market, flexibility and response times are crucial. As a result, demand from companies for labour hire and contractor services has increased over the last 20 years. Currently, over 10 per cent of the work force identify themselves as being independent contractors and nearly four per cent identify themselves as labour hire workers. These types of working arrangements are found across a wide variety of industries. Supporting labour hire and contracting arrangements is essential for a number of reasons. These include: meeting shortages of labour or fluctuating demands across industries and occupations; providing avenues for mature age workers to remain in the work force and transition employment opportunities for those seeking to enter the workforce; achieving efficiencies that enable us to compete in the global marketplace; and offering a range of working arrangements that may provide different lifestyle and remuneration benefits from those offered through direct employment options. It has been a challenging task for the committee to examine current state and federal workplace relations systems to identify strategies that provide a balance of freedoms and protections-and to do so with greater consistency across Australia. There are 16 recommendations included in the report, and they are: to address the occupational health and safety of labour hire workers and independent contractors; to improve access to skill development and training for labour hire workers; to establish a voluntary code of practice for the labour hire industry; to create greater consistency across federal, state and territory legislation in differentiating between independent contractors and employees; to improve access to information to outline the rights and responsibilities of independent contractors; to regulate independent contractors under commercial law; and to improve access to different dispute resolution procedures for independent contractors. The committee investigated whether labour hire and contracting arrangements are, in some instances, being used to evade responsibilities, particularly in the areas of occupational health and safety and employee entitlements. The committee does not condone the creation of artificial structures to avoid regulatory compliance by host businesses, labour hire agencies or contractors and it does not condone the creation of artificial independent contracting arrangements to avoid the incumbent responsibilities of an employee-employer relationship. Key to curbing possible sham arrangements is the national need for greater clarity and consistency in distinguishing between an employee and an independent contractor. The committee has opted for a pragmatic strategy-one that combines existing national approaches to achieve an Australia-wide national outcome. Essentially the strategies recommended are to provide assistance for establishing genuine arrangements and to reduce opportunities for establishing artificial arrangements that seek to avoid responsibilities. Considering independent contractors within commercial relationships provides the appropriate framework for supporting and developing independent contractors as businesses. It is important that these legitimate business relationships and choices are honoured and are not subject to excessive protectionist regulation. Improved access to relevant information on rights and responsibilities is key to ing there is informed choice in selecting working arrangements. Additionally, when a dispute arises regarding a contract for services, more accessible, affordable resolution procedures are necessary, such as use of the Federal Magistrates Court. Labour hire and independent contracting arrangements are a vital element of the Australian work force. A balanced approach of flexibility and protections has been sought to recognise the needs of labour hire agencies, workers, employers, principal contractors and independent contractors. Once again the members of the committee demonstrated considerable commitment to working together to report in a reasonably short time. I thank the deputy chair, the member for Gorton, and other members of the committee for their cooperation and dedication to the inquiry. While there has been dissent on party lines on some of the recommendations, overall there is unified support for the majority of the report. I also take this opportunity to thank the inquiry secretariat for their counsel, assistance and patience throughout the processparticularly Dr Anna Dacre, Alison Childs and their very hard working team. In conclusion, I would like to thank the many individuals and organisations who provided evidence to this inquiry through submissions or by appearing before the committee. The strategies outlined in this report are designed to make labour hire and independent contracting arrangements work for Australians and for Australian businesses. Together these strategies work to make a competitive Australia, offering a range of working arrangements to suit industry, occupation, employer and worker requirements. I commend the report to the House.",138
235,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,EXTERNAL TERRITORIES,"by leave-I rise to add to the comments made by the member for Deakin. Firstly, I would like to say that there was indeed a very short time frame for the committee and great regard was given to the pressures of time. It is true to say that therefore the committee members and the secretariat worked expeditiously to arrive at this outcome. But this afternoon I have to emphasise the concerns raised in the dissenting report. It is true to say that good work was done, as has already been expressed by the member for Deakin, the chair of the committee. Indeed, there was goodwill shown by committee members. However, it is important to note that Making it work: inquiry into independent contracting and labour hire arrangements made a total of 16 recommendations, of which nine were agreed to unanimously. A dissenting report provided alternatives to seven of the recommendations and made seven additional recommendations for the government to consider. It is the view of the dissenting members that, in some respects, the committee missed a golden opportunity to clear up the growing confusion as to who is an employee and who is a genuine contractor in the Australian work force. The committee's report, tabled today, also failed to provide any real clarification regarding the rights and responsibilities of labour hire agencies, employees and host employers. The report's findings, we argue, were prejudiced by the interference of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, who chose to release his own paper and set up his own closed inquiry on the same matter soon after referring it to the committee. In our view, the minister's disregard for the parliamentary committee process had an adverse influence upon the findings of the committee. In our view, the minister treated the parliamentary process with contempt. Having referred the matter to the committee in the first place, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations then chose to pre-empt the committee's findings and prejudice its deliberations by releasing a per with loaded assertions and opinions and by establishing his own closed inquiry on the same matter. This behaviour was another example of the government's abuse of parliamentary process and, in the view of the dissenting members, may have adversely affected the committee's recommendations. It was, in our view, an attempt to sideline parliamentary committee and influence the views of, in particular, government members of the committee. I now turn to the substantive matters raised in evidence given to the committee, starting with disguised forms of employment. Another way to expose workers to unfairness is to call them ‘contractors' and take away their employee entitlements. The dissenting report sought to clarify the delineation between an employee and a genuine independent contractor. The committee heard comprehensive and compelling evidence of sham arrangements and forms of disguised employment but, unfortunately, failed to recommend any concrete solutions to the growing problems of confusion and exploitation. Evidence showed that many workers were being forced to work as so-called independent contractors in order to avoid taxation and traditional employer responsibilities such as the payment of superannuation contributions and workers compensation insurance premiums. The evidence highlighted an absence of taxation laws to properly distinguish employees from independent contractors for the purpose of collecting the nation's revenue. Some witnesses asserted that the amount of revenue lost as a result runs into billions of dollars each year. Evidence given by Treasury underlined the inability of the Commonwealth to determine the extent of tax avoidance by employees wrongfully described as ‘contractors'. Although the personal services income legislation sought to prevent tax pa- avoidance, its effectiveness is unknown because, as confirmed by Treasury, well over 99.9 per cent of tax claims in this area are self-assessed. It is therefore not known whether these provisions, weak as they are, are being enforced properly. The extraordinarily high proportion of self-assessing PSI applicants fails to instil in the dissenting the members any confidence that the current system is an effective means of distinguishing genuine independent contractors from employees. The committee was concerned by the significant evidence highlighting the extraordinary growth of labour hire employment in the last 15 years. All committee members accepted the possible benefits of labour hire employment, but the report failed to recognise the intrinsic difficulties with labour hire arrangements. In particular, the committee failed to address the extremely high proportion of labour hire workers who are precariously employed. The rate of casualisation amongst labour hire employees exceeds 75 per cent, or more than three times the work force average. The committee received evidence of labour hire employees working for more than 10 years and still being described as casuals. The report failed to propose any relief from indefinitely being precariously employed. Furthermore, the committee received evidence that the triangular relationship involving labour hire agencies, host companies and labour hire workers has led to a blurring of legal obligations and entitlements in a number of areas such as occupational health and safety and return to work policies. Although the committee did identify some areas of concern, in our view it failed to provide solurepresent tions to the problem of assigning responsibilities in this area of work. Finally, I will describe in general terms the additional recommendations that the dissenting members felt the need to add as a result of a deficiency in the report. The senting members also recommended additional recommendations in order to fill the void left by the report. The recommendations include: proposals to prevent employees working for unreasonable periods as casuals, when they could appropriately be classified as permanents; shared occupational health and safety responsibilities for labour hire agencies and host employers; and the right for a contractor to choose their representative, whether that might be a trade union or not. Today I had the good fortune to meet with officials and members of the New South Wales branch of the Transport Workers Union. I also had the good fortune to listen to some of the members talk about their plight at a seminar held today at Parliament House. That was particularly relevant to this matter. I therefore think it is very important that government consider ensuring the right to be properly represented in the appropriate forums-which, the dissenting members would say, are the state and federal industrial commissions of this country-and that unions do not have limitations placed on their right to represent small businesses, which would be the case if the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005 were to be enacted to limit those rights of representation. No government should remove the right for small businesses to choose a union as their agent-their representative. Therefore, in the dissenting report we make specific reference to removing that restriction and ensuring that the trade unions have the right-as every other body would have-to contractors or small businesses, if they so wish it. I thank the Transport Workers Union for waiting through many divisions and being here this afternoon to witness the tabling of the report. I thank them for their contribution dis- as a union. They presented many witnesses-many workers, not just officials. I think all committee members were impressed by the organisation's ability to provide evidence from people directly affected by the laws of this land, and we certainly wanted to respond to their concerns in the form of this report. I will finish by saying that an effort was made by all members to find common ground. We can say that nine of the 17 recommendations in the body of the report were agreed to. There are certainly some good policies that could be adopted by government if those recommendations were agreed to. I guess where we differ is that we say that the seven alternative recommendations made by the dissenting members and a further seven additional recommendations that are to be found in the body of the dissenting report the should be adopted by government to ensure that the contractors, employees, labour hire companies, principal contractors and the like know exactly where they stand in the law.",139

237,Mr FITZGIBBON,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT BILL,"Hunter) (5.48 pm)Before being interrupted by question time, the MPI and subsequent interesting events, I was speaking to the Corporations Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005 and drawing on the extraordinary experience of a company known as Singleton Earthmoving Pty Ltd to make some important points which relate to the Corporations Law. I will briefly recap the story about this very viable company which was unnecessarily forced into administration by a person whom I would describe as a rogue liquidator. As a consequence, the main director of the company, Mr Bernard Wood, and all the unsecured creditors have lost their money. The only person who seems to have done well out of the decision to put the company into administration and consequently wind up the company is the liquidator himself, Mr Ariff. There is some good news at the end of all this. Mr Bernard Wood, a highly respectable character, has got back up on his feet and started a new company doing the same sort of work as he was doing previously. He has taken the resources of that company to attempt, at least, to pay back some of the money to the unsecured creditors. Of course, the original company is no longer a viable concern because, firstly, the liquidator seized all the plant and machinery of the company and, secondly, the liquidator is now owed up to $200,000 for his services. First Reading I am delighted to say that a week or so ago the creditors called another meeting to challenge the original decision of the creditors' meeting to pay this amount of remuneration to Mr Ariff and, indeed, to challenge the decision to wind up the company. Mr Bernard Wood and a number of creditors now claim that a Mr Gary Phillips, who apparently is the solicitor to Mr Ariff, was the person who either moved or seconded a number of these motions, including the motion to pay the remuneration to Mr Ariff, even though Mr Gary Phillips apparently had no status as a non-secured creditor and nor was he holding a proxy of an unsecured creditor.",142

239,Mr FITZGIBBON,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT BILL,"I will resist accepting the interjection from the member for Mitchell, as tempting as it is. In conclusion, I want to read part of a letter that Mr Wood sent to ASIC. A number of letters have been sent, but I just want to share this very quickly with the House. He says: Although I am a Director and the major unsecured creditor, this letter is in relation to me, with the advice of an experienced administrator, becoming the secured creditor by assuming the subrogation rights after paying out the National Bank. Rather than be paid ($276,000) from the administration I chose to have the unencumbered machinery to that value returned to me (which on October 10, 2004 the administrator seized without a court order). Nearly four months after becoming the secured creditor, hethat is, the administratorwill not release the machinery and refuses to reply to my correspondence. To date he has sold all encumbered plant, paid the financiers in full, kept the surplus along with the $290,000 debtor money collected. Not only will he not speak with me, but also the unsecured creditors. In addition, at the last creditors' meeting, December 17, 2004I should say that this letter is dated 18 April 2005where the main issue was to agree to his fees, he used a non-creditor or creditors' representative, a Mr Gary Phillips, to move a motion approving his  tor, convinced the other five who voted to pay the administrator and if they didn't the Supreme Court would approve the fees thereby incurring additional costs. In other words, Mr Ariff was threatening the unsecured creditors if they were not prepared to both back the motion to wind up the company and approve the remuneration for the administrator and subsequent liquidator. The letter continues: Speaking for all the unsecured creditors, is it possible for that December meeting to be deemed null and void due to an illegal vote? Hopefully Mr Wood's question has now been answered, given the most recent creditors' meeting held in Singleton only last week.",143
240,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT BILL,Do you seek leave to table that document?,143
241,Mr FITZGIBBON,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT BILL,"No, I do not think I need to, thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker; I have quoted extensively from the document. I am just amazed by this story. A good bloke had a good business that had been operating for 25 years, but a rogue director decided to seek to put the company into administration without any good reason. The administrator rolled up in Singleton in his Mercedes Benz and Zegna suit and recommended to a group of only partly informed, non-secured creditors that the company should be wound up. He seized all the possessions, rendering the company a nonviable concern. He has charged them a fortune to do so and, as a result, it is losers all around-other than for one Mr Ariff. I will close by repeating my call for the Treasurer to use his power under section 14 of the ASIC Act to intervene and instruct ASIC to revisit the issue if ASIC does not come up with any answers. I also call upon Mr Ariff to complete and make available the company's taxation returns for the year ending 2004 and 2005, which I am advised will show that there is no doubt that this company, Singleton Earthmoving, was very much a viable, ongoing concern.",143
242,Mr CADMAN,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT BILL,"I take an interest in a law that affects directors and their conduct, and I think that most Australians do in a cursory way, because they expect our company directors to be full of integrity. They expect them to be dynamic and good at their work and to make profits, but they do not expect them to make profits at the expense of others in the way we have just heard described and in the way in which Australians have observed in the HIH affair with Larry Adler and Mr Williams. The issue we are looking at today is a process whereby we are seeking to relieve directors of an inadvertent responsibility which was placed on them by an understanding of the Supreme Court in South Australia. It was not intended by the legislation when it was introduced, not intended by any comments of ministers at that time and not intended by this government or the opposition. The Australian Credit Management Law Bulletin is hardly bedtime reading, but, in this instance, it is interesting in that it clear explanation of why the government is moving to make the changes to the trustees' responsibility in a case where they are liable for the trust debt. This is the story. John ONEILL owned the shopping centre on the Belair Road in Kingswood, South Australia. Daroko Pty Ltd was a tenant, and Mr Kerry Hanel was the sole director of Daroko. Daroko was the trustee of the Daroko-(Quorum formed) I thank my colleagues for supporting me in such great numbers for this important debate on the Corporations Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005. I know they cannot wait till this bill passes the House so they can take it back to their electorates, filled with excitement about explaining to their electors and their constituents how significant this legislation is. In the field of corporate law, this is a significant bill. I have just described the way it became necessary for the government to proclaim this amendment, following the case in 2003 of Kerry Stirling Hanel and Anor v John ONEILL. A clause in the trust deed of the Daroko Unit Trust provided a comprehensive indemnity to Daroko, the company. The lease was for a term of five years from October 1998. It was due to expire on 30 September 2003. However, Hanel lost his Wendy's franchise business, so Daroko gave notice that it intended to vacate the premises on 30 June 2001. Before then, the Daroko Unit Trust-which had made a profit of $512,617-paid out all its fund to Hanel's personal trust, which left both Daroko and the Daroko Unit Trust without assets. In July 2002, ONEILL obtained judgment in the Adelaide Magistrates Court for $23,132.62, which he said were the costs associated with obtaining a tenant to replace Daroko. ONEILL sought to enforce this judgment but, in September, Hanel informed the court that, without any assets, Daroko was gives a unable to pay the judgment. ONEILL then applied for an order under section 197 of the Corporations Act. This section says in part: (1) A person who is a director of a corporation when it incurs a liability while acting, or purporting to act, as trustee, is liable to discharge the whole or a part of the liability if the corporation: (a) has not, and cannot, discharge the liability or that part of it; and (b) is not entitled to be fully indemnified against the liability out of trust assets. This is so, even if the trust does not have enough assets to indemnify the trustee. ONEILL argued that, as Hanel was the sole director of Daroko, Hanel was personally liable for the debt. ONEILL claimed the judgment debt of $23,132.62 plus a further $15,928.51 for a shortfall of rent. In December, ONEILL was awarded summary judgment against Hanel for the $23,132.62. Hanel appealed. Hanel argued that section 197 of the Corporations Act did not apply, as the trust deed contained an indemnity for the trustee against the assets of the trust. What we have here is a guy who has lost his franchise and wants to get out of the business. I understand that he had replacement lessees willing to come in and take over his lease, without any damage to the lessor. The lessor was slow in making up his mind whether to accept the new lessee. Time expired and there was a gap in the rent. The original lessee said: ‘I had this person ready to go, but you were not prepared to make the decision to accept them; therefore, I do not owe you that money. I haven't got anything to back you up.' The lessor said, ‘I'm going to get the money out of you one way or another. You have a trust but it is bare, so I am going after you personally because that is where the trust money finished up.' Hanel appealed against the decision that awarded the costs of $23,132.62 to the lessor, Mr ONEILL. Hanel argued that section 197 of the Corporations Act did not apply, as the trust deed contained an indemnity for the trustee against the assets of the trust. ONEILL argued that Hanel, as trustee, could not be indemnified because the Daroko Unit Trust did not have the assets to provide the indemnity, which was a situation in which Hanel had been involved. By a two to one majority, the Supreme Court agreed that section 197(1)(b) was to be interpreted so that a director could not escape personal liability merely by ensuring that a clause was written into the trust deed which could operate as a shield against personal liability, even though the director had caused the trust to be without funds to avoid paying the debt. The wash-up of it is that the accounting community, the credit management groups, the government and the opposition-in fact, all those who understand the responsibilities of directors-think this is an unusual and very broad decision that the court in South Australia has taken based on a single case. It is therefore necessary for the government to make an amendment to restore the situation to what it was previously. To clarify the act, we are moving the amendment today. I am very pleased that the government has sought to bring common sense into the situation. It recognises that we must have in Australia an impeccable set of directors running Australian businesses who have the confidence of the community-who are the investors-the confidence of their workers and the confidence of all the arms of government that are there to regulate the process. If we can achieve that, we will have great export sales and a vibrant business community, where people can invest with confidence and businesses can steam ahead and employ people-which in part is their purpose. I have great pleasure in supporting this amendment. I think it is sensible and within the philosophy of the government.  Secretary to the Treasurer) (6.06 pm)-in reply-I thank members for their participation in the second reading debate on the Corporations Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005. This bill will clarify the scope of the personal liability of directors of corporate trustees. It will address concerns that have arisen in the light of the recent decision in Hanel and ONEILL, which extended the personal liability of these directors under subsection 197(1) of the Corporations Act 2001. Prior to the December 2003 decision of the Full Court of the South Australian Supreme Court in Hanel, section 197and its predecessors had traditionally been interpreted as applying in very limited circumstances. These were where the corporate trustee's right to be indemnified out of trust assets was lost due to the trustee's conduct or where the terms of the trust deed were designed or could operate to deny creditors' access to trust assets to meet liabilities incurred by the corporation. (Quorum formed) Hanel and ONEILL significantly expanded the potential personal liability of directors of corporate trustees, from large superannuation trusts through to trading trusts running a small business. In essence, that decision effectively made directors of corporate trustees guarantors of trust liabilities. The proposed amendment contained in schedule 1 to this bill will, therefore, operate to restore the long standing interpretation of subsection 197(1). In addition to the clarification of subsection 197 of the Corporations Act, this bill also contains a technical amendment to clarify the operation of a transitional provision in the CLERP 9 legislation. This will ensure that the auditor independence provisions which applied before the enactment of that legislation continue to apply to financial years commencing prior to 1 July 2004. I note that the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee has commented on the retrospective commencement of the amendment in schedule 2 to this bill. The committee noted that the amendment did nothing more than preserve and give effect to the intention of the pre-CLERP 9 legislation. In concluding, I take this opportunity to note that this bill work to rebuild business confidence. Importantly, it will also preserve the application of the auditor independence provisions of the pre-CLERP 9 legislation. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

243,Mr MURPHY,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND," Mr Deputy Speaker Baldwin, our speaker is on his way to the chamber and he will be here very shortly. I am sure he will come rushing in the door. (Quorum formed)",146
244,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"Labor oppose the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment Bill 2005. We do so for the following reasons. Firstly, the bill proposes to remove the need for government agencies to negotiate occupational health and safety agreements with unions and employees, through the introduction of so-called management arrangements. Secondly, the bill will remove all references to ‘unions' and replace them with references to ‘employee representatives', defined as either a ‘regiswill tered organisation' or a ‘workplace staff association', which must now be invited into the workplace by an employee. Thirdly, the bill will require that an employee invite an employee representative to initiate an occupational health and safety investigation, where previously a union could make directly to Comcare such a request to investigate a workplace. Fourthly, employee representatives involved in developing occupational health and safety management arrangements must be issued with a certificate by the CEO of Comcare, valid only for a 12month period. Finally, the bill empowers employers to conduct the election of employee health and safety representatives, a role previously conducted by a union or a person specified by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission, which the government proposes to abolish through legislation passed through this House yesterday. Regrettably, Australia continues to have a poor record with respect to work related death, injury and illness. It is estimated that there are around 3,000 work related deaths in Australia each year-more than the national road toll. When one breaks this down, the true gravity of the situation becomes apparent. Nearly 450 of these work related deaths, an average of nearly 10 per week, are the result of a traumatic incident at work, including work related road deaths. A further 150 deaths occur while Australian employees travel to or from work, with another 200 people dying each year as a result of someone else's work activity. In 1996, National Occupational Health and Safety Commission researchers arrived at a conservative estimate that at least 2,300 people died each year as a result of work related exposure to chemicals. This does not reflect the current extent of death from occupational disease. In the near future, this ure may rise due to the expected increase in asbestos related deaths, a tragedy that for many decades has continued its macabre assault on working Australians, particularly through the Wittenoom disaster and the James Hardie disgrace. Australia has the highest incidence of asbestos related disease in the developed world. The incidence in Australia has been rising steeply since 1970, and it is estimated that the total number of asbestos related deaths will reach at least 40,000 and perhaps as many as 60,000 by 2020. More broadly, approximately 480,000 Australian employees experience a work related injury or illness each year. That lates to approximately 2.8 million Australians suffering from work related long-term health conditions. Each year there are around 140,000 compensated work related injuries resulting in an absence from work of one or more weeks. In comparison, there are over 13,500 road accidents involving casualties each year in Australia. That provides the context and background to the government's proposed changes to occupational health and safety arrangements. The Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment Bill 2005 proposes to amend the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991. That act provides the legal basis for the protection of the health and safety of Commonwealth employees in departments, statutory authorities and government business enterprises. This amendment bill is the government's third attempt to introduce the provisions contained in this bill-namely, the removal of unions from workplace occupational health and safety institutions. As such, it is instructive to consider the legislative history of the preceding bills and the reasons for their prefig- vious rejection by the parliament. The Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 is similar to its counterpart state and territory legislation, in that it follows the Robens model of occupational health and safety. The Robens model stems from the report of the committee on safety and welfare at work commissioned by the United Kingdom parliament in the early 1970s as a means of reducing the incidence of workplace death and injury. Essentially the approach by the Robens committee recommended greater selfregulation in the workplace through a collaborative approach between employers and transemployees. Importantly, the Robens model recognised the role unions play as employee representatives. As such, the principle of freedom of association was an important part of the Robens approach. The Robens model was largely followed in subsequent and similar inquiries conducted by both the states and the Commonwealth. Consequently, occupational health and safety committees have now become a familiar part of the industrial and workplace landscape across Australia. The effectiveness of the Robens approach was supported by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission when it stated in November 2002: ... there is indirect but strong evidence that ployee participation, either direct or representaachieve tive, is an essential component of effective occuentry pational health and safety management. The government's first attempt to remove the role of unions in occupational health and safety matters was its Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment Bill 2000. The 2000 bill lapsed with the prorogation of the parliament for the 2001 election. Before the lapse of the bill, the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee prepared a report on the bill's provisions. The essence of the Labor senators' report was threefold. Firstly, there was a rejection of a reduced role for unions, under the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991. Labor senators took the view that the government's position was driven by ‘ideological rhetoric associated with labour market opposition'. Moreover, there was evidence presented to the committee that where ‘unions back members of health and safety committees, the results will be lower workers compensation claims'. Secondly, there existed concern over the vagaries of the proposed safety management arrangements, especially given the ongoing success of the existing policy approach. Qualified support was given for a more flexible, dual civil and criminal system of occupational health and safety enforcement and compliance. Democrat senators took the view that that 2000 bill should be passed with amendments. Senator Murray's report stated: A key area of concern to us is the place of unions in the maintenance and advancement of workplace health and safety. Unions supplement the regulatory and inspectorial roles of State OH&S departments in an irreplaceable way. Unions as a whole sometimes get criticised as a result of the actions of some unionists in misusing the provisions of the various State health and safety Acts. emSuch unionists raise non-existent H&S issues to other industrial objectives, and misuse and search provisions under the pretext of H&S. Such behaviour needs to be addressed. However the way to deal with these abuses is not to clamp down on legitimate useful or effective union H&S activity. The government's second attempt was in June 2002 with the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment (Employee Involvement and Compliance) Bill. That bill was referred to the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee, with Labor senators again recommending the amendment of the bill to remove provisions designed to reduce or remove union involvement in health and safety outcomes. Democrat senators stated that their position remained unchanged because the 2002 bill did not address the concerns raised in the 2000 Senate report. Some elements of that 2002 bill were subsequently enacted in the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment (Employee Involvement and Compliance) Act 2004, which introduced a more flexible compliance regime. Senate amendments supported by Labor and the Democrats significantly diluted the original intent and key provisions of that 2002 bill. With that legislative summary, we come to this 2005 bill. Its proposed amendments are modelled on provisions unsuccessfully brought before the parliament in 2002, in particular as part of the employee involvement and compliance bill of that year. Let me refer to the bill's proposed provisions in respect of management arrangements. The bill proposes the introduction of management arrangements to replace occupational health and safety agreements traditionally developed through tripartite processes between unions, employers and employees. These management arrangements replace the requirement for government agencies to negotiate health and safety agreements with unions and employees to govern occupational health and safety matters. Current legislation provides for occupational health and safety committee meetings every three months, with committee meeting minutes kept for three years. These time frames will now be decided by the management arrangements. The bill also intends to remove all references to ‘unions' and replace them with ‘employee representatives', defined as either a ‘registered organisation' or a ‘workplace staff association'. The bill defines a workplace staff association as an: ... association of employees, a principal purpose of which is the protection and promotion of the employee's interests in matters concerning their employment. Additionally, the bill also proposes that employee representatives must be invited into the workplace by an employee. Furthermore, under the provisions of the bill, an employee must invite the employee representative to initiate any investigation into occupational health and safety matters. Under the current act a union is able to directly request Comcare to investigate a workplace. The bill also proposes that employee representative organisations request the right to be involved in occupational health and safety consultations by submission to the chief executive of Comcare. The Comcare chief executive may or may not then issue a certificate with whatever conditions are deemed necessary, with validity for a fixed period of 12 months. Finally, the bill also provides for employers to conduct the election of employee health and safety representatives, a role previously conducted by a union or a person specified by the soon to be abolished National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. In 2000 and 2002 the government failed to outline a sound analysis as to why the current provisions and policy approach of the act needed to be changed. In 2005 nothing has changed. In his second reading speech on 23 June, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations stated: The Australian government believes strongly that safe and productive workplaces rely on a cooperative approach between employers and employees to identify and eliminate hazards that may cause injury or death. Obviously this cooperative approach does not extend to the inclusion of unions in public sector occupational health and safety matters and institutions. Occupational health and safety matters are best developed through the tripartite processes involving unions, employers and employees based on the long standing Robens model. This bill dismantles this tripartism and that approach, making it more difficult for employees to be adequately represented in these vital occupational health and safety matters. Academic evidence suggests a very strong link between union presence and involvement and improved occupational health and safety outcomes. In his July 2003 paper entitled Workplace arrangements for health and safety in the 21st century Professor David Walters outlined international research that clearly demonstrates that active and organised workers' representation is effective in ameliorating workplace hazards, that better standards are achieved in unionised workplaces than in non-unionised workplaces, that trained representatives stimulate and participate in workplace occupational health and safety structures and procedures and tackle new occupational health and safety issues, that work force participation in health and safety decisions is one of several factors related to lower claim rates and, finally, the empowerment of the work force was shown in Canadian studies to be one of the organisational reasons consistently related to lower injury rates. Empowerment in this situation includes the presence of unions, union support for worker members of joint health and safety committees and general worker participation in decision making. These conclusions are further supported by Johnstone, Quinlan and Walters in their 2004 report Statutory occupational health and safety workplace arrangements for the modern labour market. They quoted a range of international and Australian studies. They said: While there is considerable variation in the detail of these findings, taken collectively, they all support to the notion that joint arrangements, trade unions and trade union representation on health and safety at the workplace are associated with better health and safety outcomes than when employers manage occupational health and safety without representative worker participation. This bill proposes to remove all references to unions from the act. This effectively means that the role a trade union currently fulfils may be replaced by workplace staff associations. A workplace staff association may merely be a social club and may not fulfil the requirements mandated of a trade union, such as being democratic and independent. As such, by devolving responsibility from unions to employee representatives, as this bill proposes, strong occupational health and safety processes and outcomes will become increasingly difficult to enforce. The government intends to throw employees back on their own resources instead of using the occupational health and safety expertise built up by unions and their membership over many years. Employee representatives will lack the independent information and assistance currently provided by unions, while representatives themselves are likely to be less forthcoming in occupational health and safety negotiations with their employers. As an example, unions currently protect workers who may be afraid to raise certain occupational health and safety issues with their immediate supervisors. At present, workers can take such issues to the union and protect themselves from any personal repercussions. This will no longer be the case under the provisions of this bill. Furthermore, the proposal that a union member must seek permission from a public official-the Chief Executive of Comcarewho may or may not agree to involve a union representative in occupational health and safety matters is more likely than not to be a breach of the terms of ILO Convention 87, lend freedom of association, to which Australia became a party in 1973. Finally, the bill proposes that employers, not employees, control the election of employees' occupational health and safety representatives. This provision is a blatant attempt to ostracise unions from the occupational health and safety processes within Australian public sector workplaces. In the area of workplace relations the Howard government consistently talks about choice. It is ironic then that this bill seeks to curtail the choice of Australian employees working in the public sector to be represented by a union in occupational health and safety matters. This bill represents the government's third legislative attempt to deny Australian employees the basic and fundamental right to be represented by a union, if they so choose, in occupational health and safety matters. As such, it is driven by the government's extreme ideology rather than by any sense of sound public policy outcomes. Australian trade unions have a strong track record of protecting employees from unsafe work practices and places. It is clear that health and safety outcomes are dependent upon higher levels of worker participation and union support. Based on the research that I referred to earlier, removing the role of unions and replacing them with management driven processes will lead to less safe and less healthy workplaces. Unions have a legitimate role to play in the monitoring and enforcement of occupational health and safety matters in the public sector. Unions exist as a very important and necessary safeguard. I use the word ‘safeguard' because many occupational health and safety issues are already dealt with on a oneon-one basis in the workplace, between employees and/or between employees and their managers or supervisors. There are already many examples where occupational health and safety issues arise on a daily basis and employees, between themselves or with their managers, resolve them efficiently and expeditiously. In such cases, the involvement of unions as a third party is not a prerequisite and often does not occur because it is often not required or requested. There is no mandatory involvement of unions in such issues as the government would have us believe. We already have both union and non-union employees working cooperatively with management and achieving successful results in improving occupational health and safety standards, so the government's attempt to ostracise unions entirely from these matters is comprehensible only if one appreciates the government's ideological approach in these matters. The changes contained in this bill are so unashamedly anti-union, based as they are on that extreme ideological view, that neither an individual trade union nor the organised trade union movement has a role to play in occupational health and safety matters in the workplace. Mr Deputy Speaker, I simply put to you the illustration of the trade union movement coming to the assistance of the victims of James Hardie. Just ask yourself this simple question: where would the asbestosis and mesothelioma victims of James Hardie have been without the assistance of the trade union movement? I did not see employer associations come to the rescue of the victims of James Hardie. I did not see the Prime Minister, I did not see the Treasurer and I did not see the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. It fell to the organised trade union movement to come to the defence of fellow Australians to ensure some semblance of justice was done. If for no other reason, that in itself is justification of the legitimate role of the trade union movement in today's economic and social affairs-in particular, involvement in today's workplaces and especially when that relates to occupational health and safety. The government does not see it this way-a point that becomes clear when one examines this bill. That should come as no surprise to those who have followed the Prime Minister's 30 years of public life and views about public policy. Workplace health and safety must be a priority. It must be adequately resourced for employers and employees to enforce effective occupational health and safety rules and regulations. This is incumbent upon everyone in the workplace because no-one wins if working conditions deteriorate or when workplace accidents or fatalities occur. This bill is illconceived. It is nothing more than an ideological attack on unions, with no public policy benefit. This parliament should reject it.",146
245,Mr LINDSAY,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"The Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment Bill 2005 supports the people who are most important to the government-the workers of this country-and delivers to them a choice. I want to underline to the parliament that the Howard government are not against unions; we are not union bashers. There is a place for unions in this country, and the government will always ensure that there is a place for unions in this country. But there also has to be a place for those who do not need the services of a union or who do not want the mandated services of a union. What is wrong about that? That is fair. The opposition, of course, is in a position where it has to toe the union line. Everything it does and says is to support the continuation of a system which is now way out of date in this country-the world has moved on; the country has moved on. Certainly the union movement has laid the seeds of its own irrelevance by the way that it has operated politically rather than in the interests of the members it is supposed to represent. The government believe in safe workplaces. It will come as a surprise to the member for Perth and others that these days workers and employers believe in safe workplaces. Why is safety the most important thing in a workplace? Because it is in nobody's interest that the rules of safe workplaces be ignored. It is not in the employer's interest, because productivity falls if there a workplace accident. It is not in the employee's interest, obviously, because nobody wants to have an accident. These days, if you go into a modern workplace, you will find, whether you are talking to the employer or to the employee, that safety is number one on everybody's agenda. I have been into many workplaces, both large and small, and have confirmed for myself that, in formerly solidly unionised workplaces which now have no union membership at all in the workplace, safety is still number one for both employers and employees. What does this bill do? In workplaces in the Public Service, where unions currently have a mandated right, this bill allows employers and employees, not just the unions, to consult with each other about workplace practices and to determine OH&S arrangements. (Quorum formed) The member for Shortland clearly does not want to hear that the union membership in Centrelink in my electorate has now fallen to less than 50 per cent. That is because unions are irrelevant now in the Commonwealth Public Service. The member for Shortland wants the unions to have a mandated right to determine OH&S arrangements in the Public Service.",152
246,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"If members are going to remain in the House, I ask them to resume their seats.",152
247,Mr LINDSAY,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,The government does not believe that that is fair. The government does not believe that that is right. The government has proposed the bill before the parliament this evening,152
248,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"The member for Mitchell and the member for Grey! If you want to remain in the House, resume your seats.",152
249,Mr LINDSAY,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"Fair go, Mr Deputy is Speaker. Labor will oppose this bill because they are doing the bidding of the Commonwealth public sector union. I do not know why in this modern day and age they do not understand and recognise that the relevance of unions in the public sector is diminishing, and that it is diminishing because the employees themselves do not feel that they are getting value for money in being a member of a union. Labor is saying that unions should have a mandated and preferential role in every workplace regardless of the wishes of the workers. I have news for the Labor Party: the government has an opposite view. The government believes that workers and businesses should have the freedom to choose all their working arrangements to best suit their needs. As the member for Hume has observed, this benefits all Australians. Labor wants union membership to the exclusion of all other options. In relation to choice, an issue raised by member for Perth, Labor is contemptuous of workers' rights to choose an alternative to union representation, simply because for Labor-the member for Shortland-there is no alternative. Open your mind. Open your mind and understand that Australia is different these days. There are other models. Choice is good. There is no clearer example of that than in relation to Labor's attitude to Australian workplace agreements. What marvellous agreements they can produce between employer and employee at the workplace, without the interference of unions. As I said earlier in my contribution, the government is not opposed to unions. If an employee wants a bargaining agent in an AWA to be a union member or have union membership, they can. That is how flexible the government's workplace relations program is. I think that Labor is still very much opposed to Australian workplace agreements. But think of this too. Because it is tied up with the unions, as explained by its approach to this bill tonight, Labor would allow union bosses to walk into any business any time under the guise of a suspected OH&S breach even when there are no union members in the business. We cannot tolerate that. That is unfair. It gives the unions a privileged position to which they are not entitled. The government has presented this bill to the parliament tonight because it recognises that members of the Australian Public Service want to have a say in OH&S arrangements in their workplace. I challenge the Labor Party to explain to me and to the government why they should not have a saywhy individual members who are not union members should not have a say in OH&S arrangements in their individual workplace. Surely that is sensible. The position that the Australian Labor Party has adopted on this the bill is indefensible. That is why I will be strongly supporting it in the parliament when the vote comes tonight.",152
250,Ms HALL,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"Shortland) (6.48 pm)Australian workplaces are changing. Workers are working longer, which has implications for workplace safety. The longer hours that they work place increased physical and psychological demands on them. Here we have a situation in the workplace with longer hours, and we are looking at the legislation before us today, the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment Bill 2005. Safe workplaces are important to employers and to workers. They can be achieved only through good occupational health and safety. All research and authoritative information shows that this is best achieved through a tripartite process involving employers, workers and unions. Poor occupational health and safety leads to an unsafe workplace, which leads to increased injuries in the workplace, which in turn leads to costs for employers. It also leads to disability for workers. Everybody involved in the process is disadvantaged. It is a cost to all parties. I believe that it is strongly in the interests of everybody in every workplace to work together to see that there is good occupational health and safety within those workplaces and that workers are protected, not only for their benefit but for the benefit of employers. It is in the interests of all parties to avoid injury and promote a safe workplace. This is achieved not by sitting back and waiting until people injure themselves but rather by a proactive approach to occupational health and safety. Currently the situation that exists in workhealth places covered by this legislation is proactive. The question that I ask myself when I look at this legislation is: what will islation do to make workplaces safer, to reduce injuries, to reduce disability and to make sure that there are no lost working hours? Unfortunately, I cannot see that this will achieve any of that. Rather, I think it may make the workplace a little less safe than it is now. Unfortunately, I believe this legislation that we are considering in the liament tonight is not driven by occupational health and safety best practice. Rather, it is driven by a pathological hatred of unions. I think that members on the other side of this House need to look at the way the system is operating at the moment. At various times workplaces covered by this legislation have actually been models for employers, employees and workplaces throughout Australia. I find it very disturbing that there been a series of pieces of legislation introduced into this parliament to change the way very safe workplaces, workplaces that are models, are operating. I have had to come to the decision, very reluctantly, that this legislation is not about occupational health and safety. It is not about creating a workplace that is safe for all people. It is not about protecting the interests employers by ensuring that hours are not lost through injury in the workplace. Rather, this legislation is about the government's extreme industrial relations agenda. It is driven by ideologues who are not interested in safety, and I think they have lost their perspective. When you are looking at the purpose of occupational health and safety and the roles of all the parties involved in occupational health and safety, you are looking at creating a safe workplace; you are not looking at union bashing. I am rather saddened by the fact that this parliament has taken occupational and safety to this level, with the belittling of occupational health and safety within workplaces, putting it down to an issue of this legwhether or not unions are involved. This legislation removes the need for employers in government agencies to negotiate occupational health and safety agreements with unions and employees, through the introduction of management arrangements. Management arrangements can address consultation, training and risk management. All par- references to unions are removed and replaced with ‘employee representation'either a registered organisation or a workplace staff association. Why the paranoia about unions? Is it some sort of a crime now to mention unions? Is it some sort of a crime for unions to be involved? I think that unions have played a very important role in occupational health and safety. As somebody who has worked in that has area before becoming a member of parliament-and I am not talking about working in the area of unions; I am talking about having worked in occupational health and safety, in rehabilitation and with people who have been injured within the workplace-I know how important that tripartite arrangement is. I also know how good the occupational health and safety has been in organisations of and departments that have been covered by this legislation. That is why I am so disappointed with the direction that we are taking. We are not looking at what will have the best outcome for all parties; rather we are being driven by this ideological hatred of unions. In addition, under this proposed legislation employee representatives must be invited into the workplace by an employee. That is hardly a proactive approach. I think one of the best aspects of a good occupational health and safety policy within a workplace is to have a proactive policy-one that looks at the whole of the workplace, makes recommendations and ensures that workers observe the proper safety procedures within that workplace. Workers can become very complacent too. They can be in a workplace and not take into account their proper rest periods. They may not sit properly on their chairs. They may not have the computer workstation set up properly. I am sure that the members of this House, when they are working, do not all always take into account the proper occupational health and safety approach. That is where being proactive and having someone come into the workplace is very beneficial. Previously, a union could make a request to Comcare to investigate a workplace under the provisions of the existing legislation. Under this bill, an employee must invite them in. So no longer can a union say, ‘We'd like to come in, check out the workplace and make sure that the proper safety standards are in place.' Now they need to be invited in-and they will not be invited in until such time as there is a problem. This is the wrong way to approach occupational health and safety. You should be able to anticipate problems that will arise in the workplace. That way you prevent injury and lost working hours through injury, and at the same time you reduce the cost to the employer-in this case, invariably that is government. I think that this bill is a retrograde step. is something that the government really need to address, instead of getting caught on the hang-up they have about unions. This is not about unions; it is about a safe workplace. It is about protecting workers, protecting employers and having a safe working environment. Also, under this legislation employee representatives involved in developing occupational health and safety management arrangements must be issued with a certificate by the CEO of Comcare, valid for only 12 months. It allows employers to conduct elections of employee health and safety representatives, a role that was previously conducted by the union or a person specified by the commission. Once again, I feel that this bill is being driven wholly and solely by this government's hatred of unions-something that I really do not think occupational health and safety is about. I ask the government to look at it very reasonably and consider its implications. In the last parliament, I was involved in an inquiry conducted by the Standing Committee on Employment and Workplace Relations. The committee's report was called Back on the job: report into aspects of Australian workers compensation schemes. The terms of reference for that inquiry were geared strongly towards fraud-the incident cost of fraudulent claims and fraudulent conduct by employees and employers. It was directed toward fraudulent behaviour, and it also looked at issues related to workers compensation. One of the things that I found most upsetting at the time was that, when some members of the committee tried to get occupational health and safety written in as a term of reference, the minister would not include it. The committee looked at rehabilitation programs and the benefit of these, but once again I emphasise to the House that occupational health and safety is imperative It in any workplace. Minister Dutton was also part of that inquiry. I certainly hope that he learned from that inquiry the importance of occupational health and safety and that it is an issue that has an impact on each and every person involved in the workplace. That is what occupational health and safety is about. It is not about a union, employer or worker; it is about a safe workplace. Every piece of legislation, Minister, should be designed to develop that. This report detailed some of the important issues related to occupational health and safety-the kinds of things that I think occupational health and safety legislation should include. One of the recommendations was that there be a commitment to the national occupational health and safety strategy that was put in place for the years 2002 to 2012, to address the unacceptable level of workplace injuries and fatalities. That is what cupational health and safety is about. It is about attacking unions and getting unions out of the workplace; it is about creating a safe workplace. There were five national priorities: reducing high incidence and severity of risk; developing the capacity of business operators and workers to manage occupational health and safety effectively; preventing occupational disease more effectively; eliminating hazards at the design stage; and strengthening the capacity of government to influence occupational health and safety outcomes. Nowhere does it say that you get better occupational health and safety outcomes by getting unions out of the workplace. That is why I have a problem with this legislation: it is not about occupational health and safety; it is about attacking unions. Even this report highlighted the fact that unions did have an important role to playMr Dutton- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The point of order is on relevance. The member for Shortland has said so far that she is confused, disturbed and sad. We do not dispute any of that, but I do not know how that is relevant to this bill.",153
251,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,Order! There is no point of order.,156
252,Ms HALL,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"There can be no point of order because I am very clear about this legislation. The thing that confuses me is that members on the other side of this House do not understand what occupational health and safety is about. The minister has just demonstrated that to the House. Occupational health and safety is about a safe workplace. Minister, it is time that you learned and understood that. Mr Dutton- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Again, the point of order is on relevance. I do not understand how repeating verbatim the findings of the report can be oc- relevant to this debate. If the member for not Shortland wants to fill in time for the next five minutes",156
253,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,Order! The minister will resume his seat. There is no point of order. This is a debate about occupational health and safety. The member for Shortland is within her grounds.,156
254,Ms HALL,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"At no stage have I been reporting verbatim a report. Rather, I have been referring to a report that the minister was part of. It is an excellent report that makes some outstanding points about occupational health and safety, points that the minister has obviously moved away from since moving into his new role, given that this was a unanimous report supported by all sides of parliament. In this report-and this is a quote-it says: ...union involvement was a factor in the management of a workplace that affected safety and claims performance. The report found that unions contributed to safety within the workplace. From what I have read in this legislation and from what I have seen of the performance of Minister Dutton, I can only say that this is not about occupational health and safety. Having good strong occupational health and safety procedures benefits all parties. All government approaches to this issue should be driven by developing and adopting legislation that will deliver the best outcome-fewer injuries and deaths in the workplace. This delivers a benefit to all parties. Occupational health and safety is not about industrial relations, which is what this legislation is about. Rather than being about creating the safe working environment that I have spent so much time talking about and that I have emphasised to such an extent, this legislation is about the government having another go at the unions. Occupational health and safety is not about attacking unions; about creating a safe working environment which benefits all. Evidence demonstrates that this is best achieved through a tripartite approach involving workers, unions and employers.",156
255,Mr TUCKEY,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"It is interesting to hear the words of the member for Shortland. When I picked up a newspaper the other day-I think it was the West Australian-I read that a major export program under construction in the north-west of the state was stopped for the day when 600 workers went on strike because somebody implied that a box of gaskets might have had some asbestos in them. The gaskets might have had some asbestos in them, but surely it is purely industrial action when 600 people, some of whom would not have got within a bull's roar of that box of gaskets, all knock off for the day. The member for Shortland says that the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment Bill 2005 is some sort of ideological witchhunt of the trade union movement, but of course that claim is refuted by the minister's second reading speech, in which he said: The government is committed to improving health and safety outcomes in Commonwealth workplaces, and this bill follows amendments to the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 in 2004, which introduced a strong new compliance regime. That is the role of government and it is registered in black and white in Hansard. Of course, this raises the question of who should be responsible for looking after employees under that regime. The member for Shortland tells us that she once had a job on behalf of the trade union movement in this area. She seemed to be very vague about what she did when she had that job. She did not spend 10 minutes of her time giving us a rundown on the sorts of issues she had to deal with and on her knowledge of the act and how it it is should be applied in the workplace. She dropped a few crocodile tears about the fact that, in this government's view, it might be better if other people were the preferred supervisory agent. That is what this legislation is about. It gives employees-the people who, as the member for Shortland said, need to be protected-the right to say, ‘We don't particularly want somebody who's got no skills in this area and who's not a representative of the department that is responsible for policing these requirements.' (Quorum formed) I thank my colleagues for giving their attention to what will be a brilliant speech. The Chief Opposition Whip should have worked out a revised schedule, because his own shadow minister had 30 minutes to speak but only spoke for 15 minutes-because he could not think of anything else to say from a rational point of view. I was going to keep my contribution as brief as possible and give his side a bit of a go. But the reality now is that I will take my time. If he wants to call a couple more quorums, that is his business, but it will just delay the time at which the next speaker on his side will have an opportunity to speak in this place. So that is the point we should understand in all of this. It is interesting that the member for Shortland wants to call us ideologues. We have a pretty broad agenda on this side of the House. The ideology seems to come from the other side of the House: if it is not terests of trade union bureaucrats then it is wrong. Nothing else matters. It does not matter that family people would rather deal directly with their employer. It does not matter that, as I mentioned a minute ago, 600 people went off work in the Pilbara the other day because of a box of gaskets which were possibly made of asbestos and were maybe touched by about three people. If that is not industrial action, I will go ‘Hee'. We are told by the member for Shortland that longer hours are unsafe-I wish she would do something about them in this place-and that safe workplaces are good. I have already read from the minister's second reading speech where that fact is confirmed. But I ask the question again: what does that have to do with somebody in the trade union movement who does not know anything about industrial safety law but who just uses it as an opportunity to get in and try to sign up a few members? The workplace is quite able to understand whether it is at risk. The member for Shortland said: ‘And those workers do not even try to do this themselves. We've got to teach them a lesson. We've got to get Tom Domican or someone in there just to get people to understand what it is all about.' I am amazed. This legislation simply says that there is no special right for union representatives to walk through the front door of a probably safe workplace when they feel like it. It recognises the fact that, within the Commonwealth government and, for that matter, the state governments, large numbers of people are employed to police this sort of activity. And they get around the place. I was sitting in a factoryette the other day waiting for the delivery of an item that was being put together outside in a large warehouse with two people working in it, and two girls with clipboards came in. I thought, ‘Here are a couple of government inspectors.' They said: ‘We're in the infrom OH&S WA'-or whatever-‘Can we look around the place?' They had a look around the place, and they came back to the girl at reception and said, ‘We can smell cigarette smoke here.' That was apparently all they could find, but at least they were government inspectors and they had a legal right. But this legislation says that you do not get a legal right by being a trade union heavy. It says that, if you have a good reason, you might be invited by someone who has a genuine concern. And what is wrong with that? We do consider ourselves to be living in a free country. The member for Shortland says, ‘You've got to do this to make the workplace safer.' We agree with that, but Sharan Burrow does not. She says, ‘The quicker we can have someone killed this week, the better the case we'll have to put.' She says, ‘It would be pretty handy if someone got killed this week.' Can you believe that the second school teacher to lead the ACTU would be pleased if someone got severely injured this week so that she could make a political point and protect her job? What are we talking about, when people are so fixated on their own survival that they would propose the death or injury of a fellow Australian and, when questioned about it, stick their chest out and say: ‘I stand by what I said. It's all in the interest of the cause'? We know all about causes. They had those sorts of things in Russia and murdered millions of their own people. And we are supposed to have some pathological hatred of unions? I have been in a union-until they discovered I was there and asked me not to come back. We do not have a pathological hatred of unions, but we see they have a place.",157
256,Mr CADMAN,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,So the union sacked you?,158
257,Mr TUCKEY,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"Yes, the Transport Workers Union brought me in as an owner-driver. The bloke went back very happy about that-he'd got my fee-and then they found out in Perth who was in the team. But that is all right. What I am saying is that I understand unions. I have worked with unions, I have worked with the people and I have seen them come in and try to heavy someone who says: ‘I'm working as a barmaid in Carnarvon. I hope to be a typist in Port Hedland. How many unions do I have to join to have a trip up the north-west coast?' OH&S is the last bastion for trade union bureaucrats. Unions have been rejected by the general work force. They think they can invest their money better. But now they are going to be heavied by people coming in and saying, ‘I've come to save you.' It is ridiculous. This legislation is not an attack on unions. It is a protective measure for people who do not want their company, and I cannot see that there is anything wrong with that. It goes further. I am a great advocate for single mothers and others. I think it is more important in this day and age, and I am sure the minister would admit that I raised it with him only a little while ago. We would like to see single mothers in the work force. They would benefit from being in the work force, but they have family responsibilities-and it might not only be single mothers-and I constantly put a case to find opportunities to let them work from home. They send you emails, so you know they are computer literate. But, when I put this up, the first thing that people say to me is: ‘What about the OH&S problems in their homes? You've got to go and inspect them. You've got to get the union in there.' Unions hate home employment because it is too hard to organise. If that is the truth, if a home is so unsafe, no person should be able to carve the family meat without a steel glove on. It might help my wife, I have to admit. She has a bit of a problem with knives.",158
258,Dr EMERSON,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,I can understand that.,159
259,Mr TUCKEY,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"She is more inclined to cut herself than anyone else I know. I do not know why. If someone is happy in their own home environment and an employer says to them, ‘I can help you stay at home to work,' why do people say, ‘Don't you dare do that because OH&S will say that their house is totally unsafe'? I find that a bit ridiculous. But, again, it is only because the trade union bureaucracy is terrified that people who work from home might be a bit hard to find, a bit hard to sign up and a bit hard to get the union dues out of. This is the point. There is no reason whatsoever to give any segment of the community a right of entry to a workplace under the guise that they are going into save the workers. That is a role for a government inspector. The next thing is that we will be saying that the trade unions are allowed to come into your house because a burglar got in yesterday. We have a police force for that, and there are plenty of inspectors-I do not know how many-for workplaces. The state governments and others have ample processes for ensuring that from time to time there are checks on workplaces to see that they are meeting the laws as written by the parliaments of Australia. There is no reason in the world for there to be a special role for trade unions, particularly considering most of them have no idea what the particular legislation is. In Western Australia, I saw an inspector talking to an employer, and he had a book which was probably 50 millimetres thick. I bet the average trade union official is across all that-the only book he would have with him is a receipt book. These are ridiculous arguments to put forward, but they come, of course, from the party that sits opposite and, if they are not already of the trade union movement, they know that their existence depends on that 50 per cent vote in every preselection. Where else do you have that sort of domination in politics? It used to be 60 per cent, and a vious Leader of the Opposition reduced it to 50 per cent. That is pretty tough: you just have to find one other person to vote with you. Excuse me: it is just ridiculous. With regard to the opposition of the members opposite to this legislation, as I have said, their shadow minister could find only 15 minutes to talk about it. That is how serious their opposition is. This is a proposal underwrites OH&S throughout the work force but gives the work force the right to say who might come and do inspections-if they think that should be another public servant, good luck to them. Why should it be a self-appointed person who has a job and an ulterior motive? I do not think I can add any more to my comments, but I was astounded at the effort of the member for Shortland, who just seemed to want to say that this legislation is a product of pathological hatred and ideology. There is no ideology on this side; there is just a practical sense of responsibility to represent the people of Australia. The ideology that has been delivered to us and will be again in another couple of minutes is about why there is something special in this day and age about an organisation and a culture which is rejected by 75 per cent of Australians-and, let me say, half the remaining percentage are only there because it is a case of no ticket, no start. They have to pay the fees to get a living, and I hope we are able to deal with that matter too. If unions are so good-and they could take a bit of a lesson from their superannuation funds, which seem to be popular because apparently they give a good service, and I am very comfortable about that-and want business, they ought to get out and do the things workers truly want. Workers want them to give them services and representation in this modern world. They do not want pre- the unions to oppose working from home, if that is convenient to people. They do not want them coming around and harassing them when they are trying to complete a report or something for the governmentwhich, of course, will judge their future prospects in promotion. They do not want these people hanging around. But we know why they come around; it is to try either to cause that trouble or to get more business for themselves. Of course, as the member for Shortland said, safe workplaces are good. Nobody is contesting that. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations referred to that in the first couple of paragraphs of his second reading speech, but the reality is that this is about saying that nobody has an automatic right to enter someone else's workplace. Who was it-Kingham or whoever they eventually put in jail-who went and belted up women in a workplace? How much damage does that do, when people like that",159
260,Dr EMERSON,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The statement that was made by the member for O'Connor is completely offensive and completely wrong. He has just maligned Martin Kingham, who is guilty of none of those allegations, and he should not use the parliament to do so.",160
261,Mr TUCKEY,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"The reference was to Mr Kingham, although he does not reside in this place, but if it was not Mr Kingham it was Mr Johnson or another. If I have picked the wrong name, that will be a bit of a change for this side of the House, but it does not alter the fact that, when it comes to industrial health and safety, if you are a woman sitting at a computer and a bloke comes and picks it up in front of you and smashes it at your feet, that is not exactly the sort of contribution to industrial health and safety I would support, any more than I support Sharan Burrow saying, ‘Could you please kill someone this week, Mr Employer?' I have concluded my remarks. (Time expired)",160
262,Dr EMERSON,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"I point out that that comment, too, is completely false, erroneous and malicious, and it should not be made in this parliament. Sharan Burrow never made such a statement. The member for O'Connor has repeated a statement he made earlier in his speech, which is completely wrong and completely offensive.",161
263,The SPEAKER,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"The member for Rankin raises a point about whether the member has said something erroneous. That of itself does not require a withdrawal. The member does have other ways and means in the House to correct that, if he believes the member for O'Connor has got it wrong.",161
264,Dr EMERSON,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"I will take the opportunity in addressing the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment Bill 2005 to condemn the appalling statements made in this debate by a number of members on the other side of this parliament dent of the ACTU, Sharan Burrow-and also in relation to Mr Martin Kingham-have been. Those statements display the pathological hatred that members of the government have for the trade union movementthe organised labour movement of this country. The legislation before us here today is just another example of a pattern of behaviour on the part of this government, which is trying to destroy any and every activity of unions in our society and in our economy. The truth of the matter is seen in relation to superannuation, which I will go to immediately. The government wanted superannuation choice because it did not want unions involved in compulsory superannuation. In the area of occupational health and safety covered by this bill, again the government wants no role for unions. It has been trying to get this legislation through since 2000, but now, with its control of the Senate, we see the full colours of this government on display, in its pathological hatred for the trade union movement of this country. In relation to the asbestos debate, the previous speaker said that there was no role for the trade union movement, which has done a great job-Greg Combet has done a great job in that area. Debate interrupted. NA",161
265,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Telstra",161
266,Mr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"Scullin) (7.30 pm)Regrettably, today we have had one of the greatest sell-outs in telecommunications policy that Australia has ever seen. We have seen the National Party, which championed the interests of rural Australians, go for an easy price in the debate that has been held in about the Presithe coalition rooms. There is no case for the full privatisation of Telstra, the telecommunications company. At least while it is held in majority public ownership, there is an opportunity for government to influence it. When it is fully privatised, there will be no pressure points to ensure that people in the regions get services equal to those in metropolitan areas or that people in outer metropolitan areas get services equal to those in the CBDs. Long have I put on the record in this place my concern that, in outer urban electorates like Scullin, the services provided are not up to the same standard that we see provided to CBDs and other areas within cities. These are the things that have been forgotten by the government in the continuation of its want to sell the whole of Telstra. For outer metropolitan areas, the lack of infrastructure based competition means there is a need to find other ways of providing alternative metro fibre rings to ensure competition with Telstra. Many outer areas have black spots, as they lack the equivalent CBD broadband infrastructure. New advances in infrastructure technology are always applied first in CBDs and inner metropolitan areas, with delays in their implementation in outer metropolitan areas. These are the facts as we confront them now, and they will be made worse with the full sale of Telstra. We will see the community getting a poorer service at a higher charge. The government needs to realise that the Australian people know this. Polling that has been done indicates opposition at levels of approximately 70 per cent to the full sale of Telstra. And what do we see? In 1996 the government first established the Natural Heritage Fund, out of which $1.2 billion over five years was to be set aside for the environment. What was the reason for this? The government was dealing with the Democrats and the Greens and needed to buy them off. Now we see the government having managed to convince The Nationals to support the sale of Telstra for $3 billion-$1 billion to repair the current infrastructure, and the interest from a $2 billion trust to fund upgrades to services after Telstra is sold. What a joke. Compare that to the $5.7 billion that Sol Trujillo has identified as being needed to bring Australia's infrastructure up to world standard. Even with the partial privatisation of Telstra, we have seen line rentals rise from $11.65 to around $30. Australia with its broadband performance of 7.7 subscribers for every 100 people-the worse performance of any major industrialised country-is ranked 21st in the developed world. This is what we see from this government: shortterm decisions, decisions that are not thought out in the long term in the national interest. I am talking about local conditions that confront the people I represent, such as the difficulties that have been seen in new greenfield urban developments. An example is the Botanica Park development. It was not until the community came together that Country Wide, the Telstra program, was extended to take in outer metropolitan areas like the northern suburbs of Melbourne and, under HiBIS funding, we saw broadband services put into that community. We can see it in South Morang and we can see it in Epping North. If the developer does not put the infrastructure in at the time of subdivision, these people are left behind. As has been said, they are cut out of having proper businesses at home because, when it comes to competition, they are behind the eight ball. These are the sorts of things we really need to see addressed. Citizens and businesses fear the consequences of a predatory privatised Telstra operating unchecked, with no obligation except to its shareholders. When it comes to decisions about investment in new equipment and technology, a fully privatised Telstra will make decisions that optimise the return for its shareholders and not for the community itself. It is these problems that the government must address in the national interest. (Time expired) Chatsworth By-Election",161
267,Mr VASTA,ADJOURNMENT,"This Saturday a by-election will be held for the state seat of Chatsworth, which falls within the federal electorate of Bonner. Although it is a different level of government, I take a great interest in state politics because many of my constituents often contact me to tell me about the serious problems they are experiencing with our state run hospitals, schools and roads. It is a sad fact that the poorly managed and underfunded Queensland health system is responsible for more deaths than the London bombings. The by-election on Saturday will give the people of Chatsworth an opportunity to send a clear message to the Beattie government that it needs to get its priorities right. The by-election will also present an opportunity for residents to elect an effective and articulate new member to the parliament. The person I am referring to is a colleague of mine, Michael Caltabiano. Over the past nine years, Michael has served as a councillor for Chandler and has earned the reputation of a hard working community representative who gets things done. I urge the voters of Chatsworth to give Michael the opportunity to build on what he has already achieved for the area as their councillor. I know that Michael has the right priorities. He will not stand for neglect of our hospitals and schools. He will ensure that the Beattie government does not take the people of Chatsworth for granted. On a personal note, I also wish to point out that Michael's decision to stand for Chatsworth meant that he had to resign from his job as a local councillor. The fact that he has put everything on the line for this by-election shows his true commitment to the people of Chatsworth. I know that it cannot have been an easy decision for him to step down from his job, with a wife and two daughters to support-and I commend him for his courage. Local residents may have lost a councillor, but I am confident that they will gain an effective new state member in Michael Caltabiano. I am also confident that the great work Michael has done over the past nine years in council will be continued by Adrian Schrinner, who has been endorsed as the Liberal candidate for Chandler. Like Michael, Adrian is both a colleague and a close friend of mine. Adrian grew up in the ward of Chandler and attended a local school for 12 years. He is someone who knows the local area and understands the issues that are important to local residents. Having worked closely with Adrian for a number of years, I can speak personally of his abilities and his commitment to the community. With a state by-election being held this Saturday and a council by-election being held on 10 September, residents within the Bonner electorate have a wonderful opportunity to elect two hard-working and effective representatives at two different levels of government. I urge them to support Michael Caltabiano and Adrian Schrinner. Uranium Resources Feral Animals",162
268,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this evening to talk about some of the work of the House of Representatives that is often not well spoken of or promoted in the Australian community. I refer specifically to the work of the standing committees of the House. I am pleased to say that I have the privilege at the moment to serve on two standing committees. The first committee is the Standing Committee on Industry and Resources, which is currently conducting an inquiry into the development of Australia's non-fossil fuel energy industry, with a particular focus on the strategic importance of Australia's uranium resources. That issue is not new to me, as I have been involved in the debate since March 1977, when I first visited the uranium province in the Northern Territory as a very young trade union official, to recruit workers to my old union, the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union of Australia. The second committee I am serving on is new to me. It is the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. I have been pleased to be involved in the current inquiry into the impact on agriculture of pest animals. It is fair to say that in recent times we have heard a lot about the impact of the drought on the rural community, but we should not lose sight of the fact that there are ongoing problems which the primary industry community has to confront on a regular basis as droughts come and go. That is why the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is currently conducting a significant inquiry into the pest animal issues which have an impact on the industry. One of the objectives of the inquiry is to promote better community understanding of, and involvement in, the pest animal problems which confront the rural community in Australia. Obviously at the moment the Australian community is exceptionally worried about the impact of cane toads, as their march into Northern Australia seems unstoppable at this particular point in time. Evidence already suggests that the ecology of the Northern Territory is changing as the toads set up strongholds in an environment that is ideal for the propagation of this feral pest. But the cane toad also reminds me of two other problems that we have created in Australia through the introduction of species from beyond Australia's shores. The committee recently visited the north-west of Western Australia, where we were confronted with two particular problems: the problem of the feral donkey and the problem of the feral camel-a problem that I do not think is really appreciated and understood by the Australian community. I raise these today because I think it is about time that we as a community took seriously some of the problems that are confronting our rural sector, with a special focus on the problems of feral animals. I refer this evening to a visit to Warrawagine Station, which is a station of approximately one million acres, located in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. That station is run by Robin and Lyle Mills and their family, and they employ a significant number of young people. I am pleased to note that during the visit we were also enlightened on the nature of the training that those young people are given the opportunity of undertaking. I do not believe that we as a community properly understand the major problems that confront not only the owners of that station but also the nation with respect to our requirement to actually protect our desert environment in the years to come. History will show that thousands of camels were imported into Australia between 1840 and 1907. They were used for riding and as pack animals, for exploration and in the construction of the rail and telegraph lines throughout Northern Australia. The problem is that by 1930 rail and motor transport became popular. The reaction of those responsible for the camels was to abandon them, the end result being that they bred well and spread across parts of the Northern Territory, Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland. The number of these feral animals in Australia is now estimated to be in the order of 800,000 to one million. The problem that we therefore confront is the fact that these camels eat most plant material, including fresh grasses and shrubs. They also live up to 50 years and breed actively for about 30 years, so you can imagine the problem that is confronting our primary producers. It is also creating a huge challenge for us to protect our desert environment. The camels severely damage native trees such as the quandong native peach. (Time expired) North Bondi Surf Club",163
269,Mr TURNBULL,ADJOURNMENT,"Last month I attended the 98th annual general meeting of the North Bondi Surf Club-Australia's largest surf club, with over 1,800 members. I was delighted to present 50-year Surf Life Saving Association awards to Ralph Clark, Michael Gray, Tony Rule, Terry Schofield and Keith Snell. I was especially delighted to see Jim Spencer receive his 75-year service award, his vigorous address-in-reply testifying to the preservative qualities of salt water. Although founded in 1906, North Bondi does not claim to be the oldest surf club. There is a contest for that title, between Bondi Surf Bathers' Life Saving Club, a few hundred metres south along the promenade, and Bronte Surf Club, two beaches further south again, whose AGM I also attended recently. North Bondi was part of my life almost from the time. I could walk, as my father was a member. It was where, too many years ago, I earned my bronze and instructor's certificate. Bondi Beach is Australia's best-known and most popular beach. It is a world-famous tourist icon, a must-see and must-swim location for millions of visitors. The Australian surf, however, is often as treacherous as it alluring, and without the surf lifesaving movement our great surfing beaches would have to be closed to the public. The cost of hiring full-time lifeguards to patrol Bondi on a busy summer's weekend would be unaffordable. Our greatest tourist destinations, our greatest places of recreation, therefore depend entirely on the volunteer service of hundreds of lifesavers to keep them safe. In 2005, the 410 proficient lifesavers of North Bondi performed 522 rescues, bringing the total number of rescues performed there since 1906 to 12,425. On Easter Sunday the dangers of the surf were demonstrated once more when 12 swimmers were caught in a sudden rip. Eleven were saved, but despite the best efforts of the lifesavers one was never found and is presumed drowned. Each of those rescues represents a life saved, and in many cases lives of swimmers are saved because lifesavers put their own lives on the line. The life lost on Easter Sunday could have been 12 lives lost were it not for the lifesavers of North Bondi. Indeed, they save lives not only in the surf, as they demonstrated only last weekend when they were called on to revive a person who had collapsed at the end of the City to Surf. The surf lifesaving movement has an important role in promoting a healthy outdoor lifestyle for young Australians. There are over 5,000 Nippers in the Sydney branch area, and 650 of them are at North Bondi. Each surf club relies on a strong and enthusiastic committee to put in many hours of time in administration, in addition to the hours spent on patrol. North Bondi's team is led by Grant MCMah as president and kept in line by a superefficient club secretary, Michael Wright. In my first speech last year I spoke about the very Australian egalitarianism of surf clubs. The surf clubs of Australia attract the is broadest range of members: the wealthy and the battlers, judges and garbos, policemen and villains, teachers and truants. My own electorate is one of the most diverse in Australia, and that diversity and the easygoing, tolerant way in which we delight in it is epitomised by the surf clubs of Wentworth. All surf clubs are always short of money. They always need new gear and new buildings, and for the most part they can rely on support from their community, local councils and state governments. I have written today to support North Bondi's application for a $500,000 grant from the state government through the Surf Life Saving New South Wales Surf Club Development Program, to be spent on the refurbishment of the North Bondi surf club. The federal government historically has made very few contributions to support surf clubs, other than some grants from the heritage budget. The federal government obviously cannot fund every good cause, but there are few that are more deserving than that of lifesaving. The surf clubs of Australia will always deserve our support and Australia's support. Public Libraries: Internet Pornography",164
270,Mr BYRNE,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to raise a matter of concern in this House that should concern not only the members of this House but also parents from all walks of life, from all corners of this country. It relates to the capacity of children in our publicly funded libraries to access internet pornography. I attended a very important seminar last week that was sponsored by a gentleman called Warwick Marsh, who is doing great work on behalf of the Australian Fatherhood Foundation. At that function I heard very harrowing reports from an American academic about the effects of pornography, particularly on children. Imagine my concern when I returned to my electorate to read an article in the Berwick Leader. It was written by a journalist called Dimity Barber, who is a very good and capable journalist from this particular paper. This article said: Libraries across Casey and Cardinia have been urged to install Internet filters to stop children viewing pornography. Effectively, their survey indicated that, in a number of these libraries-which are publicly funded libraries in an electorate in a growth-belt area with a large number of young families-children could actually access pornography via the library. This journalist questioned a person from the library corporation named Prue Menzies, who was the library spokesperson across Casey and Cardinia, and she said that the staff monitored computers and asked people to be considerate of others. However, when this journalist went into the libraries, the journalist was able to access pornography virtually unchecked for as long as they wanted. I do not know about you, but as a responsible parent and a responsible legislator I think it is our task in this place and across the country to lay markers. I say as a parent and a politician that this is unacceptable. I notice that my friend and colleague the member for La Trobe has come into this place, and he is quoted as saying the same thing. So in this place tonight I am calling for any federal government funding that goes to public libraries, particularly in the CaseyCardinia library corporation, to be tied with the proviso that there has to be an internet pornography filter installed. Some may say that this is a draconian measure, a measure that goes too far, but this is a measure that has been successfully trialled in America. It has been tried by concerned parents who experienced similar difficulties in the United States. One may say: ‘Well, this is isolated just to, say, libraries in the Casey-Cardinia library corporation.' But if you look at some statistics you will see that in late 2002 the Australian Library and Information Association conducted a survey of internet use in public libraries-91 library services, all of which were institutional members of this organisation. The findings indicated that most libraries are providing unfiltered access to the internet and found that public libraries are significant centres for internet access for children. If that is the case-if a lot of Australian children are going to libraries across the country-surely it is our job as legislators to protect the children from exposure to something that we know will cause them harm. Anecdotally, I have heard stories of people going to those libraries in the Casey-Cardinia library corporation and watching others download pornography. It is not acceptable. Any responsible government-state, federal or local-will mandate that the appropriate internet pornography filters must be installed. They must be installed to protect our kids. And I go further than just the call for internet pornography filters to be installed in public libraries. I call for them to be installed in child-care centres, because again there is no demand from governments that Internet pornography filters be installed there. That is completely inappropriate. Having spoken to some of my friends from the other side, I know that they will support this. In closing, it is our job as legislators and as parents to set community standards. It is unacceptable for public libraries and childcare centres to not protect our children. I call in this place at this time for the appropriate filters to be installed and, if necessary, to have that mandated, particularly by the federal government. There are precedents in federal education funding of tying money to conditions being met. I call on all other forms of government to do the same thing to protect our most treasured asset in this place, our children. Sunshine Coast: Roads",166
271,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"Those of you who know the Sunshine Coast region of Australia will know of its attraction as a holiday destination. But the good things in my electorate, such as the lifestyle and the beaches, are also responsible for a very high population growth rate in the region. The weather is also attractive all year round, although we did have a cold snap late last week-and would you believe the temperature actually got down to 10 degrees in some spots. Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that population growth in the Sunshine Coast between 1998 and 2003 was 3.53 per cent, which places it as the third highest growth rate in Australia, behind Mandurah, 74 kilometres south of Perth, with 4.02 per cent and the Gold Coast-Tweed area, with 3.67 per cent. High growth is nothing new in the south-east of Queensland. We have an influx of some 1,000 people per week from other parts of the country. The growth has brought extra cars to the Sunshine Coast, thereby putting extra pressure on the road networks. I am pleased today to announce that real progress is being made in the construction of a new road in the busiest business and shopping hub of the region, the Maroochydore Central Business District. Maroochy Boulevard will link the major arterial Sunshine Motorway to Plaza Parade. It is associated with a major interchange construction and the Maroochy Boulevard bridge, which was completed some time ago, has already been a medium-term white elephant in that it is totally ready but it needs a road constructed to it. Together these three roadwork components will help relieve the growing burden on Sugar Road and Maud Street to the south and Maroochydore Road to the north as well as Plaza Parade and Evans Street. Mr Speaker, as you would expect, I have closely monitored the preliminary planning and lent my weight to help avoid stagnation of this joint private developer, local government and state government project. The Maroochy Boulevard project has been of particular interest to me because of the need to find a solution to the traffic problems in the region. I am particularly pleased that the project is now moving much closer towards completion. Unfortunately, a Queensland Labor government project of widening the Sunshine Motorway from single lane to double lane between Buderim-Mooloolaba Road and Maroochydore Road has been delayed. Public consultation is well under way, with letters posted to landowners and business people whose properties may potentially be impacted upon by the new Maroochy Boulevard and associated projects. These landowners have been invited to speak with consultants in the state government to discuss their issues and concerns. In addition, neighbouring landowners whose properties may not be directly affected have also been sent letters by the state government. In the coming weeks, around early September, the preliminary designs for the project will be taken to the wider community in Maroochydore, located in my electorate of Fisher, and to the surrounding areas. It is expected that this will comprise newspaper advertisements and staffed public displays, which will give interested residents the chance to give feedback on this significant project. I have campaigned for several years-in fact, since before 2001-for the urgent need for a link road from Sunshine Motorway to the Maroochydore Central Business District. It has been a long, hard slog but the residents of Fisher can now almost see light at the end of the tunnel. With this project now having been discussed in various forms for at least a decade, some locals have suggested that the past years of high population growth in the area have caught up with the need and that the proposed road as a single lane each way as suggested might already be inadequate. I have to say that that is my personal view. However, I would also comment that Maroochy Boulevard is better late than never. I call on the state government to take those sensible concerns on board and if funds can be released I suggest that the road be made at least two lanes each way. I am pleased to be able to support the Maroochy Boulevard project so far and look forward to the day when the road will open up access into the Maroochydore Central Business District. Mr Speaker, I suggest that you on occasions have been to the Sunshine Coast. You know what a wonderful area it is, and you know how important this new infrastructure is for our local community. What we need of course is to make sure that roads keep up with the population. I want to urge the state government to put a much better proportion of their funds into road improvements on the Sunshine Coast. The Sunshine Coast is close to Brisbane. Eighty per cent of people travelling to the Sunshine Coast do so by road. But we do need better investment from the state government. I am, however, pleased that Maroochy Boulevard is under way. It is a major step forward and it will dramatically improve the congestion in the Maroochydore Central Business District. It will make our area an even more desirable place in which to live. (Time expired) Feral Animals",167
272,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I will continue my remarks on the feral animal problem confronting rural Australia. As I said, camels endanger our desert environment not only by the destruction of native trees but also by degrading areas with drinkable water which provide a refuge for native animals and plants. For pastoralists they also have a serious impact on the operation of our cattle stations. They cause major damage to fences and infrastructure such as cattle watering points and, unfortunately, camels are also potential carriers of tuberculosis and brucellosis. The problem is that at the moment the current methods of control are largely ad hoc and have had little impact on overall camel populations. It is therefore the responsibility of the Commonwealth government, in association with state and territory governments, hopefully with the assistance of some wellfocused recommendations of the report of the House Standing Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, to actually do something serious about reducing the number of feral camels that exist in Australia. Obviously control methods include shooting, trapping and fencing, but to date they have proven to be an absolute failure. I therefore briefly refer in passing to the success of the donkey telemetry system for the control of feral donkeys in the east and west Pilbara, which was also brought before the committee during its trip to north-west Western Australia recently. This involves a ‘Judas animal' being fitted with a radio transmitter. The collared animal seeks outs other donkeys in its home range. The collared animal is then tracked by helicopter and all donkeys found with a Judas animal are culled in the most humane and, dare I suggest, the only proper way to deal with this particular problem. Since the introduction of the Judas program in 1994, over 81,000 donkeys have been culled and 38 pastoral leases have been declared free of donkeys as a result of this program. The program has the advantage of enabling control and doing it properly.",168
