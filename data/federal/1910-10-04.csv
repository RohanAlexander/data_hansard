Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON asked the Postmaster-General, upon noticeAs a number of small storekeepers in the suburbs of Sydney who have allowance post offices on their premises will have to close their stores in conformity with the Saturday half(holiday law, which comes into operation on 32nd inst - Is it proposed to make any alteration in the business hours of such formity with the altered ordinary business hours?",15
7,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"The Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, has furnished the . following information :The ordinary business of the small storekeepers who conduct allowance post-offices in the suburbs of Sydney is of two classes, namely, (a), that which the provisions of the Saturday Half-holiday Act compels to wholly close at 1 p.m. on Saturdays, and (b) that which includes business which the Act permits to be earned on after 1 p.m. on Saturdays. There are only fifteen cases of the class specified in - paragraph [a), and inquiries are being made as to the possibility of altering the hours for postal business thereat or removing the post-office business to other suitable places if found neces-saiy. In the cases specified in paragraph (J) there is no necessity to alter the postal houis, as the storekeeper or some member of his family is in attendance to conduct --the business permitted under the Act, \",16
8,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Has he received a report from the conference of officers on the matter of providing residences for post officers in country towns? 2. If he has, will he state what the decision of the Department upon the subject is?",16
9,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. Yes. 2. I have approved of the conclusions arrived at by the conference, which were :11 That, in the case of cities and certain large towns where residences can be easily obtained, and where a considerable stall is employed in the post-office, quarters for the postmaster on the postal premises are unnecessary and should not be provided in future; that with regard to other places no hard-and-fast rule can be laid down, and that the question of whether quarters are to be provided or not should depend upon the circumstances of each particular case, the factors to be taken into consideration in deciding the question to be whether or not the postmaster can obtain suitable accommodation within reasonable distance of the office; whether, if so, the local office arrangements will permit of one of the staff residing on the premises in the position of caretaker; and Tasmania, whether the working arrangements of the office necessitate the postmaster being on the premises considerably before or after ordinary hours, &c."" COMMONWEALTH TRAWLER. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON asked the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Where, and upon what work, is the Commonwealth trawler engaged at the present time, and how long is the vessel likely to remain in offices in conher present locality? 2.* Who controls the movements of the vessel, and gives instructions ns to the various localities to be visited by the trawler? 3. Have the investigations by the aid of a trawler up to the present time furnished sufficient data upon which to base a reliable opinion as to the commercial prospects of trawling in Australian waters? 4. Is it proposed lo utilize the trawler for purposes other than those connected with trawling work. If so, for what purposes?",16
10,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are these1. Queensland waters; about a month; Fisheries investigation. 2. The Director of Fisheries, subject to the approval of the Minister. 3. The reports already published indicate the nature and results of the investigations which in some localities promise cimmercial success. 4. It is not considered desirable to do so. An exception, however, has been made whilst the ^ vessel is in the vicinity of Brisbane for ten \ days during the present month, to permit her to eonvey members of the Ornithologists' Society to islands 40 miles from Gladstone. This, however, will not seriously interfere with her ordinary work. UNIFORM GAUGE. MILITARY TRANSPORTATION- "" ANGUS """,16
11,Mr JOHNTHOMSON,Unknown,"the Minister of Home Affairs, upon notice I. What is the length of railway line from Wallangarra to Brisbane? 2. 'What is the length of railway line from Tweed Heads to Brisbane? 3. Is it a fact that in construction of line Tweed Heads to Brisbane provision has been made, by increased width of tunnels, bridges, ftc, for adopting standard-gauge width of line? 4. Has similar provision been made in construction of line Wallangarra to Brisbane? 5. Will the Minister, when conferring with Stales authorities as to establishing uniform gauge for transportation of troops, consider the advisability of providing through line with Brisbane vid North Coast line of New South Wales, now in course of construction, either from Tweed Heads or from Kyogle via Beaudesert to Brisbane? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The answers to the honourable member's questions are these1. 233 miles. 2. 6g miles. 3. I am informed that the line from Tweed Heads to Nerang, 20 miles in length, has steel bridges, tunnel and concrete culverts wide enough for four feet eight and half gauge, but wooden bridges and sleepers are of Queensland standard dimensions. From Nerang to South Brisbane, 49 miles, the line is much older, and was built for three feet six inch gauge only. 4. The line from Wallangarra to Brisbane is only Queensland standard dimensions, 3 f t . 6 in. 5. The matter will be noted for consideration.",17
12,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. Is the Minister aware that a former Ministry obtained through its Minister for Defence a written report of its expert concerning "" The Angus invention "" for overcoming the break of gauge difficulty incidental to the Australian railways ? 2. Js he aware that this expert advised "" that the Angus invention would do all that is claimed for it "" ? 3. Will he lay the written expert report above referred to on the Table of the House? 4. Is he aware that a number of prominent experts (including Professor Warren, Chief of Engineering School, Sydney University, and Henry Deane, formerly Engineer-in-Chief for New Soulh Wales Railways and now Consulting Engineer for Railways for the Commonwealth) have furnished reports to the effect that the Angus invention is mechanically sound, and mathematically correct, and should be given practical trials to demonstrate its great value? 5. Will he lay these reports on the Table of the House? 6. In view of the great importance of overcoming the break of gauge difficulty for defence and other purposes, will he at once have the fullest inquiry made in relation to the invention referred to ?",17
13,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"T he answers to the honourable member's questions are1, 2, and 3. A report was furnished by Major INVENTION. Harding, Departmental Inspector of Ordnance Machinery, and a copy will be laid on the table as desired. 4 and 5. The Department has been informed of the existence of such reports, but no copies have been received. 6. This matter is receiving consideration. NA ADMINISTRATION. APPLICATIONS TO EDUCATIONAL ESTABLISHMENTS^-LONG-SERVIC E INCREMENTS.",17
14,Dr MALONEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"the Minister of Home Affairs, upon notice If any Federal Department during 1909 applied to Messrs. Stott and Hoare or any other educational college for students, and, if so, what were the Departments, and what were the dates, and how many were so employed ?",17
15,Mr KING OMALLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is - . Yes. Application was made to the firm mentioned by the Postmaster-General's Department (Central Office) in August and December, 1909, and two shorthand writers and typists were engaged for temporary work. At these dates there were no suitable applicants registered at the Public Service Commissioner's Office. The two employees thus engaged were required to register under section 40 of the Act.",17
16,Dr MALONEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"the Treasurer,. upon noticeWhen will the long-service increments of Â£ 1 0, due to officers of theClerical Division on Â£160 per annum, be paid?",17
17,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"As the long-service increments payable to officers of the sth Class are statutory ones, it is intended to pay them in anticipation of the passing of the Appropriation Act. SUPPLY BILL (No. 3).' OPENING OF SOUTH AFRICAN UNION PARLIAMENT : PRIME MINISTER' SVISIT TO SOUTH AFRICA - BUSINES S OF TH E SESSION - KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA RAILWAY - NORTHER N TERRITORY ACCEPTANCE BILL - "" THE COM NA FARMERS."" In Committee of Supply:",17
18,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [8.10] - I move That a sum not exceeding ,Â£816,619 be granted to His Majesty for or towards defraying the services, of the .year ending 30th June, 1911. r'' ' .This Bill includes no special payments, and covers two months' Supply, based on the Estimates for last year. I promised the Leader of the Opposition that at some convenient time before I left Australia to visit South Africa I would make a statement regarding the work for the remainder 'of the session. As this is probably the last sitting which I shall be able to attend before I take my departure, I desire to state the business which the Government think is urgent and ought to be transacted this session. All of the measures on the notice-paper are important, and the Government are of opinion that their consideration will not occupy very much time. With the exception of the contentious measure now under discussion, - they include the Sugar Bounty Bill, the Excise (Sugar) Bill, the Constitution Alteration (Legislative Powers) Bill, the Defence Bill, and a small Naval Defence .Bill, which accords with the views of both parties, and is, therefore, not contentious.",17
19,Mr GROOM,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,Is it to give effect to the resolutions of the Imperial Conference?,18
20,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,Exactly . It is complementary to the Defence Act.,18
21,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,But the ment have not a Naval Defence Bill here.,18
22,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,The object is fo bring naval defence into harmony with land defence.,18
23,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,The honourable - gentleman will find that it will be a very big Bill.,18
24,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"It does not seem so important to the Government as it does to the honourable member. The list of measures also includes the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill, the Lighthouses Bill, the Patents, Trade Marks, and Designs Bill, and the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill. There is a number of other small Bills which the Government would like to bring forward. I refer to a Judiciary Bill, a Tariff Anomalies Bill, a Penny Postage Bill, and an Oil Bounty Bill.",18
25,Mr DEAKIN,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,When shall we see Tariff Anomalies Bill?,18
26,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"The Minister of Trade and Customs expects to have it ready very soon. There will also be a Bill to make some small amendments in the Electoral Act, and that long looked for Bill dealing with the Federal Territory. As regards : the Navigation Bill, of course the Government would be very pleased indeed if it could be passed ""this-session.",18
27,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,How long is the session going to last?,18
28,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"I hope that, with the co-operation of honourable members opposite, the Attorney-General will be able to finish the session this month.  really serious?",18
29,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"Oh , yes. These are small Bills. The Navigation Bill has been before the Parliament for six years. I am sure that honourable members on both sides recognise it is a non-contentious measure. We shall be very pleased if it passes safely through the Senate and reaches this House before the Parliament is prorogued. I should be very glad indeed to see the Bill put through both Houses this session. For the most part, these are small measures, and I venture to say that when honourable members opposite come to see and deal with them they will find that they can be disposed of in a very short time. Experienced Parliamentarians know that immediately the end of the session is in sight an enormous amount of work can be speedily dealt with, and I feel sure that that will be our experience this year. DurGovern- ing my absence, my duties will fall upon the Attorney-General, and may I ask honourable members of both Houses to extend to him the consideration and courtesy that they have been good enough to show me. I thank the Opposition, and honourable members generally, for the uniform courtesy and kindness which they have invariably extended to me during my term of office.",18
30,Mr DEAKI N,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"Ballarat) [8.21] - The Prime Minister's opening remarks were naturally somewhat personal, and, therefore, I at once take the opportunity, on behalf of the Opposition, of wishing him bon voyage, and a very beneficial result from the interval he will enjoy before resuming his labours here. At the same time, let me say that we desire that this Parliament shall be associated with the the message of congratulation that he will convey to the people of South Africa upon having attained in the councils of the Empire a position of authority equal to that already enjoyed by ourselves and by the other Dominions. We trust that he will also express our confidence in the future of that great country. Having regard to recent events, happily concluded by the union of all its Provinces, which have probably passed through a greater variety of grave dangers, during the lifetime of our Â»wn Commonwealth, than any other part of the earth's surface under the British we trust that their new record may be one of unbroken peace and prosperity. We both anticipate and pray for them such a development as shall assist us to insure permanent peace to the Empire, based upon the closest union of all its races and Dominions, and guarantee their advance upon the high road of progress as one people. We, with difficulties of quite a minor character compared with theirs, encountering only political antagonisms or the misunderstandings and trials necessarily associated with the settlement of a new country, cannot, without much reflection, appreciate all that has been accomplished in that new Dominion. But that gives us great hope for its future. We may congratulate ourselves upon the fact that the coming Conference of the Empire will no longer be hampered by the inclusion of separate sets of representatives from each South African Province. Next year, for the first time, the whole of the self-governing peoples of the Empire will meet as Dominions in the Mother Country. It is needless to add more, except that I trust the Prime Minister will convey to the people of South Africa, in his own effective manner, an assurance that this is no expression of mere lip friendship, but a simple and sincere welcome into the home circle. We regard them as brothers, as joint heritors with us, of the Empire of which we are devoutly proud, and as a permanent pillar in its support. We look forward to the manifold tasks of civilization in that Dark Continent being enormously furthered by the union of the white peoples making that vast territory their habitation which offers magnificent opportunities for the fruitful labour of those who are, or will become, sons of the soil.",18
31,Sir JOHN FORREST,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"Swan) [8.25]. - - I regret that the Treasurer has not given us a little more information in regard to this Bill and the finances generally. It has always been the practice for the Treasurer in introducing a Supply Bill to take the Committee into his confidence, to speak ot the revenue prospects, to intimate what revenue has been received, and to compare the returns with those anticipated when the Budget statement was delivered. The honourable gentleman, however, seems to have ignored all precedents. merely threw the Bill upon the table, and saying, "" There is nothing new in it , "" moved a resolution. That is neither convenient nor customary. I wish also to comflag, plain that no opportunity has been given to the House to discuss the Budget statement delivered by the Treasurer a month ago, as well as the papers then submitted for our consideration. Ours must be a very contented House. The whole financial position of the country was placed before us in the Budget statement, the debate on which was adjourned a month ago, and we have not yet had an opportunity to make any reference to it. Would the Treasurer expect such treatment from the Government if he were in Opposition? I think that we have been treated very cavalierly- I was going to say contemptuously",19
32,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,That is not intended.,19
33,Sir JOHN FORREST,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,Can honourable members point to any previous occasion when a month elapsed after the delivery of the Budget statement without an opportunity being given for its discussion? I do not think that such a record can be found in the annals of Australian parliamentary procedure.,19
34,Mr FRAZER,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,The honourable member can discuss thefinancesnow.,19
35,Sir JOHN FORREST,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"No one would be expected to debate the. Budget on a motion for temporary supply. That, too, would be unprecedented.",19
36,Mr FRAZER,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,But there is nothing to prevent the honourable member adopting that course.,19
37,Sir JOHN FORREST,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"I wish that the honourable member would not make irrelevant interjections. The consideration of the Budget is one thing and the discussion of a temporary Supply Bill is quite another. I have waited for a month to speak on the Budget, but no opportunity has yet presented itself. Having regard to the fact that the Prime Minister is leaving tomorrow, and to the other business that remains to be considered, I do not propose to-night to deal with the general finances of the country, and will reserve any remarks I may have to make until the debate on the Budget is resumed. By that time, no doubt, we shall have forgotten the speech made by the Treasurer, and will have to turn to Hansard to refresh our memories. The debate upon the Budget ought to be initiated within two or three days of its delivery. That is the universal He practice which should have been followed. I protest against the Treasurer throwing the Budget on the table of the House, and a month after affording honourable members an opportunity to discuss it, and then only under cover of a motion for the granting of temporary Supply. There is one question which I have waited, an opportunity to discuss, and upon which I cannot postpone my remarks any longer. I refer to the projected Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. The sum of Â£5,000 has been placed upon the Estimates in this connection: but we have not been told the way in which even this small sum is to be expended.",19
38,Mr EISHER,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,In preparing plans to enable a scheme to be submitted to Parliament for its approval.,20
39,Mr MATHEWS,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,The honourable member was very quiet upon that subject when he had an opportunity to take action.,20
40,Sir JOHN FORREST,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"I wish that the honourable member would not interject. He is merely a voting machine at the best, and has to do what he is told. To place a sum of Â£5,000 upon the Estimates in connection with this important matter appears to me to be only trifling with it, especially in view of all the protestations we had from representatives of the Labour party during the recent election campaign in Western Australia.",20
41,Mr FRAZER,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"That is a very nice statement to come from the honourable member, seeing that he was in office for nearly ten years and did nothing.",20
42,Sir JOHN FORREST,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"That statement is absolutely reckless and inaccurate. The Labour party are now in power and they are doing nothing. Its members are like ""dumb driven cattle."" The Government are not treating the country fairly by placing the small sum of Â£5,000 upon the Estimates in connection with this important project. That money is really not required for any preliminary .purpose. A proper survey from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta has already been made,- and plans and estimates of the work have been obtained. We have sufficient information upon which to let a contract for the construction of the line, and yet we are now told that an expenditure of. Â£5,000 is necessary upon preliminary work. I wish to know exactly what the Government intend to do. We have been told by the Minister of Home 'Affairs that this Â£5,000 is required to defray the cost of preparing plans prior to the introduction next year of a measure authorizing the construction of the railway. But we have never had that statement authoritatively made by the head of the Government. For the Government to place on the Estimates theXsmaJi sum of Â£5,000, with a foot-note setting out that the estimated cost of the work is Â£3,988,000, is unprecedented. They are not dealing with the matter in a practical way.",20
43,Mr FRAZER,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,We have done more in three months than the honourable member and his party did in ten years.,20
44,Sir JOHN FORREST,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,The Government have been six months in office and they have done nothing. All that has been done was done prior to their accession to office.,20
45,Mr FRAZER,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"The Leader of the Government has given an assurance that the Â£5,000 represents necessary expenditure preliminary to the introduction of a Bill next session authorizing the construction of the work.",20
46,Sir JOHN FORREST,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"Why has the Bill not been introduced this session? Is all the "" s t u f f "" which appears upon the business-paper more important than is this great project? If Ministers think so, why do they not say so? No reason has been assigned by the Government for this unwarrantable delay. If the work be a desirable one, why should its initiation be dela)'ed? I have a right to ask that question. There must be some reason for delaying the undertaking for a period of twelve months. The Northern Territory Acceptance Bill has been submitted for the approval of Parliament. There has been no delay in regard to the proposed transfer of that Territory. Why, then, should the construction of the transcontinental railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, which was the crucial question of the general elections in Western Australia, be retarded ? The representatives of the Labour party told the electors of that State that, if they were returned to power, they would build that railway, and that, if the party with which I am associated were retained in office, it would not be built.",20
47,Mr MATHEWS,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,The - honourable member was very quiet upon this subject when he had a chance to do something.,20
48,Sir JOHN FORREST,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,I do not know why the honourable member so persistently interjects while I am speaking. I do not think that his action is either courteous or proper.,20
49,Mr FRAZER,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,The policy of the Government is to build that railway.,20
50,Sir JOHN FORREST,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,But when?,20
51,Mr FRAZER,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,The Prime Minister has already given the honourable member tfn assurance in that connection.,20
52,Sir JOHN FORREST,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,The Prime Minister has not stated that next year the anything of the kind. Government will introduce a Bill to me authorize the construction of the railway.,21
53,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"Yes , I have.",21
54,Sir JOHN FORREST,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"I am very that glad to have that assurance. But I do not see any reason why the work should delayed. If it be a good thing to conforth. nect Western Australia with the eastern States by rail, why not set about the work at once?",21
55,Mr FRAZER,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,Is it not a marvellous thing that the honourable member did not think about this matter during all the years that he was a member of previous and Cabinets ?,21
56,Sir JOHN FORREST,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"How often without have honourable members opposite promised that they would build the line at once they were returned to power? All that I can tell the Honorary Minister is that have done my best in the matter. I ask him whether he has done his best? At any layedsimply rate, we did something. We had the survey made.",21
57,Mr FRAZER,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,The Government of from which the honourable member was a Minwork. ister did not secure approval of the vote for that survey.,21
58,Sir JOHN FORREST,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"We did, and experienced a great deal of trouble in getting that approval.",21
59,Mr FRAZER,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,It was the Watson Goput off until next year. vernment which obtained that vote.,21
60,Sir JOHN FORREST,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"It was not. The honourable member is absolutely error in that statement. We did secure approval of the vote for Â£20,000 for that survey. We also provided for the constructhey tion of the line in connection with the agreelegislation, ment for the transfer of the Northern Terripeople, tory to the Commonwealth, thus affording the South Australian Parliament an opporministration tunity of redeeming the promise which made on its behalf immediately prior the advent of Federation. But I do wish to touch upon that question, because I might say something which would not help me. If a railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta will be a good project next year, it must be an equally good project now. Next year the finances will not in a better position than they are at present time. Nor will the season next year be better than is the present season.",21

62,Sir JOHN FORREST,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"I never said It seems to that delay is a favourite device of persons who have not decided what they are going to do. I have been accustomed to class of politician. They say, "" Let us put it off till tomorrow, because we be do not know what tomorrow will bring Let us promise to do it next year, and when next year comes we can say that we fully intended to do it, but something has happened in the meantime, and we do not feel able to do it until the following year."" In regard to a great project like this, which affects the whole of Australia, is bound up with the federation of the States, it is absolutely wicked that all tliese years should have been allowed to go by the railway being begun. It is still more wicked that now we have the if opportunity of doing the work, having this year Â£4,000,000 of revenue more thanI we had last year, the matter should be deby them for another year. It is trifling with the matter, and not worthy of a progressive or enterprising Government. We have heard a great deal honourable members opposite about the They made it their one cry. They said, "" The party who were opposed to us have not done this work. Put us into power, and we will do it . "" They have been put into power, and we find that the work is not to be done now, but is to be I cannot understand this trifling, this indecision, this want of enterprise. One would have thought in that they would seize the opportunity to associate their names with something that is useful to the country, instead of which are associating their names with drastic which is imposing burdens upon annoying and disturbing everybody, doing no good, and not connecting their adwith any enterprising work. was It is not statesmanship or enterprise to to put off till next year what ought to not be done at once. It would have been done at once if the electors had kept us in power. We should not have come down to the House, and said, "" We expect to get only Â£1,000,000 from the land tax,"" if we knew that we would get over be Â£2,000,000 from that source. I am very the disappointed with the action of the Government in delaying this great project for no purpose or reason whatever. I am surprised that' the honourable member for KaigoopHe, and also the honourable a member for Coolgardie, should allow this to take place. The members of the Labour party who represent Western Ausyet. tralia in this Parliament have gone all over the country times out of number promising what they would do, and all we now fulfilment of those promises is the assurance that something will be done next year. Many things may happen between this and next year, and the Government may then say that they are not able to carry out what they fully intended to do this date. The policy of the Government in this matter involves an unnecessary lay, wastes time, loses a good opportunity, does no good to any one, and is not likely to bring credit upon those associated with it. The Government have lost an opporthe tunity of showing the people of Western the Government. Australia that they intended to fulfil the promise which was dangled before the eyes reports, of the people to induce them ration, and has been dangled before their if that is possible, before eyes by the Labour party ever since. I construction of such a large must express my regret that the delay has templated. That is only one occurred. The action of the Treasurer in the Government mean to undertake throwing these temporary Supply Bills on the table, and giving honourable members information regarding them, is not confinancial ducive to the public interest. There never has been an occasion like the present, where, for more than a month, the finances of the country have been before honourable out members, and an opportunity has not been orable itmember given for us to discuss them.",21

I can readily be understand that the entertainment has created a sort of lucid interval of cosmopolitanism in the Labour party, and that they are not quite prepared to settle down to local affairs. Notwithstanding the conciliatory manner in which the Leader of the Opposition has treated the somewhat flippant statement of the Prime Minister in the form of congratulations upon the general results of the South African Union, I venture to think that the statement of the Prime Minister was worthy of the occasion. He ought collect that there are in this House ber of honourable members who represent distant States, and who have been attending almost since the commencement of the sesstitution sion at half-past 10 o'clock in the morning, and remaining till 11 or 12 at night, the distinct understanding that the session was to terminate at an early date in order lo allow the Prime Minister to go to South Africa. But now we find the honourable gentleman practically waving his pocket handkerchief to this Parliament, and throwwealth ing before it a whole sheaf of business which is to occupy us for the remainder dition of the session. I wish to protest, as member from another State who has been coming over regularly every week, and sitting here from 10.30 o'clock in the morning until late in the evenThere ing, against this treatment. If we are going to carry out the programme, which the Prime Minister has flippantly put bequestion. fore us, we shall be continuing our work in this Parliament right up to the end of December. In that event we shall have been led into this practice of early mornsures. ing sittings on the understanding that the session was to close at an early date",22
74,Mr HEDGES,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,To which December does the honourable member allude?,23
75,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"I shall be satisfied if we rise in December of the present year, if the complete programme which Prime Ministei has laid before us were undertaken. It is easy for the Prime ister, who is going off on a holiday, and is naturally looking forward with some pleasure to the reception which awaits him in South Africa, to talk in this fashion. But it is not treating this House fairly. Just look at this programme. It is very this Parliament. easy to say, "" Here are a few short meaParliamentary sures which can easily be dealt with."" must remember that in any event we have to wait until the other House has dealt houses Bill are also ""short."" with that very controversial subject, land tax. Then we are asked to deal with various other ""short"" questions. .First all, we have the Naval Appropriation Bill. Then comes the Sugar Bounty Bill. That is a Bill which I do not hesitate to say will too raise the whole question with regard to sugar. There will be a very long debate in this House as to whether the statutory arrangement by which the bounty, which works in conjunction with the Excise, and was to be gradually reduced, is now to be fixed. There will be a debate on the unTariff affecting sugar, which, ' so to to respeak, will revive the whole fiscal a numquestion associated with the Excise and the bounty. Then we are asked to dispose almost in a breath of the ConAlteration Bill. But we know that that question is going to raise the whole on question of State rights. Does the Prime Minister really suppose that the members of this House are going quietly to pass a Bill by which it is proposed to submit to the people a question as to the advisableness of handing over to the Commonthe most treasured amongst the rights of the States, and so pave the way to a conof unification ? I wish to tell the hona orable gentleman that a Bill such as this will occupy at least a week in this House. Then we are told that the Defence Bill is "" a very short matter."" Perhaps it is. is also the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill. The Prime Minister has not thrown the slightest light upon that",23
76,The CHAIRMAN,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,The honourable member must not discuss the various mea,23
77,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,They have been discussed by the Prime Minister.,23
78,The CHAIRMAN,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,The Prime Minister did not enter into details.,23
79,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"I shall not go into details, 'but only deal with general the principles. As honourable members know, a very serious legal question has arisen Minover the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill which is estimated to cost this country Â£11,000,000 of money. Yet the Prime Minister waves his handkerchief as he leaves these shores, and says that it is a matter that can be dealt with "" shortly"" by I have no doubt the Witnesses Bill is a "" short "" We measure, and it is possible that the Bill amending the Patents law and the LightBut the the Northern Territory Bill will revive the whole question as to whether or not of the Commonwealth is justified in taking over this Territory, and also another point as to whether we ought to take it over until we know definitely that the Commonwealth is going to have the absolute right to direct the course of the railway. The Prime Minister has not thrown the slightest light upon that matter. Instead of that, he has told us that his Attorney General has given a different opinion from that given by legal authorities in South Australia.",23
80,The CHAIRMAN,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,I must ask the honourable member not to discuss that matter in detail.,24
81,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"I have not any intention to do so, except to say this-that we know that the opinion of very eminent counsel in this State has been taken, and that his view is of course more valuable than that of the Prime Minister's adviser, who has expressed an opinion on the contrary side. think that we are entitled to have some clearer and more concise statement as to what business is going to be taken before the close of the session; because I am sure that no one in this House thinks that the programme mentioned by the Prime Minister is really going to be dealt with. In fact, the honourable "" Labour "" member for Maranoa laughed at the statement, and said, "" How long are you going to keep us here ? "" The honourable member, of course, realized the farce of putting a programme like this before the House at a time when we are supposed to be getting ready to close the session. AVe were asked to sit at half-past io in the morning for a particular reason. If Parliament is going to sit for another two or three months, so as to carry us on till the end ot the year, I do not think it is fair to this House that such lengthy sittings should be continued; and if the Prime Minister intended anything of the kind, I venture to tell him that he induced us to agree to those sittings on false pretences.",24
82,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"Parramatta) [8.58] - I must confess to have been very much disappointed at the statement of the Prime Minister with regard to the course of business. I understood that he intended to announce a programme for the remainder of the session which would take us at the very latest into the beginning of next month. Instead he has enumerated a programme of about twenty measures, some of them of overmastering importance-cer tainly some of them measures which affect the future destinies of this continent in a way that perhaps no other measures have heretofore done. But the Prime Minister is going away.",24
83,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,I did not mention so many measures as the honourable member st cited,24
84,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,1 think the honourable gentleman enumerated nearly twenty.,24
85,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"Oh , no; the honourable member is quite wrong.",24
86,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"I assure the Prime Minister that I am not wrong. If he will look at the list of the measures that have been announced, and are not yet on the business-paper, and will add them to those which are on the paper, he will find that there are eighteen or nineteen at the least. Who expects Parliament to rise at the beginning of next month, if it is in the meantime to dispose of a programme of I that kind? I sympathise to some extent with the statement of my colleague, the right honourable member for Swan. I think that the work to which he has referred should proceed as speedily, and is, at any rate, as urgent, as the taking over of the Northern Territory. In my, judgment, the transcontinental railway is as much a part of the general Australian defence scheme as the Defence Bill itself is. The Northern Territory Acceptance Bill is also a part of that scheme. They are both parts of the general defence scheme, and should proceed together. At least, if there is to be precedence of one over the other, I think the Western Australian railway should take precedence in point of importance and urgency, as well as on the ground of its relation to the scheme for the nation's defence. It is even more important ,than the taking over of the Northern Territory. It is of no use for the Commonwealth to take over the Northern Territory, or to think of doing anything with it in the matter of defence, until the railways are built; and, therefore, to delay those projects is to delay the real consummation of all that is desired. I thought that the Prime Minister would have curtailed very much the legislative programme for this session, we on this side having intimated our desire to close the session as soon as possible after he had left these shores. I have to congratulate the Prime Minister on his departure for South Africa on such an occasion; but it occurs to me that he has overlooked one little duty. I hope the Prime Minister will not take this suggestion amiss; but it seems to me that before he lfcft he might have invited Parliament to send a kindly letter of congratulation to our sister Dominion over the sea, considering that she is now entering on a new system of self-government- a system which we hope will bring the South African people all the blessings it has brought to us. It is not too late now to forward such a communication.",24
87,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,The honourable member for Ballarat did that when the Union was decided upon; and I believe we have since taken some action. I have always felt that in South Africa I should be speaking for this Parliament and not for a party.,25
88,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"But I think it would be fitting for this Parliament to send such a message. However, I merely throw out the suggestion, and express the opinion that it is not too late now to carry i l into effect.",25
89,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,I shall be glad to cooperate with the honourable member.,25
90,Mr BAMFORD,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,The Prime Minister is going as our special ambassador to do what is suggested.,25
91,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"There is another matter to which I should like to call attention. One great question which has intimate connection with the defence of Australia is the question of filling our great empty spaces; in other words, I refer to immigration and land settlement. I should like to know from the Government what steps they are taking with a view to meeting this great national need? Are the Government doing any more than advertising for the purpose of getting people, of our own kith and kin preferably, to come to Australia, to people this vast virgin continent ? It can no longer be said that there is no land available in Australia. In a book issued on the authority of the Ministry for circulation abroad, with a foreword by the Minister of External Affairs himself, there is expressed the hope that people from overseas will be attracted to this progressive country.",25
92,Mr BATCHELOR,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,The honourable member does not disagree with that?,25
93,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"Not at all ; I congratulate the honourable member on his conversion from a different point of view which he held, especially before the electors of Australia.",25
94,Mr BATCHELOR,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,The honourable member is quite wrong. I have not changed at all.,25
95,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"The Ministei who will succeed to the Leadership of the Government when the Prime Minister leaves for South Africa has declared over and over again on the platform, that not one penny-piece should be spent on immigration until very drastic land tax proposals had been carried into effect. The Minister of External Affairs, in the book to which I refer, has shown the absolute fatuity of an attitude of that kind; because it is there stated that land is available, and particulars are given of our good social conditions, and so forth. We are toldj in this publication, of great areas available for settlement, of social conditions that are all that can be desired-in short, that here is the El Dorado for the thousands of struggling hungry people of the older countries, and that the sooner they come here the better it will be for all concerned. I congratulate the Minister on coming back to a sane view of what are the conditions in our bright Australia. In the book, we are told in' these words of our social conditionsThere are none of the hardships attendant on congestion of population or severity of climate. The Australian in every section of the community is enabled to lead a comfortable and healthy life, and if he is ambitious to succeed in any avocation he is perfectly free from conservative conventions peculiar to older countries. In politics, every adult, male ancl female, has equal privileges, and the laws of the country are framed for the benefit of all alike. It would be absurd to affirm that there is no poverty in Australia, but it can truthfully be said that the number of absolutely destitute persons forms a comparatively negligible proportion of the entire population. No poor rate is levied in any part of the Commonwealth, for there is practically no pauper class to need it. . . . . Taxation in Australia is extremely light in comparison with other countries, and in the case of farmers is practically insignificant. I pointed out the other day that that was not quite so; but that our taxation here, including local taxation, is 21s. per head more than is the taxation in the Old Land., I do not wish to underrate this statement. On the whole, it is an admirable statement of our social conditions. The honourable gentleman says furtherThe best index of the general prosperity of Australia is that about one person in every three of the whole population has something in the bank. The total number of savings banks, with their branches and agencies, in the Commonwealth, is 1,717, and the depositors, to the number of 1,333,000, have accounts amounting in all to Â£46,147,289, which averages nearly twice as much as the deposits in any other country. I wish that my honourable friends opposite would issue this statement as a leaflet and scatter it all over New South Wales just now. It would be an admirable thing to do, as it would counteract many of the false statements which are being made from every platform by my honourable friends opposite and their friends, who are conducting an electoral campaign in that State at the present time.",25

97,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"I was at it on Saturday night, and I was quoting figures to counteract some of the tarradiddles the honourable member and his friends are constantly telling the people of New South VVales.

113,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"The honourable member's lorry was decorated with garlands and bedecked with flowers. It blocked up the right-of-way, and the honourable member talked from it twenty to the dozen. He has just now made a statement for which there is not a tittle of justification. I am entitled to explain, in view of the statement which has been made, that what I did say was, that, whatever sweating there was before in the Post Office, it  going on under the regime of the present Postmaster-General, and that instead of the economic salvation they expected, things were not one whit better. That is a very different statement from the twisted statement which the honourable member has just made.",26

118,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"I shall be glad if the honourable member will do so. He will not find that I said any such thing as he has just attributed to me. One of the things which honourable members opposite are saying throughout the length and breadth of Australia is that there is no land available for settlement in this country; that the land is all held by land monopolists, and it is impossible to do anything in the way of immigration until very drastic legislation has been passed, and that that can only be brought into operation by Labour members in both the Federal and State spheres.",26
119,Mr CHARLTON,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"Hear , hear !",26
120,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"The honourable member for Hunter says, "" Hear, hear,"" but let us see what the Minister of External Affairs says on the subject. Fortunately for us. we have one of their leaders who gives the lie to all these statements, and does it authoritatively and officially - He proposes to circulate what he has written on this subject throughout the length and breadth of the civilized world. Speaking of Western Australia, this is what he saysAn enormous area of wheat land has been made available to the settler by the construction of spur railways, and when those lines which it is intended to construct are completed, a further t large area will be opened. According to this statement, it is not the land monopolist who has the country by the throat. The difficulty is a lack of railway communication and facilities with which this Parliament has nothing whatever to do. I consider these statements are well worth reading; they will be useful a little later on when we are discussing some very important problems. A little later the Minister says The price of Government lands ranges from 2s. 6d. to Â£ 2 per acre for scrub country, and from Â£ 3 to Â£ 5 per acre for lands repurchased and subdivided for closer settlement. This refers to various parts of Australia.",27
121,Mr BATCHELOR,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,I think only to Western Australia.,27
122,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"No ; the Minister, in making these statements, refers generally to Australia. We are continually hearing that no land is available for settlers, except at exorbitant prices, which put it beyond the pale of any small capitalist who seeks to get enough for himself and his family. But here the Minister says that there is plenty of land open for settlement-lan d that has been cleared, repurchased, subdivided, and is now reedy for closer settlement-and the price is no more than Â£ 3 to Â£ 5 per acre.",27
123,Mr CANN,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,That does not apply to New South Wales.,27
124,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"If the honourable member will be patient, I shall come to New South Wales before I sit down. The Minister has been through the whole of the States, and there are statements in this article relating to every State in the group, with a good many particulars.",27
125,Mr OZANNE,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,Why not get to the business of the country ? Why is the honourable gentleman wasting time like this?,27
126,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"Then the land such question is not the business of the !>44] The honourable member has been telling the people from every public platform that it is the one question, and now, when we are discussing it, he says, "" Why not get to the business of the country?""",27
127,Mr OZANNE,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,Le t us go on with the business; the honourable gentleman is only wasting time.,27
128,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"What is the business of the country if it be not immigration, land settlement, giving to the people that birth right of which the honourable member has told them scores of times they have been robbed?",27
129,Mr OZANNE,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,I never mentioned the word once.,27
130,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,Le t me go on. The Minister of External Affairs further saysWithin reasonable reach of the splendid railway services of all the States there is so much room for settlement that there is no present necessity for any one desirous of undertaking mixed farming going into the back-block*. . . . There is so much fertile land in Australia that there is no need for any intending settler to take up poor hungry soil.,27
131,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,Who writes this?,27
132,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,I am quoting from a pamphlet issued by the Minister of External Affairs.,27
133,Mr RILEY,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"Well , he does not know what he is talking about.",27
134,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,To whom is the honourable member referring?,27

136,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"That is the Minister's look-out; it is not mine. He cloes know what he is talking about. This is a fair ancl accurate representation of the state of affairs in Australia at the present moment. I have no quarrel with the Minister for issuing this pamphlet. We are getting the truth from his lips, and it is time that we had it, because the country has been saturated with lies during the last month or two; they are being circulated broadcast over New South Wales today. Now we have the answer to them from the mouth of the Minister of External Affairs in the Labour Administration of Australia. At page 35, speaking of land which is not improved, and which may be at some distance from railways, he says it is wise to leave all such land aloneand secure an area of partially improved land as is made available under closer settlement country ? schemes in all the States. He says that there is plenty of land close into railways, and that such land is being made available in every State of Australia today. Going into particulars, he shows that in all the States "" hundreds of thousands of acres "" are available for mixed farming. He speaks of the capacity of our soil for growing barley, of the magnificent crops obtained, and the remunerative character of the employment in the various districts. He says .that there is abundance of room in Australia for settlers, and an inviting market open for all the horses that can be bred here, and advises people to invest money in land, ancl to go in for the, breeding of horses to supplv the militarv requirements of India, as well as our own. Lucerne is another crop to which he refers. He says thatExperiments have proved that millions of acres of land that is offering a,t Â£ ^ to Â£ 6 per acre in - Australia will *row lucerne, and where irrigation is possible even better results can be secured than on the Hunter River flats.",27

Dairying is another industry true statement? which is recommended. It is stated thatThere is no difficulty in the newcomer securing on easy terms excellent unimproved land in tricts' ? settled districts at prices ranging from as low as Â£ 2 per acre to Â£10 per acre. We are told that improved immigration schemes have been undertaken in Australia, tionand thatextensive tracts of irrigated lands .ire now readv for occupation in areas ranging from 15 to 20 acres to 200 acres and over. On such lands dairy farming can be conducted under the most favourable conditions. The Minister invites people to come here and undertake dairying on the share system, though I have heard share-farming denounced from the house-tops by honourable members oppositeMen who contemplate undertaking this class of farming should submit the fullest possible details of their experience and qualifications to enable the officers of the Information Bureaux to make arrangements which will permit of settlement immediately on arrival. The inference is that an abundance of dairying land is waiting to be taken up on the share system. All you have to do is to show that you are a bona fide dairyman. and they will put you on a farm in which you will begin on the share system.",28

141,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"I see nothing in the next sentence qualifying in any wav what I have already read. I do not pretend to make full quotations. The book is an excellent one, and, I hope, will have as wide a circulation over the world as it is possible to give it. It is the best book that has been issued for many a long day. All the details of Australian life are referred to, space being given for the discussion of the possibilities of pven market gardeningOn irrigated lands that are now being made available for settlement in small areas ranging to 10 or 15 acres, the prospects for vegetable growing are particularly bright. Those who have been accustomed to close culture can be accommodated ; there is plenty of land for them. Speaking generally about the land available, T find this statement on page 73There are, however, available for settlement in all States large tracts of partially cleared and improved lands, which can be prepared for cropping at trifling cost, and without any delay for burning off.",28

This is not the statement of myself, but of the Government, and, moreover, so far as I can iudge, it is an absolutely correct account of the position of affairs in Australia. In South Australia "" about 360,000 acres are now open to application in various localities."" Referring to New South VVales. the booklet saysLarge areas of Crown lands are available for selection in places, and farms may still be obtained under easy conditions, though most of the land of the best quality and nearest to the railway has been selected. Pioneering work would have to be done on these Crown lands now available before a farm could be evolved -, but these disabilities were just ns apparent to a ""rent many of our present-day faTmeis, when years ago they drove their pigs in the primeval forest through which men had scarcely trod, much less built roads or laid rails. In the North Coast portion of the Eastern Division, where 98 per cent, of the 4,000,000 occupied acres are given over to pastoral and dairying pursuits, there still remain 1,195,580 acres of Crown lands, and large areas of this, particularly among the head waters of the coastal rivers will, as facilities for transport increase, come under occupation as mixed farms, with dairying predominating. In the South Coast, though nearly 3,000,000 acres of Crown lands are unsettled, it is largely inaccessible country. On the Tablelands, which occupy nearly 26,000,000 acres of the Eastern Division, over 5,000,000 acres still remain in the possession of the Crown, and though for the most part inaccessible country, areas large enough for farms are frequently found by the more adventurous settler.",28

There is just one other quotation which I wish to make, and this also relates to New South Wales. It is one of those statements which convey a world of truth and meaningWith the area of ordinary Crown lands, the lands made available under the Closer Settlement Act and the areas voluntarily released by the large landholders, a man with a little will experience no difficulty in getting a start in New South Wales. I might - repeat that for the sake of the honourable member for Hunter, as he seems to be sceptical about New South Wales. Air. CHARLTON - I know that what I state is a fact. Air. JOSEPH COOK - The honourable member may know a little about his own district, but he does not know all New South Wales by a long way.",29
171,Mr CHARLTON,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,I know as much about the State as does the honourable member.,30

178,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,If you could take the curse of party politics out of this business there is hardly an honourable memcapital ber here who would not admit that these statements are perfectly correct. It does not suit their political book just now to do so.,30
179,Mr RILEY,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,Why does the honourable member use these quotations to-night except for party politics? Air. WEBSTER - What is the honourable member quoting?,30
180,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"I have been quoting from a work which I have described at least half-a-dozen times, and the honourable member wakes up and asks, "" What is the honourable member quoting?"" I am quoting from a booklet called The Commonwealth of Australia for Farmers. Air. WEBSTER - It is a grand title. Air. JOSEPH COOK - Yes , and it is a beautifully got up book, which, I venture to say, will do an incalculable amount of good when it is circulated throughout the Old Country, as it well deserves to be. As to the States, the purport of the book is that there is ah abundance of land available on easy terms, and waiting only the advent of keen brains and strong arms to settle upon it an independent yeomanry, who will be able to defend it in the future, and to fill it with a happy and contented people. Air. WEBSTER - Is that the statement as to New South Wales?",30

I venture to say that not one of I have them has ever cultivated an acre, and yet they know everything connected with the subject. Turning to the Minister's statement as to South Australia, I again find that he knows what he is writing about. He writesLarge areas of land are about to be opened for settlement north of Pinnaroo and east of the River Murray, and on Eyre Peninsula, Port Lincoln district. Here is another general statement about Western AustraliaThere are millions of acres of unalienated lands in the State available for settlement.",30
183,Mr AVEBSTER,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,That is a very vague statement.,31
184,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,I cannot conceive of a more definite statement.,31
185,Mr WEBSTER,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,But there is no statement as to the quality of the land available.,31
186,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,Does the honourable member suggest that the Minister is trying to fool the people of the Old Country by telling them of land that is not fit for settlement?,31
187,Mr SCULLIN,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,When land is available it is applied for over and over again.,31
188,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"The honourable member does not know what he is talking about. If he turns to the official records of Western Australia, he will find that of the land made available for settlement last year, over 1,000,000 acres of good land, near railways and well watered, remain today to be taken up. The honourable member for Corangamite knows nothing of any part of Australia save the Western District of Victoria. That to him is a little world. I would remind him that Australia is a big place, and that even if a few men have obtained possession of the broad rich acres in which he is so much concerned, he need not imagine that they represent all Australia. At all events, I refer the honourable member to the Minister of External Affairs for information as to what land is available for settlement. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - There will be a great row in the caucus about this.",31
189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"I do not see why there should be. I could quote from this book many similar statements, but shall not weary the Committee with any more. I have quoted statements showing that there is land still available for settle110 ment in every State, and that it is being made available by a process of private subdivision on reasonable terms. We have it that there is good lucerne land available at from Â£ 4 to Â£ 6 per acre.",31

191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,He does.,31

193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,Where did he make that statement?,31
194,Mr WEBSTER,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,In a speech at Hawkesbury College to which I have previously referred in this House.,31

197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,It is seven years ago. Will the honourable member wake up and get the dust out of his eyes ?Will he remember that Australia is going ahead while he is sleeping ?,31
198,Mr CHARLTON,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"If there is so much land unalienated in New South Wales, why have the Government been resuming so many areas?",31
199,The CHAIRMAN,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"I must ask honourable members to discontinue these interjections. It is impossible for the honourable member to make a connected speech while they continue, and they ma.ke my task much heavier than it would otherwise be.",31
200,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"In this official pamphlet, circulating throughout the whole of the civilized world, and the cost of which this Parliament is to provide, we have the fact set out by the Minister of External Affairs that there are millions of acres available for settlement in Australia at the present time; that land is being speedily made available in every form of tenure, and that we want only people from the other side of the world to come here and make homes for themselves upon the soil. In other words, this is a statement to the effect that there is an abundance of land available in Australia; that it is cheap, easy of access, splendidly fertile, well watered, ancl capable of producing everything from the products of the station to the small cultures of the market garden. This land is available today to any one who cares to come ancl take it up. I hold, therefore, that there is excuse for any delay in submitting a bold, forward, immigration scheme. I hope that this pamphlet is but the harbinger of such a scheme. I congratulate the Minister and ask him to take his courage in both hands and to place on the Estimates an amount in keeping with the importance of this subject. There is no need longer to delay. Here are statements made on the authority of official departments in every State, and checked by himself, that there is an abundance of land available at the present time, and, there'fore, we should cease for ever to argue in this Chamber that we need drastic legislation to make the land available for the people. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported.

201,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA FOR,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ; [9.53] - Some time ago 1 informed the Leader of the Opposition that an error had crept into the Estimates-in-Chief in respect of the amount set down for Treasurer's Advance. 1 directed his attention to the matter privately, and promised that the .sum which would be asked for in that connection would not exceed Â£300,000. The Treasuiy officials omitted to comply with that undertaking, and set down the amount at Â£600,000. I happened to notice the error almost immediately, and advised the Leader of the Opposition of it privately. I wish, therefore, to say that when the Estimatesin-Chief come to be considered, it is not intended to ask for more than Â£300,000 by way of Treasurer's Advance. C.'ause agreed to.

Will the Prime Minister say what hehas arranged in that connection ?,32
203,Mr FISHER,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [9.58] - I have stated from the first that it is advisable that any ordinary borrowing from a fund of this kind should bear the usual burden of interest. But the honourable member for Parkes will recollect that before the Australian Notes Bill was introduced I stated that this advance should be regarded as an exception. Rightly or wrongly, it is an advance to enable lis to keep faith with the States by paying them in accordance with the provisions of section 87 of the Constitution up to the end of the present calendar year. Whilst I accepted with pleasure the amendment under which the money derived from the Australian Notes Bill is to be constituted a trust fund, and whilst I agree that any money drawn from it should bear a specified rate of interest, I do not think it is necessary to make that provision in this Bill.",32
204,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,The Prime Minister proposes to do that.,32
205,Mr FISHER,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"I propose to make that . provision in reference to any investment other than this one. If the Committee feel strongly upon the matter, I have always said that I would make the desired provision in respect of this fund. But I have already intimated my view that we might use this fund temporarily, seeing that the amount borrowed from it will commence to be repaid from the ist January next.",32
206,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,To borrow from a fund without crediting it with interest is very loose financing.,32
207,Mr FISHER,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,The honourable member must give me credit for at once (No. 2). consenting to constitute the money derived from the operation of the Australian Notes Bill a trust fund. No money can be used out of this Trust Fund without a Bill passing through this Parliament. No Executive can interfere with <t without the authority of Parliament. While I regret that it is not proposed to pay interest on the amount of Trust money that will be used for this temporary purpose,32
208,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"What is the disadvantage in paying it? It will only be a bookkeeping credit, but it will keep the fund in its ""proper position.",32
209,Mr FISHER,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"I quite agree with the subhonorable member, but it would be advisto state the rate of interest in the Bill if we wish to start that principle now. There are other Trust Funds, and the purposes for which the money is to be used are carefully prescribed. That applies to the Australian Notes Trust Fund. The money in that fund may be invested in British Consols, Commonwealth or State stock, or may be temporarily placed on deposit in the banks. It would, perhaps, be better not to provide for the payment of interest in this Bill, but any other advance from this fund should, I think, bear the usual rate of interest.",32
210,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,It is a very simple thing to amend the Bill to provide for it.,33
211,Mr FISHER,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"Ver y well; if honourable members strongly desire it, I would rather do it than have any doubt about it. Although it is clear enough that any money that is to be taken from the Australian Notes Trust Fund is not to be part of the 25 per cent, gold reserve. I shall put in an amendment which will make that absolutely certain. That is a matter that ought not to be left in any doubt. 'It should be stated in clear and distinct language that this Bill will not permit of any of the 25 per cent, gold reserve being taken. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

This is to make provision for the scheme of naval defence, to which all parties have agreed. The whole policy was agreed upon by the previous Government. The money may, of course, be used for any improvements of the ships that mav be determined upon. All the money proposed to be applied under this Bill is to be expended in accordance with the policy that was agreed upon by the previous Administration.

218,Mr FISHER,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,There are quite a number of Trust Accounts which are not affected by this measure.,33

227,Mr DEAKIN,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"Ballarat) [10.14] - I wish to call attention to die words at the end of clause 2 of the Bill, "" towards the construction of a fleet for the naval defence of the Commonwealth."" It is not often that an Opposition calls attention to the fact that, by the language proposed to be enacted, the Government is tying its hands in what appears to be an unnecessary fashion. If this is to be a Naval Appropriation Act, the term used in the title is as wide as could be chosen, and wisely chosen. No objection would have been taken if the terms of clause 2 had been made as wide as that title. There is always the possibility of ancillary expenditure being required in tion to the naval service, and it might be both proper and convenient to meet that expenditure out of this Trust Fund. It appears to me that the Government should not be unduly restricted in this matter of defence. The whole House is at one in regard to it. It is not a party question. Anything, that will make for efficient administration ancl for promptitude in dealing with needs as they arise is desirable. From that point of view, it does not seem wise to include the words to which I have called attention. .",34
228,Mr FISHER,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,The money is really intended for constructive purposes.,34
229,Mr DEAKIN,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"That is quite right, but suppose that some other purpose becomes apparent, subsidiary to this but accompanying or forwarding it. words "" towards the construction of a fleet "" were omitted, the money would go to the Naval Defence account, and would be available for all the purposes covered by the title to the Bill.",34
230,Mr FISHER,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [TO. 17] - I assure the Leader of the Opposition that there was no intention, in inserting the limiting words to which he has called attention, to prevent any necessary payments being made on account of salaries or wages in relation to naval construction.",34
231,Mr DEAKIN,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"If the words to which I have called attention were omitted, it seems to me that the purpose would be more easily accomplished.",34
232,Mr FISHER,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"Of course, the omission of the words would forward the intention nf the Government; but, at the same time, I do not want these Trust Funds to be loosely dealt with. I think that the Bill as it stands will enable wages to be paid.",34
233,Mr DEAKIN,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,I am not sure that it will.,34
234,Mr FISHER,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"I think so; and if the Bill covers that purpose, I would rather leave it as it stands, if honourable members, however, tliink that clause 2 is too restrictive, I shall be glad to follow the advice of the Leader of the Opposition.",34
235,Mr AGAR WYNNE,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"Balaclava) [10.19] - I "" i k that Parliament likes to tn know how the money which it votes is to be applied. We are appropriating this money for the purpose of the construction of a fleet. I should not like to see any alteration made in the Bill in regard to the appropriation of the money. If Parliament passes loose Acts, giving a free hand to the Government to do as it likes, some the money may be diverted from the purrela- pose that Parliament intended. VVe have determined to build a fleet for Australia, and I think that the appropriation of this money should be devoted to that particular purpose, and no other. If it is desirable to apply a portion of the money in some other way, Parliament should be tailed together and asked to alter the Act. I would not agree to give the Government a free hand as to the expenditure.",34
236,Mr FISHER,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,That is the safest plan.,34
237,Mr AGAR WYNNE,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"I see no objection to leaving out the words "" for the naval defence of the Commonwealth,"" but we should certainly say "" towards the construction of a fleet for naval defence."" We may have to use these ships in the China seas.",34
238,Mr FISHER,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"The Government will give If the a. fair interpretation to the words "" defence of the Commonwealth.""",34
239,Mr AGAR WYNNE,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"Thes e are the only restrictive words I can see in the Bill. How much has already been paid for the construction of the destroyers, and will the whole of the Â£2,590,000 be expended before the end of the financial vear?",34
240,Mr FISHER,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [10.21] - We have set aside Â£270,000 for payments to the end of September, and are paying gradually, in the best way possible to serve the interests of the Commonwealth, in instalments from time to time. The object of this provision is simply that we may have a big bag into which we can put the money, and out of which it cannot be drawn except for the specific purpose stated. I agree with the honourable member that the Bill ought not to be restrictive, but I clo not agree that the words referred to ought to be struck out. These words mean, as was held by the previous Government of which I was the head, that the Commonwealth may have to be defended anywhere on the seas, subject to the direction of the Commonwealth Government or Parliament.",34
241,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,Parkes) [10.22]. - Do I understand that the Prime Minister proposes to strike out the words as suggested by the Leader of the Opposition?,35
242,Mr FISHER,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,No ; 1 would rather have the words retairted in the restrictive sense.,35
243,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,Does the Prime Minister propose to make any amendment?,35
244,Mr FISHER,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,I would rather leave the provision as it is.,35
245,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"That , I think, would be very unwise, because I understand the Prime Minister to say that he desires the Government to have at all times a very free hand as to the movements of the vessels.",35
246,Mr FISHER,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,Yes .,35
247,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"As the honourable member for Balaclava has pointed out, the clause, as worded, will very much tie the hands of the Commonwealth Government. It might be very well contended, when it was proposed to send the large vesselswhich are being paid for by the Commonwealth-ou t of the Commonwealth waters, that that was not for the defence of the Commonwealth, but for the defence of the Empire. I am well aware that the Prime Minister, personally, is anxious that the Government should have a free hand to use the larger vessels; and I draw attention to the fact that the British Prime Minister, in speaking of the number of Dreadnoughts at the present time built, included the larger vessels built for New Zealand and Australia, and described them as not intended for merely coastal defence. I am sure that, if any contingency arose in which the Imperial Government asked for the cooperation of New Zealand and Australia in the defence of the Empire, we should be perfectly willing to lend the vessels for purpose.",35
248,Mr WEST,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,Wit h the sanction of Parliament.,35
249,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"Of course; I am not talking about the Prime Minister ""playing boats"" by himself. It is quite possible, however, that there might be some people who did not think imperially, but locally, and who would say that the phraseology of the clause limited the Government's action. I do not desire any limitation, but rather that the Prime Minister or the Government should have dis[H5l cretion. If the words objected to by the honourable member for Balaclava are retained, they might be thought to impose a limitation. I quite agree with the honourable member for Ballarat that if the clause stops at the word "" defence,"" the latter words are not needed. The obvious purpose of the Bill is the naval defence of Australia, direct or indirect, through the Empire. If the Prime Minister thinks it desirable to retain the words, I ask him to stop at the word "" defence,"" so as to do away with any equivocal words which might be used to impose a restriction on the Government.",35
250,Mr FISHER,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,Wide Bay-Prime Minister) [10.26] - I do not take the restrictive view of the honourable member for Parkes.,35
251,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"I take no restrictive view, but simply say that the words might raise discussion.",35
252,Mr FISHER,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"I think it wise, when initiating legislation of this kind, to say exactly what we mean; and I think that the Government and this Parliament mean that these ships are primarily for the defence of the Commonwealth. During the very recent, widespread, and, shall I say, vigorous discussion in the country, the Government, of which I had the honour to be the chief, held that we could not prescribe the waters in which the fighting or defending would take place, and that no imaginary line could be drawn which the ships should not be ready to cross for the purpose of defending the Commonwealth. In my opinion, these words, should remain, in order to show that this is a Commonwealth fleet; and the Government of the day will have to take the responsibility of directing the vessels, subject, of course, in a great emergency, to the calling of Parliament together. If an imaginary line were drawn beyond which the ships should not go, a position too ridiculous for contemplation would be created. In my opinion, the that words impose no limitation, while they inform the world that the fleet is intended primarily, and almost wholly, for the defence of the Commonwealth, though I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that, while the ships are defending the Commonwealth, they are defending the heart of the Empire.",35
253,Mr DEAKIN,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,And vice versd.,35
254,Mr FISHER,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"Ver y well; it applies both ways. The honourable member for Parkes has told us that the armoured cruisers for New Zealand and Australia are called Dreadnoughts; but I may say that the most recent advice we have from the advisers of the King is rather in favour of smaller craft for the defence of this country. I am not, of course, in a position to reveal the actual advice ; but we are told that with smaller vessels we get more powerful defence for less money. Of course, I am now speaking entirely apart from any political leaning or bias; but we are advised that the powerful smaller craft would be more embarrassing to the larger craft.",35
255,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,I am sure that the honourable member is not properly informed as to that.,36
256,Mr FISHER,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,The honourable member is not more closely in touch with the Imperial advisers than the Government are.,36
257,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"It all depends on the meaning of the word "" smaller.""",36
258,Mr FISHER,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,I mean smaller than the armoured cruisers.,36
259,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,How smaller ?,36
260,Mr FISHER,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"A good bit smaller; but, in any case, this is scarcely a matter which can be discussed here. I have no prejudice in the matter; as the representative of the Government I speak for the whole people of the Commonwealth when I say that we desire to have the best ships for the least money-ship s which will give the most effective defence, both on our own account and ih co-operation with the fleet of the Mother Country.",36
261,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"Parkes) [10.30]. - The Prime Minister has not understood my point. In the endeavour to save the time of the Committee, I curtailed my observations unduly. I have not claimed that we should attempt to indicate in this Bill that this naval force is intended for any purpose other than the defence of the Commonwealth. I tried to point out that if a contingency arose, whicn we hope will not arise, and the question were asked whether these ships should be used for other purposes than the direct defence of the Commonwealth, objection might be urged by some members of this House that it would be ultra vires of the provisions contained in this Bill. I do not wish it to be so. If the Prime Minister found that the Imperial Government were building a number of vessels specifically for "" the defence of Great Britain,"" he would at once, if his attention were drawn to it, take exception to it on the ground that it ought to be for the defence of the Empire.",36
262,Mr ARCHIBALD,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,Who is going to decide?,36
263,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"That is not the question now. Whilst 1 do not desire that it should be indicated in the Bill that the object of building these vesselsis - the defence of the Empire, I wish its wording to be left sufficiently wide, so that the Imperial idea with which the Prime Minister seems to be imbued from time to time-if he will forgive me for saying so-migh t be given effect under this Bill. If the Government of the day proposed, at some future time, to join with New Zealand in assisting the British Fleet in the China seas, some members might say that that was beyond the power given in this Bill, since the appropriation was obtained for the construction of vessels "" for the defence of Australia."" The honourable gentleman is, no doubt, well aware that that great authority on defence, Admiral Mahan, has pointed out in a chapter of one of his books much upon "" the disposition of navies,"" that prior to the Japanese-Russian war, the naval base for the defence of Australia was the middle of the Indian Ocean. Since that war the point may be somewhat changed. There is a very popular opinion in this country that, in order to defend Australia, we should have our harbors full of warships; but, according to Admiral Mahan, the naval base for the defence of Australia was, some time ago, at a point in the Indian Ocean. As the Prime Minister is well aware, defence at sea is quite different to defence on land. At sea the enemy is treated as an ocean bushranger, and we go out on to the highways of the ocean to meet and destroy him.",36
264,Mr ARCHIBALD,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,Shoul d we not follow him up as Nelson did ?,36
265,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"Of course we should. Nelson went down to the West Indies to follow the French Fleet; and he went to the end of the Mediterranean to meet them at Alexandria. Our ships would have to go across the ocean too. If we limit ourselves in this Bill, when the time comes for sending the larger ships away in response to the wishes of, and in co-operation with, the Navy of the Imperial Government we may have members of this House raising the point that there is no power to do such a thing under this Bill. We have members of this House who are not so well <jisposed towards the British Empire as some of us are.",36
266,Mr WEST,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"Yes , they are; but they think of Australia first.",36
267,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,The honourable gentleman has no right to sav that.,37
268,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"I may be Minister allowed to remind these new political fledgelings that in 1903. when we had navy of our own, and were providing a miserable and despicable Â£200,000 contricipal bution towards the Â£35,000,000 for the upkeep of the British Fleet, there was not one Labour man in this Parliament who would vote for the subsidy.",37
269,Mr DEAKIN,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"Yes , the honourable memThe ber for Maranoa voted for it.",37
270,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,I did not wish to mention any names. I might mention one or two others who distinctly said they did not want to vote for the defence Empire. Mr. XING O'MALLEV - The honourable member for Maranoa voted for the subwith much heavier armament. sidy.,37
271,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"Then I beg the lutely honourable member's pardon. I did think there was one solitary exception. had many statements about defending Austhat tralia, and that they wanted Australia be a nation."" There was plenty of that kind of schoolboy sentiment.",37
272,Mr OZANNE,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,Does the honourable memworld ber call the desire to make Australia nation a schoolboy sentiment?,37
273,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"I say that some honourable members were not prepared to assist even to that paltry extent in the fence of the British Empire. Of course, we hope to make Australia a nation, if can. but we want people for that purpose; and we want it clone as part of the British Empire. I wish to convince the Prime Minister, seeing what his sentiments are, that it would be desirable power in the hands of the Government to use these vessels either for the direct fence of the Commonwealth or its indirect defence through the British Empire.",37
274,Mr WEST,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"I hope he will do nothing of the kind. If the honourable member's suggestion were adopted, the. matter would be out of the power of 'this Parliament all the time.",37
275,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"This Parliathe ment would have to say whether the ships could be used at all. The honourable memit ber for East Sydney has shown how he would construe this clause. I can see, now that some feeling has been stirred in the party opposite, that the Prime ister will not entertain my suggestion, I make it for what it is worth. [H5]-",37
276,Mr DEAKI N,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"Ballarat) [10.38] - I am not quite as much impressed as the Prime appears to be by the fact that within the last twelve months there has nobeen, apparently, a change of opinion in the advice tendered by some of the prinnaval advisers of the Admiralty The swing of the pendulum is almost regular. In one year the opinion is in favour of enlarging the ships, and in the next year in favour of concentrating their power. Prime Minister is perfectly right when he says-and there, it appears, all the authorities are with him-that a Dreadnought, in size, represents what is now considered an excessive development, and of the that the new antagonist of the Dreadnought, though a very large vessel, is considerably smaller than a Dreadnought, but These swings of the pendulum take place from time to time. The Prime Minister is absoright when he ridicules the possibility not of our drawing a line on the map and sayWe ing that a vessel that can operate within area is defending Australia, and that "" to the same vessel would not be defending Australia if operating beyond that line. No such line can be drawn. The oceans of the are one. It is just possible that a there might be a combination of forces of such a character that Australia's Safety would be determined by naval conflicts taking place thousands of miles away from deAustralian ports. If lhat were possible, Australian vessels, as well as British we vessels, and those of the Indian Fleet, should, for Australia's sake, be concentrated where the crisis will take place.",37
277,Mr ARCHIBALD,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,It may be decided in for him to retain Ihe North Sea.,37
278,Mr DEAKIN,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"Exactly . Of course dethe effective range even of the armoured cruiser now under construction, would be too limited to permit it to be transferred such a distance in time to take part in a conflict which might be brought about with forty-eight hours' notice. Where the decisive conflict will take place we cannot, and need not, know. We must provide best defence in the best form we can, being satisfied with nothing less, and use to the best purpose whenever and wheref-ver the emergency may arise. My object is to give the Government a freer hand to up expedite construction in any way which Minmay be considered necessary; but having but pressed my suggestion on the Treasurer, I shall not occupy m'ore time in regard to it.",37
279,Mr FISHER,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [10.42] - The honourable member for Parkes always has something interesting to say; but I do not accept the restrictive reading of the provision.,38
280,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,I do not give it a restrictive reading; but I say that there are others who do.,38
281,Mr FISHER,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"What I said does not conflict with the statement made in the Imperial Parliament-that naval defence is ject to the Naval Discipline Act, and provides for the United Kingdom and its Territories. We also have territories, although they are not specifically alluded to. I venture to say that those responsible in times of emergency will give the provision a reading which will be in consonance with the traditions of our race, and the best interests of the jCommonwealth and the Empire generally.",38
282,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"Parramatta) [10.44] - On the whole, it may be well to let the Bill go through; but we shall later require an amending measure to remove its limitations. There is already a growing trouble in connection with the management of our land defence, because of the restrictions of the Trust Fund. The great bulk of our military requirements have to be supplied from the other end of the world; and when Parliament votes Â£100,000 for armaments or equipment of any kind, it cannot be sure of spending the money within the year, everything depending on the conditions of the factories at Home, which may be able to do the work off-hand, or may be so glutted with orders that they cannot meet our requirements for twelve or eighteen months to come. Therefore a Trust Fund is needed, into which the money voted could be paid, to make it unnecessary to get re-votes in succeeding years, a practice which needlessly inflates the Estimates, and often causes delay, because when the manufacturers are ready to execute our orders, it is found that there is no money available pending a fresh appropriation. A Trust Fund is needed for both land and naval defence, and while it may be well to confine these provisions to the construction of the Fleet, a Trust Fund will later be needed for its maintenance. The honourable member referred to the contemplated introduction of a Naval Discipline Bill as a supplement to the Defence Act. If I am any judge, the consideration of that measure will take some time.",38
283,Mr FISHER,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,I hope not.,38
284,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"The honourable member knows what naval discipline is elsewhere, and .what it must be here.",38
285,Mr FISHER,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,Thos e who fight the battles of their country must be willing to conform to the ordinary rules of discipline.,38
286,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,Is the Government going to follow the recommendations of the Conference ?,38
287,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"I hope so. We sub- must have common standards of discipline, as well as of arms. While it is true that the Home authorities may be reducing the size of vessels of war, they are not likely to come down to vessels of the "" River "" class for the defence of the high seas. For many years to come we must be content to accept their suggestions. The tendency now is to reduce the size of the war vessels, making their armament heavier, though giving them less of it. Great speed is particularly aimed at, especially for the defence of the trade routes. As a naval expert has said, we need something which will catch anything, which will fight anything, and which, if the odds are against it, can keep out of the way until assistance arrives. Clause agreed to. Clause 2, preamble, and title agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted. Bill read a third time. UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.",38

I have much pleasure in movingThat the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia offers most cordial congratulations to the Parliament of the Union of South Africa upon the establishment of a National Government and Legislature for that Dominion capable, under the blessing of Divine Providence, of accomplishing the tasks required for the development of its Provinces and for the unity of the Empire. I ask my honourable friend, the Leader of the Opposition, to be good enough to second the motion.",38
292,Mr DEAKIN,TRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL,"Ballarat) [10.51] - I second, with great pleasure, the motion, which will enable the Prime Minister, while conveying the congratulations of the Commonwealth Parliament, to place before the Union Parliament a few words which directly express the unanimous feeling and Imperial sentiments of both Houses of this Parliament.. The Prime Minister needs no credentials.' He has authority to speak for this Parliament on these non-party matters at any time, and we shall willingly endorse what he may say.
