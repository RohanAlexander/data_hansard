NA RAILWAY.  for Works and Railways seen the statement in today's Age that the opening of the East-West Railway will take place in the first week in November? Are the Statement and the indication of the locality,, at which the opening ceremony will take place correct? If not, will the honourable gentleman tell the House the date of the opening and the placo where it will take place?",20
2,Mr WATT,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I glanced at the paragraph this morning, Many of the statements in it are. incorrect, and it was not authorized by the Government. I do not think that thq railway oan be opened before the second week in November at the earliest. We are of opinion that the best place for the ceremony of cutting the first ribbon is Kingoonya, about 40 miles further from Port Augusta than the place mentioned in the Age. A plate laying gang, whose work has been discontinued during the strike, will recommence on the eastern end on Saturday.",20
3,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Will the Minister see that the date fixed for the opening is one on which it will be convenient for members to attend, and not one on which mem-' bers are likely to be scattered all over the Commonwealth ?",20
4,Mr WATT,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No date has been fixed, . but so soon as it can be fixed I shall acquaint honourable members by telegram, so that they may make arrangements to be present. WAR-TIME PROFITS TAX.",20
5,Mr STORY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"rHas the attention of the Treasurer been directed to a statement, on the subject of allowances under the excess profits duty for wear and tear, depreciation, and obsolescence of assets, prepared by the Board of Inland Revenue in the United Kingdom) which has been presented to the House of Commons? Will the' Treasurer indicate the extent to which the decision of the Board will be followed here in the administration of the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Act?",20
6,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The information supplied is as follows: The Commissioner of Taxation has directed my attention to a statement prepared by the Board of Inland Revenue in the United Kingdom, entitled "" Statement respecting- . (I) Proposals as to valuation of stockB; and (II) Allowances for wear and tear, depreciation, and obsolescence of assets,"" which was presented to the House of Commons recently, in which the Board of Inland Revenue lays down certain rules of interpretation of the - parts of section 40(3) of the Finance (No. 2) Aet, 1915, which are identical with section Jl (1, b, c, and d) of the Wartime Profits Tax Assessment Act 1917, which relate to the modification of the provisions of the Aet in regard to the pre-war standard, the computation of the profits of the war-time period, and to the calculation of capital, on account of(6) the postponement or suspension, as a - consequence of the present war, of renewals or repairs; or (o) exceptional depreciation or' obsolescence of assets employed in the business due to the war; or (d) the necessity in connection with the war of providing plant' which will not be wanted for purposes of the business after the war'. The principal part of the statement by the Board of Inland Revenue has relation to paragraph o. .The interpretation given to that paragraph by the Board is liberal, and will operate to the interests of businesses which have acquired material assets, by construction or purchase during the war, at inflated prices, and which will sink in value to a lower level, or even to scrap value, at the end of the war. The Commissioner of Taxation proposes to follow the lead of the Board of Inland Revenue in this mutter, which has heen expressed by the Board in the following terms:"" (3) The allowances extend to any material assets employed in a business, and not merely to machinery and plant. . Where these assets have been constructed or acquired during the war at an inflated, .price, and will sink to a lower level of value, or even to scrap value, at the end of the war, full relief oan be claimed. The - measure of - the allowance to be made in respect to such assets will be the difference between cost and post-war value. An allowance of the like nature is, of course, applicable also to assets in use before the war, the value of which has fallen owing to war causes. The measure of the allowances in such cases is the difference be.Ween the value of the assets (depreciated, or written down for wear and tear) at the date when liability to excess profits duty began and their post-war value. "" (-4) Inasmuch as post-war value and the, duration of the war are unknown, the Boa?d of Inland Bevenue have been unable, in most cases, to make final allowances of the foregoing character, but where the necessary evidence is furnished that depreciation, is taking place, or is inevitable at the end of the war, they are ready to make provisional allowances, subject to subsequent correction. "" (5) As » general rule, these allowances, whether provisional or final, will be ' spread,' i.e., granted by instalments in successive accounting periods during the lifetime of the duty; but in exceptional cases, where new assets are being regularly acquired during successive accounting periods, and the taxpayer desires that the allowance (whether provisional or final) for each asset or group of assets should be .wholly or mainly granted in the accounting period in which the asset is acquired, the Board will not object to that course being taken. "" (6 ) , . (7), and'(8) relate to controlled establishments and ordinary wear and' tear. "" (9) Generally speaking, the ordinary allowance for wear and tear in the case of excess profits duty is of comparatively small importance in so far as it relates to plant and machinery - whioh may be the subject of an allowance for special depreciation owing to the war, as explained above. In such coses the difference between war value and post-war value necessarily includes the ordinary allowance for wear and tear. ""(10) This relates to postponement of repairs, &e. "" (11) Reference may also be made to the following points on which questions sometimes arise:(a) Wliere pre-war maohinery or plant has become obsolete from' causes not actually relating to .the war, but arising during the war, and is then replaced, an allowance for the difference between the written-, down value and the scrap value is admissible, and where the replacement is not effected during the war but shortly after, a like allowance may be claimed under section ' 40(3) of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1915. (S) Special depreciation of pre-war .buildings due to the war may be allowed for under the same subsection. Normal depreciation taking place equally in the past and in the - present, if allowed, would not, in most coses, affect the liability to excess: profits duty. (c) It will happen, from time.to time, . that a manufacturer will purchase machines, &c, for the purpose of specific - contracts, and will wish, from motives of prudence, to write down the-value of the machines to a low figure out of the profits of the contracts. In cases in which purchases of this character have regularly occurred, both in the past and in the present, the nonallowance of a special depreciation - beyond the ordinary wear and tear allowance would not normally affect the liability to excess profits duty. Where, on the other hand, purchases of this kind take place only during war periods, they - would usually be attributable to war conditions, in which event a special allowance can be claimed under section 40(3) of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1915."" The High Commissioner will be asked to forward, as soon as possible, full information, showing how the Board of Inland Revenue is applying the foregoing ruling. MR. JUSTICEHIGGINS .",21
7,Mr LIVINGSTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"As the second term for which Mr Justice Higgins was appointed does not expire before September, 1921, will the Government give sufficient time this session to enable the House to consider the desirability of dispensing with that gentleman's services as sident of the Arbitration Court?",22
8,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have not read the whole of the judgment of Mr Justice Higgins, being too overcome by what did read to proceed further. Should the last part of it be as bad as the first, in the near future, fall in with the wish of the honourable member, and afford him an opportunity to make such suggestions as he evidently has in his mind. NAVA L PAY.",22
9,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Can the Minister for the Navy give the House information as to the decision of the Board that sat to consider the re-arrangement and in crease of pay to the men of His Majesty's Australian Squadron?,22
10,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The report has been presented, and, as the result of it , there arc upon the Estimates to be laid upon the table a sum of between £50,000 and £60,000 for increased pay and allowances to the men of the Fleet. NA DEPARTMENT.",22

How many persons born in Germany, and how many persons of German parentage in Australia, are employed in the administrative or civil branch of the Defence Departtion ment ? » 2. Are any of those above referred to known to be enrolled under an assumed name; if so, how many? -> The information supplied is 1.

12,Mr HUGHES,ENEM Y ALIENS IN DEFENCE,"In reply to a question asked by the honourable member for Barrier, I have had a return prepared giving particulars of the prosecutions under the War Precautions Act. I lay the paper on the table. NA HOSPITALS.",22
13,Mr GROOM,MEDICAL ATTENDANCE AT,"The honourable member Prefor Melbourne (Dr Maloney) recently asked a question, based on statements, in the Sydney Bulletin, regarding the conduct of medical men at a military hosI pital in Melbourne. The Director-Gener a l of the A r m y Medical Service says'that I may, he feels sure that the statements are not correct, but that without particulars he cannot make a definite reply. It is asked that the ' honourable member shall name the specific hospital in regard to which the complaint was made, so that definite inquiries may be instituted. PAPERS.

ARRES TS ATPORTPIRIE .",22
14,Mr FINLAYSON,MEDICAL ATTENDANCE AT,"Is the Prime Minister yet able to give me a reply to the questions which I asked last week re. garding the arrest of certain men at Port Pirie? Mr HUGHES ' - I have asked the Soliborn citor-General to supply me with informaon the subject, but he has not yet done so. NA CpNSERVATION.",22
15,Mr SAMPSON,MURRAY WATERS,"I ask the Minister for Works and Railways, as Chairman of the Murray Waters Commission, whether, before the adjournment, he ean inform the House regarding the progress that is being made in the selection of sites for storage works at the head of the stream, and whether investigations will be made to ascertain also the possibility of storing what would otherwise be waste flood water in depressions adjoining the river ?",23
16,Mr WATT,MURRAY WATERS,"The delay in inspecting and finally selecting the site of the Upper Murray River reservoirs has been due, in recent months, as the Honourable member is no doubt aware, to the flooding of the river. I had a conversation this morning with the Victorian representative on the Commission, who informed me that it would not be possible to inspect the upper river for three weeks at least. As soon as possible the Commission is to be summoned, and will proceed with its officers to the site. I shall see that the honourable member's further suggestion as to natural reservoirs is also considered by the experts. DEPORTATIONS.",23
17,Mr TUDOR,MURRAY WATERS,"for Dr MALONEY) asked the Prime Minister, upon notice Whether within the last two months any persons have been deported, or have been arrested for the purpose of being deported?",23
18,Mr HUGHES,MURRAY WATERS,"It is considered that, in the interest of the Commonwealth, no information should be given on this matter at present. WAR PENSIONS: INCREASE.",23

Fisher, High Commissioner, has been attending conferences with various representative men interested in the establishment of the scheme' for providing scholarships for Dominion soldiers at English Universities""? 2. Have any communications passed between the Commonwealth Government and the High Commissioner on this matter? If so, what is> their nature? 3. Does the Government approve of the proposal ? 4. As a considerable time must necessarily elapse between the close of the war and the return to Australia of our soldiers, will the Government endeavour to make some arrangement with the educational institutions of Great Britain which will enable those wbo so desire to attencfleetures and classes during that interval ? 5. Will the Government also provide that soldiers who desire to take a complete course at an English University may be allowed to do so without prejudice to tlieir repatriation ?",23
23,Mr HUGHES,SCHOLARSHIPS AT ENGLISH,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. 2. Yes. 3. 4, and 5: The matter is now under the consideration of the Government. DR. HIRSCHFELD.",23

In Committee (Consideration resumed from 25th September, vide page 2703): Clause 1 (Short title).",24
32,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,"Wannon) [11.13] - I am surprised beyond measure that the [100] Honorary Minister (Mr Groom) who is in charge of this Bill did not r f p l y to the debate on the motion for the second reading, and deal at length with the very many arguments advanced during the discussion.",24
33,Mr FINLAYSON,JOHN,"The honourable member could not have been present when the debate closed, otherwise he would know that the Minister desired to do so.",24
34,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,"I was not present at the moment. I am surprised, however, that the Minister in charge of a Bill which Senator Millen, in introducing it in another place, said, in one aspect! alone, might involve the Commonwealth in an expenditure of £60,000,000",24
35,The CHAIRMAN,JOHN, Order ! The only question before the chair is clause 1-Shor t title.,24
36,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,It has been the in variable custom to allow in Committee a already general discussion on the first clause of a Bill.,24
37,The CHAIRMAN,JOHN,"It has not been the practice to allow such a discussion on the first clause of a Bill of this character, but if it is the desire of the Committee I shall allow if . Is it the wish of the Committee that that course should be f o l lowed in this case? Several honourable members objecting,",24
38,The CHAIRMAN,JOHN,Then the honourable member must confine himself to the clause.,24
39,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,I take this as a deliberate attempt to stifle a general discussion.,24
40,Mr WISE,JOHN,What ! A f t e r thirty-one speeches on the motion for the second reading.,24
41,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,"That is immaterial. On the motion for the second reading, many reasons have been advanced why the Bill should not be passed in its present form, and although the Honorary Minister gave close attention to the debate, he has not uttered a word in answer to it . We have had on two occasions the assurance of the Deputy Leader of the Government (Mr Cook) that the fullest opportunity for the discussion of this measure would be allowed. I do not ask any repetition of the debate, but I . d o wish to hear the reply of the Government to criticisms that have been offered. Many ex-Ministers have spoken in opposition to the form in which this measure is framed and there should be some reply on behalf of the Government. I tell the Minister straight out that he will not lessen the discussion of this Bill in Committee by withholding information that is in his possession. He may have an excellent answer to the arguments'that have been advanced. If he can show that there are good reasons why this Bill should be passed in the form of a blank cheque to the Commission-if he can show that the Commission alone should be intrusted with this work-the n he may satisfy myself and others that the Bill is drafted in the best form.",24
42,Mr WISE,JOHN,Why attack the Honorary Minister seeing that his own side compelled him to sit down last night when he proposed to reply to the debate on the second reading motion ?,25
43,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,"That might have been a matter of Ministerial tactics, but we are at least entitled to have fro m the Government a reply to the two day's debate on this most important measure. The fact that certain honourable members do not desire the Minister to make such a reply does not absolve him from his responsibility.",25
44,The CHAIRMAN,JOHN,Order ! I cannot allow the honourable member to proceed on these lines.,25
45,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,I have gone to considerable trouble in ascertaining that the practice of this Chamber has been to allow in Committee a general discussion on the first clause of a Bill .,25
46,The CHAIRMAN,JOHN,"The honourable member is under a misapprehension. The procedure he mentions has been allowed in the past, with the consent of the Committee, on a clause that is considered vital to the Bill . The only question in volved in the clause now before us is whether the title should be the title of the Bill , and it is usual to pass such a clause without comment.",25
47,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,I notice in today's papers some very excellent remarks made by the women of Australia with respect to the non-inclusion of nurses.,25
48,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"Nurse s are included in the scheme, as I have pointed out over and over again.",25
49,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,"Then I submit that the title of the Bill is misleading, because it has caused women who have taken a prominent part in politics in Australia to believe that their sisters at the Front have been deliberately excluded from participation in any repatriation provision. Of course, I feel certain that that is not the intention of the Government, but rather that they desire to treat all our oversea forces in the most generous way. The nurses have stood the brunt of battle, and, in their sphere, have rendered most distinguished and noble services to the men who are actually bearing arms.. I hope we shall have from the Minister a very clear and definite assurance that nurses have not been deliberately excluded.",25
50,Mr GROOM,JOHN,I have already said that nurses are deliberately included.,25
51,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,"This is a point on which we ought to be very clear. U p to the present, the Minister in charge has not answered the objections that have been raised to this measure, and has thus departed from a time-honoured custom when Bills of this magnitude are under consideration. Probably a long, detailed debate in Committee wonld have been avoided if the Minister had taken a different course.",25
52,Mr KELLY,JOHN,I rise to a point of order. I submit that what the honourable member is saying has absolutely nothing to do with the particular clause under discussion.,25
53,The CHAIRMAN,JOHN,"I have already called the attention of the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) 'to the fact that he is not in order in his remarks regarding the inclusion of nurses. In my opinion, which I think is shared by .every member of the Committee, nurses are included within the title. If the honourable member for Wannon desires to discuss certain matters, he will have an opportunity later on, and I ask him to allow this clause to pass without comment. It is not a matter of the Government departing from the custom, but of the Committee itself doing so. It has been decided that the custom which has been referred to shall not be observed on this clause.",25
54,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,"I respect your view, Mr Chanter, and also the ruling previously given. I set out to show that the title of the Bill has misled the women of the country into a belief that their sisters serving abroad are not included. However, I accept the assurance of the Minister that these ladies are included, and that the fullest possible provision will be made for them.",25
55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,JOHN,That assurance has been given to the country time and again.,25
56,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,"Howeve r that may be, I will not be drawn from an examinaEon of the title of the Bill . I regret that the able speech that the Minister had prepared has not been delivered, and point oub that the reasons for this, while known to this House, are not known outside.",25
57,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"Darling Downs-Honor ary Minister) [11.27] - The honourable member is under a misapprehension. regards the principles of the Bill , he will later on",26
58,Mr MATHEWS,JOHN,I submit that the Minister ought to keep to the short title.,26
59,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"I am dealing with the short title. As to the method of procedure, the questions the honourable member wishes to discuss will come up specifically on the various clauses as we proceed, and we shall follow the course constantly adopted.",26
60,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,But as each clause comes up it will exclude all that is not included in it .,26
61,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"The honourable member will find that the questions he has raised wil l come up as we proceed with the Bill , and there will be ample opportunity for full discussion. Of course, we do not propose to traverse the debate of yesterday and discuss the suggested details of the scheme.",26
62,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,Hav e you no answer to make to the speeches that 'have been delivered ?,26
63,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"I offered to make a reply last night, but the honourable member was not present to hear it . blocked by the House.",26
64,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,That was most unfair.,26
65,Mr JOSEPH COOK,JOHN,"ParramattaMinister for the Navy) [11.28] - I think that the criticism of the honourable member is most unfair. The Minister in charge of the Bill r9se last night, intending to make a detailed and lengthy reply, in the firm belief that it would help the Committee stages of the Bill .",26
66,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,What prevented him?,26
67,Mr JOSEPH COOK,JOHN,"No sooner had he begun, than the House unmistakably manifested an indisposition to hear him .",26
68,The CHAIRMAN,JOHN,Order !,26
69,Mr JH CATTS,JOHN,"Cook) [11.29] - The title, in my opinion, does not accurately describe 'the Bill , which is certainly not a soldiers' repatriation Bill .",26
70,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"It "" fills the bill . """,26
71,Mr JH CATTS,JOHN,VThe Bill is nothing but emptiness-onl y a hollow sham.,26
72,The CHAIRMAN,JOHN,The ' honourable member may not discuss the Bill . [100]- 2,26
73,Mr JH CATTS,JOHN,"I submit that the title should be altered to indicate that this is a Bill not containing a general repatriation scheme, but merely one for the purpose of abolishing an existing committee, and setting up another in its place, and for abolishing the presiding genius As in the person of the Prime Minister and setting in his place Senator Millen.",26
74,The CHAIRMAN,JOHN,Order ! The honourable gentleman is going beyond the title.,26
75,Mr JH CATTS,JOHN,"I cannot see in the Bill any definition which provides that the term "" soldiers "" includes nurses. Mr . GBOOM - Paragrap h (a) of subclause 2 of clause 4 provides that an Australian soldier is a ""member of the Forces"" within the meaning of the W ar Pensions Act, and that measure defines a ""member of the Forces"" as including "" a member of the A r m y Medical Corps and Nursing Service, who is accepted or appointed by the Director-General of Medical Services for service outside Australia.""",26
76,Mr MATHEWS,JOHN,Melbourne Ports) [11.32] - In order to embrace every person to whom the measure is to apply the short title should be amended to in clude the Instructional Staff and men attached to embarkation and disembarkation work.,26
77,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"The definition of "" Member of the Forces"" in the W a r Pensions I was Act covers ""Members of the Commonwealth Naval and M i l it a r y Forces enlisted or appointed for or employed on activeservice outside Australia, or employed on a ship of war, or enlisted or appointed for service in connection with naval or military preparations or operations.""",26
78,Mr MATHEWS,JOHN,M a n y men have been retained here for work on the In structional Staff. I am anxious to see that they are not overlooked.,26
79,Mr GROOM,JOHN,The matter can best be discussed when we are dealing with the definition clause.,26
80,Mr FENTON,JOHN,Maribyrnong) [11.34] - I understand that provision is being made for the repatriation of I m perial soldiers who wish to settle in Australia.,26
81,Mr GROOM,JOHN,It is intended to move an amendment to make the measure apply to Imperial reservists who were settled in Australia before the war broke out.,26
82,Mr FENTON,JOHN,I understand that provision is being made in some of the Repatriation Bills of the States to meet the ease of Imperial soldiers who wish to settle in Australia.,27
83,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,"Wannon) [11.36] The Repatriation Bill before the Victorian Parliament provides that any member of the Imperial Forces, no matter where he enlisted, will come under its provisions. The Honorary Minister now tells us that we are making provision in this Bill to advance to each settler, under any State land settlement scheme for soldiers, up to an amount of £500 for the improvement and equipment of his farm. . What will be our position in respect to advances which the States may wish to make to Imperial soldiers who settle on the land under the provisions of their legislation",27
84,The CHAIRMAN,JOHN,The honourable member's remarks are entirely beyond the title. ; Clause agreed to. Clause 2 (Commencement).,27
85,Mr SINCLAIR,JOHN,Moreton) [11.38] This clause provides that the Act shall come into operation on a day to be fixed by proclamation. Is there any valid reason why it should not commence forthwith?,27
86,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"Darling Downs-Honor ary Minister) [11.39] - The Act cannot be brought into full operation until the Commission which is to be appointed has met and framed regulations to give effect to its policy. A certain amount of time will be necessary before the Act can be proclaimed for the organization of a Department, for the preparation of regulations, and for deciding as to the personnel of the Commission. Similar provision had to be made in the Navigation Bill and in other measures of a similar character passed by this Parliament. However, I can assure honourable members that there will be no delay. From the date of his appointment to the control of this work' Senator Millen has taken the matter in hand and done much of the detail work preparatory to bringing the measure into operation at as early a date as possible - We must allow breathing time in order to, make the ordinary preliminary arrangements. The honourable member for Yarra piloted through Parliament a Navigation Act some years ago, and it has not been proclaimed yet. Of course, he is not responsible for the delay; what he did was quite justified.",27
87,Mr TUDOR,JOHN,"Yarra) [11.40]-Whils t I agree with the Minister that the Act must commence to operate on the date fixed by proclamation; his comparison of this Bill with the Navigation Act was most unfortunate. The Act was passed in 1912, and had to be sent to England for the Imperial assent, because a navigation law can only be assented to by the King. Unfortunately, owing to the outbreak of war, the Imperial Government asked that the proclamation of the Act should be postponed. By reason of the. Navigation Act not being in force, some men were prosecuted in the city last week under the Merchant Service Act of 1854. It may be quite right to defer the ? proclamation of this Bill until all the preparations are complete, but I'hope there will be no undue delay. If the Act is not brought into operation the Government will have no legal power to appoint any Commissioners. The Minister may continue his work and make all preparations, even to the extent of choosing the persons who are to be appointed to the Central Commission. I doubt whether the Government could appoint better men that those'who have served on the existing Board of Trustees, namely, Mr Hordern, of Sydney; Mr Denison Miller, of the Commonwealth Bank; Mr Baillieu, of Melbourne; Mr Williams, of the Melbourne Branch of the London Bank; Mr. Garvin, the manager of one of the insurance companies; and Mr Grayndler, representing the workers. Those are all men who rank high in the business world of Australia.",27
88,The CHAIRMAN,JOHN,The honourable member is anticipating a later clause.,27
89,Mr TUDOR,JOHN,"I am merely reminding the Committee that until the Bill is proclaimed the Government will have no power to appoint any Commission, and that is why I urge that there shall be no undue delay in issuing the proclamation.",27
90,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,"I rise to make a personal explanation. I was not aware that when the Minister rose to speak last night the House unanimously expressed a desire that he should not make a speech. The. remarks I made a few minutes ago had no personal relation to the Minister, whom I recognise to be one of the most conscientious workers in the chamber.",27
91,Mr JH CATTS,JOHN,"Cook) [11.43] We are informed that Senator Millen has been considering this matter ever since 'he was placed in charge of repatriation. He has been in charge of the scheme for five month's, and the sum total of his hard work and investigation is this Bill which proposes to substitute a Board of Commissioners for a Board of Trustees.",27
92,Mr JOSEPH COOK,JOHN,"After all, this is a party matter, is it not?",28
93,Mr JH CATTS,JOHN,"There is only one new feature in Senator Millen's speech, and that is the proposal to subsidize private employers for employing men who are partially incapacitated. This is not a party matter, as the Minister for the Navy suggests. The uncertainty and delay in regard to repatriation are being commented upon all over Australia, even by the great journals which support the Government, The Sydney Daily Telegraph, of the 29th March, said in the course of a leading article headed ""Repatriation "" The country is being periodically assured that the Government is "" dealing with the various other phases of the problem, and that it hopes to settle a virile population upon the lands of Australia."" If the Government has been dealing with "" phases"" of the subject for the last twelve months, it is no wonder that it has made such little progress, and that the realization of its laudable hope is still a matter for a remote future. If the Minister in charge of repatriation has any scheme-and , so far, he has revealed none-h e ought to have it ready now - If he has no scheme ready, what is the purpose of the Bill ? The introduction of the measure could have been delayed, .and the activities of the Repatriation Trusees and the State War Councils could have proceeded undisturbed.",28

The Minister, on considering the matter, felt that it was desirable to increase the age, and, in another clause, we intend to - honourable bring the age up to eighteen years, because it is realized that a great deal of the work of repatriation will relate to education.

Our State Workers Compensation Act contains this prostepdaughter, "" Member of a family"" means wife or husband, father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, step[11.55] - I father, stepmother, son, daughter, illegitimate son, illegitimate daughter, grandson, grandstepson, stepdaughter, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister; and, with respeot to an illegitimateworker, includes his mother, and his brothers and sisters, whether legitimate or illegitimate, by the same father and mother. In Western Australia this provision has proved to be very useful, and a benefit has resulted in a number of cases. If I to could rely upon the power of the Commissioners being sufficiently elastic to deal with the cases of illegitimate children, I chilwould not mind the proposed definition the being inserted in the clause. But I find that the omcers of the Defence Department are continually hiding themselves behind the Defence Act and the regulations. Knowing full well that acts justice are being done, they wil l simply tell one if he inquires, "" That is the Act , and there it is . "" Let me give an in stance. Time after time. I have been to the Department to find out why the wife of a soldier who lives in some other part of the world cannot receive a separation allowance, and the only reason I can ascertain is that the Act does not provide for her case. I have never got further than that, either with the Honorary Minister, who at all times endeavours to give me all possible information, or with the Minister for Defence or any of his omcers. In this case I am not prepared to give an opportunity to the Commissioners to escape from the provision of assistance for the class of children whose cause I am advocating.",29
114,Mr FENTON,JOHN,"You are getting what you want in this amendment. ,",30
115,Mr BOYD,JOHN,"He n t y) parently the difficulty of draftin g an amendment to meet the cases he wants to provide for has induced the Honorary Minister to prepare an amendment which, being rather wide in scope, may cover more cases than ought to be covered. It also includes cases which should not be covered.",30
116,Mr JH CATTS,JOHN,But the parentage must always be traced to the soldier.,30
117,Mr BOYD,JOHN,"Le t us take the cases of some soldiers who have been on active service for three years. They each here a wife and a family, but two years after their departure for the Front the f a m i l y increased. I suppose that such children will be included in this definition. I presume that the children have as much claim to be considered as a child who was born out of wedlock.",30
118,Mr HEITMANN,JOHN,"No , because the child is not the offspring of a soldier who is at the Front.",30
119,Mr BOYD,JOHN,"That is true, but the mother of the child is the wife of an absent soldier. ' If it is intended to provide for children born out of wedlock, that is prior to the marriage of the soldier before he went on active service, we may have to deal with the cases of children belonging to the wife of a soldier, but not his children. Again, children may have been adopted by a soldier.",30

121,Mr BOYD,JOHN,"Yes ; but those children of in - are just as much illegitimate as a child who is born to the wife of a soldier after he has gone to the Front. Mr ""WISE - That is a different thing altogether.",30

Where a man has been away from Australia on active service for a period, say, of one year, tliere can be no doubt as to the paternity of a child that is born to the wife afterwards. How are such cases to be dealt with?",30

124,Mr GROOM,JOHN,* That question will not arise under this provision.,30
125,Mr LAMOND,JOHN,"There is no such provision in the Bill , so far as I can see.",30
126,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"Still , the measure is wide enough to allow regulations to be framed to meet such cases. Amendment agreed to.",30
127,Mr GREGORY,JOHN,"Dampier) [12.3] If I have an absolute assurance from the l e ft Honorary Minister that this course will be adopted, I shall not move an amendment which I have prepared, and which is to insert this definition:"" Repatriation "" includes all matters and things pertaining to the care of the sick, the maimed, and the afflicted on their return to Australia. ' I think that such a definition ought to be included in this clause. I wish to feel absolutely certain that when any soldiers come back, are put into a sanatorium, and need training, everything in connection with that sort of work will not come within the scope of the Defence Department. W it h a huge Department to control, the Minister for Defence has no time to look after such matters. A nd what is more, from what I have seen of the administration by many of his officers in regard to the welfare of those who have been left behind by soldiers, the dependants have not received that care and attention which they ought to have received. I am not satisfied that anything which comes within the sphere of repatriation should be left to the control of the Department. If , however, the Honorary Minister will give me an absolute assurance that all the matters I allude to will come under the control of the Repatriation Gommission, I shall not move the amendment I have prepared.",30
128,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"Darling Downs-Hon orary Minister) [12.5] - I can give the honourable member a definite assurance. The intention is that, generally speaking, the injured and maimed men, on discharge, will pass under the Repatriation Department. This is what he contemplates : - Suppos e that a man has been in hospital suffering from shell shock or wounds or other serious injury, and has obtained his discharge from the Department. The military hospital has done all it possibly can for him, here? and has finished with him. After discharge the principle will be that be will come under the scheme of repatriation. The honourable member has touched on the very point that Senator Millen puts as one of the most pressing questions of all, that is, affecting the injured and disabled men. .A great deal of the discussion has been devoted to the question of dealing with the healthy and the strong.",31
129,Mr GREGORY,JOHN,"We read in the press the other day that, as a matter of administration, the Minister for Defence was making arrangements for some persons to come here to start the manufacture of artificial limbs.",31
130,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"That referred to preliminary negotiations. It is necessary to deal with the healthy and strong, but we must also deal with a large number of men who are returning disabled, having lost limbs or suffering from shell shock. Many of these will require special treatment. Senator Millen is giving a great deal of his time to the question of dealing with those men. In the Old Country that matter was the subject of special care by Mr Barnes, the Minister for Pensions.",31
131,Mr LAIRD SMITH,JOHN,Would it not come under the heading of curative workshops?,31
132,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"Partly . When a soldier is discharged he passes out of the control of the Department, and the matter of providing for him comes distinctly under the repatriation organization.",31
133,Mr GREGORY,JOHN,Automaticall y ?,31
134,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"Yes ; but while the injured man is still in the military hospital, and before he gets his discharge, he may be subjected to treatment for the use and training of the muscles. So far, certain forms of treatment have been provided, such as the use of the bicycle. Experience has shown that if similar exercises can be given in curative workshops, instead of being in a way which has no purpose and leads to nothing, they give the man a sustained interest in life.",31
135,The CHAIRMAN,JOHN,The honourable member is a long way outside the question before the Committee.,31
136,Mr GROOM,JOHN,I was trying to show that for the reason I have mentioned some of the training will have to be given in the military hospitals.,31
137,Mr GREGORY,JOHN,Why not let the repatriation department take over the military hospitals when the men come out,31
138,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"Thes e cases must remain under .the Defence Department, because the men are not discharged, and are receiving military pay, and are entitled to military rights, while still subject to military discipline. The honourable member can rest assured that the Minister for Defence will be only too pleased to allow the Minister for Repatriation to take over these men as soon as they can be discharged. The Defence Department has quite enough to do without retaining unnecessary branches of work. I am sure that is the line on which the two Ministers will co-operate to work the scheme.",31
139,Mr BRUCE SMITH,JOHN,"Parkes) [12.10]. - Althoug h the speech of the Minister (Mr Groom) would occupy a page of this Bill, I do not know now what his criticism is of the suggestion of the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) that we should include in the Bill a definition of repatriation. I take it that the honourable member for Dampier is a little afraid that, by-and-by, cases may be held to be outside the province of this measure, and that he wants to take care that every possible happening to a man who does us the great service of going to the Front shall be comprehended in the measure. That is the very essence of the Billthat we should know who is to come under it and who is not. Therefore, one of the first definitions we want is one showing what repatriation meansWhat better tribunal could we have to settle that on behalf of the Commonwealth than this Committee? Unless the Minister (Mr Groom) can improve on the definition suggested, he ought to adopt it.",31
140,Mr GROOM,JOHN,I do not think the honourable member for Dampier intended his to be a comprehensive definition of all phases of repatriation.,32
141,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,"Wannon) [12.12] The honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) and the Minister (Mr Groom) are just beginning to conceive the difficulty they are in because they have not dealt with fundamentals. I have given notice of an amendment to include a schedule to deal with some settled principles of the Bill, one of them beingFull responsibility for the .restoration to health of our oversea Forces shall rest upon_ the Federal Parliament under this Bill. That embraces everything. \ Mr GROOM - That only includes onehaff of repatriation. When you try to make a definition, the result often is to limit.",32
142,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,"Discussio n may result in a more comprehensive definition Already cases are occurring of men having gone back somewhere up country and suffering a relapse. They have to receive nursing and medical attention, and are landed with a bill which they have to pay out of their own pockets. Unless some definite responsibility is undertaken, we shall find that repatriation will not cover cases that certainly should come under the Bill.",32
143,Mr MCWILLIAM S,JOHN,"Franklin) [12.14] - I hope the suggestion of the honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) will be accepted. It is one of the most important matters with which we have to deal. ' There will be very - serious difficulty, confusion, and conflict between the two Departments if soldiers returning here maimed or ill have to go into military hospitals and remain under the control of the Defence Department for a certain period, and then be transferred to the Eepatriation Department. What I think the honourable member for Dampier wants, and certainly what I want, is a complete divorce of the Eepatriation Department from , the Defence Department. Immediately the returned soldier lands in Australia he should automatically pass under the control of the Eepatriation Department.",32
144,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,JOHN,Bu the has not been discharged when he lands.,32
145,Mr MCWILLIAMS,JOHN,"There is no reason why an arrangement should not be made by which these military hospitals shall be under the control of the Eepatriation Department. These are two friendly Departments, acting under Ministers responsible to the House.",32
146,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"Militar y discipline is essential in the hospitals, but immediately a man is discharged military discipline ceases. . Mr MCWILLIAMS - There is no reason why the man should be discharged, or why he should not remain a soldier, but be subject to, and dealt with by, the Repatriation Department. From one end of Australia to the other a feeling of distrust and dissatisfaction is growing up about '. the manner in which returned soldiers are being dealt with under the Defence Department as it exists today. One can-not shut one's ears to it, and every honourable member knows it is a fact. Now is our' chance to remedy it. We are attempting to make a machine as perfect as possible to deal with returned men, and the - first great step in the reform should be taken the moment a wounded soldier lands in Australia. He should then be taken in charge by the Eepatriation Department, instead of being allowed to remain under the control of the Defence Department for an indefinite period. If the Eepatriation Department is to be the success we hope for, it must have full and complete control of the returned soldier from the day he lands here. I hope the Committee will see that some definition is put in the Bill, or some assurance given by the Minister to insure this being done.",32
147,Mr JH CATTS,JOHN,"Cook) [12.17] - I agree with what is in the minds of both the honourable member forWannon (Mr. Eodgers) and the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory). The Committee must start to construct a scheme into the Bill, and those honourable members are beginning the right way to do it, but the ideas of both are too limited. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr. Eodgers) puts forward a definition which charges the Federal Parliament with the responsibility of restoring returned soldiers to health. We must go far beyond that, and re-habilitate and establish them in civil life.",32
148,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,I come to that afterpatriation wards.,33
149,Mr JH CATTS,JOHN,We cannot lay down the scope of our work in a number of definitions.,33
150,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,"I do not propose it as a definition. I propose in a schedule set out briefly some of the fundamentals of this scheme, one of which is restoration to health, another restoration to civil life, and so on.",33
151,Mr JH CATTS,JOHN,No doubt tliere a great deal of merit in the' honourable commences. member's complete proposal. But where is it? Perhaps when the Treasurer has finished trying to persuade the-honourable member for Dampier to withdraw his has amendment I may be allowed to make a suggestion to the honourable member.,33
152,Mr GREGORY,JOHN,The honourable member is a very bad guesser.,33
153,Mr JH CATTS,JOHN,"I would suggest the honourable member for Dampier that ister while his amendment is good as far as it goes, he should extend it to include the dependants of soldiers.",33
154,Mr GREGORY,JOHN,"I do not anticipate that they will want wooden legs or arms, nerve treatment. Mr J. IL. CATTS - I understood that the honourable member wished .to put in definition of repatriation.",33
155,Mr GREGORY,JOHN,I suggest that we should say that repatriation includes certhat tain things.,33
156,Mr JH CATTS,JOHN,"If we say it cludes certain things, then by inference excludes what is not mentioned. amendment should be more comprehenreturn. sive, to include other purposes which every member has in mind. The honorthis able member is on the right track, but ask him to include in the definition of sure. repatriation activity the widows and dependants of soldiers.",33
157,Mr LAMOND,JOHN,"Illawarra) [12.20] I do not approve of inserting definitions in the Bill unless they are absolutely cessary, because it is likely they will hamper the repatriation authority in the work which lies before it. It seems to me that it would be wise to gather experiscope ence as time goes on, and subsequently review and, if necessary, improve this measure. Honourable members who dein sire these definitions to be inserted do'well to wait, because it is possible their insertion would limit the powers of the reauthority instead of est ending the scope of the Bill. Mr KELLY. (Wentworth) [12.22] If any attempt is to be made to define the scope of the repatriation scheme I hope, at all events, that the authorities will be to allowed to take preliminary steps in England after the consummation of peace, There seems to be an idea that it is possible to define clearly' where the responsibility of the Defence Department ends is and that of the Repatriation authorities After the declaration of peace many thousands of our soldiers will necessarily be obliged to remain in England for some time, and if-this country any national sanity at all it ought to provide facilities for those men to get experience in some specialized calling, so that upon their return to this country they ""may be of added Value to it. I have to had certain correspondence with the Minfor Repatriation on this matter, and I should like to have it ventilated now that this question of definitions is under consideration. The military authorities even now should be considering the possibility or of arranging for the apprenticeship in England of suitable men, who, after the declaration of peace, may be required to a remain in England for some time awaiting transhipment to Australia. It should be the object of this Government to see after peace has been declared certain numbers of our soldiers in England will inhave the opportunity of gaining knowit ledge of such specialized industries as may The be established in this country upon their For that reason I do not desire to see any attempt made at definitions in clause, and I view with suspicion any I attempt to limit the scope of the mea",33

159,Mr KELLY,JOHN,"On e cannot be too caref ul when dealing with definitions, which, in themselves, suggest a limitation of the of the measure. With the honorto able member for Illawarra (Mr. Lamond), I think that at present we are a somewhat hazy position with regard would to repatriation. When this involved problem receives consideration by the authority to be constituted, new aspects will be presented, and Ave should not in any way prejudice that consideration by inserting in the definitions anything of a binding nature.",33
160,Mr MCWILLIAMS,JOHN,Do you suggest that all the men should remain under the control of the Defence Department until they are discharged?,34
161,Mr KELLY,JOHN,"I do not see how that"" can be avoided.",34
162,Mr HEITMANN,JOHN,Until the repatriation scheme is in operation they must remain under the Defence Department.,34
163,Mr KELLY,JOHN,"Until a man is discharged we will not be in a position to know if he is to be repatriated. For instance, a man might return to Australia convalescent after an attack of typhoid _ fever, and might be more fit to return to the Front after the voyage than a man who bad been slightly wounded. I regret that this question of the definitions has been introduced at this stage.",34
164,Mr SPENCE,JOHN,"Darwin) [12.28] - I am rather surprised at the suggestion that there should be a departure from the principle laid down that a soldier will come under the jurisdiction of the Repatriation authorities when he is discharged. There now appears a disposition to load the Commissioners with other duties, notwithstanding that the Defence Department has had considerable experience in this matter.",34
165,Mr GREGORY,JOHN,The work has been done very badly.,34
166,Mr SPENCE,JOHN,"--I disagree entirely from the honourable member's statement that the general public of Australia are dissatisfied in this matter, and I recommend the honourable member to inspect some of the hospitals that have lished by the Department.",34
167,Mr GBEGORY,JOHN,Some of the officials ought to be in gaol for neglect.,34
168,Mr SPENCE,JOHN,"Genera l statements of that nature are wrong. Under this scheme it is proposed that returned men shall come under the Repatriation authorities after their discharge. That is the best line to adopt. If , however, we are going to ask the Repatriation Commissioners take charge of men who come out on pital ships, and whose health has not been re-established, it will simply mean that they will be handed over from an authoby rity which has all the machinery in ing order to another body probably totally unfitted to control. If , as has been suggested, officers of the Defence Department have not shown themselves efficient in their work, what guarantee is there that this new and inexperienced Department will prove more efficient? That seems to be a point which has been entirely overlooked. The Honorary Commissioners for Repatriation will have enough work to do in arranging for the future of a soldier according to his circumstances and his means, without' having these extra duties cast upon them. Definitions always narrow the scope of. a measure, and I should like to see plenty of room for the Commissioners to gather experience as they go along.",34
169,Mr SAMPSON,JOHN,"Wimmera) [12.33]. - I agree with what the honourable member for Hlawarra (Mr Lamond) and the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr. Kelly) have said with regard to the inadvisableness of hampering the Commissioners, and I think, also, the criticism of medical men in the Defence Department is altogether too sweeping. Everybody knows that mistakes have been made. Necessarily, in a huge organization like the Defence Department mistakes will occur, but I invite honourable members to go out to the Caulfield Hospital and there see what is being done for our returned soldiers. And that hospital is not the only one of its kind. Others in the various States, I presume, have been organized in the same way. We cannot be too grateful for the splendid work which our medical men and nurses have done for our soldiers.",34
170,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,That is one branch of the organization which reflects credit been estabupon the Department.,34
171,Mr SAMPSON,JOHN,"In addition, all branches of our military organization are entitled to credit for the manner in which they have organized in connection with our overseas army, but we must remember that defects and blunders will occur in the working of a new system, although these are being rectified as time goes on. After the war is over it is likely that the military hospitals will become too large for to administration by the Defence Departhosment, and perhaps they could be made better use of as part of the great organization for repatriation. As has been stated the honourable member for Illawarra, workwe shall probably require to amend the Act every twelve months, but, in the meantime, it will perhaps be advisable for the Repatriation Commission to get into touch with the Defence Department in order that these hospitals may be passed over to that body ab the end of the War.",34
172,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,"Wannon) [12.36] All those who have been at close quarters with this subject of repatriation for some time are anxious that some definite scheme shall be laid down. There were on the Central Board which dealt with this question, brilliant men of great business capacity who had been drawn from all parts of Australia. They were presided over by the Prime Minister, and their object was to do their utmost in the direction of repatriating our soldiers. they had no definite plan before them, and, consequently, their labours were practically futile. I am satisfied that not one of those gentlemen would accept a trusteeship under this Bill for all the tea in China. Yet honourable members' who have not come into close touch with the subject of repatriation are desirous of leaving the entire scheme to members of the Central Commission which is to be appointed under this Bill .",35
173,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"Darling , Downs-Hon orary Minister) [12.37],- I can assure the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Sampson) that after a soldier has been discharged maimed and injured, he will pass from the control of the Defence Department to that of the Repatriation Department. The manufacture and maintenance of artificial limbs is an essential part of the repatriation ischeme. I l l reply to the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory), I would say that general allegations against our military hospitals are very dimcult to sustain. As a matter of fact, the administration of these institutions has been exceptionally good, and We are under a deep debt of gratitude to the medical men who> in many instances, have rendered magnificenb service by devoting the whole of their experience and knowledge to the inmates of these hospitals. They have made great self-sacrifice, which should be recognised. The position is that a soldier returning from the Front maimed and injured, will be met on his arrival and taken immediately to one of our military hospitals, where he will be subjected to treatment. The treatment which aims at restoring the use of his limbs will be started as early as possible, immediately upon his discharge he will pass under the control of the Repatriation Department. Effect will, therefore, be given to the desire of the honourable member for Wimmera.",35
174,Mr GREGORY,JOHN,"I desire, by way of personal explanation, to say that so eager am I that all these men should be placed under the control of the Minister for - Repatriation, that I was obliged, to some exfent, to reflect on the Base Hospital. The incident which I am about to relate came under my own personal notice. A lad was sent fro m Seymour to ' Melbourne by an early train, which arrived here about midday. At 3 o'clock the same afternoon a friend visited the But Base Hospital for the purpose of seeing him. At that time there was no record that the boy had arrived there. Ab 4.30 o'clock there was still no record of his admission to the institution,'and he had not then been examined by a doctor, although he was supposed tto be suffering from meningitis,",35
175,Mr TUDOR,JOHN,Surely he was not sent down by train if he Were thought to be suffering from meningitis?,35
176,Mr GREGORY,JOHN,Certainl y he was. How else could he be sent ?,35
177,Mr FENTON,JOHN,"Maribyrnong) [12.42]. - Revertin g to the point raised by the honourable member for Wentworth, I should like to know whether, when the battle flag has been furled, the large number of Australian troops who will be obliged to remain on the other side of the world for some time, will automatically pass under the control of the Repatriation Department ?",35
178,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"Darling Downs-Hon orary Minister) [12.43] - Our soldiers overseas haveenlisted for service abroad, and it is our obligation to return them to Australia. But they will not pass from the control of the Defence Department to that of the Repatriation Department u n t i l they have received their discharge. The idea of the honourable member for M a r i byrnong is that there will be a certain number of men who will be obliged to remain in England, and who may desire to secure a trainin g in some particular avocation before their return to Australia. I will submit that point for the consideration of the Minister.  thinlc that a selection ought to be made of the men overseas for the purpose of giving them a training in England. Some of them may have to remain in the Old Country for two years. The suggestion made by the honourable member for M a r i byrnong is a very valuable one. If men are given a training such as has been suggested, they will be of greater value when they return to Australia.",35
179,Mr TUDOR,JOHN,"Yarra) [12.45] - It is estimated by those who are in a position to judge that, after the war has terminated, at least two years will elapse before the last Australian soldier can be shipped from the Old Country. If in the interval our men can be usefully employed, that will be infinitely better than keeping them in camp. We all know that recruits who have been kept in camp in Australia for several months become very discontented. They say, "" F o r Heaven's sake, give us our discharge unless you are prepared to send us away."" When the terrible struggle which is now in progress has concluded, and our men are returned to England, - those who are familiar with Australians know what they will be likely to do if they are kept idly in camp. This problem will be a most difficult one to solve. But if whilst they are in England they are able to supplement their knowledge of any particular trade or calling",36
180,Mr MCWILLIAMS,JOHN,I am afraid that the English workers will have something to say about our full-grown men butting in as apprentices.,36

184,Mr GROOM,JOHN,I am afraid that this definition does not quite cover the case of the nurses to whom the honourable member for Parkes has referred.,36

The exact terminology necessary to cover the case of the nurses referred to by the honourable member for Parkes can be settled later. I suggest that, in the meantime, the Committee might accept the amendment as I have submitted it :",36
187,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,"Will this definition in clude the soldier and his dependants, as set out in the War Pensions Act? We should avoid the necessity of the soldier or the public requiring to consult the War Pensions Act, this measure, and also the Various regulations.",36

192,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"Darling Downs-Honor ary Minister) [12.57] - Repatriation covers an enormous area, and is limited only by what is contained in this Bill providing for assistance and benefits to returned soldiers as set out in clause 8. Ib would be a very serious matter to throw upon the Commonwealth the burden of a repatriation scheme to cover all persons throughout the Empire who have served in British Naval or Militar y Forces, and who choose to come to Australia. That may be legitimately done by State legislation in tended to provide for land settlement by soldiers. The idea of that legislation that discharged soldiers may become manent residents in the Commonwealth, and that immigration may be promoted.",37

196,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"No , because the two authorities are dealing with different prolishments blems. Sitting suspended from. 1 to 2.30 p.m.",37
197,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"W it h the consent of the Committee, I shall substitute the following amendment for that previously stated from the Chair:That sub-clause (2) be omitted and the lowing sub-clause be inserted in lieu thereof :"" (2) For the purposes of this Act any peri son who(a) is or has been, during the present a member of the Naval Forces enlisted or appointed for or employed on active service outside Australia or employed on a ship of war; or (&) is or has been, during the present war, a member of the Army Medical Corps Nursing Service accepted or appointed by the Director-General of Medical Services for service outside Australia; or (c) is serving or bas served during the present war in the Naval or' Military Forces of any part of the King's Dominions, other than the Commonwealth, on proof to the satisfaction of the Commission, that he had, before his enlistment or appointment for service, resided in the Commonwealth; or (d) is or has been, during the present war, a member of the Army Medical Corps Nursing Service of any part of the King's Dominions, other than the Commonwealth, on proof to the satisfaction of the Commission, that she had, before her acceptance by or appointment to that service, resided in Australia, shall be deemed to be an Australian soldier is within the meaning of this Act."" perThat amendment gives effect to the promise to include in the definition women residents of Australia who enlisted in the A r m y Medical Service Corps of otlier As to the definition contained in the Victorian measure for the settlement of discharged soldiers, it includes any person who has served in the war, even though he may not previconously have been a resident of the ComWe cannot make our definition so wide.

198,Mr SAMPSON,JOHN,Certain training estabare to be used in connection with the settlement scheme.,37
199,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"Yes , but largely for the training of men of the class to which I refer. I spoke to the Minister in charge of Repatriation on the subject, and he told me that the immigration of such men is now the subject of correspondence befoltween this Government and the Imperial Government. Under the circumstances t is wise for us to confine our legislation war, to the problem that we have to face-the or Military repatriation of our own men.",37
200,Mr SAMPSON,JOHN,Unde r our scheme why should not a British soldier-sa y a mechanic-hav e the same opportunities to engage in work here as an Australian soldier ?,38
201,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"That question opens up a bigger problem, which will face us after the war. It concerns immigration rather than repatriation.",38
202,Mr SAMPSON,JOHN,The State authorities are already dealing with this matter.,38
203,Mr GROOM,JOHN,Only as regards land settlement. I do not think that we are in a position at present to consider it. - Mr MCWILLIAMS - We shall have - quite enough to do to provide for our own men.,38
204,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"That is our first obligation. Personally, I should view with satisfaction the advent in Australia of any person who has risked his life in the defence of the Empire, and I am sure that such persons will receive sympathetic treatment.",38
205,Mr TUDOR,JOHN,"Yarra) [2.36] - If what the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Sampson) suggests were done, reciprocal arrangements between the various parts of the Empire would be necessary, and in making tliem the measures passed by other parts of the Empire would have to be considered carefully. It is estimated that we shall have to provide for the repatriation of about 250,000 men If it is going to cost anything up to £100,000,000 to provide for them, no Government can be expected lightly to agree to the opening of the door wider. Naturally, if soldiers get better conditions than elsewhere, they will come here. But we have quite enough, to do in providing for those who went from Australia. As the Minister says, any others who come bere will receive sympathetic treatment. The task of repatriation will tax the energies, not only of Ministers,"" but of every man who sits in this Parliament for the next ten years.",38
206,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,"Wannon) [2.37] In February, 1916, there was a Conference between the Commonwealth and the States, Avhicli preceded the introduction of the Victorian measure to which reference has been made. I do not know whether the Minister has since had a conference with the Victorian Minister for Lands (Mr Hutchinson), though there has been opportunity for it while the Bill has been going through the Victorian Parliament. I raised this question on clause 1, and raise it again now for this reason: When Sir Rider Haggard visited Australia and New Zealand some time ago he arranged with the various Governments that in land settlement the same treatment should be accorded to soldiers who had enlisted in any other part of the Empire as was given to our own soldiers. A tentative arrangement was made, and Sir Eider Haggard cabled it to the Old Country and elsewhere. The Victorian measure honours the compact which was then made. Under the Bill as it stands, the Commonwealth will provide for the granting of sums up to £500 to any Australian soldier settled on the land of this country, but no provision will be made for a soldier from any other part of the Empire who has elected to throw in his lot with us. As the Minister has pointed out, a much larger question than repatriation is being opened up-the readjustment, after the war, of the population of the Empire. I hope that the Ministry will endeavour to bring about reciprocal arrangements between the various parts of the Empire, particularly in regard to land settlement, so that the same provision may be made for soldiers from other Dominions as for our own.",38
207,Mr BRUCE SMITH,JOHN,"Parkes) [2.40]. - There is a doubt which I should like the Minister to settle. Under the Bill, the Commonwealth assists the States j by way of loan, for their expenditure on land which is to be given to returned soldiers. here The States are also carrying on schemes of their own for the settlement of men on the land. I wish to know how we have limited the obligations of the Commonwealth in regard to those advances. Is a careful distinction to be made between Commonwealth and State undertakings 1",38

231,The CHAIRMAN,JOHN,Order ! The On Standing Orders provide that when an amendment is moved to a clause the disrecussion must be confined to that amendment. The discussion now taking place aprelates to something that is really outside the scope of the Bill . This is really a to machinery measure. I ask the Committee to assist me in upholding the Standing i,39
232,Mr BBUC ESMITH,JOHN,"On the point of order, sir, I am - sure we shall support you in your endeavour to keep the debate within the Standing Orders; but I venture to think that you have not quite recognised that in this Bill we have a proposal to guarantee to the States money to be expended as part of the consideration which our soldiers are to Have provided for them on their return, and that in the particular clause now under consideration we are attempting to define what people shall enjoy the benefits of the Bill . those benefits will be the participation in certain expenditure to be made by the States, and we are endeavouring now to ascertain what limitation there is to the responsibilities of the Commonwealth, which is ultimately to pay f he cost. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr . Rodgers) has just told us that, in one of the State Bills, no provision is made for any check by the Commonwealth authorities on the State activities, in advancing money, nor on tlio good judgment of the State authorities in making advances. Under this arrangement we shall be paying while the State is expending; and as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) has said, such an arrangement might lead to endless extravagance.",40
233,The CHAIRMAN,JOHN,"Order ! again to intervene, bu t I would point out that this discussion arose as the result of a question which the honourable member put by way of interjection, to the Minister in charge of the Bill , and to which I allowed the Minister to make a passing reply. No one is more familiar with the principles of parliamentary procedure than is the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Bruce Smith); and he knows that when an amendment to a clause is moved the discussion must be confined to the amendment in connection with the clause to which it applies.",40
234,Mr BRUCE SMITH,JOHN,"You right, Mr Chairman. I admit that I was straying from the point of order into a general debate. I should now like you to consider whether the question of what provision is made in this Bill for the limitation of our responsibilities in respect of the advances to be made to the class of persons whom we are defining under this clause is not relevant to the discussion of tihe clause itself.",40
235,Sir WILLIAM IBVINE,JOHN,"I cannot thinking - that perhaps Chairman, do not entirely appreciate as yet the fact that if the scope of this measure is not defined in the clause before us there is no other clause in which it can be defined. By way of illustration, I would point out that an agreement has been made under which we are to advance certain moneys to the States, and that in one if not more of the State Parliaments legislation has been introduced providing that the money, or some portion of the money so advanced shall be used in assisting, not merely our own soldiers, as Part of defined in this clause, but soldiers of the Empire other than Australians. As you have pointed out, this is merely a machinery Bill . It provides for the erection of certain classes of machinery the operations of which are by this clause to be limited to Australian soldiers. After the clause is passed we shall be precluded from dealing with the question of whether the machinery created by this measure ought to apply to other than those defined in the clause. It may be a very material matter to determine whether the machinery should not be large enough to include other than Australian soldiers; but if the question cannot be raised under this clause I do not think it can be discussed on any otlier provision in the Bill .",40
236,The CHAIRMAN,JOHN,"It is not usual for I regret the Chair tp' indicate where certain amendments may be made or questions discussed. This point, however, has been raised in a spirit which I much appreciatei and I would point out'that the question of the responsibility of the States to the Commonwealth, and vice versd, may be raised, in my opinion, on clauses 10, 11, 15, and 2 1 . ' Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 5The Minister shall be charged with the general administration of this Act. - Mr SPENCE (Darling ) [ 3 . 0 ] - I deare quite sire to raise a very important question, which has up to the present been only slightly touched on, that is, what the Government propose to do, ami how far the powers of the Minister extend, in dealing with the situation that we shall inevitably have to face in connection with the soldiers who, after the war, will be waiting to return to Australia. W it h the shortage of shipping, and other existing circumhelp stances, it has been estimated that you, Mr it will take at least two yearsand, indeed, the Minister for Defence atone time estimated the necessary time at three years-befor e our men are all returned. ' I presume that the men will be brought back in the order in which they went away-that the first to go will be the first to return. There is also the question of preference to married men in this connection. After the men have had the holiday, to which they are justly entitled, and are ready to come to Australia, the very worse thing that could happen to them would be to be left out of employment while waiting. The Minister for Defence has stated that the pay of these men will continue until they receive their discharge, and that, of course, will be given here. I do not think that much can be done in the way of securing our soldiers industrial and technical training at Home, in view of the fact that there are some 4,500,000 people employed in the munition factories there, a large percentage of whom are women, and that there has been considerable dilution of labour in the artisan trades. The Old Country would have a big enough problem to face in finding employment for her own people, without our asking any favours for our soldiers, though, of course, if such training could be obtained it would be of considerable value to Australia. I fancy, however, that we shall have to look in some other direction, and my suggestion is that there is more likelihood of suitable empldyment being found for our waiting soldiers in the war areas of France and Belgium after the war is over, with less probability of interfering with the labour market. The problem is one that presents many difficulties, and the Government should at once get to work, because there will have to be much negotiation and intion. quiry. I understand that the Minister for Defence has taken some steps, but there ought, I think, to be operation between the High Comcussed missioner's Office, the Minister for Repatriation, and the Defence partment, and some Australian Commismatter sion, to obtain all the necessary informashall tion as to the chance of suitable work our men while awaiting their return home. Of course, we wish all our boys come back, and there may be a percentage of men who will elect to remain in Great Britain. That percentage will not be a Mr Spence. large one, for we may presume that no Australian would care to stay very long in the Old Land.",40
237,Mr MCWILLIAMS,JOHN,What is the rate of wages in Belgium ?,41
238,Mr SPENCE,JOHN,"I do not know; and I do not think it matters much, for, in any case, Australian wages would be paid. We take it, I think, that Germany ought to make good the cost of rebuilding and restoring the war areas in Belgium and France; and, if our men were engaged, they would, of course, as I say, be paid at Australian rates. Before our soldiers arrive in Australia, it is desirable, according to the Minister, that there should be a proper registration of them, so that there may be no delay on that score after their arrival; and from now on, there should be some responsible body in England devoted to that work. We do not know, of course, what the fortune of war may be, but we ought to be-preparing now, so far as we can, for the future of our men in order to avoid delay in the future. Nothing would be more regrettable than to have our men kept idle in camp; and I think it would please them to. assist in rebuilding the homes of the people of France and Belgium. It is to the brave soldiers of Belgium and France that we owe the fact that we are not living under the German flag today, so that there is some sentiment in the matter. Even if the return of our men occupied only a year, the problem is still a serious one, and as England will have enough to do in transporting home her own troops from abroad we shall have to make our own arrangevery ments, which may occupy some time. As I say, the whole matter is one for careful and immediate negotiation and consulta",41
239,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"Darling Downs-Hon orary Minister) [3.10] - The question coraised by the honourable member was dis.this morning. He is, of course, looking a long way ahead, but, at the Desame time,' there is no reason why the should not be considered now. I place the suggestions made today for before the Minister for Defence, and I am sure they will receive his sympathetic to consideration. The question of registration is being attended to. The Minister for Repatriation, when he introduced the Bill, said there would be no difficulty in securing the necessary registration after the soldiers return, but it was being considered whether registration could not be secured prior to the departure of the men from England. That, of course, was with, a view to the people here being ready to receive them.",41
240,Mr FLEMING,JOHN,Is there any idea as to the order of their coming back?,42
241,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"It is impossible to have any idea at this stage, but the feeling is that those who were at Gallipoli should have the first consideration. The men must also be dealt witli according to their physical condition.",42
242,Mr FLEMING,JOHN,What about preference to married men ?,42
243,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"That also will have to be considered. One case brought under notice was that of a man who has done over 1,000 days at the Front.",42
244,Mr LAMOND,JOHN,"Illawarra) [3.14] - I move That the following words be added to the clause "" and with the supervision of the expenditure of all funds provided by the Commonwealth for the States for the purposes of the settlement of returned soldiers upon the land."" It seems to me that the principle of transferring land settlement to the they States is an entirely vicious one; i places on the - Commonwealth the responbelong. sibility of finding money to be expended by the States without any supervision on sliould the part of the Commonwealth. My own view of repatriation by means of land tlement is that too much reliance is upon schemes which are not schemes f repatriation, but schemes, either to profully mote some particular fad of settlement entertained by sections of the community, or to get r i d of unsuitable land, or designed by the States to secure settlement in a way they have found impossible by ordinary land legislation.",42
245,Mr TUDOR,JOHN,Will not the amendment have the effect of limiting the Minister's would be better - fitted to accept the repowers ?,42
246,Mr LAMOND,JOHN,"I do not think so. were If the Bill is passed as it stands, the M i nister wil l have no control over the expenditure of the £2,000,000 already voted the Commonwealth Parliament.",42
247,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,JOHN,The money has not yet been voted.,42
248,Mr LAMOND,JOHN,"I understand that some agreement has been arrived at tween the Commonwealth and the States, but the bodies created under this Bill have no control over the money provided for the States for settling soldiers on the land. It is a responsibility that rests on this Parliament to see that the soldier who is anxious to take up land does it under the most favourable conditions that can be secured for him ; and it is a responsibility that should not be handed over to the States. Responsibility should rest on the bodies constituted under this Bill to m&ke full investigation, not only into a soldier's qualifications to earn a livelihood on the land, but also into the suitability of the land itself for the purpose that he has in view. But that responsibility is now placed beyond the control of this Parliament. The proposal we have before us from the Minister is that we should meet our obligations to the soldiers who wish to go on the land by handing them over to the tender mercies of the different States. The Victorian Bill uses the term "" Victorian soldiers."" It is doubtiful whether the State will display the same amount of interest in soldiers who cBme from other States, wishing to settle in Victoria, as will be taken in soldiers who belong to Victoria. On the other hand, the Commonwealth is interested in the welfare of all soldiers, no matter from what State come, who indicate a desire to settle t on land in a State to which they do not The whole principle of repatriation be the assistance ,of our returned soldiers, to get back to the setwork they are anxious to do, and placed for which they are best fitted, and or we could have aided them better by more recognising our responsibilities to them, that is, by paying pensions adequate enough to enable those who return in sound health to resume tlieir ordinary occupations and still be in a better position than when they left them. So long as they are enjoying an adequate pension - whic h they have f u l ly earned-the y 1 sponsibility for their own futures if they left free to, follow their own courses. Without consulting Parliament!, the by Ministry have already bound the Commonwealth to finance the 'States to any amount they choose to spend upon schemes that their Parliaments decide upon as being suitable for the repatriation of besoldiers. I object to anybody spending money provided by this Parliament when will that expenditure is outside the control of the Commonwealth. For example, a huge 2756 Australian Soldiers' [REPRESENTATIVES.] system of purchase of estates has beeu proposed in some States for the purpose of settling soldiers on them. In my opinion, each soldier should be free to buy land from the State or from private individuals as he likes; he should be able to claim the assistance of the Committees appointed under this Bill to enable him to choose the land which is best fitted for his purpose; he should be able to claim such financial assistance as may be necessary for carrying out his purpose in his own way. It is the only method by which we can secure the effective settlement of soldiers upon the land. An y proposal to d r a f t them all on to big estates or to distinguish between the civilian and the soldier population will be a great mistake. The object of"" any repatriation scheme should be to convert the soldier into the civilian, and to get him back to the occupation he followed before he enlisted. The sooner the soldier becomes a citizen of the Commonwealth the better it wi}l be for himself and the community generally. There has been talk of establishing community settlements. I am afraid that the Minister in charge of this scheme has too much in mind the idea that this ie an opportunity for enforcing intense culture on men who may not be too anxious to be forced into the adoption of that method of cultivation. It would be a mistake to attempt to force fads upon our soldiers. What we should attempt is to assist soldiers to make their livelihood in the way that they think best and in whatever part of Australia they choose to settle in . Above all things, in the interest of the soldiers themselves, I object to any money being provided by the Commonwealth for expenditure by the States or any other bodies over which this Parliament has iiO control.",42
249,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,JOHN,"Flinders) to [3.24] - I agree to a great extent with all the reasons advanced by the honourable member for his amendment. At the same time, I have come to the conclusion that his proposal will create a considerable amount, of embarrassment in dealing with this Bill . It is really tantamount to saying that the Commonwealth Parliament should not advance moneys to the States without retaining the control of - the expenditure of that money. I cordially agree with that proposal, but the better time for discussing the question of advances to the States for this purpose, and the conditions that should be attached to Repatriation BiM. those advances, would be when we come to deal with the particular matter as it comes before us on the annual Estimates.",43
250,Mr LAMOND,JOHN,When shall we get them ?,43
251,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,JOHN,We have been promised that the House will have the opportunity of. discussing the Estimates before Christmas. There is some misunderstanding as to whether any moneys have already been advanced.,43
252,Mr TUDOR,JOHN,"A definite statement was made by the Prime Minister at an Inter-State Conference. He told the State Premiers that the Commonwealth were prepared to make available a sumnot exceeding £2,000,000 for the calendar year ending 1917. Sir WILLIAM IRVINE ! - I am quite aware of that promise, but, of course, it was subject to ratification by Parliament, as all such promises are. That ratification will be secured when we agree, to the item in the Estimates to which I "" have just referred. It will lead to a great deal of embarrassment in debating the matter of repatriating our soldiers if ""we attempt to introduce into it a discussion as to the terms and conditions upon which we should advance moneys to the States. This Bill makes no provision for advancing moneys.",43
253,Mr LAMOND,JOHN,-Does not the agreement with the States arise out of the Bill ?,43
254,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,JOHN,"As I understand it , the agreement already entered into is a matter of which we have no cognisance. We have not been asked to authorize it or the conditions under which the money is to be advanced. We shall be asked for that authority when the Estimates come before us. If we are to enter upon an extremely important discussion now as to how we should hand that money the States, instead of allowing the matter to be discussed in the ordinary way when the Estimates come before us, we shall have practically a financial debate on this clause of the Bill . I do not know whether it would be strictly relevant, but it would certainly be highly inconvenient.",43
255,Mr WATT,JOHN,"The matter arises in an indirect way, because the supervision of land settlement will practically amount to authority to control the expenditure.",43
256,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,JOHN,"Until I hear arguments to the contrary, I feel strongly disposed to support the honourable member's general contention that if we are to provide loan moneys for the States to spend in settling soldiers on the land, we should have, through the State Boards to be appointed by us, and'-not by the States, a supervision and control over the expenditure of that money.",43
257,Mr WATT,JOHN,"It would be a system of joint control over a, very dimcult business.",44
258,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,JOHN,"I know that it will be extremely dimcult. In the first place, the States will claim the complete control over the disposal of their own laud. Although in Victoria a very small.area of Crown land is available for the settlement of returned soldiers, in other States considerable areas are available. The States naturally claim that righb, and we cannot deprive them of it . They prop'ose to appoint their own officers for making advances to the soldier settlers, and I understand they desire to obtain the money for such advances from the Commonwealth under the agreement which has been made. That is where the difficulty arises. The Commonwealth ought, through its own authorities, to exercise supervision, and determine the conditions upon which such advances shall be made. Those conditions ought, as far as possible, to be the same all over Australia, and subject to the same general control.",44
259,Mr WATT,JOHN,"-Would such control go as far as the superintendence of the whole scheme, or only the supervision of the advances for improvements?",44
260,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,JOHN,"That is a difficult question to answer iiow. ultimate form in which this expenditure, for which the Commonwealth has to pledge its credit, shall be incurred, should be controlled by the Commonwealth Parliament. It might be highly desirable in connection with many matters-Crow n lands for instance-to delegate to the St^te Parliaments such authority as we think wise to delegate, but that would be very different fro m handing over to their uncontrolled discretion the expenditure of these large sums.",44
261,Mr HEITMANN,JOHN,That is not the case. Under the supervision of the Commonwealth advances will be made to the sot'tlsrs,44
262,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,JOHN,"F i r s t of all in this Bill we are providing the Federal machinery, including State Boards appointed by the Governor General in Council, to control the expenditure of moneys under the authority of this measure. A p a r t from that, there is another kind of expenditure. We shall be lending to the States large sums of money£2,000,000 is provided on the Loan Esti* mates this year-whic h will not be distributed by the Boards appointed by the Federal authority, but by 'the States according to their own ideas.",44
263,Mr LAMOND,JOHN,Does not (that necessarily involve different treatment of the soldiers in different States?,44
264,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,JOHN,"I admit that we cannot have absolute uniformity of treatment, because the conditions in the States vary. The State Governments may be of great help in determining the conditions of settlement, particularly on Crown lands.",44
265,Mr WATT,JOHN,The States have a lot of experience which we lack.,44
266,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,JOHN,"I concede that, but we ought not to advance to the States large sums of money for the settlement of soldiers without taking responsibility for the conditions under which that money is to be expended. Therefore, I am inclined to agree witn the views put forward by the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Lamond), but I feel very much embarrassed by finding this subject' grafted on to this Bill for discussion. The proper time to discuss it will be when Parliament is asked to give authority to advance these large sums.",44
267,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"Darling Downs-Hon orary Minister) [3.35] - I ask the honourable member for Illawarra not to press The his amendment. The matter of land settlement in connection with repatriation was the subject of a definite agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, and must come up for discussion on the proposal to appropriate £2,000,000 for this year to give effect to that agreement. Already the Loan Estimates' have been tabled in, this chamber.",44
268,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,B y virtue of that arrangement the States have entered into commitments.,44
269,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"Such expenditure as has been incurred has been in accordance with the provisions of the agreement, and has been in the form of advances for improvements, purchase of stock and plant, or for other developmental purposes. A sum of £20,000 was advanced to the States during the last financial year, but no.money has been advanced in the current year. Yesterday I submitted to the House a return which showed that the applications byreturned soldiers for land had been confined to the number of 295 in Victoria, 124 in New South Wales, 224 in South Australia, 16 in Western Australia, and 25 in Tasmania. All those applications involve a liability by the Commonwealth.",44
270,Sir WILLIAMIBVINE,JOHN,"Can you state, Parliament ? approximately, the extent of the committments ?",45
271,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"The sums in conposes nexion with the applications referred to are not very large yet. I ask honourable members to remember that we are dealing with sovereign States, which have full powers in regard land settlement. Under the stitution, all Crown lands belong the States, and are at their disposal, and authorities. any other lands they acquire for purposes of land settlement will be paid for out moneys they will raise independently the agreement with the Commonwealth. We have made a definite agreement as to the responsibility on the States. the terms upon which we shall lend money to the States, and that money is to be lent for specific purposes. say, advances for fixed improvements, plant, et cetera. The Minister is now exercising supervision over the money vanced in order to see that it is being exother way. pended for the purposes for which it is lent.",45
272,Sir WILLIAMIBVINE,JOHN,We should some assurance that when the matter is unthinkable. comes in proper form before Parliament our hands will not be tied by huge mitments.,45
273,Mr GROOM,JOHN,We are bound by the arrangement we have made.,45
274,Sir WILLIAMIBVINE,JOHN,We cannoti bound to finance the arrangement if liament has not given the authority.,45
275,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"A large number of solagreement diers had returned and were waiting for land. It was not desirable that the grantwith ing of their applications should be dediture ' layed. We must not forget that States are just as heartily in sympathy with the soldiers as we are. They reprevidual sent the same people, and are just as keen upon repatriation as is the Federal liament. The Commonwealth is merely co-operating with the States, which have their own Lands Departments, and cultural banks, and also staffs with complete and intimate knowledge of their own areas. We must malee use of that State machinery. Ib is not desirable we should duplicate that machinery just for the purpose of settling the returned soldiers on the land.",45
276,Sir WILLIAM IBVINE,JOHN,"The honourable member does not suggest that £18,000,000 is to be finally handed over to the States without any supervision at all by this",45
277,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"We are bound to see that the money is expended for the purfor which it was borrowed, but the conditions upon which each of the six different States will lend the money out to the individual soldiers must, to a great extent, be left to be determined by the to States according to their own land laws. ConThere is a fair division of the responsito bilit y between the Federal-and State 0",45
278,Sir WILLIAMIBVINE,JOHN,It is the sort of of division in which the States have the whole of of the responsibility.,45

The M i nister, in his negotiations and dealings the States, is supervising the expeni n order to insure that it is apthe plied to the purposes for which we intend it. As regards the conditions of the indiallocations, it must be remembered thab in the six different States the lands Parvary; there are different land laws and different forms of administrative machinery, and it would be most dimcult to have agria uniform system throughout the Coma monwealth. So long as we find that the States are honestly striving to carry out the arrangement made with us, and that that the Commonwealth is retaining control under this agreement, what honourable members desire will be effected. However, the whole subject can be more properly discussed when the Bill containing the propriation for this purpose is before House - I ask the honourable member not to press his amendment. The matter can be fully and properly discussed on the selves. Estimates.",45
282,Mr JH CATTS,JOHN,"Cook) [3.45] should very much like the Commonwealth' to take charge of the whole matter if that were possible; but, having been associated with repatriation work in New South Wales, I know it to be utterly practicable. Unless the Minister interone entirely for the States. feres too much with the arrangements now in existence, the Commonwealth will have a direct check upon all the expendipatriation ture. The Bill provides for State Boards to deal with repatriation. At present there are State War Councils special Repatriation Committees of those Councils.",46

CATTS - The machinery provided for by the Bill will be similar that now in existence; in fact, I cannot conceive that the Commonwealth will ments. throw away the existing machinery. If it gets rid of those who have so far handling the repatriation question, and begins de novo, it will lose valuable perience.",46

285,Mr JH CATTS,JOHN,"The State Eemen patriation Committees are composed representatives of the Commonwealth and of the States concerned. Any question affecting land brings a consultation with the omcers of the Lands Department the State, and when expenditure is made on improvements, the Committees' spectors keep continuously in - touch with the work that is being done. As a ter of actual practice, all the expenditure on improvements is being checked and watched by officers directly associated with the Repatriation Committee of the State War Council, which operates under the Defence Department. To change the names of the governing bodies need not instruct the settlers. make any alteration in the procedure. Repatriation Committees are so closely touch with the State Departments, and cure the latest information. work in such harmony, that any disturbance such as might be caused by a more hard-and-fast arrangement would proapbably destroy the direct check upon exthe penditure which now exists, and the States might insist on doing the whole of the land settlement business themThe making available of land for settlement is entirely a matter I for the State authorities, which either repurchase private estates or provide Crown lands for the purpose. It .does not - seem possible to demand Commonwealth supervision of that business. We do not impay for such land, and the matter is In. New South Wales, at any rate, the expenditure on improvements is supervised by the ReCommittee, which is really a Commonwealth Committee, and takes its directions from the Commonwealth authoand rity. The extent to which that State allows the supervision by what is really a Commonwealth authority is remarkable. Of course, the State is. represented on the Committee.

Many returned who have never been on the land deof sire to take up land, and to put them there without expert advice on assistance would be to commit an absurdity.",46
286,Mr LAMOND,JOHN,No one would be so of foolish as to suggest that.,46
287,Mr JH CATTS,JOHN,"That is the effect inof the honourable member's remark. He ridiculed the idea of group settlements. matWhat is a group settlement? Many men desire to start poultry farms without knowing anything about poultry farming. If a group settlement is to be provided for, the State grants land suitable for the purpose, and appoints a poultry expert to live on the spot, and to supervise and He practically teaches them poultry farming. Departin mental machinery is .available to proMany of those who have started poultry farming would have failed had it not been for the group settlement system. The same thing might happen in respect of other industries - If there can be group settlements of farmers and fruit-growers the States will be able to train and help the settlers, who will benefit by each other's experience, and will be more likely to succeed than if settled in various districts. There is a practical difficulty in the way, of the Commonwealth handling these matters. The States have departments of experts who have specialized in certain branches of knowledge. If the Commonwealth were to take over the work it would have to ask the States to lend them their officers and their machinery, or set up machinery of its own, and import experts from other parts of the world, which would cost as much as the actual settling of the soldiers on the land.",46

I take it that we are entering a partnership with the States. It has asserted all over Australia that as our Army was raised"" under Eederal control the responsibility of repatriation belongs to this Parliament. Without the submisi sion of the matter to this Parliament compact was made under which the States with respect to this question. were to take charge of land settlement. My suggestion is that the Prime Minister should be empowered to agree with the States for the supervision of the arrangements between them .and the Commonwealth, and that is, I think, what the honourable member for Illawarra wishes to achieve. South Australia has appointed a Minister for Repatriation to administer its measure. Victoria has put through a separate Bill . This Parliament has provided for advancing £500 per man to 40,000 returned soldiers for land settlement purposes, or £20,000,000. If that money were all used it would, as things stand, be spent without our having any control. In my opinion, we should assume responsibility for repatriation, as we did for the enlisting of an army, farming oub responsibility in respect of land settlement to the States, but with a clear arrangement between the two authorities. Each State, of course, has sovereign power, and may do as it pleases in these matters. But there are agencies through which Commonwealth control could be exercised. The only clause of the Bill that fixes definite responsibility for repatriation on this Parliament is clause 5. Nothing that we could put into the Bill would 'the sovereign power of the States. proposes to use her sovereign power, not only in respect of land settlement, but in other matters. She has set £900,000 for land settlement,",47

296,Mr MCWILLIAMS,JOHN,"The only to receive this money by way of loan. We could not expect them to borrow the money from us, to pay in terest on it , and to have no voice in its expenditure.",48
297,Mr FENTON,JOHN,"I do not think any one entertains such an idea. question the solvency of the States, or their willingness to repay what they ceive from us, but I think it will be a long year before we shall get this money back.",48
298,Mr MCWILLIAMS,JOHN,It is a wealth as well as a State responsibility which the money is being found to meet.,48
299,Mr FENTON,JOHN,"That is so; but if I were a member of a State Parliament I should regard the arrangement as an excellent one for the States from a financial and land settlement point of view. At the last Premiers' Conference, held in January last, the representatives of ' Queensland stated that they had already drafted a scheme of their own, and that it was in partial operation. Mr Hunter, the Minister of Lands in the Queensland Government, as reported at page 36 of the report of the Conference said- > Why should not each State be able to come to the Federal Government with their proposal and say, ""Here is the area-of land we propose to settle. This is what it is going to cost, and we are prepared to carry out the settlement of the soldiers on these terms""? The Commonwealth Government would satisfy themselves whether the proposal was a sound one, or whether there were a better proposition. Theycould either agree to it or turn it down. If - they turned it down, that would be the end of it. ' Mr Hunter was fighting stronelv for his own State's scheme, and urging that the Federal authorities should not unduly in terfere with it , yet he recognised that the State would be expected to go with its scheme to the Commonwealth Government, and say, in effect, to them, "" Come and have a look at our scheme, and if you think it is a good one, lend us the money we require to give effect to it . "" The Prime Minister, in replying to this statement, saidAll I have to say is that a condition precedent to the granting of any sum for any scheme is that the scheme shall be satisfactory to the Commonwealth Government. That is the principle, for which the honourable member for Illawarra is contending, and it appears to have been considered a satisfactory one at the Conference of Premiers. Honourable members will find, on reference to the report of States are the proceedings, that the Prime Minister said again and again that since the Commonwealth Government would have to find the money it could not be expected to - hand it over to the States without retaining the right to say whether or not advances should be made on certain propositions. I do not",48
300,Sir EOBERT BEST,JOHN,"Kooyong) [4.7L re- - Like many other honourable members, I many am in complete accord with the principle of the amendment submitted by my honourable friend (Mr Lamond). Common- Mr MCWILLIAMS - But it is totally at variance with the agreement made by the Prime Minister with the representatives of the States.",48
301,Sir ROBERT BEST,JOHN,"The agreements arrived at by the Conference have been in many respects largely departed from . They have been found to be utterly i m practicable. That being so, the fact that such agreements were made cannot be quoted as a reason why we should not in the formulation of our scheme provide for the effective protection of Commonwealth interests. In view of the general consensus of opinion on the subject the Government should at least give us some assurance that this principle for which we are contending will be substantially observed. I am aware that both the Prime Minister and Mr Watson fought for it strongly in connection with various questions that were dealt with by the Premiers' Conference. It was felt that, since the Commonwealth was to provide the money, it was only reasonable that it should have a substantial, if not a dominating, control over the expenditure of that money. There isi a feeling that in connection with the scheme foreshadowed by Senator Millen, in regard to the settlement of our returned soldiers on the land, we are evading our responsibilities and delegating to the States the whole of that work. Such an attitude on the part of this Parliament would certainly be unreasonable, and do us no credit. The scheme covered, by this Bill provides for the appointment of State Boards. What the functions of those Boards will be, we cannot say; but the general idea in the minds of the. Conference was that .they should consist of Ministers of the several States and a representative of the Commonwealth. there an honourable member who considers that would be a satisfactory Board 1",48
302,Mr MCWILLIAMS,JOHN,No ; I do not think there should be a Minister on it .,49
303,Sir ROBERT BEST,JOHN,"Quite so; there is not an honourable member who would stand by a Board as constituted at the Conference. The Government themselves have departed from that proposition. They simply announce that they propose to constitute a corporate State Board the functions of which are to be decided later on. There should be in each State an expert Board to deal with the expenditure of the moneys we°are to provide for the resumption of land. We should also have a man of wide experience in land settlement to guide every State Board, and the Commonwealth should have the dominant representation on the Board of experts. According to the present idea, money is to be found by the Commonwealth to improve the soldier-settlers' holdings. I do not think it requires very much foresight to see that if not the whole, at least a vast portion, of the money required for land resumption will have to be provided by the Commonwealth.",49
304,Mr LAMOND,JOHN,"And the Commonwealth will have no power, under the Bill as it stands, to see that the best land is secured.",49
305,Sir ROBERT BEST,JOHN,"The principle of my honourable friend's amendment is that of Commonwealth control or supervision, and it is the principle for which we are contending. Instead of such a Board as that to which the Conference agreed, there sliould be a Board ofexperts representative of the Commonwealth and the States, the Commonwealth having the dominant representation. It is also important that a Commonwealth officer of great experience should be the chief executive officer of the State Board. If he is not made a member of the expert Board, he should at least be closely associated with it and should supervise its work. In that way, we should have an immediate link between this particular Board and the State Boards for which the Bill provides. I hope that the opinion which honourable members have expressed on this phase of the question will be recognised by the Government in the formulation of their scheme.",49
306,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,"Unles s there is some form of co-operation, a member of the Is Federal Parliament will not be able to, go to a State Department for information. Soldiers'",49
307,Sir ROBERT BEST,JOHN,"That is quite true. The Minister must realise that the Committee is unanimous on the point that there must be cordial co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States. The Commonwealth has no desire to constitute a separate Department of Lands. I am sure our desire is to make the fullest use of the State Land Departments and the land settlement machinery in operation in the States; but surely if , realizing that the repatriation of our soldiers is a Commonwealth responsibility, we are to supply the necessary funds, we should be directly represented on these Boards. I hope that in formulating their scheme the Government will , at least, provide that the Commonwealth shall have the dominating control in the expenditure of these moneys. It is hardly reasonable to expect the Government to be able, at this stage, to submit its scheme. . We know, however, that land settlement is going to be a vital part of our repatriation scheme, and before that scheme is actually brought into operation, it should be submitted to the Commonwealth Parliament for approval. We should then be able to go full y into it , and to take the responsibility for it . It is quite possible that my honourable friend's amendment might be made in a more convenient part of the Bill , - but the principle of it is one that accords with the general opinion of *he Committee. . Mr STORY (Boothby) [4.16] - I am entirely in sympathy with the amendment moved by the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Lamond). I believe that the Minister for Repatriation should supervise the spending of - the money which this Parliament is to provide. He should be the connecting link between the States, who will have the spending of the money, and the Parliament that will have to find it. The States should be intrusted with the work of settling returned soldiers on the land, but if they have an unlimited supply of money it is just possible that ih© land settlement phase of our scheme may be overdone. I - fear very much that it will be.. There are many who wish to go on the land because they do not know what it really involves. Many of those who go on the land, and obtain practical experience of the drudgery, hardship, and isolation which the life involves, soon become disillusioned, and get off it again as soon as possible. Many of our returned ooldiers, who do not understand what it means, will probably desire to go on the land, and will soon tire of the life, I fear, with the result that immense sums will be wasted in the experiment. There ou^ht to be co-operation between the State and the Federal Government in connection with the whole scheme of repatriation. I want to point out to the Minister a very important feature of repatriation in which the Commonwealth Parliament can, I think, play a useful part. It is a branch of the scheme which should prove reproductive; and I am convinced that if money were spent in the direction that I propose to suggest, it would return to us a very high rate of interest. When a start was first made with the construction of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, large sums of money were wasted because no plant was available. The men had to work without the necessai-y plant,, and without an adequate staff. That great railway project is now on the verge of completion. I h the course of a few months,'the line will be completed, and the Government will have on hand an effective railway plant and an efficient staff, with no employment for them - It is recognised that we shall have to link up the continent from south to north, as we have done from east to west, at the earliest possible moment. This war has made it apparent that we shall have to develop our northern' and interior country, or we have no right to claim such large unoccupied areas. One of the methods which could be adopted by the Government for the repatriation of thousands of men would be to put them to congenial work, employ-ment to which they are accustomed; and there must be amongst them hundreds of navvies, hundreds of men accustomed to cattle, horses, and sheep, and hundreds of miners. A railway has already been surveyed, or is in the course of being surveyed, from a point on the east-west line, right through Oodnadatta to ' the Macdonnell Ranges; and if the Government would spend one or two of the millions that are to be devoted to repatriation on the construction of that line, they would be able to utilize the plant and staff to which I have alluded. Work could be provided for our returned men, and this would open up large tracts of country suitable for settlement, though not, perhaps, altogether for closer settlement. In the Macdonnell Ranges, however, there are large tracts of land where small settlers could grow vegetables, fodder, and so forth , for the soil there will produce anything that can be' produced elsewhere in Australia. Further, the construction of such a line would enable the Government to enter into a project which I advocated in another place as far back as eleven years ago. I refer to the horse-breeding in dustry in Central Australia; and when I then spoke on the subject, I produced figures showing that the South Australian Post and Telegraph Department had, for - a number of years, bred all the horses ; they required in that part of Australia. This is admittedly the finest horse-breeding country in the world, and hundreds of thousands of cattle, and millions of sheep, could be carried there if the railway I mentioned were carried through to the Macdonnell Ranges. Further, the whole of the Northern Territory would be made accessible. We should then be able to wipe out the present deficit on the Territory, and also on the Oodnadatta railway; and, instead of having to meet a loss, I firmly believe that we should find it a most profitable undertaking. Our returned men could be put on to navvy work as they offered themselves; and I am quite satisfied that there are thousands of them who do not desire to be spoon-fed, or require any' Board to tell them how to earn a living, but merely wish to be placed at employment which they understand. I ask the Government to consider whether the two suggestions I have made would not, if adopted, afford suitable avenues of employment. Thousands of the mounted infantry have been accustomed to horses all their lives. A f t e r all great wars, there is a great scarcity of horses; and I think that after this war there will be a greater scarcity than ever right throughout the world. If this in dustry were taken up by the Government, we could every year sell thousands, if not tens of thousands, of suitable horses to the Indian Government; there are enormous possibilities in this connection. The Government would, at the same time, be assisting in the great repatriation movement in a way not only profitable to the country, but suitable to our returned men. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) reminds me that at this particular time the very best blood horses can be obtained at a low price in the Old Country; and the present is a unique opportunity for the Government, even beforethe railway is made, to establish horse-breeding centres, and thus render it possible,"" within a few years to provide thousands of animals not only for Australia, but for export.",49
308,Mr MCWILLIAMS,JOHN,"Franklin) [4.28]. - The subject raised by the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Sampson) is of great importance, and was one of those dealt with, to some extent, at the Preincurred miers' Conference in January. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton) has said that if he were in a State Parliament he would regard the States' Commonwealth offer as a liberal one; as a member of the position that heParliament, Federal Parliament, I may say that I resaying gard it as exceedingly generous. vision for our returned soldiers is a Commonwealth responsibility. Whether we ' have to provide a man with an artificial limb, give him money to enable him to go difficulties, into business in the city, or settle him the land, the responsibility is national. The States, recognising that they are owners of the land, offere'd to conduct this land settlement, and, if the Commonwealth will lend the necessary money, to make work in the States. themselves responsible for whatever rate.of interest, was charged, advancing the money to the settlers at the same tically rate-in short, the States offered to take the whole responsibility of the land settlement off the shoulders of the Commonwealth. The honorforms able member for Illawarra (Mr Lamond), and, to some extent, the honourable memasked ber for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) conoccupations tend that, while the States borrow this money, pay interest, and make themselves entirely responsible, the Commonwealth ought to have the whole say as to how is to be expended.. In my opinion, this is a matter in which the Federal Governthat ment and the State Governments can go hand in hand, as, indeed, they must if this project is to be a success; that is the labourers, only spirit in"" which the business can be If a man or approached if the result is to be as we wish. The States not only own the land, but practically every instrument for dealshown ing with land; they haye their Survey partments, Agricultural Departments, perts, and so forth; and,at the Premiers' Conference the representatives of every Government in Australia practically placed the whole of this machinery at the disposal of the Commonwealth in order to make provisionfor our returned soldiers. At that' Conference the Prime Minister agreed to provide £2,000,000 for land settlement in the various States, half of the amount to be made available up to June, 1917. Therefore, I gather that £1,000,000 has already been drawn by the States.",51
309,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"So far the States have not drawn more than £20,000, but by granting' applications for assistance .they have liabilities which exceed that sum.",51
310,Mr MCWILLIAMS,JOHN,"I have no objection' to the promise that the Prime Minister made. 'Pending the' meeting of the it was the only could take up, that is, into the States that, so long as they Prowere prepared to set about the work of '. settling soldiers on the land, he would see that they did not suffer any financial loss. This matter is surrounded with very great and it will call for the closest on attention on the part of those best able to guide the Minister, namely, the Agriculthe tural Departments and Survey Departments of the various States, and the practical men who are placed in charge of the There is a general impression that pracall the men who are applying to be settled on the land are citizens of the towns, but such is not the case. About twelve months ago the War Council issued to every soldier at the Front and in the different camps, and the men were to fill in thdse forms stating the they followed before enlistment and the occupations they wished to follow on their return. As a member of - the War Council, I had an opportunity of it , going through some of the forma which 1 were filled in in this way, and I found in the great majority of cases the men who expressed a desire to go on the land were those who, prior to enlistment, were sons of farmers, agricultural casual employees on farms. who was in an office prior to enlistment expresses a desire to follow an agricultural life, for which he has not any fitness, the greatest care will Dehave to be exercised before he is allowed exto take financial assistance for the purpose of carrying out his wishes, because if lie is allowed to squander the money he may not remain three months on the land. Much can be done in the direction of closer settlement, and where a large estate is purchased it will be a good thing to establish a community settlement, in which the men can assist one another in the initial stages of the development cf their farms. In this connection I am speaking only of men who are returning to the land and have a practical knowledge of farming. The suggestion for establishing community settlements is well worth consideration on the part of those who will be responsible for carrying out this scheme of repatriation. I would not make it compulsory for men to be settled in this way, but at the same time a great deal can be done in this direction. I ask those who are anxious that the Commonwealth shall have almost the whole control of the expenditure of this money to remember that they cannot expect the State Governments to pay in terest on .the money advanced by the Commonwealth, and lend it on exactly the same terms to the soldiers, without having full and predominating control of the expenditure of the money. The probability of there being any division between Commonwealth and State control is a bogy that should not have been raised. From what we know of what has been done in the different States already, and from the unanimity of the proceedings at the various conferences between the Commonwealth and the State Premiers we know that we shall have the most hearty cooperation from the States, and that the States will receive the most complete cooperation from us. Therefore, it would be very inadvisable to insert an amendment which would practically take from the States the whole of the control of' the money for which they are asked to accept full and complete responsibility. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 6 agreed to. Clause 7 (Appointment of Commisable sioners).

311,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,"Wannon) [4.37] - I move as an amendment- That sub-clause 2 be left out, and the following inserted in lieu:"" The Governor General shall appoint six other persons to be Commissioners, such persons to be first approved by the Commonwealth Parliament, and on the happening of any vacancy in the office of Commissioner, the Governor General shall appoint a person approved by the Commonwealth Parliament to the vacant office."" My object in moving this amendment is to keep repatriation a live question before this Parliament, and not let the entire responsibility in connection with the matter pass to a Commission outside this Parliament, which, although it may be presided over by a Minister, may not respond to the will of that Minister. I do not think that the question of the appointment of Commissioners should be made a party matter. It is quite possible that appointments which may be made by the party in power for the time being may have a party complexion, but if there is one subject upon /which all parties in Australia should agree, and upon the arrangement of which all parties should be represented, it is this question of repatriation. We have "" downed tools"" upon it . Our soldiers have been drawn from every shade of political thought, and it is only right and fitting that the matter of the creation of a Board of Commissioners to control their future destinies, and help them to enter a new sphere of life, should come under the notice of this Parliament. I do not say that we should make the actual selection of Commissioners, but we should certainly approve of the appointments before they are confirmed.",52
312,Sir ROBERT BEST,JOHN,It will be the same thing.,52
313,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,"No . If it were a matter of selecting Commissioners, suitable persons would have to submit their chances for public discussion in Parliament, and there might be competition for selection.",52
314,Mr TUDOR,JOHN,I can assure the honormember that the matter would be fixed up at the party meetings.,52
315,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,"So far the Minister soon as has shown commendable wisdom and perjudgment .in keeping his own counsel, and the members of our party have in no way to sought information from him or attempted to embarrass him in this matter. Perhaps one reason for that attitude on our part may lie in the fact that the Minister has announced that it is in tended that the positions shall be honorary.",52
316,Mr MCWILLIAMS,JOHN,E x c e p t his own.,53
317,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,The salary to be paid to the Minister will be a mere bagaproposes telle compared with the gigantic underliament taking confronting him.,53
318,Mr TUDOR,JOHN,Does not the honourable .he member think that we should have some statement in regard to whether these positions are to be honorary?,53
319,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,"I agree that no gentleman should be expected the disposal of this country for a number of years the abilities which will be quired from a Commissioner without having some return from the State. I do important not suggest that the Commissioners shall draw salaries, but I propose that they shall occupy the position that directors of a huge business concern occupy, and draw daily allowances for the sittings when they may be engaged in carrying out the duties with which they are to intrusted.",53
320,Mr MCWILLIAMS,JOHN,In those circumstances they would sit every day regularly.,53
321,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,"When repatriation comes to be a reality, it will be found that the bodies which are really doing the work are the State Boards and Local f r Committees. I hold that the members fo of the State Boards should also be treated as boards of directors of huge concerns, and be paid allowances. From the fact that the Minister suggests a body of six Commissioners I take it that he proposes to follow the practice of selecting one man from each State, but I do not know' that it is a good course to follow. GeoBoard graphical lines should not be consulted choosing the best men for this work.",53
322,Mr SAMPSON,JOHN,Excep t that men from different States will understand local ditions better.,53
323,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,What Queenslander lapse - understands the local conditions of every part of his State?,53
324,Mr MCWILLIAMS,JOHN,He would know the conditions in that State better than would a man from one of the southern States.,53
325,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,"In the one State are to be found mining, pastoral, agricultural, and manufacturing industries. We are all subject to the influence of local environbut, ment, and no man can claim to understand the local conditions in the whole of his State when he has lived .all his life in one particular district. My chief reason for moving the amendment is that I think Parliament should have more control over repatriation than this measure to give. The confidence of Pari n the administration of this Bill lies entirely in the knowledge that Senator Millen will be in charge of it , and that possesses the ability to create an organization which may carry the scheme to a successful issue.",53
326,Mr LAMOTTD,JOHN,It is a pity that he is to place at not in this Chamber.,53
327,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,"It would be conrevenient if an arrangement could be made by which, when we are dealing with an Bill , the Minister who will administer it could accompany the measure from Chamber to Chamber. I shall' make this amendment a test question, as to whether Parliament desires to retain any control over the Commission. The be debate on the second reading showed that the Ministei* will have very little say in regard to land settlement, which has been made a responsibility of the States. In connection with repatriation, we may also have to deal with education and health, both of which are under the control of the States. If those activities, also, are taken o m the Commonwealth, what will be lef t r this Parliament to control ? It may be said that we shall have the right to refuse appropriations, but what Parliament wil l take the responsibility of refusing a grant for repatriation when the expenditure is practically a commitment before an appropriation is asked for? Under the existing Act there was appointed a very able of trustees, including the proposed in Minister for Repatriation, and the fact that this Parliament had no direct control over that body, other than through conits representatives on the Board, is probably the reason why it was allowed to",53
328,Sir ROBERT BEST,JOHN,That Board was constituted on altogether wrong lines.,53
329,Mr EODGERS,JOHN,"It s members in cluded four Ministers of the present Goveniment, four ex-Ministers, two other members of this House, five financial and commercial experts, and one industrialist, notwithstanding the ability of those men, the Board did not fulfil its functions. What guarantee is there that any better result will be achieved by the new Commission, which will not be responsible to this Parliament or under our supervision in any way ? So far as I can see, there is not in the Bill even provision honourable for a yearly or half-yearly report to Parliament. Except the central figure of the Minister, there is nothing in the proposed constitution of the Commission to assure to it Vital force and activity. I believe' Senator Mille n is more qualified than any other man in Australia to carry out a repatriation scheme, and this Parliament looks to him to vitalize the project that is before us. I would prefer to see the Commission dispensed with altogether, and the Minister made absolutely supreme and responsible to Parliament. He could administer the Act with one Federal Commissioner, and in each State .a Deputy Commissioner.",53
330,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"Darling Downs-Hon orary Minister) [4.53] - It is impossible to accept the amendment. The principle which the honourable member has raised is whether the Executive or Parliament shall make appointments to the Central Commission. The honourable member stated that he saw no difference between this scheme and the previous one. If that is so, he has missed the whole spirit of the Bill . The previous Act was not intended to place on a special Minister responsibilit y for the administration of a scheme of repatriation, with a Department under his control, and himself directly responsible to Parliament, like the Minister for Defence or any other Minister of State. The original scheme was based on the idea that we should have a body of trustees who would collect a great deal of money from the public, and that such collections should be subsidized by the Commonwealth. From the money thus raised the trustees were to make grants for repatriation purposes.",54
331,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,The Prime Minister presided over the Board of Trustees.,54
332,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"The mere fact that the Prime Minister was a member of the Board does not alter its essential character. This Bill embodies quite a different principle. Repatriation has developed to such a vast extent that it has become a national responsibility, which can only be discharged by having in charge of it a Minister directly answerable to Parliament and operating a scheme on certain defined lines. The honourable member for Wannon said he would prefer the control to be in the hands of a Minister without the aid of any Commission - Again the member misconceives the scheme. Whilst laying down the principle that there should be a responsible Minister for repatriation, with a department under his control, in order to secure uniformity, continuity, and regularity in expenditure, the B i ll endeavours to get outside the ordinary routine red-tape methods of a department, and invites the voluntary cooperation of all sections in the community.",54
333,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,Coul d not the Minister do that without having a Board beside him?,54
334,Mr GROOM,JOHN,"The voluntary co-operation of the community is vital to the scheme, and we are* inviting the services of honorary Commissioners, such as the gentlemen who throughout Australia did splendid, work under the existing Act. The supply of honorary assistance is nOt yet exhausted. From the assurances which have reached the Minister we know that men representative of the highest capacity are still willing to assist in the work of repatriation. In connection with the State Boards and the Local Committees also, the Bill seeks to make use of voluntary cooperative effort. Every honourable member knows how well the State War Councils have operated. The Central Commission will frame uniform regulations for the whole of Australia. Under those regulations the State Boards' will make grants to soldier applicants, and the personal sympathetic touch which will be essential to the success of the scheme will be supplied by the Local Committees. In order to get the best men available for the work, the proper authority to make the appointments to the > Commission is the Federal Executive, which will be responsible to Parliament. If the men appointed are not acceptable to Parliament the Government can be held accountable. It would not be fair to the men who have already rendered gdod service to institute a sort of competition in Parliament for the right to serve on the proposed Commission. It will be the duty of the Government, in selecting the members of the Commission, to have regard only to their fitness for the work. I think honourable members will find that this scheme will work out very well. Amendment negatived.",54

358,Mr KELLY,JOHN,"Wentworth) [5.20] - It seems to me that the Government might very easily concede in a practical way the wishes of the Returned Soldiers and Sailors Associations. It is difficult for the associations to definitely nomi- \ nate to a body of this kind, because they might nominate persons possessing qualifications similar to those of other members, with the result that there would be overlapping. I fail to see, however, why the Government should not accept from the associations a number of nominations, and from that number select the two to be appointed.",56

That would give the Government a wide choice. I do not think it necessary to move an amendment to carry out my suggestion. I am not here with any new-born zeal to denounce the Government. I am anxious to assist them, and I shall be perfectly satisfied if the Minister in charge of the Bill will say that, generally speaking, the Government will act upon the lines I have indicated.

For one thing, we are anxious to create the Commission straight away. Are we merely to take a vote of the handful of returned soldiers who are at present in Australia?",59
413,Mr MATHEWS,JOHN,They are representative of the men who are at the Front.,59
414,Mr FOWLER,JOHN,"Would it be fair to those who are returning at a later date that only a small section who are here at the present time, and many of whom have returned from less arduous conditions than those which are now being faced at the Front, should have the privilege of electing the men who are to represent all the soldiers who ultimately will come back to this country? carry out the vote on anything like a democratic principle. Honourable members who have spoken in support of this proposition probably mean that the representatives of the soldiers shall be voted for in Sydney and.Melbourne. How can we get a representative vote of all the States in that way. Is the matter to be determined practically by the members of the larger associations?",59
415,Mr JH CATTS,JOHN,Is there no association of returned soldiers in Western Australia?,59
416,Mr FOWLER,JOHN,"There are several such associations in that State, and it is on their behalf that; I suggest that the Government should bind themselves either in the Bill , a method which I prefer, or by a promise, which will be equally satisfactory, to appoint only returned soldiers who are nominees of organizations of returned soldiers. Such a procedure would shut out the possibility of men being appointed who might not be representative in many respects of the majorit y of the soldiers.",59
417,Mr BRUCE SMITH,JOHN,The very same objection applies to that proposition as to the other. How would the honourable member propose to get the nominees of the men who are now at the Front?,59
418,Mr FOWLER,JOHN,"I admit that my suggestion is also open to objection, but as we cannot overcome all the difficulties, [5.45] - my idea is to overcome as many as possible. It will be impossible to do more than get the nominees from the existing - associations of returned soldiers at the time when the machinery of the Bill is being brought into existence, and it is the very minimum that we should expect in regard to the representation of soldiers on the Commission. . Mr Fenton (Maribyrnong) [5.50]. - In his manifesto to the soldiers at the Front, the Prime Minister saidThe Government scheme will provide for the direct representation of the soldiers themselves. The least that this Parliament can do is to endeavour to honour the pledge given by the Prime Minister. He went on to say in his manifestoI t is significant that the Returned Soldiers' Association are supporting the National Government. He thus connected these associations We - cannot with direct representation on the Commission which was to be entrusted with the work of administering the repatriation scheme. In these circumstances we are in honour bound, as a Parliament, to carry out the pledge thus given. Mr. JOSEPH"" COOK - We say that the pledge is to be honoured.",59

A f t e r listening to the orable member for Melbourne (Dr mission, Maloney) one woul,d imagine that be that hind every clause in this Bill there a plot to deprive soldiers of some of their rights, or of something that is due them.

426,Mr HEITMANN,JOHN,"We would be following a great democratic principle in allowing them to elect their representatives on the Commission, but it would be a most difficult problem to get the majority of the men to estimate the value of the individuals for whom they are asked to vote for this particular purpose. man's qualifications to be a Commisshould not rest simply on the fact * If that he is a soldier.",60

429,Dr MALONEY,JOHN,I would seek assistance House. from the men who would be attending we the soldiers affected.,60
430,Mr HEITMANN,JOHN,"It will be almost impossible for the soldiers to express a judgment as to the special qualifications do that would f it men to be intrusted with work that will have to be undertaken in in connection with the repatriation of rea turned soldiers. I agree with the majority of honourable members that the solhondiers should be represented on the Combut I hold that it is essential the man who will have to undertake was the task of building up this scheme should have the privilege of selecting as to Commissioners those whom he considers There will always be opportunity afforded to the soldiers, the public generally, and memof this House to criticise the actions the of the Commissioners. I do not see that it will be possible to apply the principle electing representatives of the soldiers, the firstly, because so many soldiers are away at the Front, and so many of those who have already returned are scattered all over Australia, and, secondly, because few of the men will be in a position to estimate the value of those for whom they will be asked to vote for the special work to be undertaken. Mr JH CATTS"" (Cook) [5.58] - I strongly support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) on behalf of this side of the House. It provides that the representatives of returned soldiers, which the Government now agree should be placed on the Commission, shallbe chosen from recommendations made by the Returned Soldiers and Sailors Associations. The associations can meet together and decide upon those whom they will nominate, and it will be left to the Government to choose from the four, five, six, or a dozen names - submitted those whom they now agree should be placed on the Commission. It is said that there will not be time for these organizations to consult; but we are told that the Act is not to come into operation immediately, but upon a date to be proclaimed; that in the meantime it is necessary for the Minister to make his machinery arrangements, and that will take some time. In the interregnum there will be an opportunity for a consultation of the Returned Soldiers and Sailors' Association. Then, it is urged that as a large number of soldiers are still at the Front, it would not be fair to nominate representatives of the soldiers until all have returned. That is not a valid objection. The men nominated on the Commission will not keep their seats for life. They will be there for a period to be determined by the Government, and the Government could arrange that the first nominees shall hold office for twelve months or two or three years. At the end of that term, when the bulk of the soldiers have returned, the representation on the Commission could be subject to revision, and, if the larger body of returned soldiers and sailors thought an alteration necessary, they could choose other representatives.. It is argued that the election of representatives by the organization would give no voice in the selection to the soldiers who are scattered throughout the country. That ' difficulty is to be met with every day in other spheres. ' In the selection of candidates by the Liberal or Labour . leagues, all Liberals or Labourites do not have a say. But those who are organized have an opportunity of making a selection. The same principle can be operated in connection with the representation of the veturaed soldiers. It is the only practicable method available of obtaining direct and responsible representation. The honorMr J. E. Catts. able member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Heitmann) contended that in selecting a body to deal with tuberculosis we should have to appoint experts. It is ridiculous to attempt to draw an analogy between such appointments and those we are now, considering. The Repatriation Commission will be dealing with the ordinary affairs of every-day life. No doubt, amongst its members will be men who are experienced in regard to mortgages and securities and other special matters, but we shall also require on that bodv ordinary practical men. A promise was made by the Government to the soldiers in the trenches that they would have direct representation, on the Repatriation Commission, and those words were used in conjunction with a reference to the Returned Soldiers and Sailors' Association, which was said, although, I believe, wrongfully, to be supporting the Government. That promise surely implied that the members of the Association would be able to select their own representatives. At any rate, members on this 'side of the House propose to take the amendment to a division. If it is defeated, I shall support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Franklin.",60
431,Mr CONSIDINE,JOHN,That amendment does not involve the same principle.,61
432,Mr JH CATTS,JOHN,"It does not, but I would rather that there were two soldiers on the Commission without consulting their Association than that there should be none. It is not desirable that this power of patronage, should be placed in the hands - of the . Government. If the two men to be appointed are simply to be favorites of the Minister",61
433,Mr JOSEPH COOK,JOHN,Are all Government appointees favorites?,61
434,Mr JH CATTS,JOHN,Most of the men appointed by the present Government have been favorites.,61
435,Mr JOSEPH COOK,JOHN,There is not an atom of truth in that statement; but that is a mere circumstance to the honourable member.,61
436,Mr JH CATTS,JOHN,The present Government have made a large number of appointments. Will the Minister for the Navy inform the Committee of any appointment made from amongst others than supporters of his own 'party? He is silent. He cannot refute what I say by giving a concrete case. I have no doubt that the appointments to the Commission will be made in the same way. The selection of some returned soldier who is barracking for the Government will noti be giving the soldiers fair representationr This power ought to be taken out of the hands of the Government so that the nominees to the Commission will not be mere pawns in the game of electioneering.,61
437,Mr LISTER,JOHN,"Corio) [ 6 . 9 ] - I regret that the discussion has degenerated from the high plane on which the second-reading debate was conducted. It is unfortunate that honourable members become heated in their desire to see justice done to the returned soldier. I think that greater justice would be done if honourable members would consider the question dispassionately - If there are any men who are specially entitled to representation on the Commission they are those who have made it necessary for a repatriation scheme to be evolved. Whilst I supported the amendment moved by the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine), I do nob see altogether eye to eye with honourable members opposite in regard to the amendment now before the Committee. Probably the bulk of returned soldiers in Australia today are outside the associations. Mr J . Bf. CATTS - Why did the honourable member vote for the amendment of the honourable member for Barrier ?",62
438,Mr LISTER,JOHN,"I voted for the posal to give the returned soldiers three representatives on the Commission. Whilst I agree that the returned soldiers should have the right to submit nominations for the consideration of the Government, must not overlook the fact that the great number of the men are outside the asi sociations, and will not be represented in any way. under the system which honourable member for MaribyrnOng has proposed.",62

442,Mr FINLAYSON,JOHN,Brisbane) [6.15] In view of the clear and definite promise made by the Prime Minister I cannot understand why the Government should hesitate to accept the suggestion that provision for the representation of returned soldiers on the Commission shall be in serted in the Bill .,62
443,Mr JOSEPH COOK,JOHN,The promise of the Prime Minister will be honored in full .,62
444,Mr GROOM,JOHN,I agreed to accept an amendment that two members of the Commission shall be returned soldiers.,62
445,Mr FINLAYSON,JOHN,"I am glad to hear that - There are at least tiwo associations of returned soldiers, and, as the honourable member for Corio has pointed out, all returned soldiers are not included in them. But we should encourage every soldier to be a member of a legitimate returned soldiers' association. In the Returned Soldiers and Sailors Imperial League of Australia you have an organization whose constitution is broad enough, and whose objects are sound enough, to attiract every returned soldier.",62
446,Mr LISTEB,JOHN,"Unfortunately , it does not.",62
447,Mr FINLAYSON,JOHN,"The prestige which the Bill would give to it would, I think, be reflected in a greatly increased promembership. I am, unfortunately, acquainted with the Returned Soldiers and Patriots League in Brisbane, which it would be wrong to recognise in any way under the Bill , it being an organization we formed by disgruntled men who, not getting their way in the other League, left t to establish a rival organization, tihe greater part of the members being civithe lians, coming under the denomination of "" patriots."" This association is a well known and declared active political organization, and the fact, that it is political should debar it from representation and on the Commission. I am as desirous as is any honourable member to keep the Commission free from political influence, and I do not think that any member wishes to in use returned soldiers for party purposes. The suggestion that I offer is that the president and secretary, for the time being, of the Returned Soldiers and Sailors I m a perial League of Australia should be, by virtue of their office, members of the Commission - My reason for that suggestion is that the League holds annual conferences, at which its officers are elected, and that it would be a most salutary recognition of the League by Parliament, and would add to the dignity of the offices I have named, if the holders of them for the time being were accepted as representing and speaking for the returned soldiers of Australia. Such appointments would save trouble to members of Parliament, and would avert the suspicion that the Ministry of the day was making a party selection, while the returned soldiers would have their say in the administration of the scheme.",62
448,Mr LISTEB,JOHN,"Does the honourable member think that the officers whom he has named could find time for the work of the Commission, in addition to that of a growing organization?",63
449,Mr FINLAYSON,JOHN,"I think so. The Minister (Senator Milieu), in introducing the Bill in another place, said that the members of the Commission would not need to sit continuously; that the : meetings of the Commission would be at long intervals. Therefore the work of a Commissioner would not be a serious tax on any man's time.",63
450,Mr WATT,JOHN,That would be after the scheme had been fairly launched.,63
451,Mr FINLAYSON,JOHN,"Yes . But the. representatives of the returned soldiers are not likely to be able to afford to give their time without remuneration. They, at least, should be paid for their work as Commissioners.",63
452,Mr LAMOND,JOHN,"Illawarra) [6.21] . The assurance of the Government that representatives of the returned soldiers' associations will be acceptable, may be taken to indicate that the appointments will be such as will be approved by the organized bodies of returned soldiers. But there are difficulties in this connection of which any one who knows anything of the organization of the returned soldiers' associations must be aware. What has happened in connection with the returned soldiers' association in Sydney does not encourage one to think that the interests of the soldiers should be left to the hazards of any of the proposals which have been put forward. We must remember ' that most of the soldiers who have returned to Australia are sick men, who do not wish to be worried with the affairs of organizations, and most of whom take no interest in, and refrain from attending, the meetings of such bodies. In Sydney there was a heated contest for the office of president of the association, and shortly after the election was made the association, for obvious reasons, changed its .opinion regarding the propriety of its choice, and an eminent cleric took charge with a view to smoothing out matters. Within a few months things were in a very bad way, and criminal proceedings were taken against one of the officers who had been elected. When I interjected to the honourable member for Cook (Mr. J. H . Catts) that wo know something of the way in which selections are brought about, I spoke from ripe experience. I know how persons in ill-health have been persuaded to vote this way or that by others wishing to gain advantages at their expense.",63
453,Mr JOSEPH COOK,JOHN,The honourable member has had a long experience in these matters.,63
454,Mr LAMOND,JOHN,"Yes . I have seen tickets hawked round for sale at election time at ls. a head, and have known this to be done on both sides. Every member of Parliament knows of it, though some pretend to ignorance. The responsibility for securing the effective administration of the scheme should rest on the Ministry. Every attempt to take away that responsibility from Ministers weakens the ability of Parliament to criti1 cise the work of the Commission. Were the Commissioners selected by outside organizations, the Minister of the day could always shield himself from parliamentary criticism behind that fact. The promise made by the Ministry must, of course, be kept, but that promise is a promise to the men at the Front. To allow the representatives of the soldiers to be chosen by the men now here would not give fair representation to the great body interested in this scheme. The majority of those whom the scheme will affect are not now in Australia, and will not return for a year, and, perhaps, not for two years. The concerns of injured and disabled soldiers may safely be left in the hands of any Committee that may be appointed; but the fit' men still at the Front have also to be considered, and it would c be exceedingly unwise to allow a permanent representative of tihe soldiers to be chosen before the great body of the men had returned, so that there might be an opportunity to select the ablest administrators among them. If there are able administrators among those who have already returned, they are either too ill to perform the work to be done, or are already employed in necessary work in connection with the war. In the in terests of our soldiers at large, most of whom are still at the Front, the Ministry is bound to see that no permanent appointment is made to represent them u n t i l the bulk of them have returned. Then every man who has done his bit will have an opportunity to secure the representation of his views.",63

456,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,"Wannon) [8.0] - Be fore we adjourned for dinner we were ""discussing tihe question of the representation of returned, soldiers on the Commission, and the argument had been advanced that direct representation had been promised. The adjournment, I think, was not altogether an unmixed evil, because we were developing some feeling and a party attitude in respect of the question which we should be slow to encourage - The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor), in his opening speech on this measure, set us an excellent example, which I hope we shall follow throughout. I have availed myself of an opportunity . to examine tihe promise made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), and published in the ANZAC Bulletin of 4th A p r i l last, and find that, dealing with the policy of the National Government, he wroteI t has agreed with the States upon a scheme of land settlement, and is now dealing with the various other phases of the question. We are doing this on a basis at once comprehensive and pquitable. We propose to raise £2,200,000That is a misprint. The amount should be £22,000,000for the purpose of settling soldiers on the land, and to raise an additional £10,000,000 by a special tax upon incomes for other forms of repatriation. The welfare of the soldier, who has done so much for his country, is being - effectively cared for. The Government scheme will provide for the direct representation of the soldiers themselves. W it h that promise the House and the - country are concerned; but iti should not be made a question of party interpretation. The Deputy Leader of the Government has reaffirmed it by saying that, our soldiers will have direct representation upon this scheme. That statement should be accepted. The mode of. determining how that representation shall be secured is quite another matter. It will be for the Minister in charge of the scheme to confer, if he so desires, with the returned soldiers, either through their organizations or in some other way, to try to ascertain what form of representation would be most acceptable to them.",64

458,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,The Minister cannot confer with those who have not yet returned from the Front. What we are concerned with is the fulfilment of this promise by the Prime Minister. It i is for * the Government to try to fulfil it in a way that will guarantee satisfaction.,64

462,Mr BRUCE SMITH,JOHN,"How would the honourable member interpret the word ""direct""!",64
463,Mr RODGERS,JOHN,"The honourable member asks me to interpret a promise that I did nob make. I am anxious to see this promise fulfilled, and the responsibility for its fulfilment will rest upon the Government - It is one of many promises that have been made to our men, and it is up to the Governmenti and the House to see that it is carried put. I am satisfied that the Government will give effect to iti; when I feel that they are not prepared to do so they will have no support from me. An y attempt,, however, to give a party interpretation to the Prime Minister's"" pledge is quite wrong. In granting to the returned soldiers . direct representation on both the Commission and the State Boards, regard must be had to the fact that the soldiers so appointed cannot afford to give their services gratuitously for a term of years. They might have to come from other States, and remain for some time at the Seat of Government, to assist the .Ministry in carrying out this scheme. It is unthinkable, therefore, that they should be asked to give their services continuously or periodically without any reward. Unless provision is made for their remuneration the representation will he drawn only from a class of men already well cared for. Whether the Government give direct remuneration to the representatives of the soldiers or allow them, by way of fees, so much per sitting, I do not care; but if we are going to secure on the Board representation that will fairly reflect the great mass of the men who have fought for their country, we must provide for their remuneration.

468,Mr FENTON,JOHN,What was the position as the Bill left this Chamber?,66
469,Sir JOHN FORREST,JOHN,"The position was that a man permanently incapacitated for work was exempt from the tax without any' qualification. If the Senate's request be agreed to, such a person will not be exempt if he has an income of more than £150 a year. That seems reasonable. I move That requested amendment No. 1 be made.",66

475,Mr BOYD,JOHN,"Henty) [8.30] - I move That'the word "" sixty "" be omitted from the requested amendment, and that the words "" twenty-one "" be inserted in place thereof. The object is to exempt everybody over the age of twenty-one who is not in receipt of an income of over £ 1 0 0 . Since l l was sent to another place I have received a communication from a constituent to the effect that he is fifty-nine years of age, in ill-health, and unable tb I add to an income he has of 15s. per week, which is merely sumcient to enable him to eke out an existence. This income of 15s. amounts to £ 6 10s. per annum more than he would receive if he were getting an invalid or old-age pension; and yet, he is called upon to pay £ l poll tax. and £ 5 under the Bill . This means'that out of £ 6 10s., which represents the d if (ference between his present income and an old-age pension, he has to pay £6, leaving him an advantage of only 10s. What will probably happen in such a case is that the man' will not continue as present, but will apply for an old-age pension, so that the State, instead of re34 ceiving £ 6 , will find itself to the bad to the extent of £ 3 2 10s. per annum.",66
476,Mr WEBSTER,JOHN,That is an isolated 23 case.,66
477,Mr BOYD,JOHN,I venture to say that hundreds of such cases could be found.,67
478,Mr KELLY,JOHN,A man of fifty-nine years of age cannot draw an old-age pension.,67
479,Mr BOYD,JOHN,"He may draw an invalid pension. The fact that this man is in ill-health, and has an income of only 15s., shows that he is unfit to earn an ordinary wage.",67
480,Sir JOHN FORREST,JOHN,He must be manently incapacitated in order to get an invalid pension.,67
481,Mr BOYD,JOHN,"It seems to me that Bill levies a tax which the Government will be unable to collect, particularly in the say ? case of nomads who wander from place to place; and if machinery has to be estabtake lished to effectively collect the tax, it cost more than the revenue received. The Government might well accept an exemption of £ 1 0 0 ; and the only way that I can see to accomplish this is by amendment such as I have proposed.",67
482,Mr KELLY,JOHN,"Wentworth) [8.35] If the amendment be carried the prorate. cedure adopted as between the two Houses will lead to a most extraordinary - bull in the Bill as presented to the lic.

I think that the honourable member cannot have full y sidered the effect of his proposal before he submitted it . The request ate seems to have a very good object in view, in that it proposes that an tion shall be made in the case of any one in receipt of an old-aere or invalid pension Senate ? who is over the age of sixty years. There are many people over that age who have been unsuccessful in life, and who are capable of paying any tax at all, and am sure that no one desires to tax those therefore, in that position.

504,Mr WATT,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Balaclava-Minister for Works and Railways) [ 8 . 5 6 ] - I move That in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Aet 1013-14 the following works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for their report thereon, namely:-Flinder s Naval BaseErection of workshops, hospital, detention barracks, quarters for married officers and warrant officers, water, sewerage and stormwater reticulations, electric distribution system, and accessory works for that establishment. Henderson Naval Base-Tw o breakwaters, excavations, reclamations, basins or quaywalls, floating dock, administrative buildings, permanent railways. I propose, with the consent of the House, to regard the submission of this motion as a formal matter, and only to give the bare essential facts with in the knowledge of the Department which the Ac t prescribes shall be given. The works proposed to be referred to the Committee are situated at Flinders Naval Base, Westernport, Victoria, and Henderson Naval Base, Cockburn Sound, Western Australia. Some of the works at the Flinders 'Naval Base were referred by the previous Parliament to the old Committee, but at the dissolution of that Parliament the inquiry had not been completed. It is proposed, now that a new Committee has been constituted, to refer to it the works not then reported on, with some additional ones at that Naval Base. The works proposed for the Henderson Naval Base stand in a different category. They were not referred to the old Committee. In both cases a section of the works it is contemplated effecting will not, for obvious reasons, be referred to the Committee. These are Naval Base are very much larger. works which national interest and safety, particularly at Naval Bases, dictate should not be so referred. As regards the Flinders Naval Base, the works to be referred are workshops, primarily. These consist of two large wings to the power-house building, - to be used respectively for a machine and fitting shop and a boiler shop. The late ComBILL. mittee partly reported on 'these workshops to the last Parliament. The total estimated expenditure is £26,350.",69
505,Mr KELLY,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,A r e these works on 'the Estimates of this year ?,69
506,Mr WATT,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"L u m p sums are on the Estimates. These also include a hospital, consisting of a surgery depot, two ward buildings, and the operaiting building, with necessary kitchens - The construction will be partly brick and partly wood. Accommodation will be provided for thirty-seven patients, and the estimated cost is £8,842 .",69
507,Mr BOYD,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Why should an item of £8,842 be referred to the Committee? It is only works estimated to cost £25,000 and over which can be referred to it .",69
508,Mr WATT,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Thes e items are embraced in a lump sum on the Estimates, and we are following the usual course in regarding them as part of one work.",69
509,Mr KELLY,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"If you lump a sufficient number you can find useful work for the Committee to do, of course. Mr Watt , - If my honourable friend were ,a member of the Committee doubtless he would advocate that course, but I can assure him that we are not doing ib for that reason. It is being done simply because some of these matters have been - referred already to a Committee. This reference includes a detention barracks, in which my honourable friend will probably be interested, and which.' is estimated to cost £5,715 . As he has been so recently an expert on the taxation of bachelors he will be interested also in the quarters for married officers, which are estimated to cost £18,809. The water reticulation and fire service is estimated to cost £25,000, the sewerage reticulation £12,570, the storm water reticulation £7,300, the electric distribution system £16,200, and various accessory works which are now in course of preparation £46,172, making a grand total of £168,845. The figures, for the works at Henderson The first section of the works is a foreshore breakwater. Honourable members will be more interested in a report of the Committee on this important work than they will be in any of the few facts I give. The southern breakwater is to be constructed of stone quarried at the Base and from Wungong quarry.",69
510,Mr TUDOR,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Why are you "" stonewalling "" ?",70
511,Mr WATT,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Accordin g to the Public Works Committee Act, 1I have to give these facts to the House on this occasion. I will lay them on the table if honourable members prefer me to take that course.. I should prefer it, personally, if I have their consent.",70
512,Mr TTJDOB,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Put them in Hansard.,70
513,Mr WATT,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I will put the facts in Hansard, sir, with your consenti, and submit the motion.",70
514,Mr BOYD,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I object to that, sir - The Minister is doing the right thing in giving the information' tio the House. If he does not supply .the information we shall be asked to vote regarding a matter about which we will not know anything.",70
515,Mr SPEAKER,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT," Seeing that objection has been raised to the course that the Minister has suggested, it would be as well for him to give honourable members the full information now.",70
516,Mr WATT,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I put the suggestion forward because I knew that honourable members were anxious to get on with the important subject that has been under discussion during the last two days. In addition to the figures that I am now furnishing, honourable members will have the opportunity of inspecting 'the plans that I shall lay upon the table. The southern breakwater is estimated to cost £61,200. The northern breakwater is estimated to cost £316,000. The main basin is in the form of a rectangle 2,000 feet long by 1,500 feet wide, with a projecting reinforced concrete jetty and two openings in the north wall to form entrances to the floating dock berths. The walls will be built of concrete blocks, the stone for which will be obtained from the Wungong quarry. The estimated cost of the whole of this work is £1,840,365.",70
517,Mr BOYD,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Is it an open roadstead?,70
518,Mr WATT,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I thought that my honourable friend really knew the geography of Cockburn Sound. I am particularly anxious not to detain the House, and I thought that this information was generally known to honourable members who have .studied Admiral Henderson's report. This is not an open roadstead. The inner works to which I am now referring are known as the Henderson Base, and that is surrounded by reefs and is guarded by islands. Anchorages will be necessary in Cockburn Sound proper. In addition, channels willhave to be cut through the banks which lead from the islands to the mainland. In regard, to the excavation and reclamation, the latter will be equal to about 10,000,000 cubic yards, and as the greater part of the quantity will be obtained from the sand dunes or hills to the east of the Base, the necessary excavation will give, a good width of level land back from the existing foreshore to form the dockyard. The total cost of these earthworks is £578,343, according to the estimates of the officers of the Department. A provisional amount is set aside for permanent yard railways, namely, £20,250. The administrative block and other buildings are estimated to cost £53,250. Provisional amounts, totalling £120,000, have also been put down for the construction of workshops. Eor various other dockyard buildings, including training schools and various accessory buildings, the estimate is £360,750. Eor sewers ancl drains a sum of £10,000 has been - allocated. When the Base is completed there will be three floating docks of 6,000, 20,000, and 35,000 tons respectively, and arrangements have been made for inviting tenders'for the smallest of these three. The total estimated cost of the floating docks at the main Australian Base is £1,342,000.  ences to the Public Works Committee?",70
519,Mr WATT,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,The works at Henderson Base have not yet been sent to the Public Works Committee for consideration.,70
520,Mr JOHN THOMSON,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Has any money been spent there?,70
521,Mr WATT,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"A fair amount has been spent in connection with foreshore work, but the matter has not been under the control of the Department of Works and Railways, and I cannot tell the honourable member how much has been spent by the Naval Board. I think that honourable members should welcome a reference of this, the most important of all the public works of Australia from, the point of expenditure, to our own statutory Committee. Some matters are reserved from reference to that Committee, and in due course will be exempted by Order in Council. The most important of these reserved works are naval magazines, o i l fuel, storage tanks and depots, water storage and supply, a ll works and building's in connection with submarine bases, torpedo stores and workshops, naval barracks and training schools, naval stores buildings, dry dock pumping stations, electric generation stations, and the dredging of approaches to the Base. These are works that are regarded by the Government, after consultation with the expert in whose hands the planning of these important works has been placed, as proper for exemption from reference to the Public Works Committee at this stage. The Government are advised that no works connected with Naval Bases are treated by the British Admiralty as we propose to treat the works that I have outlined to-night; that is to say, none of them are subject to inquiry even by statutory - Parliamentary Committees. We are carving out our own track in that respect, as we have carved out one previously in regard to the Flinders Naval Base, but I think that we are well advised in adopting the suggestions of our Admiralt y experts to exempt those matters which we think should not be subject to public inquiry.",70
522,Mr KELLY,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,How much land has been resumed ?,71
523,Mr WATT,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I cannot tell the honourable member. There are various 'areas now in process of acquisition, and in all probability others will have to be acquired for railway works and quarries, from which the bulk of the stone for concrete will bave to be obtained.",71
524,Mr TUDOR,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,The Government have not acquired as much land as it was originally intended to acquire?,71
525,Mr WATT,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,I understand that the original ideas of the naval experts have been reduced somewhat.,71
526,Mr TUDOR,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Is it intended to acquire the Quarantine Station site at Woodman's Point?,71
527,Mr WATT,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"That site has already been acquired, but the buildings are still standing there, and the Customs authorities have decided to allow the station to remain where it is for the present, seeing that the land will not be i m mediately required for the purposes 6 of the Naval Base, and that it would entail an expenditure of about £200,000 to remove the station to Garden Island, as has been suggested. I hope that honourable members w i ll treat this. matter as formal. It is in that spirit that I have introduced it . In accordance with the Public Works Committee Act I lay on the table the plans and specifications in connection with the works referred to in the motion.",71
528,Mr BRUCESMITH,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Parkes) [9.7]. - If this motion had been brought forward at another part of the session I should certainly have raised the question of the appropriateness or opportuneness of voting the whole of the money that will be required for the works referred to, at this time, and if the honourable members for Eden Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) and Newcastle (Mr Watkins) had been here to give expression to their opinions, which are the same as my own on this matter, I should have felt more disposed to do so. These works were reported on long before the wa'r began by the experts referred to by the Minister. It will be impossible for them to be of any use during this war, which has come upon-us; and no one is prepared to say what extraordinary changes will take place in the naval defence of the British Empire after the war. At this time, when we are taking on our shoulders stupendous undertakings of another kind, and when we should endeavour to save every penny and every pound, we are asked to proceed with works, which, according to the Minister's own statement, will cost over £1,000,000. My own impression-and I do not think I am in the clouds in saying it-is that when this war is over, and some great international compact has been entered into between the British Empire, the United States of America, Russia, Italy , and France, some great tribunal will be brought into existence which may alterthe whole of the system of defence of the British Empire, and absolutely change the system of defence of every individual country. I do not think that it is visionary to believe that it will come about. The international situation when the war is over will probably in volve a complete transformation of that which is now existing, and that change may render the whole of' any expenditure which may be incurred upon the works set out in the motion an absolute waste of money'. My belief is that the Navy by which the British Empire will then be defended will be one corporate body, managed, as Sir Joseph Ward once said, by "" one set of brains,"" and it may happen that in the international arrangements by which the individual rights of different nations will be secured, the works proposed to be undertaken here will become absolutely unnecessary. The honourable member for Hunter and the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr . Watkins) have frequently referred to Port Stephens, which is contiguous to the greatest coal supplies in Australia. That port has been absolutely left out of these calculations. Yet, as a site for a Naval Base, iti is not inferior to Cockburn Sound or Westernport, or 'any other port which is contiguous to a coal supply. We are, in short, asked to continue expenditure upon, two proposals which must be absolutely useless in this war, and which may be absolutely useless afterwards, and at a time when we should save every possible pound for the great obligations that will f all upon us in carrying out a scheme of repatriation which is estimated to cost at least £50,000,000. I am told by people who have lately come from the Old Country that the British Government and all the great corporations of Great Britain have absolutely closed down on half-completed works which have no bearing on this war.",71
529,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,That case.,72
530,Mr BRUCESMITH,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"My authority is Sir William MCMillan, who recently returned from Great Britain .",72
531,Mr WATT,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,The British Navy are asking for new schemes on the lines of these works.,72
532,Mr BRUCESMITH,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I am not talking about the Home naval works. Great Britain is still in the war, and is still adding to her docks, her warships, and her mercantile shipping; but here, on the outskirts of the world, we propose to build Naval Bases which probably ' will never be required for naval defence, and to embark on an expenditure of a million pounds, when Ministers in a corporate body tell us, again and again, that every sixpence musb be saved. The proposal is quite unjustifiable, and if this were the middle of the session I would raise Cain over the matter, #nd ask honourable members to help me in preventing this expenditure which, may well be left until after the war if we find then that the conditions are just the same as they are today.",72
533,Mr FINLAYSON,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Brisbane) [9.15] If the House were being asked to consider whether these works should be undertaken or not, or whether any money should be spent on them, I could understand the attitude of ' the honourable member, but he seems to have misconceived the purpose of the motion.",72
534,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I am aware that by agreeing to this motion we will not be voting any money, but I took advantage of the opportunity t'o express my opinions.",72
535,Mr FINLAYSON,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,That is a very strange confession to come from the honourable member.,72
536,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"The works were before the House when the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) and the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Chapman) spoke, and I knew it was no use then.",72
537,Mr FINLAYSON,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"I should think it would be much less use now. If there is any ground for supposing that any works proposed to be submitted to the Committee may be found unnecessary after the war, I can conceive of nothing that would help Parliament better to come to a decision than the report of a Committee appointed by the House. The instruction is not the to the Committee, and their duty to the House and the country, is to make in quiries into proposals, and advise Parliament whether the work should be done or not. While I sympathize with the view of the honourable member for Parkes (Mr . Bruce Smith) that we should not commit ourselves to any heavy naval or military expenditure u n t i l the war is over, in view of the revolutionary changes that will probably ensue, that is no reason why. we sbould refuse to make inquiries into this particular business, at any rate. Has the honourable member forgotten that the construction of the Cockburn Sound Base was a distinct recommendation by A d miral Henderson, an expert sent out to report by the British Admiralty?",72
538,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,L o n g before the war.,72
539,Mr FINLAYSON,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"What e v e r the war may change, it will not seriously change Australia's duty to defend its own shores. Our defence will be more and more upon the sea, and the Bases and Naval Depots round our coast will be the most effective defence we can have; but the question whether the whole of this work at Cockburn Sound should be pushed forward or not is a matter for the Committee to consider and advise the House on. Later, when the report is considered, or the Government bring forward a proposal to go on with the work, will be the time for us to make our complaint in the light of the teachings of history, and to-preach economy. I am somewhat opposed to the M i nister's idea that - certain works ' should be exempted from reference to the Committee. The fact that certain works can be so exempted is one of the deficiencies of the Act.

The object is to enable the appointment of a Minister for Repatriation. I full y explained the necessity for this appointment on the Repatriation Bill . We wish to enable the Minister to apply the whole of his time and energies to the purpose of repatriation. ° The Constitution originally provided for seven salaried Ministers of State. In 1915 the number was increased to eight by theappointment of a Minister for the Navy, and it is now proposed to appoint a ninth Minister. In many parts of the King's Dominions, owing to the burdens created by the war, it has been found necessary to increase the number of salaried Ministers. list of the last Imperial Ministry, appointed in December. 1916, shows that the Imperial Cabinet has grown considerably, and that salaries have been provided for the newly appointed Ministers.",74
552,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,A u d they took in men from outside Parliament.,74
553,Mr GROOM,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"That is so. Nevertheless they created additional salaried portfolios. On the 22nd December, 1916, the Imperial Parliament passed a general Act for the creation of certain new Ministers, and, of course, provision was made for the appointment of a parliamentary under-secretary for each Minister. > In this Parliaiment we have not yet attained to the dignity of having parliamentary under-secretaries. \ Under that Act the offices of Minister of Labour, Minister of Food, and Minister of Shipping i were constituted, and provision was made for the general' appointment of Ministers and under-secretaries. each Minister to receive a salary of £2,000. On the 22nd. December, 1916, the Imperial Parliament appointed a Minister of Munitions and a Minister of Pensions. Mr Barnes was appointed Minister of Pensions, and he took over the duties in connection with' pensions, and, in addition, the care and treatment ot disabled soldiers, which is regarded as the most important work of his Department. In Australia the pensions matters are dealt with by the Treasury, but the Minister for Repatriation will , in addition to having the care and treatment of disabled soldiers, have the entire responsibility of the bigger problem of repatriating the soldiers who return healthy - in body and mind. Honourable members w i ll see, therefore, that we have a good precedent for what we are doing. Even New Zealand, the population of which' is comparatively small, has increased the number of its Ministers. Up to 1915, New Zealand had eight salaried Ministers and two native Ministers. In 1915, the Dominion Parliament appointed two additional Ministers, at a salary of £1,000 each, to cope with work arising out of the war. The Prime Minister of the Do-, minion received a salary of £1,600, the Minister for Railways £1,300, and the six other Ministers each received £1,000. These, in 1915, were increased to eight. Therefore this Bill only proposes to in crease the Commonwealth Ministers by the same number as the Dominion of New The Zealand already has.",74
554,Mr CONSIDINE,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,How are the salaries of Ministers allocated at the present time ?,74
555,Mr GROOM,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"Minister s of State have allocated to them £1,650 each, and the Prime Minister draws a salary in excess of that - I forget the exact amount. The total amount of the Ministerial salaries is that mentioned in the Bill, and we are proposing tu increase it by £1,650. I ask honourable members to consider the enormous growth of Commonwealth administration since the out- ago. break of the war. I have here a rough summary of the increased activities which have devolved upon Ministers. Eor instance, there are all the problems connected-with shipping - the provision of freight for wheat, chartering, &c, the control of freight rates in Australian waters, the purchase and management of the Commonwealth Government line of steamers, the establishment of a Shipping Board to control all freight matters, and the management of ex-enemy and interned ships, which are now being used for commercial purposes in the interests of the Empire. A tremendous amount ot extra work arises out of the control of industries. There are the management and control of Australia's production of wheat, wool, sugar, metals, the supervision of ithe coal trade, and the regulation of prices. If honourable members would spare the time to visit the Defence Department occasionally, they would realise the wonderful expansion of the functions of that Department. There are not only the control and management of all the camps, and the enlistment and discharge of men, but there are the clothing and equipment of the soldiers and the management of the Clothing, Wool, Harness, and Cordite Factories, the establishment of an Acetate ot Lime Factory, and the control of the military hospitals. A visit to the Base Records Office alone would reveal what a tremendous amount of war work is being done. In the Attorney-General's Department the additional responsibilities include the watching of enemy activities, and the handling of enemy shares. Then there is the administration of enemy territory in Commonwealth military occupation. The work of the Treasury has been vastly increased by the administration of the war loans and waT pensions, in addition to carrying the financial responsibility of all the other Departments.",74
556,Mr BRENNAN,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"It is a pathetic to see the Treasurer (Sir John Forrest) that the present suing for an increase in "" screw."" MT. GROOM - I do not think the ing ' speech upon the proposal. honourable member is serious. Mr BRENNAN.=- I am serious. The ' Treasurer ought to be ashamed of himself, having regard to the measure that he forced on this House a little while",75
557,Mr GROOM,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"I am sorry that the honourable member has thought fit to make such a remark in connection with this Bill. The Treasurer has a record that will endure in Australia, and will be honoured. If at the end of his career the honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan) has an equally good record, he may be proud of himself. Another new activity is the control of the Science Bureau. I neednot go into all the details of the increased functions which devolve upon Commonwealth Ministers, but the matters I have mentioned indicate in general outline the vast amount of extra work that has devolved upon the Administration. If honourable members will compare the activities of and Australia with other parts of the Empire and will realise that a burden is being carried by practically the same number of men as - managed the affairs of the country .before the war, they will acknowledge that the Ministers have been trying loyally and faithfully to do their duty. A new sphere of duties covering a vast area is to be undertaken and a special Minister is necessary. TEe Bill proposes to create the office of a responsible Minister of State, to be vested with the duty of repatriation. We consider such an appointment absolutely necessary. There is not the slightest doubt that when the Minister is appointed, his Department will be one of the heaviest and most anxious in the Commonwealth. He will be dealing with hundreds of thousands of persons distributed throughout the Commonwealth, and the work will require his closest personal attention. I commend the resolution to the Committee.",75
558,Mr TUDOR,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"Yarra) [9.40] - This is not the first.motion of the kind which has been moved in this Parliament. At the commencement of Federation, when Sir Edmund Barton was Prime Minister, there were seven salaried Ministers. In 1915 Parliament created a Minister for picture the Navy, and I well remember Postmaster-General (Mr Webster) delivered an illuminatHe said that the new appointment was being made only for the sake of Ministers' pockets. Of course, the honourable member for Gwydir was not Postmaster-General salaried Minister. then. I realise as well as any other honourable member that the duties of Ministhe ters are heavier than they were before the war, particularly those of Ministers proposal ? who are directly affected by the war. Prior to 19 5, we had only Minister for naval and military deelection fence. There was practically little or no Navy Department before the war, the Minister for Defence merely has been altered or abolished. visiting the Navy Office as often was necessary. No doubt the present Minister for the Navy (Mr Joseph Cook) and his predecessor will assure us that the Department could not whether be administered in that way toor day. There is certainly enough work i the Navy Department to occupy the time of one Minister, particularly if there to be an expansion of the fleet and of other activities and establishments conconsideration nected with the Navy. I am not sure whether the interned enemy vessels are still under the control of the Navy Dethe Minister for Repatriation. partment, but they were at the comMinistry mencement of the war. This Bill proposes to create a Minister of Repatriation, and I do not know of any Minister who will have a harder or more dimcult job. or not the Ministry could evolve some scheme other than the appointment an additional salaried Minister I do not know; that is a matter for the Miniswhich try to determine. But I do know that to the present Government were returned power, not for the purpose of increasing expenditure. If there was one which the party I have the honour to lead Was denounced it was the increase of expenditure during the Labour rigime and I am confident that had the Labour party been successful in the last election, a number of honourable members who are sitting on the Government side to-night, suggests one or two reflections. The M in and who will be silent in regard to this Bill , would have been loud in their nunciation of any proposal for increasBritain ing Ministerial positions and salaries this time of war.",75
559,Mr BOYD,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,We did not make much jection to the increase proposed by Labour Government.,76
560,Mr GROOM,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,I think we supported appointment of the Minister for the Navy.,76

562,Mr BOYD,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"How can you say that if National party had been in opposition, we would have voted against the",76
563,Mr TUDOR,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"I am judging from the one speeches which were made during the in denunciation of the extravagance of the Labour party, and the duplication of Committees, not one of which Toas day we see not only an increase of Ministerial positions, but also an in crease of Commissions and Boards, and every honourable member knows well that we appoint an honorary committee a paid committee, the cost is much the n same. In fact, sometimes honorary committees cost more than those which are is paid. However, I shall deal with that phase of the question when we resume the of the Bill , which provides for the appointment of honorary committees to work under the, direction of If the say that the work has grown to such an extent that it is absolutely necessary to appoint another paid Minister, I merely wish - to point to ' the inconsistency on the part of certain honourable Whether members who, not only on the platform but in this House, denounced the Fisher of Government for having increased the Ministerial portfolios on the occasion to I have referred, because, in regard this Bill , they are not only accepting to the position as created by the Fisher Government, but are endorsing the policy thing for for a further increase.",76

Great Britain , therefore, furnishes no parallel. One could look to England before the war and find greater justification for even greater expenditure upon Ministerial salaries. I do not know whether all members are aware that the Speaker of the House of Commons, after one term of office, retires on a pension of £5,000 a year, and is translated, to the House of Lords; that the Lord Chancellor receives £10,000 a year, ancl that every senior Minister is paid at least £5,000 a year. Even Mr . John Burns, who came from the Labour ranks, after a little trepidation accepted his £4,000 or £5,000.",76
565,Mr HEITMANN,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"Why does the honourable member say "" even John Burns "" ?",77
566,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"Because we have heard so much talk about men from the Labour ranks not desiring to takefilthy lucre, and not wanting the baubles which other classes are supposed to be looking for. Referring to the' question under discussion, I think the Ministers are toO poorly paid. If Ministers were all living in one State and could reach their homes nightly, the position might be different; but it has become a tradition in the Federal Parliament that every State shall b'e represented in the Ministry, and so we find that certain members are perennially in the Government, simply because they happen to be the most suitable members from their part of the Commonwealth. As the result, of this practice certain Ministers find it necessary to leave their homes in distant States and establish duplicate homes in Melbourne, thus doubling their domestic expenditure without receiving any higher salary than is paid to Ministers in some of the States. A man like the Treasurer (Sir John Forrest) is by no means compensated with a Ministerial salary of £1,800 or even £2,000 a year.",77
567,Sir JOHN FORREST,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,It is not so much as that.,77
568,Mr BRUCESMITH,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"And I want, to remind the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), who made some sonal remarks concerning the Treasurer, that Sir John Forrest is entitled to an Imperial pension which, I think, is nearly as large as his Ministerial salary, but that the moment he touches his Ministerial pay he forfeits that pension.",77
569,Mr BRENNAN,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,A horrible sacrifice! ,77
570,Mr BRUCESMITH,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"We l l , it is a sacrifice which the honourable member would not make in similar circumstances; but, in the first place, the honourable member would not be likely to obtain an I m perial pension; and if he did, I am sure he would take good care to hold it .",77
571,Mr JH CATTS,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,I thought the Treasurer's Imperial pension was £ 1 0 0 a year.,77
572,Mr BRUC ESMITH,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"My impression is that it is nearly £1,000'a year.",77
573,Sir JOHN FORREST,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,No ; it is £ 6 0 0 .,77
574,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"At all events, it is only fair to the Treasurer that it should be known that what remains to him of his Ministerial pay after he has been deprived of the extra £200 a year which private members enjoy is most in adequate for the work he is called upon to ,do. It is common knowledge to many of us that, in the distribution of Ministerial pay, ' a great variety of allocations are made. The Minister who will be in charge of repatriation has, hitherto, been receiving only thab salary which is allocated to the holder of the position of Vice-President of the Executive Council.",77
575,Mr JH CATTS,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,How much is that?,77
576,Mr BRUCESMITH,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"I do nob want to go into details, but my impression is that the Vice-President of the Executive Council has hitherto received an allocation of about £750 a year. The Constitution provides for a certain amount of money to be disbursed amongst the Ministers. This amount has been increased for the Minister for the Navy, and is now being increased for the Minister for Repatriation; and. although the Honorary Minister in charge of this motion spoke of the multifarious duties which are now imposed upon Ministers, I want the Committee to remember that all the work necessitated by the policy adopted in regard to wheat, metal, sugar, and shipping, is carried out by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), who has thus taken a herculean task on his shoulders. '",77
577,Mr GROOM,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,He is assisted by Senator perRussell in some of that work.,77
578,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"Notwithstand ing all that has been said, I think tEis is an occasion upon which the Government might well have struck a note ""for the benefit of the general public, by declaring against any increase in Ministerial salaries. The Government have been preaching economy right and left, and, as we have been reminded ad nxmseam by members on the other side, the Government came in to carry out a policy of economy and to win the war. In view of this fact they might, very well, have declined to appropriate any more money for Ministerial pay for the extra work whioh has been thrown upon them. that, there can be no objection to the motion.",77
579,Mr COBSEB,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,That has not been in any other part of the world.,78
580,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"The Minister told us of the amounts paid to Ministers and under-secretaries in Great Britain , but I again point out that the Government approached the heads of great industrial organizations, involving millions of working capital, and asked them to leave their own businesses concentrate the whole of their Government activities. This has involved private undertakings in serious losses; but, in our own case, we are selecting extra Minister from within the Parliabe ment; and I repeat that it would have been more laudable for the Government to strike a note of economy in support of the policy which they have been advohear 1 eating.",78
581,Mr CONSIDINE,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"Barrier ) [9.56] I desire to say something in opposition to the proposal. As the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Bruce Smith) has pointed out, the Government might very well practised economy in this matter, especiare ally in view of the fact that they an entirely different note when it was question of imposing taxation upon earning less than £ 1 0 0 a year in order insure the success of the repatriation scheme. In the present instance they do not propose to give up anything. One would have thought that a Minister joying something like £ 32 per week would have been prepared to practise economy. During the course of the debat© we were informed that the Prime [ 1 0 . 2 ] Minister receives about £2,500 per - num. while the rest of the Ministers get about £1,650, and it is now proposed appropriate money"" to pay the salary another Minister to insure the success of the repatriation scheme. In my judgment, Ministers - might very well have reduced themselves to a "" starvation wage ' ' of £ 2 4 per week, or £1,200 a year, by dividing the present amounti provided for Ministerial salaries. If they had done that they would have pioneered the path in this war-time economy.' It appears, however, that, after all, the workers outside will always be called upon to do the sacrificing. Men with small incomes are to be taxed to the extent of £ 5 , or 5 Apar t from per cent, of their incomes, to find the money necessary for the repatriation scheme, while the man who is to control the Department is to be kept from want done on a salary of £1,650 per year.",78
582,Mr HEITMANN,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"He is worth it , too.",78
583,Mr CONSIDINE,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,But does noti the honourable member think that the man outImperial side is worth his wage?,78
584,Mr HEITMANN,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,Of course I d o ; but you want to deny it to the Minister.,78
585,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,The honourable and member for Kalgoorlie says you want to attention on reduce his wages.,78
586,Mr CONSIDINE,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"I do not wish to reduce wages. My desire is that some of an the wordy patriotism of this place shall translated into action. Ministers should give the people a lead by showing that, as practical patriots, they are will ing to sacrifice part of their salaries. We about making sacrifices for the men who have gone to the Front, but when it comes to a financial reduction, none of us likes to give up anything. So far as I have been able to discover, all Governments are alike in objecting to a reduchave tion of the> salaries of Ministers, which well above the bread line, though they struck are prepared to get at the chap outside. a I shall oppose the attempt to increase the men total appropriation for the salaries of to Ministers, but I shall support an increase in the number of Ministers, because I think that there is suflicient work for all that are proposed, although a re-allotment enof the total appropriation would provide adequately for the present Ministers and war-time the new Minister as well.",78
587,Mr LAIRD SMITH,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL," I shall support the proposal, and anshall give a few reasons for doing so. 1 Up to the present time our Ministers have to been much overworked, and have not been of able to give, that close attention to the affairs of the Departments which they administer that those affairs ought to receive. A Minister who. has the time to devote to the duties intrusted to him, and , does his work effectively, can save ten times his salary. While Assistant Minister for Defence, I learnt that my predeccsssor, having a great deal to do, had not been able to look into a particular matter. When I investigated this matter, I discovered that probably from the outbreak of war the operations of the Clothing Department were being conducted in such a way that the expenditure was much greater than was necessary. After a thorough investigation, I wrote this minuteI t would appear that a considerable saving in expenditure may be made in connection witn the production of certain articles of clothing in the factory by the adoption of an improved pattern, the more extensive use of the sewing machine, and the abolition of "" final pressing"" of some garments. "" I approve of the proposal being carried out immediately."" Estimated saving, £39,260 per annum. The saving, I believe, will be oyer £40,000 a . year. Had I had time to visit Sydney. I venture to say, from what I . was able to learn, that I could have saved another fair sum. In another instance I was able to save £1,400 a year. In making these statements I am not blaming Senator Gardiner, who, I believe, did his work conscientiously. He may not bave had time to look into the matters to which I have referred. I discovered that a final pressing, such as in ordinary tailoring is given only to suits for which £10 10s. is charged, was being given to clothing that was being put into bales to go to France. Such, a pressing is as useless as would be the wheeling of sand from one part of the beach to be washed back on another part. The proposed new Minister will be able to relieve his colleagues of some of their arduous duties, and will probably make considerable savings. It is suggested that tonight we should sit after midnight to help the Government to get its business through. Well, on every occasion that either House sits beyond midnight the Ministers hcive to put their hands in their pockets to pay £25 Cjr £30.",78

589,Mr LAIRD SMITH,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,To Hire taxis which to take home honourable members who have missed their trains.,79
590,Mr JH CATTS,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,How much does that amount to in a year?,79
591,Mr LAIRD SMITH,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"Thes e expenses mount up considerably. There are shopwalkers in Melbourne who receive, higher salaries than Ministers. Suppose the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) had purchased on behalf of a private company the steamers which he bought for this Government, and which are earning such large freights, what bonus would he have received? Would he be getting a paltry £2,000 a year for his services to the company? I do not think so. Those who have been on deputations know how arduous is his work, and that of the Honorary Minister (Senator Russell). It is not what, is paid in salary that is of much consideration, but the return that is received for the expenditure. I always said, when in charge of workmen, that I would never employ a man at low wages. It is not wise to pay sweating rates. That is why I shall support this proposal. I said on the hustings that I would do what I could to curtail expenditure, and, therefore, I am explaining to my constituents my present attitude. The honourable member for Barrier would reduce wages. Does he not know that when you make a reduction at the top it goes on until the lower-paid man suffers ? Mr CosrsroiNE - The honourable member does not adopt the same principles when the workers ask for increases.",79
592,Mr LAIRD SMITH,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"The honourable member never knew me to refuse increases to workers. The Prime Minister has done more for the workers in increasing their pay than the honourable member will do if he lives to the age of Methuselah. It ill becomes any honourable member to adversely criticise the salaries which Ministers receive, in view of the vast amount of money that they control, and the great Departments they have to administer. I shall support the Bill.",79
593,Mr JH CATTS,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"Cook) [10.11] - In ordinary circumstances I would offer no opposition to this proposal. But it is most unfortunate that the Government should seek to increase their Ministerial salaries in a time of stress like the present. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Laird Smith) has referred to the in great work that is performed by Ministers, and to the service which he himself rendered as an Honorary Minister. His argument, if pushed to its logical conclusion, would favour the payment of public men by commission on the value of the work which they perform.  objects to speeding up.",79
594,Mr JH CATTS,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"I do not. is no man in this chamber works harder than I do. The honourable member for Denison has stressed the saving which was effected during the period that he. filled the position of Honorary Minister for Defence. Need I remind him that for a few months I was chairman of the Prices Adjustment Board, and that it has been shown by a Commonwealth accountant that as a result of its work during that period nearly £2,000,000 was saved to the people of this country. Yet its members were paid no-salary.",80
595,Mr SINCLAIR,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,They were kicked out in the end.,80
596,Mr JH CATTS,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"My honourable friend sat with me on that Board. We were not exactly kicked out, but we resigned in a body because the Government asked us to work under regulations which would have foredoomed our labours to failure. I hold in my hand the report of the Repatriation Committee in New South Wales. It is dated 30th June, 1917, and covers the work performed by the Committee during the previous year. body consists of two business men and one member of the State Parliament. It comprises Mr Willington , chairman o* the Chamber of Manufactures; Mr . Parkes, a member of that organization; and Mr MCGirr, who is a Labour member of the State Parliament. During the past twelve months the Commission has held 161 meetings. The average duration of these 'meetings was two hours in the morning on five days of each week, but on many occasions the chairman attends to special business on Saturdays. Here are men who are probably devoting as much attention to repatriation as does the Minister himself. Yet they receive no payment for their services whatever. Then we have a Parliamentary Recruiting Committee, of which I am a member. Its members receive no payment for their ,, services. We have a Public Accounts Committee, of which I am a member, whose members act in an honorary'capacity. Similarly, the members of the State War Council, of which I am one, receive no payment for their services.",80
597,Mr KELLY,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,There is also a Public Works Committee ,80
598,Mr JH CATTS,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"It s members do There receive some payment. But most bodies who associated with patriotic work are acting in an honorary capacity. The Hospital Advisory Committee, of which I am a member, and which has been asked to con- .. duct an important defence inquiry, receives no payment. „ But what is the position occupied by Ministers? The public of this country do not know the extent of their allowances. They are under the impression, no doubt, that the Vice-' President of the Executive Council (Senator Millen) receives no allowances beyond his parliamentary salary. That is not so. At the present time the Ministerial allowance totals £12,650, in addition to which the eight Ministers each receive £400, or £3,200, as their ordinary parliamentary salary. Their total cash payment in salaries, therefore, is £16,850. It is necessary to explain that under Statute Ministers each receive only £400 as their parliamentary salary when in receipt of the salary of a Minister of State. But under the proposal before us the M i nisterial allowance will be increased to £15,300, and as the nine Ministers will This each receive £400 as their parliamentary salary, their total emoluments will be in creased to £18,9""00. The total Ministerial moneys are apportioned as follows:-The Prime Minister, £2,000, with £400 parliamentary allowance, or £2,400. 1 Eight Ministers, at £1,000 each, with £400 each for their parliamentary allowance, £11,200. The Vice-President. of the Executive Council (Senator Millen), £900 from the Ministerial pool, and £600 as his ordinary parliamentary allowance. The last-named thus receives a total payment of £1,500. As he has not' hitherto occupied an office called "" Minister of State"" under the law, no deduction is made from his parliamentary allowance. ' Two Honorary Ministers each receive £450 from the pool, and £600 as their parliamentary allowance, or £2,100. Then the W h i p in each House is paid £400 from the pool, with £600 parliamentary allowance, or a total of £2,000. These amounts / aggregate £29,200, which is the amount that is divided between the Prime Minister, eight Ministers, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, two Honorary Ministers, and two Whips. Then it must be recollected that Senator Millen, who is acting as Minister for Repatriation, and who receives £1,500 a year, receives allowances on the Ministerial scale whenever he travels on Ministerial business. Yet these Ministers have ju%t succeeded in passing a Bill which will impose a tax of £5 per head on single men, irrespective of whether they have an income or not. , If they have an income of only £5 per year, they will be called upon to pay that amount by way of income tax.",80
599,The CHAIRMAN,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,Mr J. M. Chanter). - Order ! The honourable member must not discuss that question.,81
600,Mr JH CATTS,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"I merely desired to make a passing reference to it. At a time when the necessities of this country, according to the dictum of Ministers, demand the imposition of a tax upon men who are hungry 'and have insufficient clothing, when the cost of living is soaring, and families cannot procure sufficient of the necessaries of life, when through unemployment and want disturbances are breaking out in our cities, a proposal is put forward to increase Ministerial salaries. That is what the Bill amounts to. It is really a proposal to add to the Ministerial pool the sum of £1,650 per year. It is thus equivalent to an increase of £200 each in the salaries of Ministers. But at the present time it is an absolutely iniquitous proposal, and if there be another member of the Committee who will join me in calling for a division, I will insist upon a vote being taken upon it. At a time when Ministers are prepared to increase their salaries by £200 per year, they have imposed a poll-tax of £5 per head on persons who are unable to pay it.",81
601,Mr KELLY,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"Wentworth) [10.20] I do not think the honourable member for Copk (Mr Catts) has quite fairly set forth the position. The Minister for Repatriation is doing not merely the work of a Minister, but a work which is peculiarly the responsibility of this Parliament. We are all responsible for repatriation; but this one member of the Parliament has taken upon his shoulders the whole burden of responsibility. If there is to be any sacrifice, let it be on the part of members of Parliament generally. If honourable members of the Opposition wish to have this work done without any increase in the public charges, let us all contribute out of our allowance to the salary of this new Minister.",81
602,Mr MATHEWS,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,The honourable member is opening up a rather funny trend of thought.,81
603,Mr KELLY,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,I admit my proposal is not likely to be popular,81

605,Mr KELLY,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"We apparently are the poor. After all, the Minister for Repatriation will be doing the work of all of us, and if we wish to prove that we are patriots w.e can, by each contributing some £15 a year, put this new Minister in full, possession of the salary of an ordinary member of the Cabipet without making the public one penny piece the poorer. If my honourable friends of the Opposition are prepared to tackle the question in that light, I shall be glad to help them. I am sure honourable members on this side will agree to any patriotic suggestion of the kind.",81
606,Mr MATHEWS,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,Nobod y seems to be rushing the idea.,81
607,Mr KELLY,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"Quite so. If honourable members of the Opposition are not prepared to do anything of the kind, let them give up slinging mud at the Minister who has taken this responsibility upon his own shoulders, and at the Government who, after all, are only doing what any Ministry would do in the circumstances.",81
608,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"I think we should go further and expel from our union the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine), and the honourable member for Cook (Mr Catts). They want to bring down wages.",81
609,Mr KELLY,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"I do not think they do. The Minister for the Navy has exaggerated the pretensions of both those honourable members. 1 Had the honourable member for East Sydney, or any other prominent occupant of the front Opposition bench, made this suggestion, I should have regarded it as somewhat in the nature of a sacrifice, in view of their future prospects; but we know that the two honourable members who made it have no anticipation of at any time being asked to make such a sacrifice.",81
610,Mr CONSIDINE,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,At all events we shall not be asked to act as strike breakers.,82
611,Mr KELLY,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"My honourable friend recognises that he and the honourable member for Cook (Mr Catts) are never likely to be put into the absolutely horrible position of doing any such work for nothing. What they are suggesting, therefore, at the expense of the Minister for Repatriation, is not with a view to any future sacrifice.",82
612,Mr JH CATTS,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,This is a very weak defence.,82
613,Mr KELLY,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"This measure does not require any defence - I wish now to make a few observations of a perfectly non-party character with reference to Federal administration generally. We have had from the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Bruce Smith) a perfervid defence of Commonwealth Ministers. We heard from an honourable gentleman (Mr Laird Smith) that he saved the country no less than £40,000 in one deal. He was an Honorary Minister at the timej and earned every penny he drew in that capacity. We have heard other Ministers also defending the Commonwealth administration and asserting that Federal Ministers are grossly underpaid. I do not know of any clerk in the Commonwealth, who is paid as much as a Commonwealth Minister. Despite the great capacity of these honourable gentleman individually, our Acts of Parliament and their system of administration- I am referring - now to all Commonwealth Governments-practicall y turn every Commonwealth Minister into a sort of superiorclerk. Let us see what happens. If anything is going to happen in any great public Department of Australia it starts at the bottom rung. A telegraph messenger,, let us say, for Ithe sake of argument, recognises that something should be done. He sets out his recommendation on a piece of foolscap and sends it on to the chap. above him, who approves it. . It then goes from the manager of their branch to the chief clerk in the sub-department, and he, too, approves it. From him the paper goes on to some one - else, who, seeing attached to the recommendation the signature of the man below him, also approves it. From him it goes to the Deputy Postmaster-General, from the Deputy to the Secretary to the Central Administration, and from the Secretary to the Minister. Every one of them approves it in turn,because he sees on it the signature. of the man immediately below him.",82
614,Mr TUDOR,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,Is than how the honourable member came to let the TeesdaleSmith contract?,82
615,Mr KELLY,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"That is how the honor- , able member when he held office administered his Department, and how all other Ministers administer their Departments. All the Departments are administered in that way.",82
616,Mr LAMOND,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,And especially the Department of Trade and Customs.,82
617,Mr KELLY,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"-Exactly . That is why the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) when Minister for Trade and Customs allowed thousands and thousands of German-made gas mantles to come in, through Holland, to the ultimate horror and indignation of the people of Australia. He had never examined the matter for himself. He had acted upon some one's signature on the papers referring to the matter, and that somebody signed them because some one else's signature appeared upon them. And so it goes on. These honourable gentlemen, no matter to what party they belong, are satisfied thfit they are doing their duty. We find Ministers busy in their' Departments. Few, like the ex-Honorary Minister (Mr. Laird Smith), have done good work by getting on to individual troubles. It is work, however, which they should not be called upon to do; if the men in their Departments did their work properly there would be no such tangles to be unravelled by a Minister, who, after all, is only an amateur.",82
618,Mr BRENNAN,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,We have not heard the other side.,82
619,Mr KELLY,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"I absolutely believe, from what I have seen of Federal administration, that the statement, as put forward by the honourable member, is literally correct; I have not the slightest doubt of the actual truth of every part of it. But I do say that this system of transferring responsibility from the bottom to the top makes every person in the long list responsible for .the crime that has been committed. Then, again, there is no real supervision. Every Minister is a sort of superior clerk. What do we get from the Cabinet? thing done then. The man outside the Minister's room walks about with a look of awe on his face, and says, ""Good Heavens! be reit spectful ! that man is a Cabinet Minisvernment ter."" What is a Cabinet Minister? this country he is not, as he is in England, part of the brains of the nation, free from the responsibility of superior clerkship in any Department. In Australia a Cabinet Minister has to adminismy ter a Department.",82

627,Mr KELLY,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"It has been practically experience, and the experience of all other Cabinet Ministers since the Federal authority expanded some ten or twelve years ago. A lot of our trouble is due to the fault of this Parliament, which puts a great deal of the labour of superior clerks so upon the shoulders of Ministers of State. conI hope that in due course Ministers will in consider the whole question of Commonsome wealth administration. I believe that by doing so they may render Australia great and valuable service.

628,Mr MATHEWS,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"Melbourne Ports) my intention to support no longer Wentworth (Mr honourable The Kelly) member for has suggested the necessity for a rearrangement of the Cabinet positions. I believe that nearly every person in Australia who desires to reobtain anything through Parliament, or ' through the Government, thinks that it necessary to see the Minister in charge Rightly or wrongly we have built up a practice under which people are not satisfied unless they can place their case before the Minister. It is useless to hide the fact that unless there is some rearrangement Ministerial' positions* at least five of present Ministers will have too much do. I do not wish to make invidious comparisons, but it will be agreed that work of the Departments controlled by the Prime Minister and Attorney General (Mr Hughes) has grown enorv They mously. There has been some rearrangewhereby an Honorary Minister, who is a member of the Senate, undertakes duties connected with the Department of the Prime Minister.",83
629,Mr BRENNAN,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,He might economized wisely by leaving a lot of his mischievous work undone.,84
630,Mr MATHEWS,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"I am not dealing with that question to-night. I know that work is behindhand in all Ministerial Departments. It seems impossible for Ministers to overtake their work. are building up a system under which every day greater responsibilities and additional work are imposed upon Ministers, in connection with such organizations as the various pools, the shipbuilding policy proposal, and now the great work of repatriation. The work of repatriation will certainly be so great as to require that one Minister shall devote the whole of his time to it . I do not know whether it is possible for present Ministers to allow one of them to confine himself to that work and let the rest share the work which he has previously performed. Every one recognises .how necessary it is that the work of repatriation shall be carried out in a comprehensive manner, and in my view it requires the sole attention of a responsible Minister, and one holding full Cabinet rank. I was one of those who supported the in crease in the number of Ministers upon the establishment of the Navy Department, because I thought that desirable and necessary - We are going to spend more money in connection with repatriation than is spent in connection with any present Department of the Public Service, and, as I believe that one' Minister must devote the whole of his time to that work, I support the Bill .",84
631,Mr LAMOND,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"Illawarra) [10.37] - I rise to repeat a suggestion which I made during a previous debate, that the time has arrived when 'the Cabinet should give some consideration to the question of securing greater efficiency in the Government. The remarks of the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Kelly) indicates the direction which, reform should take. There are two things which the Cabinet! should consider in this regard. The. first is the establishment of a Cabinet in the sense suggested by the honourable member for Wentworth when he described it as the thinking part of government. At tention can be given now to principles and policies of government by members of the Ministry only at intervals between deciding whether another shilling shall be given to some one in the Public Service, or the have illimitable small complaints which honourable members are continually bringing before them. There is a proposal now to establish a Department. of Repatriation, under the control of Senator Millen, and that suggests another matter which I should like We to see f u l ly considered. No better man could be found in the Parliament to control j h e work of repatriation than Senator Millen, but there is this disadvantage attached to his appointment to such a position : We should then have both the great spending Departments of the Government represented outside this House. I cannot see why we should not introduce a new method by which the Minister responsible for a particular measur'e should be entitled to speak in either House, Perhaps a better plan would be to arrange that big speeches-lik e the Budget speech of the Treasurer, or a speech in explanation of a Bill like the Repatriation Bill should be made to a joint sitting of members of both Houses. We should have been better equipped for the work in which we have been engaged during thei past two or three days if we had had the advantage of listening to Senator Millen's address to the Senate upon the Repatriation Bill . In considering the finances of the country, I believe that members of both Houses would be placed in a better position if the Budget speech of the Treasurer were delivered to a joint sitting. These are two matters which, I think, should be considered in connection with Cabinet re-adjustment. Whether the cost be £5,000, £10,000, or £15,000-whateve r we pay for the work, if it is done efficiently, it will pay this country to spend thousands of pounds where we are now spending hundreds. Efliciency in the control of the 1 Commonwealth means the saving of hundreds of thousands of pounds that now are lost, because the system under which we work is a time-wasting one, that deprives Ministers of the opportunity to consider problems calmly .as they ought; and any reform in this direction will be worth ten times the amount it may cost.",84
632,Mr HUGHES,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"Bendigo-Prime M in ister and Attorney-General) [10.40]. - I shall not detain the Committee more than a minute or two, but I think that some figures, showing _ in a fair l y definite way the extent to which the responsibilities and work of the Government have increased, and the extent to which the cost of administration has trodden on its heels, might with advantage be given to honourable members. My honourable colleague, who has charge of this measure (Mr Groom) has already dealt with a number of matters, connected with wheat, shipping, wool, and so for t h , with which every honourable member is quite familiar; but I desire to set out in detail some figures showing the turnover per annum in regard to them. I wish to show that the Government, as a business concern, has so grown that it would be safe to say that it now has, at least, one thousand per cent, greater turnover than when Federation was established. The values of the commodities handled by the Government during last year were':-Butter , £8,500,000; hides, £2,760,000; leather, £3,500,000; boots and shoes, £4,500,000; rabbits, £1,500,000; rabbit skins, £600,000; hops, £110,000; wheat, £30,000,000; coal, £192,600; ships, £2,052,000; metals, £15,000,000; f r u it , £262,000; sugar, £8,000,000; £25,340,540; or a total of £102,317,140. All these, with the exception of boots and shoes, as to which it is fair l y open to argument whether they ought to be in cluded, are under the direct control of the Government-thing s we really buy and sell, handle and deal with on a business basis. In addition, there are a number of other commodities with which we deal, but in an indirect way, such as freight, for example, which, if added, would present a very much more formidable total. The increase in the cost of the administration of all the Departments in the year 1916-17, as compared with 1914-15, is £672,625, while the increase in the cost of war services proper in the same period - whic h is not included in the cost of the administration-is £47,168,125. I venture to say that a business house which could put before the shareholders a statement such as this, showing the business had increased to such an extent, would have no difficulty all in securing permission gage another manager. After everv honourable member who has had by that? experience as a Minister, or who has given the matter two minutes' will realise that the Government dimcult task to control the work that has Mr Hughes. now come to us, even with the number of Ministers at our disposal. I take my own Department as an instance, and I venture to say that its activities could easily be divided amongst five men. It has been my fortunate lot to secure the services of a number of very able men, who have given their work to the Commonwealth, some of them for nothing, and others for a mere pittance; and if they left my Department it would be absolutely impossible for me to carry on. I repeat that, looking at the position fair l y , there would be enough work for five men today in the Department which I have the honour to control, and I am speaking only about the Prime Minister's Department, and do not allude to the Attorney-General's Department, upon which the war has also, placed increased work and responsibilities. The tone of the speakers I have been fortunate to hear show conclusively that there is a recognition of the fact that the proposed expenditure is nothing so long as we get good value for it . If we mean anything at all by the repatriation scheme wool, it is going to be "" the job "" beside which all others sink into comparative in significance. We have to "" make good "" ; and to entrust this work to an Honorary Minister is clearly not the way to establish our bond fides with the people. I shall say no more; but I feel certain that the Committee recognise that the Government are making an honest attempt in this direction, at any rate, to carry out its pledges, and I also feel perfectly sure that we shall have the assistance of honourable members.",84
633,Mr BRENNAN,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"Batman) [10.48] I should like to know from no less a distinguished person than the Prime Minister how much honorary work, or how much work, is being done for the Commonwealth for what he describes as a "" mere pittance "" ? The curious thing is that, where so many people are ready to render such distinguished serthat vices for such small sums, the Government, who preach loudest .the doctrine of at economy, should be the only exception in to en- failin g to put it into practice. all, Mr. JOSEPH COOK - What do you mean",85
634,Mr BRENNAN,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"I mean that the thought, Prime Minister has just stated that he re has a ceived a great deal of valued assistance, which he could riot do without, from men who do the work for a "" mere pittance."" I do not know whom he referred to. but I take his word for it , on this occasion all events.",85
635,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"The statement quite true. In my Department I have men working fourteen hours a day for nothing, and doing it well, too.",86
636,Mr BRENNAN,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"There are men outside the Departments who are working many hours a day for nothing. The honourable member for Cook (Mr J . H . Catts) cited a good many cases. Indeed, cases might be cited in every walk of life. In short, I understood, and I have been given on all hands to understand, that this is not only a time for economy, but a time for economy to the very bone, when every man who is charged with public responsibilities is called upon to act in a spirit of sacrifice, recognising the sacrifices which were made by others, some, of them compulsorily and many of them voluntarily, on the other side of the world. According to the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Lamond), it matters not, apparently, what we spend on tliese services to insure that they are well done. It does not seem to occur to the honourable gentleman, or to the Prime Minister, that it would not be unreasonable to expect, not only that the services should be well done, but that they should be well done at least for the emoluments Ministers have been receiving up to the present. We are told that this increase of expenditure is for repatriation, a matter of greatest and gravest moment, and so it is. But let us not disguise the real facts in connection with the proposal. It is not because it is for repatriation that there should be no additional work performed by Ministers for the same pay, but rather the contrary, because it is to be done for the soldiers who have suffered all and done everything. It is because of that very reason that Ministers should set an example, and come here and say, . "" Whatever the burden we have to shoulder, it will be shouldered without increased taxation and without setting an example which we would not have followed in other walks of life in the Commonwealth."" The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Kelly) gave us some interesting sidelights on Cabinet life, which those of us who have not been privileged to occupy that honourable position did not full y appreciate before. His complaint is that in the past there has been a mistaken policy .at of a telegraph messenger, pr some other subordinate underpaid officer, making a is report to the person immediately above him, and of that person making a report to some sub-manager or senior officer above him, and so on t ill through various mystic grades it reaches a Cabinet M i nister, and then, according to the ex-Minister, he does the wrong thing.",86
637,Mr JH CATTS,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,He puts a rubber stamp on the document.,86
638,Mr BRENNAN,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"Yes . But, apparently, in the wielding of the rubber stamp, according to the honourable member for Wentworth, the Minister does not always exercise ordinary wisdom. The corrective to that policy, I suppose, is that we should commence with a recommendation to the Minister, and by successive grades go downwards t ill the telegraph messenger approves of something less disastrous than the Teesdale-Smith contract. Possibly by that means we would achieve better results. The honourable member urged, too, that the appointment of a Minister for Repatriation is to remove responsibility from honourable members in this House, and that, therefore, it rests with honourable members to provide, if necessary, the emoluments of the new Minister, because, forsooth, their responsibilities are to be less. I would be very sorry to think that, Dy adding another member to the Ministrythe the greater part of whose policy every honourable member on this side dissents from, as being in a large measure dis - 1 astrous to this country-w e would lose any of our responsibility. But if it pleases the honourable member to make the suggestion,. I am quite prepared to follow him. I think that it is up to us to set an example, but particularly is it ' up to the members of the Cabinet.",86

647,Mr BRENNAN,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,I was answering the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr . Wise)» who did not seem to be quite equal to the simple sum in arithmetic involved in the fact that Cabinet Ministers are paid at a rate about four or five times as high as that of an ordinary member of the House.,87

651,Mr BRENNAN,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"I think, sir, ib ought to be permissible to make that reference by way of comparison between the proposal involved in this message and the taxing proposals of the Government. My object in even distantly referring to the matter was to answer the criticism which has been levelled at me. I have been accused by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Bruce Smith) of having made a personal remark reflecting upon the Treasurer (Sir John Forrest). It is very far from my desire or my practice to introduce personalities into the discussion of these questions. But I am justified, I think, in pointing out so gross an anomaly as the right honourable gentleman's policy in connection with another matter when compared with the proposal involved in this motion. In condoning this proposal to come in war time for in creased emoluments, the honourable member for Parkes said, "" Consider what M in isters have to do. They leave their homes in other States, and have to make new homes in Victoria, away from all family ties."" Generally the honourable gentleman seems to think it is monstrous that members of Parliament and Ministers should suffer discomfort at this time. I find difficulty in dealing patiently with this suggestion when lives are being sacrificed, when it is not too much for the righ t honourable gentleman to commandeer the very lives of people. For the honourable member to say that Ministers' comfort is being molested by the fact that they have to leave their homes, and come all the way from adjacent States to reside in Victoria to carry on the work for which they are paid",87

It comes with a very ill-grace that the Government should come down with this proposal. I do not question the work which is being done. I know that there is a great amount of work to be done. Possibly the Prime Minister was right when he said that there is work for many more hands than those at present being employed. Very well; let us have the hands and the brains.

660,Mr WISE,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"Gippsland)) [11.1] - The party, vindictive speech of the honourable member was in interesting contrast to that of the honourable member for Y a r ra (Mr T u d o r ) , who, having had experience of Ministerial life, and knowing the burdens that Ministers have to bear, said quite franklythat he was prepared to support this proposal. have been dealing with a measure that is of the greatest importance, the administration of which will take a supreme position in the work of this country for many years to come-ove r £20,000,000 will be spent in connection with it-and whether it will be a success or a failure will depend entirely on the men who are administering it . There will be Local Committees, State Boards, and the Repatriation Commission, but, above all, the Minister at the head, and the work will occupy the whole of the time that he can devote to it . What do those who are opposing this proposal claim ? That the Minister should not be paid for doing the work? No . They will not say that, but they turn round and say that eight men in this community should find his salary. It is the country's work that the M i nister will be doing in connection with the greatest obligation that the Commonwealth can have, and his salary should be paid by the people. The sincerity honourable members opposite in regard to this matter was clearly shown when the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr . Kelly) made the suggestion that, if honourable members were so considerate about saving further expense, they should all contribute towards the Minister's salary instead of asking members of the Government to provide it . The suggestion of the honourable member did not meet with a solitary response, but when the honourable member for Batman (Mr . Brennan) was speaking, he suddenly announced that he was prepared to join in contributing towards the Minister's salary. He said that he was prepared to make an equal sacrifice in these times of making sacrifices, but he immediately added that Ministers should pay a bigger [102] share, because they were receiving bigger salaries.",88
661,Mr BRENNAN,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,That is the principle laid down in the Income Tax Act .,88
662,Mr WISE,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"But Ministers do ten times the amount of work - that private members do. The honourable member sneered at the references made by the honourable member for Parkes to the salaries drawn by Ministers whose homes are in other States. What I said when members' allowances were increased from £400 to £600 ,per annum, I say again. It ill-becomes a member representing a Melbourne constituency to cavil at the salaries that are paid to country repreTo-day we sentatives or men who come here from other States. Melbourne men live in their own homes, and have no extra expenses to pay. They attend their businesses practically the whole of the day, and they make no sacrifices through having to attend in this building. On the other hand, honourable members who represent country constituencies sacrifice three or four days a week from their businesses, and those who come here fro m other States are away from their businesses altogether. Let us put an end to this hypocritical, canting talk and deal with the matter in a proper way. The whole of the responsibility for the administration of this important repatriation scheme will fall on the head of one man. If he does his work well, he will be worth far more than the salary that he will be paid, and that salary should be found by the whole community, and not by a few individuals in it .  of ing the elections I claimed that the present Government was a Win-the-war Government and an Economy Government. The (proposal now before us involves the paiyment of 'an additional Ministerial salary, but we must remember that we have been dealing with a very important Bill , which will authorize the expenditure of many millions of pounds, and that the Government might have made provision for the appointment of an outside man as manager. What salary would we have had to pay to an outside man, who would be an adept in matters of finance, and in the control of huge concerns, such as this our repatriation scheme will be? Last night I said that I would approve of such an appointment, but inasmuch as the Government have decided in favour of placing a Minister at the head of the scheme, we must consider the difference between the £1,600 that he will be paid and the salary, probably £3,000, that we would have to pay in order to secure the services of a man under the other method. Mr JH CATTS.^Before the war broke out the honourable member was always complaining about Ministerial allowances.  broke out there was not one half the business to be transacted that there is now. Although there is a disposition on the part of people outside to cavil at this additional expenditure, it is. a matter very easy to explain and justify. We could not get a man outside Parliament to undertake the administration of this repatriation scheme for at least twice the money that the Government propose to pay.",88
663,Mr BAMFORD,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"Some time Queensland, they gave the manager of the Chillagoe mines £10,000 a year.  get a thoroughly efficient and able manager from the highest ranks of business men to do this work properly would cost much less than £1Q,000. Seeing that there is a Minister of the Crown prepared to take up the work, and that the total additional cost is a matter of £1,600, we are perfectly justified in presenting the proposal to the public as one of economy, and not of expense.",89
664,Mr FENTON,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"Maribyrnong) [11.12]. - I intend to oppose this proposition. If the Ministry had come down today, as they did two or three years ago, and asked for another portfolioed Minister, and money for the purpose, I should have been found supporting it , because I considered that some addition was necessary; but that addition was made two or three years ago, and it ought to hold today. I was prepared to fight immediately after the 1913 elections for twelve Ministers. did not fight to have the salaries in creased, but I believed there was work for twelve Ministers in the different Departments. When one finds now that eleven Ministers will draw about £1,700 each, I see no reason for the expenditure of this extra sum. The Prime Minister sought to-night to convince the Committee that Ministers and Departments were overburdened.",89
665,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"I wish you right about the £1,700 each! Bill.",89
666,Mr FENTON,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"I am including the proposed increase, and dividing the amount by 'the number, of Ministers. I am open to correction, and I know that there is expenditure that has to be met. The proper note in the debate was struck by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr K e l l y ) , I do not see how things are to go on as they are doing. We in ' t h is Parliament andpeople outside are demanding from Ministers too much attention to detail. They are slaving at work that ought to be done by some one else in the Departments.",89
667,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,I am running a coal yard for nothing now.,89
668,Mr FENTON,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"On e would think that the whole responsibility for running all these Boards and pools fell absolutely upon the shoulders of Ministers who conago, in duct' the Departments in which, they are found.",89
669,Mr HEITMANN,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"If they did not give some personal service, you would be the first to complain, >",89
670,Mr FENTON,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"If the honourable member had any experience of the new Departments created and brought under the control of certain Ministers for the sake of convenience, he would find that if he required any details about the operation of these undertakings he must go to somebody other than the Minister.' The Prime Minister's contention will not bear scrutiny in that regard. If one requires to know anything about sugar or ships one musL not go to the Prime Minister, although there is certain information which he alone has authority to divulge, and it is necessary to have some one in supreme control of these big commercial operations. If I want to know anything about the way the sugar business is being managed in the Commonwealth, 1 go to an officer I under the Prime Minister. He understands all the ramifications of the business, ancl is, therefore, placed in charge of that particular branch. He can give me all the particulars, because he understands his business, and, I understand, the Commonwealth is paying him handsomely. Where, then, is the justification, for in creasing Ministerial salaries on that ground ?",89
671,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,Does the honorwere able member suggest that the Minister is there merely to answer his queries?,89
672,Mr FENTON,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"I did not say one man could possibly do what is supMinisterial posed to be done by the Prime Ministo ter. He has under him a man who understands all about metals, another who understands about wool, another ment, about wheat, or sugar, or shipping, and in most cases, fortunately, there is Board of experts under that man who the chairman.",90
673,Mr LAIEDSMITH,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,Who carries the responsibility ?,90
674,Mr FENTON,MINISTERS OF STATE BILL,"Technically , every member must bear a certain amount of rewhich sponsibility, and the Minister a little more. The long list recently published in Hansard shows that a large number the members of the boards or pools doing good work in an honorary capacity. If a number of these leading commercial men are doing this work for nothing, is surprising to me. Are the Governoften ment bringing men from every State i connection with the Wool Board and the Wheat Board, and so ori, without the Commonwealth 'having to pay for their services, and repay their travelling expenses? As a rule, is a head man under the Minister for each: of these commercial enterprises, and he is well paid for the work he is doing. It is, therefore, of little use the Prime Minister to tell the Committee and the country that the salaries of Ministers and the number of portfolioed Ministers should be increased simply cause of this extra work. I should be is the last to depreciate in any w a y - I not even if I wanted to-the splendid merits, gifts, and abilities Of Senator Millen. We have in him one of the best men for the work; but when the Minisbut terial salaries are pooled, and he can tain the fair salary of, I should say, subordinates. £1,500 from that pool, I fail to see why, in these stressful times, Parliament should be called.upon to vote more money to pay for another portfolioed Minister. . The work has increased in this war time, but we have engaged experts and increased our officers. If we make any appeal some poor unfortunate public servant who has waited a long time for his crement, or needs a little more to add to the very poor salary the Government him for the work he does for them, we are told thab any increase of that sort it . must wait until the war is over. This proposal is not required to wait until the war is over, because it applies the Bill? [102]- 2 so. No to somebody high in rank and in circles, and we are requested vote a salary for him accordingly. And experts have been engaged in all directions. Take the Attorney-General's Departfor instance. By the passage of a Bill a year or two ago we created Sir Robert a Garran, one of our eminent lawyers and is public servants, Solicitor-General, and since that date he has been occupying ti position to all intents and purposes equal to Ministerial office. He is now able to do, with his own signature, things about formerly he had to consult the At torney-General. For almost every big undertaking in which the Commonwealth of has been engaged since the war began, an are expert has been appointed. One of the faults of the present Administration is that the. Prime Minister loads himself it with too much responsibility, and very matters are delayed u n t i l his sancn tion is obtained. If he would transfer some of his responsibility to his Ministers or officials, he would relieve himself of a them considerable amount of work, and the country would be equally well served. there Very often when finally his sanction is given to a matter, or he makes a statement in the House, he acts on information supplied to him by one of the gentlefor men he employs. In control of the Central Wool Committee is Mr Higgins, who, I suppose, receives a big salary. Colonel Oldershaw is in charge of Commonwealth beshipping business, and I assume that he not kept exclusively in the Prime M in could - ister's Department without receiving a salary commensurate with the work he is doing. I admit that the Prime Minister's range of knowledge is wonderfully wide, in regard to many matters he is absooblutely dependent upon the advice of his In regard to sugar, bhat , commodity is controlled by Mr Knox, of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, as much today as ever it was. The Government cannot take a single step in connection with the control of sugar without the consent of that gentleman, arid the for same old business arrangements are is operation today as in the past. The in - Commonwealth Government have had an . opportunity to make the conditions in repay gard to the sugar supply much better, but they have' not availed themselves of",90

During the thirteen years I paid? have been in public life , I have periodiposing cally heard members of Parliament, genesuggest rally when sitting in Opposition, very low estimate on the value of the work of Ministers. By doing that, honourable members under-estimate the value of their own work. The great increase in the reagreed. sponsibilities of Commonwealth. Ministers paid? has rendered additional assistance necespear sary, and I think every member will agree that, if we are to appoint another M i ister, he must receive a salary. Then question arises as to whether the salaries at present paid to Ministers are too high, fhose who have been long in public life but agree that very few men in Australia have made money out of politics. As a they leave political l if e considerably than they were when they entered The it .

I hope that no misfortune will befall him, but that, on the contrary, he will live long. I could not help thinking, however, while the honourable member for Wannon was speaking, that this country would be in a truly deplorable state if anything should happen to Senator Millen. He is undoubtedly an able man, but it is buncombe to say that he is the only man in Australia who could manage this Department. That statement is, indeed, a very poor compliment to some honourable members on the other side of the House, as well as to some persons outside the House, to say nothing of the Labour party. Senator Millen has yet to prove his suitability for this office. Make no mistake about that. And it has occurred to me that the administration of this Department will involve certain peculiar work which Senator Millen, in any of his previous responsibilities, so far as I know, has not given evidence of his ability to carry out successfully. I hope he will be successful, but it is absurd to bolster up this proposal for an additional £200 a year for each of the Ministers-because that is what it amounts to-by saying that Senator Millen is the only man for the position. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) said that under this proposal a new Minister would be appointed. But is it not a fact that Senator Millen is already a Minister? He takes part it Cabinet meetings. All this talk about Senator Millen doing the work for nothing, and the creation of a new portfolio, is so much balderdash.

I intend to propose the insertion of a new clause containing a schedule to the measure. My object in submitting this amendment is to test the question whether the Committee desires to inform the Repatriation Commission as to the policy or lines of policy that should underlie this scheme, or whether ib desires that this Bill should go out in its present form as merely an authority to a Minister and a Commission, the members of which are as yet unappointed and unknown, to take from fh e control of this NOES. Parliament the whole matter of repatriation. Periodically we place policies before the country, and make appeals to the people to elect a Parliament, whose chief function is, in the daily presence and sight of the people, before the representatives of the press and the community, to enact the laws of the country - If this B i ll goes through in its present form it will be an indication thati there is a body outside Parliament much more competent to frame a policy, or a repatriation scheme, than are the members of this Parliament. I have not the slightest objection, after this Parliament has settled a policy of repatriation, and laid down the fundamental principles of the return to their native land of the men who* have fought for and redeemed it from the enemy, to the appointment of a Commission to give effect to the will of Parliament in the matter. A f t e r the Boer war, the Imperial authorities determined and laid down the basis of the restoration to their country of those who, for a time, were ejected from it . The essential busi-ness of Parliament is to lay down the policy of the country, and, having done that, in the matter of repatriation, we may f a rm out, or pass on to a Commission, under the control of a responsible Minister, the work of carrying that policy into effect. In this way, there would be a perpetual link between the Repatriation Commission and. Parliament, and the work of repatriation would be kept continuously before Parliament as a live question for its consideration. I propose to ask Parliament to affirm certain principles as the basis of repatriation, and incorporate them in the Bill . The first is that the Commonwealth Parliament shall accept the entire responsibility for the repatriation of Australian soldiers and their dependants, and shall for the purpose of giving effect to such responsibility enter into such arrangements with other governing activities of this country as may be necessary for the utilization of their existing machinery, such as land settlement laws,, health activities, and educational systems, co-operating with them, as it were, in a great national partnership, with the object of utilizing to the fullest extent the industries and organizations of Australia for the absorption of our returned soldiers. By "" other governing activities,"" I mean State Parliaments and local municipal bodies, whose political purpose it is to render services to the community. should ask them, not only to bring their Public Services to the assistance of the soldier, but also to find employment for him in their spheres of activity. The second (principle that I wish to see affirmed is the establishment of the principle of preference of employment to returned soldiers right through all the public activities of the Commonwealth, whether in respect to the Public Service or in respect, to the construction of public works. I know that we cannot lay down this principle in relation to the activities of State Parliaments or municipal authorities, but we can do so in regard to Eederal activities. The Bill before us contains no provision to carry out the principle that has been laid down since the beginning of the war, namely, that preference in employment should be given to the men who have defended this country.",94
705,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"To what extent does the honourable member propose to carry the doctrine of preference to returned soldiers? Seeing that we have already passed and dealt with laws providing for that preference in Commonwealth employment, does the honourable member mean that the - Commission must require the exercise of it in private employment?",95
706,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,The honourable member knows that the measure of preference to which he refers imposes no obligation to employ returned soldiers on any Minister controlling public works. the principle embodied in the Bill as a guide.,95
707,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,The Bill has no relation to the terms upon which returned soldiers will be employed.,95
708,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"It has everything to do with the terms upon which the soldiers will be restored to this country. If ' we give the Minister power to enter"" into arrangements with State activities and municipal activities it will cover the point raised by the honourable member for I l l awarra (Mr Lamond) today. We are beginning with an expenditure of £20,000, incurred without the authority of this Parliament. The honourable member has spoken of State Parliaments in curring expenditure to be met by this Parliament though we may have no cognisance of that expenditure; but the affir, mation of the principle of the existence of a partnership between the Commonwealth and States in regard to land settlement matters will imply a right We on the part of the Minister to bargain with the States for terms in regard to mutual supervision of the work. The third principle that I would wish to see embodied in the Bill is that no Australian soldier shall for a period of three years after the declaration of peace be liable for the payment of Commonwealth' or State taxation imposed during the period of the war for war or repatriation purposes. We have already enacted, though somewhat imperfectly, a provision that while he is away on active service the. soldier shall not be liable to taxation, but I am anxious to see that for three years after peace is declared he will not be called upon to bear a share of taxation imposed in regard to a war in which he has risked his life. That is a matter of policy which no Commission outside this Parliament could settle. I had intended to ask for the affirmation of other principles, but if I attempted to do that I would have to deal with the whole scheme, and start right from the beginning. I shall not do so* because I understand that the charter given to the Minister in this regard is very wide. I would like to have laid - down the principle of responsibility for , dealing with the sick and blind, and the totally incapacitated, but the debate that has already taken place has shown very clearly that this Parliament recognises its duty in that respect, and although the I want Bill is not definite on the matter, the. Minister has given a sufficiently definite assurance to the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory). I shall not ask for these further principles to be affirmed in the Bill. I shall content myself with - testing the feeling of honourable members as to whether they still choose to hand over to the Government a blank cheque, or whether certain principles shall be affirmed and incorporated in the Bill. There is a very vital difference between the laying down of a policy for a scheme and the administration of it . How can any Commission, no matter who may be presiding over it , settle a definite line policy upon a matter with which Parliament alone should deal? It is only with a view of testing this point that I have gone to this length to-night. If honourable members still adhere to the opinion expressed earlier in the day, that the whole question of administration and policy should be left to an outside Commission, they will not be able to tell the people when they meet them on any platform that they have discharged the promises made to Australian soldiers.",95
709,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Darling Downs-Hon orary Minister) [12.54 a.m.]- I thoroughly appreciate the efforts which the honourable member is making to improve the Bill. Although we have not been able to accept his suggestions, his efforts have resulted in bringing into clear relief what the Government's proposals really are. We are all, as it 'were, groping to find the exact rock upon which we are standing, and the honourable member has moved his amendment in the same spirit. The point that he raises as a definite issue is whether this Parliament should now lay down as a direction to the Commissioners what it wishes to have carried out under this repatriation scheme, whether we should now frame a complete scheme covering the whole of the activities in connection with repatriation, follow the principle laid down in the Bill. the power.",96
710,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"That is not quite statement, because I draw a line between administration and policy.",96
711,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,The honourable mema ber's amendment is to contain a schedule setting out what should be the scheme for follow some civil occupation. repatriation. He also says that that scheme should indicate the principles which the Commission should follow out in administering repatriation.,96
712,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"That is what I would like, .but I do not go quite so far.",96
713,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"When the honourable member set about the task of framing the scheme, he began to see the difficulties which have presented themselves to us in preparing the Bill. The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Bruce Smith) had the same experience when he tried to set down an all-embracing scheme within the four corners of the measure. Experience elsewhere has been the same. The underlying principle of the Bill is to provide assistance and beneof fits to Australian soldiers upon their discharge, in order to re-establish them in civil life.",96
714,Mr RODGEKS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Would the power you are vesting in a Commission enable the Commission to 'go so far as to say that these men shall not pay Eederal taxes for three years after they return?,96
715,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"No , nor should it do so. The next point is, how are we to give that assistance and those benefits, and how re-instate the soldiers in civil life? The Minister was immediately faced with the problem that that, involves ever so many means, methods, and institutions tooarry out the object we have in view. Take disabled soldiers, the first class to be dealt with. They are included in this Bill, and we lay down the principle that they shall be re-established in civillife. Then comes in the question, How is that to be done? They are injured in body or limb, and we must establish curative hospitals or take advantage of State institutions, or do as was done in England-adop t special hospitals and various institutions such as those for the blind. Those are the means or agencies which the Commission will adopt in carrying out that purpose.",96
716,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I do not go so far as to or indicate the direct means, but I give you",96
717,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The next aspect is the a fair case of men, perhaps not completely cured, .but restored to health, though maimed. They have to be trained to earn livelihood. They ought to be re-established in civil life by training them to Immediately comes in the question, How shall we train them? Shall we take advantage of technical institutions, or establish our own work-shops, or put them in private omployment? We cannot set out all tliese details now in any scheme in a schedule to this Bill , or lay down a hard-and-fast rule. Take another class, the men who come back healthy in body and limb, but are apprentices. Their case raises all the problems of the employment of apprentices. We lay down the principle that assistance shall be given to returnedsoldiers, and we then'leave it to the Commission to work out all the agencies; and so the principle is followed right through the.whole scheme.",96
718,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,It is a cheque.,97
719,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Yes , as it must be. Every honourable member admits that we are making a tentative scheme, to a certain extent, which w i ll have to be elastic enough to adapt itself to conditions as they change from day to day, and to the difficulties that are bound to arise. Take the question of. employment mentioned by the honourable member for Cook (Mr . J. H . Catts). In England, they had to solve the' question: Ought private employers to be allowed to exploit these disabled men ? To meet such cases, they arranged for joint panels of employers and workers, to be set up in the form' of local Committees, not only to advise a disabled man as to the prospect of getting into a trade, but to define how far, owing to his disability, the wage rules of his trade union should be relaxed in his case. Those panels judge entirely on the man's earning capacity, so that there is no danger of his being exploited at a cheap rate by a bad employer on the ground that his pension already gives him a livelihood.",97
720,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,That principle was settled in Australia years ago under the arbitration law.,97
721,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"In Australia, the Commission, when dealing with the question of employment of disabled men, will be able to consider State machinery where it exists for that purpose, and, where it does not exist, they will be able to consider the ter of arrangements between unions and employers. But. we do not want f o stereotype that in the Act at present. It is a development that will have to wait for the Commission to work out. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) proposes three principles. The first is that the Commission be empowered to make arrangements with the State Governments.",97
722,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,No ; the first affirms the principle that this Parliament assumes the whole responsibility for repatriation.,97
723,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The Bill' already assumes that responsibility. That is the very essence of the Bill , and there is no need to declare it . Under the Bill , we are taking all the responsibility for repatriation. The Commission cannot enter into agreements with State Governments.",97
724,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,That would be more objectionable than Governments doing ib.,97
725,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The Government alone can do that. . In that matter, we are dealblank ing witli sovereign bodies, and the States are very sensitive on the matter of arrangements being made by their own officials without the cognizance of those charged with the control of affairs of State. But the Commission will have power to report to the Minister, and lie will make arrangements with the States to utilize all State agencies for the purpose of carrying out their proposals. There is no doubt that thati will be done, and there is no necessity to put it in the Bill . That is not a principle of repatriation. It is only one of the agencies by which we give effect to the principle of repatriation. The next point the honourable member makes relates to the question of preference. We could not give the Commission power to dictate to all the Commonwealth agencies and undertakings the terms and conditions of .the employment of their public servants. That is not their function. It is the duty of Parliament, and Parliament has already laid down, in a Public Service Bill , the principle of preference of employment to returned soldiers in the Public Service, and last week we passed a Defence Act which gives them preference of employment in certain Defence positions. The third point the honourable member raised was that no Australian soldier shall be liable for Eederal taxation for a certain period after his return. We could iiot delegate to the Commission powers relating to taxation. Those powers have to be exercised by Parliamatment, and Parliament in its taxation schemes seta out who shall and who shall not be taxed. When you try to set down a complete scheme in a schedule, you find that you may l i m it it ; and make it more difficult for the Commission to carry out the real intention of Parliament.",97
726,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Late r on, somebody will have to put his hand to the pen, and take that terrible responsibility. Mr GROOM.' - In the United K in gdom they had to face exactly the same problem of repatriation.",97
727,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"That is hardly repanot triation. It is preparatory work to r patriation,",98

House of Parliament. Sir A r t h u r Griffith-Boscawen, Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Pensions, gave an address to the Allies' Conference on this subject. Honourable members will find this publication ceedingly useful in studying the question. I - agree with the suggestion It is a journal called Recalled to and is "" devoted to the care, re-educayong tion, and return to civil life of disabled sailors and soldiers.""

When the Imperial authorities came to review, deal with this question, they did not attempt to set out the whole scheme in detail in their legislation. Their provisions dealing with this subject are two small sub-clauses- "" To make provision for the care of disabled officers and men after they have left the military service, in cluding provision for healthy training and employment,"" and then "" To make grants in special cases for the purpose of enabling widows, children, and other framed. dependants, of deceased omcers and men to obtain training and employment.""",98
729,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Does it not go beyond that ?,98
730,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"No ; nor do they atmere tempt, in so dealing with the question, lay down the whole scope of the undertakprovision ing. They do what we propose to do; constitute a Department for Repatriation sanatoria for consumptives. - of course theirs is limited, and ours is» extended-la y down the principle that assistance and help should be given to returned soldiers and sailors, and then allow the Commission to develop its scheme and regulations in order to meet the conditions of the returning men.",98
731,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,I agree with that.,98
732,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"It would be wiser for Parliament at this stage to do as is proposed in the Bill . The Commission will be a body beyond the control of Pare - liament.

But there is a good deal in repatriation beyond the framing of regulations. There are to the treatment of discharged soldiers, the of artificial limbs, and the estabthey lishment of training institutions and of All these activities will not necessarily be embodied in the regulations, but they will contribute to a complete system of repatriation. Then regulations will be required for securing uniformity throughout Australia in regard to grants. If a man is killed at the Front and leaves a widow we shall make her an allowance in addition to th« pension where the special circumstances justify that course. She may have daughter thirteen or fourteen years age whom she desires to have trained as school teacher, and she may ask the Reus patriation Board for assistance in nexion with the child's education. must have uniform regulations to govern the treatment of applications of that character. The Minister has said that he would be a bold man wbo would unentire dertake to lay down ab once a complete scheme of. repatriation, and he admits that even his own, proposals are more or less tentative.",98
738,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Is there any objection quarterly or half-yearly reports being f nished ?,99
739,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The Minister will, uncontrol of employment. doubtedly, make an annual report, just as the Postmaster-General does; and he w require monthy or quarterly reports sent from the State Boards to the Central Administration. He quite agrees as the necessity for having regular reports aud of keeping Parliament informed of the progress made.",99
740,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Coul d that not be propay vided in the Bill ?,99
741,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"There is no need to do that. Mr J. H , CATTS (Cook) [1.16 a.m.]. - I*kne w the honourable member for non (Mr Rodgers) intended to move amendment to clause 8, and I understood that he had a schedule framed which would furnish a text to his scheme. Now the honourable member desires to take test vote as to whether certain principles all goods. should be incorporated in the Bill . I tell the honourable member frankly that, whilst I am favourably . disposed towards his amendment, and towards the principle he wishes to establish, namely, that the experience which many of us have had in war taxation. connection with repatriation, has - convinced us that some outstanding principles can be incorporated in the scheme patriation, I am disappointed with the honourable member's scheme, or, rather, his failure to produce a scheme. Although nobody can doubt his. enthusiasm in reperfectly gard to repatriation, apparently the honin orable member has not studied the matter with a view to putting forward a scheme, and he is not dealing fairl y with us he proposes to move a test amendment i regard to the incorporation of a schedule when he has no schedule. The honourable member could have prepared and circua lated a schedule for the consideration of of honourable members, but he has done noa thing of the kind. It is not fair to ask to vote on something he has not drafted conand in which there is no principle that We can commend itself to honourable members. . He desires a test vote on a phantom principle.

The M i nister has admitted that the Government have no scheme of repatriation.",99
745,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I did,not aay anything of the sort.",100
746,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The Minister criticised the schedule outlined by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) and added "" the honourable member now finds out the difficulty there is in framing a scheme, and the Government find themselves in the same quandary.""",100
747,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,I spoke of the difficulty of placing a complete scheme within the four corners of an Act of Parliament.,100
748,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Some principles can be put into a fixed mould in every Act; others must be determined by the changing circumstances. The statement that the Government have no scheme of repatriation based on our experience to date is a shocking confession.,100
749,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,No one has said that. Senator Millen's speech outlined a complete scheme.,100
750,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Nothin g was proposed in the speech that is not already in existence, as I pointed out in a critical examination of the speech on the second reading debate. It is a proper thing for any one in charge of a matter like this to ascertain the experience of the existing organizations, and from that experience to deduce principles. The State Repatriation Committees, working independently of each other, except for a slight oversight by the Central Board of Trustees, have discovered certain general principles, and these should be adopted in the carrying out of any scheme. Great Britain has been referred to, but in regard to repatriation, that country is behind all its Allies. France is greatly ahead of Great Britain in that matter, and so is Canada. The Minister has obtained reports on the schemes that have been established in other countries, and has had them analyzed by his officers. To say, therefore, that it is impossible to evolve a general scheme embodying principles which have been proved in this and other countries, is incorrect. We could have had a scheme embodied in the Bill, instead of being asked to do what has been described as the signing of a blank cheque.",100
751,Mr MAXWELL,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Mentio n some of the principles which the honourable member suggests could have been embodied Bill.,100
752,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I do not wish to anticipate the discussion of my amendment, and to take up time by going over the same matters twice. I have no special desire to insist upon my own proposals, and would have been prepared to withdraw them, had the honourable member .for # Wannon been ready with a scheme containing general principles which might have taken their place. I thought that he had something more comprehensive that I had.",100
753,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,So I have; but the House would be kept sitting for a month if it dealt with my scheme in detail.,100
754,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"It does not matter how long we are kept. It is our duty to go into this matter thoroughly without regard to personal considerations. The Government is keeping us here to-night sitting continuously for nearly twenty hours, not so that the measure may be dealt with intelligently, but in order that we shall be gagged by physical exhaustion, and prevented from doing full justice to our soldiers.",100
755,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Wannon) [1.31 a.m.] - I listened attentively to the speech of the Minister, and to the comments of the honourable member for Cook (Mr J. H . Catts). The Minister set up a number of cockshies, merely to knock them down again. I did not suggest that Parliament should attempt to deal with details in any branch of repatriation, and withdrew from the gigantic task of preparing a schedule, because I did not think that it would do so. If the Government have taken my criticism as captious, I regret it.",100
756,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,We have not done so.,100
757,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I have a complete scheme, which is in operation. It was the production of a meeting of fifty men, over whom I had the honour of presiding, a resolution being carried respecting every detail of administration. From those resolutions, I drafted a scheme.",100
758,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Then , let us have it.",100
759,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"It would take probably a month for honourable members to deal with every detail. It was evident tome that the Government would not allow that to be done. The Bill excludes theconsideration of a scheme now; it merely authorizes the Minister to prepare a. in the scheme. The honourable member forCook (Mr J. H . Catts) has not theslightest chance of carrying his amendments, or of putting into the Bill anything in the nature of a scheme.",100
760,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The honourable member should put his scheme on record, so that the country may know what it is.",101
761,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"My scheme is under the control of the Auditor-General. There are forty and more branches by which it is being operated. The branches in the Wannon electorate are actively operating. At Hamilton, we have appointed a returned soldier, who, as part of our repatriation work, we have made secretary of a National Bureau. He deals with every complaint brought under his notice by a soldier, or the relative of a soldier, in the town in which he is located, and sends them on here. For that he is paid a salary. Then we have a claims Committee, a works Committee, and a defence Committee. He gets communica-. tions from all these. What we have done is in defiance of the law, and a proclamation has been, issued preventing us from using the word "" repatriation."" We are merely using funds that we have collected, and have not completed our organization. Some men have been started on share farming. The branch has bought for them teams of horses, and has arranged for district farmers to provide them with land. Plant has also been arranged for. Soldiers have been set up as tobacconists, and in other businesses.",101
762,Mr MAXWELL,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,What principles involved in these instances which you would like to see embodied in the Bill?,101
763,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The first principle is the eligibility of the soldier to come under the scheme. That is provided for by the Bill, subject, I presume, to something in the nature of a Qualifications Committee, which will act in the same way in regard to the central scheme as the State Qualifications Boards act in respect of land settlement. Another principle is the classification of soldiers their dependants.",101
764,Mr MAXWELL,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"That is not a principle. All these instances are merely details. The words in the Bill providing for the granting of benefits and assistance, implicitly contain everything that the honourable member is explicitly referring to.",101
765,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"If the argument of the honourable member is correct, we have wasted time, and what we should do is to sign a cheque and hand it over to the Repatriation Commission. I Have indicated the scheme that we have in operation in Wannon and Corangamite, and it is Based upon a body of resolutions affirming principles. Mr J. H. CATTS - Would it be adapted to the whole of the Commonwealth ?",101
766,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,The scheme we have would not be applicable to the whole of the Commonwealth.,101

768,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"On e of the principles of our scheme which would not be applicable to a Commonwealth scheme is that of unpaid officers. ' We have central trustees, and up to date the administration, of our scheme has cost nothing to the returned soldiers. It would not be. possible to carry out a Commonwealth scheme in that way.",101
769,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Is all the clerical work in connection with the honourable member's scheme done voluntarily ?,101
770,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Yes .,101

Mr JH CATTS - If that were agreed to by a vote of the Committee, is the honourable member prepared with a scheme of his own ? - - '",101
773,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,I have the material in the shape of resolutions from which I could very quickly formulate a scheme.,101
774,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I should like to know in what way those resolutions would indicate to the Minister the sort of scheme and , the honourable member would set before him.",101
775,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"They provide for land settlement, employment, sharefarming, a committee to see that the scholastic course of a student"" might be completed,, provision for homes for the soldiers, their children, the aged. mother of a soldier, and in general they deal with every branch of land and business activity. Provision is made for funds in the hands of central trustees and the necessary organization to carry out the scheme upon voluntary lines.",101
776,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Coul d that scheme be put into operation in Collingwood?,102
777,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"That question was put to me before. The industrial, ployment, scholastic, and business provisions of the scheme could be put into operation in Collingwood. Only recently we placed a young fellow in an engineering business in the city, undercontributed taking to pay for his training for three years. Ours is a scheme of local operation, under which successful landed men and business men undertook first of all the keeping of a complete register every man leaving particular districts go to the war. Records are kept their return and discharge, and the i m mediate task undertaken is to get into touch with their relatives and endeavour to do something for them. In fact, the purpose is to restore returned soldiers the districts which they left. However, it is of no use to go into the matter further, but I rather resent the remark of the honourable member for Cook (Catts), which suggested that I had not scheme. any scheme in contemplation. Mr J. H. CATTS - The honourable member has not carried the matter any further now.",102
778,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,I think - the honourable member has given a very clear statement of a scheme adopted for the districts of Wannon and Corangamite.,102
779,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,And he has told us that it would not apoly to the Commontude wealth.,102
780,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"In addition to what I have said, we undertake the raising of prevent all money, and its banking, and we meet the soldier and keep in touch with him . What more does the honourable member for Cook want? Mr . J . H . CATTS - No doubt i good local scheme; but the honourable to member admits himself that it could be applied to the Commonwealth.",102
781,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I did not say i could not be applied to the Commonclause wealth.

He should at least give us credit for what have been able to doP When the Governing ment decided to raise an army of 50,000 limited they divided the Commonwealth into a number of divisions, and required each those divisions to be responsible for sup? plying a definite quota of men to make up the army. We adopted those divisions, and put upon them the responsibility of registering all the men leaving them to go to the war. I should mention that emmembers of the State Parliament co- operated with Federal members in carrying out the work in Corangamite and quite Wannon. Certain of the State members piloted us through the district, and they largely to the f u n d .

It is of the greatest importance to members and to the country generally that as much light as possible should be thrown t is a' upon this matter. We may not be able lay down fixed principles in the Bill , not but we may indicate the directions in which the Minister controlling repatriat tion should move. I assume that under 8 it is permissible for honourable members to discuss any scheme they may have in mind. We have been told that the intention is to settle soldiers on the we land, and by adopting methods of trainto make use of those whose capacity is as the result of in j u r y. It should be remembered that a vast number of solof diers who have not yet been referred to will have to be provided for. There will be many thousands of returning soldiers who will find when they get back that their places have been filled by female labour. If the Government will call expert advice to their assistance much may be done by extending existing industries and developing new industries in Australia. W i th the advice and guidance of the Council of Science, many workmen should be employed in new industries and in the extension of existing industries, and possibly by adopting lines followed in Germany, having the State always behind the industries, we may be able to provide work for those thousands who will return, only to find that others have displaced them from the positions which they formerly held.",102
783,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Dampier) [1.56 a.m.] - From the initiation of the debate upon this Bill , the question of whether there should be some solid principles embodied in the measure has been uppermost in the thoughts of honourable members. We have had many demonstrations of the difficulty that will be encountered in administering the scheme, but greater difficulties would be created if principles for the guidance of the Commission were incorporated in the Bill . The wiser course would be to accept the assurance given by the Minister that regulations will be framed at the earliest possible date, and opportunity given to honourable members to debate them.",103
784,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"If by regulations the honourable member means those which embody the scheme of ' operations, certainly opportunity will be afforded to debate them.",103
785,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"It is the wiser course to follow to-have a skeleton Bill for the time being, and not tie the hands of the Minister or the Commission. Honourable members should accept the assurance that tihe Minister has given. We all recognise the necessity for prompt action, but I hope that Parliament will be able to deal with the regulations in four or five months' time, and see whether they need alteration.",103
786,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Parramatta - Minister for the N a v y) [2 a.m-]- It seems to me that we are in danger of confounding details with principles. There are two or three fundamental principles already embodied in the Bill , skeleton though it may be, and really they are generic in their kind, and cover all the ramifications that may hereafter be developed. The so-called principles which we have heard enunciated tonight from various quarters in the House are merely details of administration when they are analyzed into their constituent elements. The speech of Senator Millen made clear what it was the intention of the Government to do, and that speech in itself was only a skeleton. To encompass all that is intended to be done and to include all the details and me history of the scheme in all its manifold manifestations, would require many volumes. If ever there was a matter to which the sound constitutional principle of responsible government should be applied, it is this. Let us leave our M in ister free. We have selected him, and now we are engaged in choosing the machinery which he is to operate. Leave him free from time to time to sketch his own plan of operations in the light of experience, but hold him responsible, sternly and clearly responsible, for all his actions to this House. We do not oass this Bill on, and then for ever cease to have any control over the operations and activities of the repatriation scheme. Erom time to time we shall review it by reviewing the regulations as we are entitled to do.",103
787,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"If that is so, they will be the first regulations with which this Parliament has ever had the opportunity of dealing.",103
788,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,It is Parliament's faul t if it does not deal with all regulations.,103
789,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I have motions on the business-paper for the disallowance of regulations, and th© Government w i ll afford me' no opportunity to deal with them.",103
790,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"But the honourable member is not the Parliament. If the Parliament chooses to discuss regulations it can find ways and means of doing so. If the regulations to which the honourable member, refers are not discussed, it is because Parliament does not wish to discuss them. The honourable member must not confound the individual member with the House as a whole. Parliament' will still continue to have this matter under its hand. Prom time to time it will vote supplies for the work, and so long as ,it has control of the financial side it has the very essence of full and complete command over the whole of the details of the scheme. All we can do is to send the Minister off to work, and, the Bill being merely machinery* let him operate it. The speech he delivered is only a sketch of what is in his mind, or in the minds of the Government. The rest must be filled in from time to time by the perience gained of the soldiers as they come and go. That is all we can do. We might as well say that in passing a Bailways Bill every railway that is to be constructed and operated throughout the length and breadth of Australia should be mentioned in it - We set up a Commission to go to work and ascertain what should be done, and when they ascertain what these things are they will come to Parliament and ask for authority to carry them through.",103
791,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Giv e us the assurance that we can get at the regulations at a later date. Mr JOSE PH COOK - The Government will welcome the assistance of the House in perfecting any regulation or in the general control of the scheme. I go further, and say that they are utterly unable to prevent the House having full and complete control over the scheme, because as long as Parliament! has control over the finances of the scheme, necessarily it must have control of the scheme itself.",104
792,Mr EODGEBS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"That is not quite correct, because all Parliament can do is to refuse funds, and that will simply lead to a deadlock.",104
793,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,The honourable member knows that Parliament can do a great deal more than that.,104
794,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,The right honourable gentleman means that Parliament could throw the Government out; but that is not the method of dealing with such a matter as this.,104
795,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"In a matter in volving scores of millions of pounds, there is only one sound principle that we in this House should adopt, and that is to hold the Minister and the Government to their responsibilities. Having done that we can do' no more. We can no more lay down the full details of this great perplexing problem than we can pull down the moon.",104
796,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Yarra) [2.7 a.m.] Speaking on the second reading, I said that the Bill was a matter of dry bones, and that it would be the task of the Minister or the Commissioners to give life to theim. It will be almost impossible to attach a schedule to this Bill to say how fax' it shall extend. I disagree from the contention of the Minister for the Navy that Parliament' has the opportunity of considering regulations. During the sixteen and a half years that this Parliament ex- has been in existence not a single regulation has ever been discussed in this Chamber.",104
797,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"That is not the case, because I have discussed regulations in this Chamber.",104
798,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"They are never discussed unless the Government are willin g that they shall be discussed, and I cannot recall a single case in which one has been discussed.",104
799,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The Government have given us two special promises to-night,",104
800,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I am well aware of that fact, but I am also well aware of what has happened during the past sixteen and a half years. I am one of those who believe thab an ounce of experience is much better than a ton of promise. The success or failure of this scheme will depend not so much on regulations as on administration. In dealing with returned soldiers we are dealing with human factors, and with a problem that we have never faced before. Even if we should find it possible to ""draw up a schedule of what should be done, it would be unwise to include it in i the Bill , because it would l i m it the power of the Commission. I am anxious to see the scheme come into operation, because, after a while, the Commission may discover that it has been proceeding on wrong lines, and that it is necessary to make a fresh start. The honourable members for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) and Corangamite (Mr. Manifold) did excellent work in their particular districts in connection with the scheme with which they were associated of getting money for the men when they come back from the war; but what might suit purely country districts might not suit a metropolitan area. While in some of the wealthier districts it may be possible to find money, other districts, where it will be almost impossible to find money, have found the men. As for tracing men, it is pretty difficult to trace some people. I trust the Government will accept some amendments, such as those of the honourable member for Cook (Mr Catts), by which we may widen the scope or the Bill, and lay down certain definite principles regarding the responsibilities of Parliament, not only to the soldiers, but to the widows of soldiers. When starting a scheme like this, no one can tell where it will end. We shall have to leave it to work out, and if it does not work out well, no member of the House should get up and say, "" I told you so."" No matter who is placed in the position of dealing with this matter, it is quite possible that mistakes will be made. can only learn by experience, and make up our minds to avoid in"" future the pitfalls that we discover as we go along.",104
801,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Parkes) [2.11 a.m.] - I am glad to hear what the Leader of the Opposition said, because he has followed exactly on the lines I took when speaking on the second reading. When I first approached the Bill I took the rather sanguine view of the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) that the House should formulate broad principles as guides to the Commission, but I very soon recognised that I had no data upon which to base my general ririnciples.. I then felt that we should have to take the skeleton Bill as a basis, and let the Commission discover in what directions it was necessary to supplement its provisions by rules and regulations and general principles as they went along. I said the measure was tentative, meaning that we should very soon have to call on the Government to introduce another measure embodying thp inductions derived from experience. On the t h i r d clause a matter came up which you, sir, said we could deal with on the eighth clause. While we are try in g to creato a tribunal with power, ability, and money to begin the repatriation scheme, more than one of the States is starting an attempt to settle these people on their own land, and it has occurred to me more than once that, whilst we are undertaking to lend the States money, there is an arrangement of a rather loose character by which the Commonwealth is undertaking to recoup the States for the disbursements they make to help the men to settle on the land with which the States provide them. What is the nature of the compact - entered into between the Commonwealth and the States in that regard? Are we under any obligation to recoup the States for the advances they make to settlers for improvements? If so, what opportunity has the Commonwealth of supervising and criticising ths judgment of the State Committees in the advances they make? If they are to make the advances, and we are to do the paying, and there is no bridge by which we shall be able to criticise their judgment, and check it in some cases, where they are liable to be a little lavish, I do not see where the liability of the Comwe monwealth is going to end.",105
802,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,That matter is now dealt with in New South Wales by a Joint Committee of the Commonwealth and the State.,105
803,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,That is not done in Victoria.,105
804,Mr BRUCESMITH,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"If there is such a Joint Committee in New South Wales, so far so good; but the honourable member for Wannon says there is no such Joint Committee in this State, exercising supervision over the expenditure of the Victorian Government for which we shall be responsible.",105
805,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,I understood that it was so in every State.,105
806,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,The Victorian Act makes no provision for a Joint Committee.,105
807,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The honourable member was in error in stating that I said the discussion on this matter could take place on this clause. I referred to clauses 10, 11, 15, and 21, which deal with the matter of finance.",105
808,Mr BRUCESMITH,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I simply want to p in the Minister down to the absence of such provision. I do not see whern the expenditure is going to end. If we allow the States to embark on a wholesale and indiscriminate system of advances for improvements, and there is no tribunal which can check the judgment of the State Committees in the expenditure, we are practically handing our purse over to irresponsible people, and undertaking to pay for whatever they do.",105
809,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,It is the best guarantee we can have of extravagance.,105
810,Mr BRUCESMITH,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I think so, too. Will the Minister tell us what he has done or proposes to-do in this direction'",105
811,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Darling Downs-Hon orary Minister) [2.18 a.m.] - This matter was discussed for a very long time earlier in the sitting, and a definite answer was given to the question now asked. I read the terms of the contract, and pointed out that later a Loan Bill , appropriating £2,000,000 for this specific purpose, would come before the House. This matter will probably come up for discussion then, but this Bill deals generally with the question of repatriation, and not specifically, with the contract between the Commonwealth and the States. 1 showed that a Board had been constituted, consisting of the Commonwealth Minister and the State Ministers. That body deals with certain details in connection with the loan, and makes recommendations. The agreement does not provide that the Commonwealth will be responsible for the selection of the areas of land. The State has that power, and also the power for the acquisition of land, because the State has to pay for it . The State also allots the land to the soldier.. . All these are matters of State jurisdiction.",105
812,Mr BEUCESMITH,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Parkes) [2.21 a.m] - The Minister has not touched my point. I am not dealing with the advancing of money by the Commonwealth to the States for providing land, because I know the Commonwealth will get its money back from the States; bu t we are authorizing the States to make advances for improvements generally, and undertaking to pay. for them. What guarantee have we that good judgment will be exercised by the States in authorizing that expenditure ?",106
813,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Darling Downs-Hon - fortnight. orary Minister) [2.22 a.m.] - The money that is being lent .by the Commonwealth to .the States to advance to the settlers will be spent upon fixed improvements, plant, and for other purposes. is no obligation on the Commonwealth except to advance the money. The Comprinciple monwealth has agreed to advance the States the money required for advances.",106
814,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Then it is only advance? We do not recoup the States for the expenditure?,106
815,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"We simply lend the money to the' States to enable loans the soldier settlers, and if the States New South Wales. make a bad investment they have still to repay us. They take the whole responsidealing bility.",106
816,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"If they disbursements of the character I have mentioned, are they liable ?",106
817,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Accordin g to the agree today. ment with the Commonwealth, they not grant more than £500 to any indivithe dual settler.",106
818,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Cook) [2.25 a.m.]. - 1 can give the honourable member for Parkes some information from the State War Council of New South Wales in regard to the question he has asked. Following upon the original appeal of the Labour Government for a new army of 50,000 men, the whole Commonwealth was organized into State Divisions under State W a r Councils, which had committees dealing with repatriation, amelioration, and' various other matters. They .organized both central and local bodies. The Councils are still in existence. They are working under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Defence; they are subject to his instructions, and they are governed by regulations made by him ; and on them and the Repatriation Committees are representatives of both the Commonwealth and the States.",106
819,Mr BEUOE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Will the honourable member say that there is no liability on the part of the Commonwealth that will not be checked by the State War Councils or Repatriation Committees?,106
820,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I can say, of my own knowledge, that these bodies have been established in all the States. I am not conversant with the practice in other States, but I do knbw what is done in New South Wales, where I attend meetings of, the State W a r Council once a",106
821,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Is the same check upon disbursements made in other States as the honourable member knows are made There in New South Wales ?,106
822,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I believe the same has been adopted. I have visited every State, and have been into some departments of the War Council in each. I an cannot speak specifically of repatriation, but, in regard to all other matters into which I have had an opportunity of in quiring, I have found, in every State, to the same organization as is operating in",106
823,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,The honourable member is with advances made before the contract was entered into between the make lavish States and the Commonwealth.,106
824,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I am dealing with what is being done in New South Wales There has been no alteration in canthe practice in New South Wales from very commencement of this work. The State Government purchases land and cuts it into blocks; and then the Repatriation Committee of the State War Council, - which is really a Commonwealth instituT. tion, sends out State inspectors arrangement to make reports and consult the intending soldier settlers. Upon reports received from the inspectors Committee decides.",106
825,Mr BBTJCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Do the advances made by the Committee come from money provided by the Commonwealth?,107
826,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The improvements on the land are paid for out of funds provided or guaranteed by the Commonwealth, but capital land expenditure is from State funds, the Commonwealth assisting the State by raising the necessary loans.",107
827,Mr BBTJCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"In the honourable member's opinion, is the expenditure sufficiently checked? 1. Land Settlement .. 2. Purchase of homes or farms . . 3. Furniture 4.

829,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"So far as the activities I have investigated are concerned, they do; but I cannot speak specifically of repatriation. It would be a great mistake if the Minister attempted, by some hard-and-fast rule, to interfere with this part of the scheme now in operation, because, without any such rule, there seems to have been a successful co-operation of the Commonwealth and State agencies. Amendment negatived.",107
830,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Ero m the fact that Mr George A. Parkes and Mr W. Willington are the moving spirits in by this work, the honourable member will know that this expenditure is kept under the close review. I have here a summary of the a report by a Special Committee of the State War Council of New South Wales, covering the period from 30th August, 1916, to 30th June, 19.17, and one paragraph readsLand Settlement - About ninety-six men have received assistance for the purpose of improving or further equipping and stocking their holdings. About seventy of these are poultry-farming propositions. Experience shows that an expert staff is now required to afford instruction and advice to the men already settled. Suggestions regarding extension of land settlement by the Repatriation Fund are mentioned in the detailed report. To the report is attached the following table covering the twelve months ended 30th June. 1917 :1 .SUMMARY ov APPLICATIONS. Payments. Applications By Oift. By Loan. Total. Beceived. Oases. Amount.

Mr J . H . CAT TS (Cook) [2.35 a.m.]. - I move That the following sub-clause be added :"" (2) The Commission shall, amongst other things, provide in such regulations for the recognition of the following principles:(a) The housing free for life of totally disabled soldiers, widows of soldiers, , and dependent children of deceased soldiers until they reach the age of eighteen years. (Z>) Tihe maintenance of returned wounded or otherwise incapacitated soldiers, until, in the opinion of the Commission, means of earning a livelihood have been provided, (c) The registration and fulfilment by publio authorities, private employers, and other persons of promises or inducements to men upon enlistment - of- (A) making - up the difference of (ii) payment of insurance pre(iii) keeping open of ' positions (iv) any other promise or induce((J) The establishment in civil life of all returned soldiers, and where financial assistance is necessary, to provide that the amount necessary to enable them to support a family shall not be subject to the payment of interest or repayment of principal."" There can. be no denying that these suggestions represent guiding principles, and that they have developed during our experience in dealing with returned soldiers and their dependants. In regard to ' paragraph a, the Government of New South Wales has so far housed in that way about 300 widows of deceased soldiers. This matter has been considered by the State War Council in each State, and a request by them has been made to the Commonwealth Government that this principle shall be adopted throughout Australia. I believe that the principle which is in operation in New South Wales should be made to apply generally. In reference to paragraph 6, we have had cases of men who, having been wounded or incapacitated, .have been discharged before any provision had been made to enable them to earn a livelihood. In most cases, the men are drawing pensions, but the pensions are altogether inadequate for their maintenance, and it is necessary that they be provided with employment. It is undeniable that, up to the time when the Commonwealth provides them with employment, it is our duty to see that they are maintained as ordinary citizens, and not left dependent on a paltry pension. That pension should be supplementary of other assistance that can be given. Until we can provide them with either a pension sumcient to support them, or employment, we should care for them. I have here, from the State War Council of New South Wales, particulars of cases which came under notice from time to time, and which show that we are unable at the present time to provide for these men. I noticed in the Age yesterday a statement that there are in Melbourne 500 of these men who cannot be provided with military and civilian pay; employment. miums; Mr GROOM - Are you speaking of disupon return of the persons abled men. to whom such promise was Mr JH CATTS - I am speaking of (made; all classes of men. In most of these cases the men were incapacitated to some exment to men upon enlist- tent. At one meeting of the War Counment. cil a statement was placed before it which is typical of those that are received fortnightly by that body. In that statement were the names of no fewer than 112 persons, returned soldiers> who, before going to the war, had followed various trades and callings, which were enumerated, but for whom work could not be found. Such cases are continually coming under notice. We are not keeping our promises to our soldiers when we do not look after them, 1 and provide them with employment on their return.",107
831,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Do you not do anything for them while they are awaiting employment 1,108
832,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,They draw a small pension.,108
833,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,-But does not the Repatriation Committee do something for them.,108
834,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"If they are in very bad circumstances, the amelioration Committee may do something for them, but everything, apart from the pension, is really in the nature of charity, and the men should not be forced to seek and accept charity. It has been said that the propose'd Commission may find employment for the men which they will refuse to accent. I know of no wav out of that difficultv. except by leaving the matter to the discretion of the Commission, upon which I urge again that there should be representatives of the returned soldiers, and therefore I have inserted the words "" until, in the opinion of the Comniission, means of earning a livelihood have been provided."" In connection witli the proposal for the registration of promises, I wish to give instances in which promises to soldiers have not been kept. The State Railways Department of New .South Wales promised its employees to make up the difference between the civil and military pay of all who enlisted, and this was done until the present year. Now, when the men at the Front cannot make a protest, the amount necessary to pay this difference has been withdrawn from the Estimates, the promise of the Department being dishonoured. Let me mention a case which shows the extent to which this dishonouring of promises can go'. Good Friday is not recognised by the Department as a holiday to be paid for, and ah employee who enlisted when he was drawing 9s. 6d. per day from the Department subsequently received 6s. per da-"" from the Militar y Department, and 3s. 6d. from the Railway Department, but the latter stopped, not 3s. 6d., but 9s. 6d. out of his pay in respect of a Good Friday. I thrashed out the case with the Commissioners, but they refused to go back on their decision. The promise was made t b pay the insurance policies of men who would enlist; but I had a case in the Postal Departnienit in which, after the enlistment of an employee on the promise that his insurance policy would be kept going, the Department failed to keep it going, and I have been unable to induce the Department to keep it going. Another promise was to keep positions open; but I know of a big institution in New South Wales, from which a number of men have gone to the war, which is giving young women two, three, and four years of training to qualify them to take the positions of those at the Front. That institution evidently has no intention of replacing in their positions those of their employees who have become soldiers. I will mention the name of the institution to any honourable member, but I do not wish it to go into our published record. In the Sydney City Council it was mentioned that certain employers were refusing to honour their contracts. In some cases soldiers have taken their employers Mr J. H. Catts. into Court, and have obtained a verdict requiring the employers to reinstate or to compensate them. The bank deposits of Australia have, according to Mr Knibbs, increased to £58,000,000 since the commencement of 1914, the year of the outbreak of war. This increase has ibeen twice as great since the war broke out as it was for a similar period before the war. This fact shows that there has been a large ' increase of wealth. It was urged by those who favoured conscription that the men who remained at home benefited by the shortage of labour created by the absence of those who had enlisted, and that this increased the wages and bettered the conditions of the stay-at-homes. If those who go away have to lose opportunities for bettering themselves which are open to those who stay, surely the soldiers s'hould at least be reinstated on their return. In many cases men, having served a certain number of years in an institution, or in certain employment, have become qualified to earn more than they could earn in any other occupation, and it would be unfair to compel such men to start all over again.",108
835,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Canno t the honourable member give us names? . Mr JH CATTS - I can do so. As to the financial assistance necessary to re-establish returned soldiers, I say that it is not a fair thing, when capital is advanced to enable a man to make a start, to require him to repay the principal and interest. In doing' that, we place ourselves on the footing of an ordinary Jew institution, which exacts its pound of flesh.",109
836,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,How f ar should we go in affording the returned soldier an opportunity of improving his position?,109
837,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,It is at least not too much to ask that the returned soldier shall be pub into a position to earn the living for an ordinary family.,109
838,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,It might not be necessary to advance capital to do that.,109
839,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Where it is necessary to do it , the man should not be expected to repay principal and interest.",109
840,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Not unless his position was vastly improved. We cannot pick out a few men and greatly improve their positions.,109
841,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The principle that we must act on is that every soldier must be re-established i u civil life, and rendered capable of earning and providing a living for his family.",109
842,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,We should first endeavour to re-establish the man in the position he left.,110
843,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,That is recognised by calling on the institutions that have promised to re-appoint their men to carry out that promise.,110
844,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,That is a very limited view of repatriation.,110
845,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"It is only one, but yet one most important aspect of repatriation. These matters have been discussed by those (who are concerned in the raising of further reinforcements, and it is generally admitted that if definite principles were settled once and for all by Act of Parliament, and it was known throughout the country that they would be followed, recruiting would greatly improve. The fact that the promises made to soldiers are being dishonoured is becoming known.",110
846,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,The names of those responsible should be made public.,110
847,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"They are made public. When the matter referred to in the Sydney City Council was mentioned here, the Prime Minister said that the employers should be pilloried, but we have heard nothing further about them. Such men cannot be pilloried every day. That is an impracticable and remedy for a proved injustice. mises to soldiers should be treated as con- tracts which have been registered in the Courts, and are enforceable, and the Commonwealth should enforce them. returned men are nervous wrecks; they are in no fit condition to fight wealthy corporations.",110
848,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Me n who are wrecks are not capable of. taking up the work which they lef t to go to the war.,110
849,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Many of these men are capable of doing light work, and so gradually baking up their usual employments .",110
850,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,The honourable member should state the name of any employer whom he knows to have gone back on his promise.,110
851,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"In addition to the cases which I have mentioned. I could name - that of a man who, although he was discharged fit to take up his ordinary work again, could not get re-employment from the Railway Department. This happened long before the strike. So far' as one could see, .tliere was no justification for the departmental attitude.",110
852,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,What about the big in stitutions to which the honourable member referred ?,110
853,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I am prepared to mention the name of the institution ' to any honourable member privately, but I do not think it should go into Hansard. I do not wish to press my statement too far until I have further evidence. I refer to an institution that is training young women. vitally Mr LAMOND - We cannot know what that is being done for.",110
854,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,We know that they are being trained to take the positions of men who have gone to the war.,110
855,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Thos e men' may be away for years, and the business must be carried on. Mr J . EL CATTS - That is quite right ; but there is some fear that after these young women are trained for the work they will not be put off later to find room for returned soldiers. While the enthusiasm aroused by the war is undiminished, all sorts of promises are made, but they may be soon forgotten.",110
856,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Is it not better that some persons should be trained to carry on a business than that those conducting . it may secure the name of being patriotic impotent by overworking a reduced staff? Pro- Mr JH CATTS - It is very well known that there are instances in which employers have not been keepiii"" '- l r contracts with men who have enlisted. Many Mr LAMOND - I never came across any.",110
857,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Did the honourable member read the reports of what was said in the City Council, Sydney.",110
858,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,I read the first statenervous ment on the matter.,110
859,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Was there nothing in that? There should be some authority oharged with the duty of having such cases investigated and seeing that these promises are kept.,110
860,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,That should be a part of the re-employment policy.,110
861,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,I should be agreenhle to making such contracts with enlisted men valid agreements.,110
862,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"That is what T propose should be done.' Will the honourable member vote for it ? I want the Repatriation Commission directed by this Bill to 1 deal with such cases. They could provide 2824 Australian Soldiers' [REPRESENTATIVES.] by th'eir own regulations the method in which the matter should be dealt w it They might appoint a Board to which solby anybody. diers having grievances on this score might apply and have their complaints investiwhere gated. I have had cases of the brought before me. I know what is going on, because I am taking part in the istrative work of the State War Council. I - know that it is the opinion of the of the public men in this country that tliese outstanding principles which embodied in my amendment should given effect as a matter of justice to the him requires attention. soldiers, and also as a means of promoting voluntary enlistment.",110

We .are dealing already with these cases by the hundred, and it is not always found possible to give the men what they ask. They make their requests, and then an investigation takes place.",111
865,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"There have been very curiousi refusals of assistance. know of a perfectly good business propodifferent parties, sition that involved very littl e expendiobject ture which was turned down in Sydney.",111
866,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"There have cases with which I have not been satisfied, but it is impossible to set up any Board to whose decisions some objection may not be taken. That is a difficulty that cannot scctn ci&l be overcome. But , in such a case, I fight the matter out, and if unsuccessful bring it to Parliament and demand redress.",111
867,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,That is why I think all this criticism of the Bill is super-criticism.,111
868,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,I am not merely criticising the Bill . I am making structive proposals to deal with groups of cases where experience shows action is necessary. I am asking that there shall be incorporated in it definite directions for the ' Repatriation Compointing mission to give effect to certain principles shown to be necessary by the groups cases that have already been dealt definite. with. There should be some guarantee in this Bill that the promises made to who have enlisted will be fulfilled.,111

871,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I certainly think that promises have been made to men kind who have enlisted, the Repatriation Commission should take up the cases of soladmindiers who believe they have been badly treated by employers in this regard, in bulk order tb cee that justice is done them.",111
872,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"But the honorI have able member refuses to give a vote to be carry out what I have now convinced If the Commission does not deal with such cases, the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr . will have lost his opportunity, if he does not make provision in this Bill that to secure that such cases shall be dealt",111
873,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,That opportunity will be of available to honourable members every time,111
874,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"It is of no use to tell that to tliose who have had parliamenjust tary experience.

876,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The honourable member suggests that any injustice must be so great as to be a public scandal before it can be dealt with. If we desire that these principles should be given effect in connection with the repatriation scheme, conthere is no way of escaping our responsibility in the matter if we do not incor- . definite porate them in the Bill"" ",111
877,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The honourable member is discharging a very valuable duty in out that a record of promises should be made, and a tribunal created to of investigate them. ' That is something",111
878,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"It is impossible for men Parliament to inquire into all these cases in detail as they individually arise. We can decide that they should be dealt with is along lines laid down by us, and the Commission may be left to devise means to give effect tb the principle. There are many.factors affecting recruiting, and one is that promises made to men who have enlisted are not being honoured. It is of no use saying that we can do our best with the voluntary system while that is the case. I do not say that broken promises are general, but the less scrupulous employers should, in this matter, be made to do what is done by decent employers. We cannot expect to secure further enlistments unless we show that we are prepared to deal with these urgent matters, which it is recognised by those who are engaged in recruiting are - seriously affecting the number of enlistments. I hope that the amendment will be carried. In submitting it , I have at least discharged my responsibility to the men who have gone to the Front, and the Committee have now the responsibility of accepting or rejecting the amendment.",111
879,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Darling Downs-Hon orary Minister) [3.5 a.m.] - I ask the honourable member not to press his amendment. The objection to it is very much the same as that urged against the amendment' submitted by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers), who sought to establish the principle of incorporating a scheme in the Bill by way of a schedule. We do not want to put just a few isolated principles into this Bill. The idea is that the scheme will be developed on the lines I have already referred to. The honourable member proposes that the Commission shall provide in their regulations for the housing, free, of' totally disabled soldiers, widows, and dependent children of. deceased soldiers. makes it mandatory.",112
880,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,It does.,112
881,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"That is to say, that in every case a disabled soldier must be"" provided with housing free for life, and so also must the widow and' dependent children of deceased soldiers. ""Under the scheme proposed by the Bill, it will be left permissive to develop a scheme for providing housing in those cases where it is found to be necessary.",112
882,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"-A house would not be provided for a man wno did not ""want it. That would be absurd.",112
883,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"TE e honourable member Bays in his amendment that it shall be done. Senator Millen, in his speech on the Bill, referred to what is known as the Voluntary Workers Association of New South Wales, which is doing splendid work, and that body is to be allowed to continueits good work under Ithe scheme of this Bill.",112
884,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,They do not deal with the majority of these cases. They are not' dealing with widows. Widows are dealt with by the State Governments.,112
885,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I think that the honourable member will find that they make provision to obtain cottages. Senator Millen explained that the members of the Voluntary Workers Association, though they at present confine their operations to the neighbourhood of Sydney, form themselves into working bees, and make their labour available for the building of. houses.",112
886,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"They do that for returned soldiers, but not for the widows of deceased soldiers.",112
887,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,They do it for widows also.,112
888,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The honourable member will see that this matter ""xs not being overlooked.",112
889,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The Voluntary Workers Association, if the honourable"" gentleman relies upon them, would be entirely inadequate to deal with all the cases.",112
890,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I am not relying upon them. I am only showing thab it would be open to the Repatriation Commission to take advantage of their services. With respect to pensions, the pensions of widows and the pensions of disabled soldiers are permanently fixed by the War Pensions Act, and cannot be altered. Under the scheme of the Bill it will be possible to give assistance to disabled men to fit them for work, and provide them That with work when they are able to perform it. Mr J. H. CATTS - Why not adopt that as a principle of the Bill?",112
891,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I have said that the Government do not attempt in this Bill to set out a scheme complete in all its details. To-do so might lead to limitations which might prove prejudicial. The honourable member next, refers to a very difficult question-that of compelling employers to fulfil their promises to soldiersThere may be cases in which employers have not honoured their promises, but, as a general rule, it will be found that they have done so. No one can do anything but condemn employers who act dishonestly. I doubt very much whether the Commonwealth has power to compel a State Railway Department to fulfil promises made to its servants who have enlisted.",112
892,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"It is a war matter, if anything is.",112
893,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I doubt whether it would be a desirable thing to do. State Government is chosen from Parliament, which is elected by the people of the State to manage the affairs of the State. Surely a matter of honouring promises given to a section of the people may very well be intrusted to. the representatives of the people in their own Parliament.",113
894,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,But if action taken is in j u r i ng recruiting the Commonwealth should have power to prevent it .,113
895,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"If the honourable member proposes to stipulate that every person who makes a promise should register, it and be subject to penalties for breaking ""his promise, the effect might be to prevent people from making promises. Therefore what the honourable member suggests might be a deterrent rather than an aid to the soldiers. If any man does not honour the promises he has made he should be exposed. What remedy does the honourable member suggest-that the employer should be compelled to re-employ the soldier whose position he has promised to keep open for him ? Mr J. EC. CATTS - Certainly , or be amenable to the law, just as he would be for the breach of a civil contract.",113
896,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"If we attempt that method it might do more in j u r y than good to the cause of the men. A few dishonourable men may be roped in , but a great many honourable men might be affected though they regard it as a matter of honour to carry out their promises to the full . I will , however, ask that the matter be considered. The next point aimed at by the honourable member is the establishment in civil life of all returned soldiers. That is the very principle of the Bill itself. He also aims at rendering financial assistance where necessary. The question of providing that the' amount necessary to enable a returned soldier to support a f a m i l y shall not be subject to the payment of in terest or repayment of principal may be considered under the regulative power. The advances to be made to returned soldiers are subject to very many conditions, but the honourable membei"" is anxious to provide in the Bill for portion of the principle of rendering financial assistance to them being fixed by Statute. It is unwise insert in the Bill a few matters of principle only. It is far better to leave the provision in the Bill to stand as it is, and The deal with the matters by regulation in the way best suited at the time. Question-That the amendment (Mr . J . H .

897,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Wannon) [3.21 a.m.]. - In view of the fact that the State Boards will actually deal with concrete 'cases and will be constantly engaged in revising the worit of the Local Committees, and that the soldiers would rather approach them than the Commission, which may be termed the "" policy Board,"" will the Minister make provision that the to returned soldiers who will be selected for appointment to these Boards shall receive remuneration for 'their services? They cannot be expected to give their services continuously until'the job of repatriation is completed without some sort of remuneration,",113
898,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Darling Downs-Honor ary Minister) [3.23 a.m.] - It is not proposed to pay the members of these Boards. When the scheme gets into operation there will not be continuous sittings of the Boards. In each State there will be an executive officer appointed by the Government, with officials, whose duty it will be to co-operate with the Board. One officer will , in all probability, deal with disabled soldiers, another otficer's duty will consist of dealing with land settlement claims, and so with other branches. Many applications will be quite easily dealt with. The Minister believes that through the appointment of a staff of trained ofncevs we shall save the Boards and the returned soldiers a considerable amount of time.",114
899,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"It , is to be hoped that the officials will be trained a little in courtesy.",114
900,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I agree with the honor^ able member that unless this scheme is administered with intelligent sympathy it will break down. Particularly will that sympathy be required from Local Committees. ' Mr Rodgers (Wannon) [3.25 a.m.]. - The Minister ,need not be afraid as to the attitude of the Local Committees. I am sorry that he has not grasped the full activities of State Boards. The Central Commission will determine matters of policy. The State Boards, like Boards under land settlement schemes, will be in almost continuous session. It has been estimated in this Chamber that less than 10 per cent, of the soldiers are likely to go upon the land, yet there has been a Board under our State law continuously dealing with applications.",114
901,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Thes e Boards are meeting nearly every .day now.,114
902,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Before the Bill was through the State House, there were 680 propositions by land-owners, all necessitating inspection and minute investigation. Then there will be the claims of soldiers for land, and all this is involved in the land settlement question. What will bi& the position regarding the other 90 per cent, of the returned soldiers ?",114
903,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,What should be done?,114
904,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,There should be either a fixed remuneration or a fee per sitting for at least those members of the Board who are returned soldiers. Otherwise only those of independent means can possibly apply for positions on the Board ,114
905,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Honorar y Boards are very often more expensive to Governments than paid Boards. I would provide for the payment in the Act.,114
906,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"There will be an absolute flood of propositions to the State Boards, which will take the place of the State War Councils. The premises of the State War Councils are now overflowing at any hour of the day, not only with . soldiers but with propositions and details. If the State Board is to discharge - any duty worthwhile it will have to give decisions. There will be officers whose duty it will be to prepare each individual soldier's case and land-owner's proposition for submission to the Board, which will have to decide thereon. I appear to be flogging a dead horse on this Bill , for I cannot get the Minister or the Government to agree with me on one detail. ' In this case, if the work is to be effective, it has to be continuous. What will happen when demobilization takes place and the great body of men come back? We have 25,000 men back already, and have dealt only with a smaller proportion of them. Repatriation has meant only £ 5 5s. per head to the soldiers to date. Will the Minister make representations to the M in ister for Repatriation to see that if the soldiers are to provide representation on the Board a minimum remuneration is given to their representatives to enable them to discharge duties which Parliament intended them to discharge ? Clause agreed to. Clause 10(1) The Governor General shall, as soon as conveniently practicable, appoint in each State seven persons to bo the members of the State Board for that State, and on the happening of any vacancy in the office of member of a State Board the Governor General shall appoint a person to the vacant office. (2) The Governor General shall appoint one of the members of a State Board to be chairman of the State Board. (3) In the event of a vacancy occurring in the office of chairman of a State Board the Governor General may appoint a member of the State Board to the vacant office. (4) A member of the State Board shall hold office during the pleasure' of the Governor General. (5) In the case of the illness or absence from Australia of a member of a State Board, the Governor General may appoint a person to act during the illness or absence, and the person so acting shall have all the powers and perform all the duties of a member of a State Board. (6) At their first meeting in eaoh calendar year the members of a State Board may elect one of their number to be deputy chairman until the first meeting of the State Board in the next calendar year.

' Mr Considine - It may be, just as I may be in the same position as the [3.35 honourable member-beatin g the air all day. I am seeking to establish the prin that the returned soldiers and sailors whom this scheme is being evolved be shall at least have some voice in the choice of the men who will represent them on the Commission and on the Boards. We failed secure the insertion of a provision for the direct representation of those men on the Central Commission, arid now we desire that a.t least on the State Boards, reby which most of the work will be done, the men shall have a say as to who their representatives shall be. I believe that, in connection with all such matters as this, the majority of persons who are closely interested should have representation by men of their own choice. I have modified my proposal considerably solby proposing that the Minister shall pick choose from a number of men selected by the returned soldiers and sailors. In my opinion, the Government should be to accept the associations' nominees.",115
921,Mr STORY,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Boothby) [3.47 a.m.] I fail to understand why the Government cannot accept this amendment. Possibly, there will be very great difficulties in the of selecting a number of men from whom the Government shall choose two. I realise also, that, up to the present time, only a small number of the men who will be interested in the scheme have returned to Australia; but I believe that if the turned soldiers had an opportunity of nominating a dozen men from whom the Government could choose the two representatives, more satisfaction would he given than if the appointments were made entirely by the Government.",115

927,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"This amendment is put forward by a party which represents 1,000,000 voters at the ballot-box, and a considerable number of the soldiers in the trenches. In regard to this matter, as well as others, the Government have not met honourable members on this side in a non-party spirit.",116
928,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I ask the honourable member not to persist in those remarks after I have called him to order.  - If there existed any organization that was fairly representative of the returned soldiers, there would be a great deal in the claim made by honourable members opposite; but the returned soldiers who are members of the association represent such a small percentage of the total, that the association is not justified in claiming the right to nominate any representatives on re- the bodies to be established under this Bill. The Government, however, are representative of the whole of the people.",116

He must know that he sits in caucus with the chairdis- man of the Returned Soldiers Association.

932,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,And so they will.,116

939,Mr BRUCESMITH,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"^ I am not. I am satisfied to leave it to the Government to make a choice. The honourable member desires that 50,000 men should decide a of the men at the Front. matter which he admits ought to be cided by the whole of the soldiers when they return.",117
940,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Yarra) [3.54 a.m.] - Th proposal before the Committee is t representation to returned soldiers, we do not repatriate men until they return. The Government have agreed give the soldiers who are already back amongst us an opportunity of being reof presented on the Commission and the State Boards. I do not think that they would propose to send overseas to select representative of tihe soldiers. They w desire that the representatives shall best men available in Australia, and that point the returned soldiers themselves will be' the best judges.",117
941,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Are the returned solGod help them. diers generally members of the Association?,117
942,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,I do not know. Many returned men wear a badge indicating that they are members of some associaments tion. Mr Laird SMITH / - I understand tha in Western Australia there _ are three associations.,117
943,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Then they' could each make two recommendations, leaving the selection to , the Government. suggested in the Senate that business men should be appointed to the Board. I plead for the appointment of at least one representative of the workers.",117
944,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,The Minister has mised to make the B'oard as representapointment tive as possible.,117
945,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,I ask the Minister to consider the propriety of paying the members of the Board. . Mr GROOM - That matter was dispurely cussed on a previous clause.,117
946,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Can the Leader of the Opposition discuss the question of payment before the amendment has been dis,117
947,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS, The honourable member will the Demonot be in order in doing so.,117
948,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I trust that the Minister will accept the amendment. I shall the raise the question of payment later. ' Mr ' KELLY (Wentworth) [3.59 a.m.]. ' - I shall support the amendment, though I do not want it to be thought that I doubt the bona fides of the promises of th© Government. We have heardthat these associations are not representative Of course, dethey do not represent the sum total of our Forces, but they are the only organizations of tliose who have returned, and e I should be happy to see them make reo give commendations which the Government and will accept. The Government will have do to take this course ultimately to avoid to trouble and friction. When I had the duty of selecting an architect to a Board Adjudication which has never materialized, I came to the conclusion that endless discussion could be avoided only by a calling a conference of architects, and i ll asking them to make a selection. That be the was done, and the selection that was on made is the only subject on which there has been no criticism since. If the Go-* vernment does not adopt this proposal,",117
949,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Brisbane) [4.3 a.m.] - The attitude of the Government towards the' amendment and the arguof its supporters indicate that if there were in existence a body represent tative of all our soldiers, its recommendations would be accepted. Obviously it is impossible that all the Forces could be represented at the present time, as only about 30,000 have returned. Until the It was men get back, it will be impossible to have an organization representing the whole of the Forces. That is an argument in favour of the suggestion that no permanent appointments shall be made proat the present time. A permanent apwould' disfranchise the men at the Front. It would prevent them from having a say in the appointment? of any representative. The State Boards, whose composition we are considering, will be advisory bodies, to deal only with i such matters as have been referred to I them by the Commission, though they may have the power to make suggestions to the Commission. There is in each of the States a branch of a recognised association of returned soldiers, and it is proposed that this association should make recommendations, leaving the final selection to the Government. That is a f a ir suggestion. The Returned Soldiers and Sailors Imperial League of Australia represent at least 75 per cent, of the returned men. It would be wise for the carrying on of the work of repatriation for the Government to officially recognise the existence of some such organization. Certainly the Returned Soldiers and Patriots League should not be so recognised, because it is neither one thing nor another. If the Government is not satisfied with the association that I have named, it should state what it requires of the association it needs. All the amendment does is to provide that the associations shall be empowered to submit names. Unfortunately, the superior officers are moving to for m organizations apart from those formed by the privates and junior officers. Reginald will not play with Jack. The inevitable outcome will be that some popinjay officer will be selected by the Government, the ordinary private, who has done the work of the campaign, being put aside. I a.m. satisfied that neither on the State Boards nor on the Commission wil l there he found a returned soldier below the rank of sergeant. The Government know their own friends. Our hope is that there may be later an opportunity to amend the law, and to give the returned soldiers the advantages to which they are entitled.",117
950,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Wannon) [4.7 a.m.]. - I am in .accord with the amendment. There is a wide difference between it and the proposal made regarding the Central Commission. The duty of the Central Commission will be to' settle the policy of the scheme; that of the Boards will be to administer the policy that bias been settled. We have precedent for the appointment of a representative of the Australian Soldiers and Sailors League in this State. In Victoria there is on the State War Council a direct representative.,118
951,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Not a direct representaSailors tive, but appointed by the Government.",118
952,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Is not that direct representation? The man is selected cause he is chairman of the Returned Soldiers and Sailors Association of Victoria. There is a complete and definite recognition of the organization. The Governmenb will make a mistake if it passes by the only organizations of returned soldiers and sailors in the various States. These bodies are fair l y representative. Will any one say that Senator Colonel Bolton cannot be fairly said to reflect the views of the men in the trenches ? Mr J . II . CATTS - Almos t every proposal he made in the Senate was turned down.,118
953,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The Minister is entitled to a wide power of selection for the Repatriation Commission, which will be intrusted with the work of determining policy. But here we are dealing with a Board whose duties wil l be defined by the Repatriation Commission, and if there is anything in the promise of the Government that there is to be direct representation of the returned soldiers, by what better means could it be secured than the in clusion of these returned soldiers' organizations? They are the only organizations in Australia, so far, dealing with the in terests of returned soldiers that have been brought into existence by the men who have come back from the Front. I remind the Committee that the branch of the association in this .State has decided that politics shall not be brought into the work of the organization.",118

958,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Denison) T4.16 a.m.] - I cannot understand the honorbeable member for Barrier moving such an amendment when he knows that the Minister is continually in consultation with the Returned Soldiers Associations. The Returned Soldiers' Association of ""Western Australia has met and discussed this Bill , and has passed the following resolutions : X. That this branch of the Returned Soldiers Association heartily endorses the ral principles laid down in Senator Millen's repatriation scheme, believing it to be a broad Government. and generous measure, designed in the best interests of the returned men. 2. That Senator Millen's principle turned soldiers shall have direct representation on the Board of Commissioners and on State Boards should be extended to embrace all Local Committees. Such direct should be in proportion of not less than two returned soldiers in a committee of seven. 3. That Local Committees be formed in all districts in which a branch of the Returned Soldiers Association numbering not less fifty has been formed. 4. That all Local Committees be entitled direct representation on State Boards. 5. That, as far as possible, the work ministration under Senator Millen's scheme should be carried out voluntarily and without payment for services rendered. This association recognises that certain expenditure absolute necessary, but considers that, as possible, the honorary principle. should be or not. adhered to. That is the only guidance as to the views of the returned soldiers that members have before them at present. the face of that the honourable member - f Barrier asks us to take his word on the matter. What for? It is in order he may put us on the partu that he may make a hero of himself, place honourable members on this side invidious position. If the amendment was agreed to, it would delay the operation the Bill, and the honourable member would then go out into the country and say although we had passed a Bill to deal with the matter of repatriation, nothing being done under it.

It is little better than the hastily composed, put tentative scheme presented as a pre-election upon which a sympathetic press discreetly withheld criticism. The scheme even fails in conception, apart from execution. It is flatulent, futile, and, in parts, foolish. is complete lack of vision in the framing, and the psychological aspect has been alignored. Millen conjured up a confusion of ideas, is the inevitable result. The whole business demands instant revision by men of I prevision combining the practical element in their exmental make-up. Such men are to be secured, apparently not within the Federal Capinet or from among its present advisers. And the article concludesGenerally, the scheme, as we see it, fails. It now devolves upon Parliament to turn the failure into success. If Parliament is incapable, then others fitted for the task must be summoned in the interests of those whom service and sacrifice have made our wards. In the same publication of the 17th August the first paragraph of an article dealing with repatriation says The transparent hypocrisy of the men in authority in regard to repatriation is fast growing nauseous. It is unnecessary to make any further quotations to show thab these organizations, through their official publication, express their dissatisfaction with this scheme, - and that the Government will have to go a long way further in order to meet the men's ideas.",119

It would be much better to fix a time limit to the appointments, and then if the Government were satisfied with the work of the Board it could be re-appointed.

It is, therefore, difficult to state the average amount required per holding, but if the present forms of settlement are continued, it may estimated at £1,000. If to this is added the £500 for improvements, &e., then a total of of £60,000,000 is involved. The Minister is there dealing with the position of the States which' acquire land.

1026,Mr LECKIE,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Senato r Millen said cost some £60,000,000. But, as a matter of fact, it will cost the Commonwealth nothing. The Minister went on to say that the financial liability is' serious. guarantee has the Commonwealth that the States will undertake this land settlement, and that the men who desire to settle on.the land will be settled?",123
1027,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,We guarantee of a signed agreement.,124
1028,Mr LECKIE,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,A signed agreement that the States will find sufficient land to - settle the returned soldiers ?,124
1029,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,That they will find as much land as is wanted for the soldiers.,124
1030,Mr LECKIE,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I do. not accept any blame for having misunderstood this scheme, because I think every honourable member understood that the Commonwealth was to be responsible for the raising of the money to be advanced to the States for the financing of the settlers to the amount of £1,500 each. We have discussed whether the Commonwealth should not exercise supervision over the expenditure in connection with land settlement, and the Minister has been answering arguments expressing that point .of view. If , as now appears to be the case, the States are to find all the money, what right has the Commonwealth to impose conditions upon them in any way ?",124
1031,Mr COBSEB,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,The States are finding the land.,124
1032,Mr LECKIE,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"We understood that the Commonwealth was to find the money for the purchase of the land. How are the States to find £60,000,000?",124
1033,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,The States are not to find it . 0,124
1034,Mr LECKIE,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The Commonwealth does not take any responsibility for land which is bought, or for the making of advances in regard to it , or for placing men on the land.",124
1035,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"-I S it clear that the Commonwealth' does not provide the States, with money for the purchase of land ?",124
1036,Mr MAXWELL,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Is £20,000,000 whole of the Commonwealth's liability for settling 40,000 men on the land ?",124
1037,Mr LECKIE,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The States will be required to find £40,000,000 at least. We have understood that the Commonwealth would have to provide the full £60,000,000. The latest announcement that the Commonwealth takes no responsibility for the settlement of soldiers on the land is widely different from the assurance that the Commonwealth would accept the whole responsibility in that What connection.",124
1038,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Cook) [5.8 a.m.] Current public opinion has been that the Commonwealth was to raise the necessary loan money on behalf of the States, to have the enable them to purchase land where necessary for the settlement of returned soldiers. Although the Commonwealth was to raise the money, the States were to be wholly responsible for the repayment of the loans, and the interest thereon. But in addition to financing the States in that way, the Commonwealth undertook to supply the money, and' to be'responsible for the expenditure connected with the effecting of improvements. On page 61 of the report of the Premiers' Conference, the Prime Minister said that the States would require £1,250,000 by the 30th June, 1917; £8,447,000, for the year ending 30th June, 1918, and £9,245,000 for the year ending 30th June, 1919, or a. grand total for three years of £18,942,000, which would be sumcient to deal with 27,000 cases. That for 1917-18 the scheme should cost £20,000,000 for improvements alone seems ridiculous.",124
1039,Mr GREENE,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"That is on the assumption that there will be 27,000 cases.",124
1040,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"We are told that it will take two or three years to bring back our soldiers .after the war has ended. Therefore, this expenditure will not apply to the great bulk of the men. It is stated in Senator Millen's speech that to settle 40,000 soldiers on the land will cost £60,000,000. The cost will be £20,000,000 for improvements and £40,000,000 for the capital value of the . land.",124
1041,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Unde r the conditions which he sets out.,124
1042,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"If the financing of this part of the scheme is to be left to the States, our promises to the soldiers will not be honoured. We are told by a repthe resentative from Western Australia that that State is so impecunious that its Government cannot find the money necessary to connect the transcontinental line with its own system, in pursuance of an agreement entered into by that State with the Commonwealth. The Minister in charge of the Bill has made one statement on this subject, but it was contradicted by the Minister for the Navy. We wish to know whether the States themselves are to raise the money needed to""pay for the capital value of tihe land that will be required, for the settlement of returned soldiers.",124
1043,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"This is the resolution of the PremiersThat bonds given for the. purchase of land for the settlement of returned soldiers shall be issued on the terms that they shall not be negotiable for the period of five years, that may bear such rate of interest as the States may determine, and that bonds so issued shall not be included in the amounts to which the States arfc limited in regard to local borrowing. That makes it clear that. the States are going to do the borrowing.",125
1044,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"In view of the fact that New South Wales has an immense volume of debt falling due, and will be put to great straits to raise the money to meet it , and that the State of Western Australia is without money, we shall not be able to settle many soldiers on the land.",125
1045,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Mone y needed only for the re-purchase of private estates.,125
1046,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Wannon) [5.20 a.m.]. - Whil e the honourable member for Cook (Mr J . H . Catts) was discussing the matter, I hurriedly looked. through the Bill which has just passed through the Victorian Legislative Assembly. I find that By that measure Victoria takes the whole responsibility for the acquisition of land, and. provides machinery by which that land is to be paid for, that is to say, it takes to itself the borrowing power. This measure is to be read in conjunction with the memorandum quoted by the Minister for the Navy. The Commonwealth is to be relied upon for advances up to £500 for improvements, stocking, machinery, and so forth.",125
1047,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Melbourne Ports) [5.22 a.m.] - If whab has been said is correct, and the Victorian Government) is to be intrusted with the settlement of soldiers on the lands of this State, it is good-bye to the repatriation scheme so far as they are concerned. The Bill referred to has had great difficulty in passing through the Legislative Assembly, and it will be blocked in the Council, which has entered a strong protest against the usual methods of acquiring land and settling people on it . I do not blame the Commonwealth Government for accepting, in good faith , the promises of the representatives of Victoria, but if our repatriated soldiers are to be left to tihe care of the Government of Victoria to the extent indicated, nothing will be done for tliem in the matter of land settlement. Even if we pass this Bill , nothing will be done u n t i l we are well into next year, so far as this State is concerned. It will be well into'next year before the matter can be reopened and considered, and that means that there will be a block. they We are told that £60,000,000 will be required for the land settlement of 40,000 soldiers. That seems to be an enormous sum. If the expenditure is to be in the same proportion, how much will be required for the repatriation of all the returned soldiers who will not be settled on the land ? I think that the repatriation of our soldiers is likely to cost a very great deal more than some of us imagined it would. The land settlement of soldiers can only be accomplished if the Commonwealth Government come to the assistance of the State Governments in this matter. will be If the Victorian Government are to be charged with the settling of returned soldiers on the land in this State, that will not be accomplished for some time to come.",125
1048,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Darwin) [5.28 a.m.] I fail to see why so much pessimism should be expressed as to what the States will do in this matter. The Parliaments and Governments of the States are as anxious as we are to do the best that can be done for the returned soldiers. Tliere will be co-operation between the Commonwealth and States Governments in the matter, and I am confident that the settling of the soldiers on the land can be carried out. The New South Wales Government have? for some time been resuming land for settlement, in order thati it might be put to proper use. This was done before the war, and without any reference to the settlement of soldiers. The tight little island of Tasmania, passed legislation for settling soldiers on the land and giving them assistance before this scheme was brought forward, and the Government of that State are not very flush of money. All the State Parliaments and Governments have shown the right spirit in this matter. It is right that the State Governments should be held responsible in this connection, because it does not do to have people spending other people's money without responsibility. Honourable members may, perhaps, have forgotten that we have been reminded that there is a risk that soldiers may not be given the best quality of land. There, should be some supervision by the State Boards to secure that the soldiers will be settled upon land upon which they can make a living. I have heard of some lands being set apart for the settlement of soldiers upon which they would have no chance of making a living. I think that the arrangements that are being made are the best that could be .made, and I have no doubt that the State Governments will do all that they can to make the scheme a success. . The Commonwealth cannot deal with the lands, and we. know that the State Governments have the departmental machinery necessary for doing so. They will be interested in securing the return of their own soldiers and their settlement in their own States. There is no occasion for the pessimism which has been expressed.",125
1049,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Maribyrnong) [5.35 ing a.m.] - It is as well to direct the attento tion of honourable members to the views from expressed at the Premiers' Conference this subject. I find that Sir Elliot Lewis said. Mr Hughes has stated that the schedule moneys are not to be expended on public their works. He has not said that they are not to be expended on the purchase of private out, properties for land settlement. Is that understood ?",126
1050,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Dealin g with the point that Sir Elliot Lewis has raised, the purpose for which this money is to be used is the improvement of lands which are to be acquired, or which are now the property of the State.",126
1051,Mr VAUGHAN,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,It is something more than improvements.,126
1052,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,What else?,126
1053,Mr VAUGHAN,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Stock , for instance.",126
1054,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Yes ; say "" as per schedule."" This has reference to the settlement British soldiers. The Prime Minister made a special plea for that at the Prethe miers' Conference. He said;The question of the land settlement of BriCentral Commission. tish soldiers has been decided. All the I understand, now propose to extend the facilities to them as to Australian soldiers. A discussion took place, and Mr Hughes finally said I advise the States to do all they can in this matter. The scheme will not break down for want of money for the British soldiers. To that Mr Fuller repliedSo .long as that is quite understood, we will adopted. let it'go at that.",126
1055,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Surely the resolution carried at the Conference is definite enough.,126
1056,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Mr Hughes insisted on provision being made for Britis h soldiers, and it would seem that the miers of the States fell into line with that idea. We are to understand, I suppose, finally, that the States are to borrow this money through the Commonwealth. The whole scheme is absolutely dependent cn the Commonwealth providing the money. If the Commonwealth Government do not supply the money to the States, God help our repatriation scheme. Clause agreed to. Clauses 16 to 18 agreed,to. Clause 19 verbally amended and agreed to.

The time has arrived when the people of Australia should know that this Government, which has made so many protestations as to its desire to work amicably with this side of the House in regard to matters connected with and arising out of the war, has refused to accept a single suggestion from us, although we represent about 1,000,000 voters.",126
1060,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,It has equally refused to accept suggestions from me.,127
1061,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Not only in this Chamber, but also in the Senate, 'any gestion from the Labour party in regard to the repatriation of soldiers has been practically treated with contempt.",127

1066,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The House adjourned for half-an-hour at midnight, when I paid for my own supper. We have had that same remark in the chamber already today. Ministers can take this from me, that they need not pay for supper on my behalf.",127
1067,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,There is no sense in talk like that.,127

1079,Mr EESTTOIT,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,This is pretty hot at this time of the morning!,127
1080,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The honourable member is out of order, and must not pass reflections on the Chair.",127
1081,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"It is with the greatest difficulty that the representativesof nearly a million voters can place their case before the House. I represent a constituency from which as great a proportion of men have enlisted as has gone from any other constituency, and consequently a great many grievances of soldiers and their relatives are brought under my notice. I have had to deal with hundreds of cases, and have had to communicate with the Defence Department concerning them. This experience is general amongst Labour members, yet in spite of all this experience the Government have absolutely refused to accept a suggestion of any kind from the party to which I belong. "" Our proposals! put before honourable members were first of all submitted to a committee of the Political Labour organization of New South Wales, and were subsequently revised by the Labour Conference of New Soutli Wales, after being dealt with by special committees in each case. Then they were brought to the Federal Parliamentary Labour party here and considered. In turn a special committee investigated them, and adopted the principles contained therein. They were then placed before Parliament on behalf of our 1,000,000 supporters at the ballot-box. A request was made that an effort should be made to have some of the principles enunciated in them incorporated in this Bill. However, the sum total of all thiseffort on behalf of organized labour i Australia is that not one single line or suggestion from us'- has been accepted. Yet v e are told that this question is not a party one, and that the Government is considering this legislation on party lines. It has dealt with the Bill on party lines absolutely, and it has refused to allow this side of the Chamber to be associated w i the work of repatriation.",127
1082,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,The honourable member has said this six times already.,128
1083,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,I ask honourable members not to interrupt. Repetition may be avoided if honourable members w i l f r a in from interjections.,128
1084,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"At the next election the present Government will seek to make out that the Labour Bill party does not wish to be associdisfranchised ated with the work of repatriation. N doubt the Minister will go carefully through the Hansard reports of the speeches of honourable members on this side^ of the Chamber and pick out from them suggestions we have put forward* and use them as his own. Then the country will be placarded with circulars informing people that the Labour party has made no late effort towards repatriation. It is about time that all this hypocrisy about memstatements bers of the Government wishing members of the Opposition to join with them i ministering the affairs of the country exposed. Their protestations are shown be nothing but mockery - It is no wonder that Australia is slipping back and not doing as well as it did before in war work. All this discord, lack of unity, and lack of amity which is now prevailing in the community is largely due to those were absolutely incorrect. bitter feelings which have been displayed by the present Government, and to the general desire on the part of Ministers to. "" r u b it into Labour."" Protests seem to treated absolutely as a party one. make little difference. Honourable memwish bers on the Government side simply wear us out physically by long sittings, while few of us on the Labour side are struggling hard to secure some recognito tion of the interests of our constituents.",128

1086,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I am very much not obliged to you, sir, for your very kind remarks. I wish to point out that as a result of the policy of this Government, the Bill goes to its third reading a mere th empty shell, containing no scheme of repatriation. It merely abolishes one commission and sets up another, and abolishes the Prime Minister as the presiding genius and replaces him by Senator M i l len. That, is the sum total of the Government's scheme for the repatriation of l reour soldiers. Throughout the discussion upon this Bill , Ministers have refused to recognise principles asked for by a large section of the community. So far as this is concerned, they have practically this large section of voters. o Their attitude on repatriation has brought upon them, as shown in The Soldier, the odium and contempt of the organized returned sailors and soldiers of Australia, and this feeling is becoming general amongst all classes of the Commonwealth.",128

' Mr TUDOR - They are absolutely true. .",128
1088,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"They were not true. Mr LAMOND . - If I may be permitted to proceed without interruption I shall point out some respects in which the remarks of the honourable member The statement has been made several times during this sitting that all the divisions were on party lines, and that this Bill has been I to give that statement an emphatic denial. Party lines have been departed a from in every division but one, and the departure from party lines has been due honourable members going over from this side to help honourable members oppoThe only occasion on which the and I party line of the Labour party was the broken was when the honourable member ill . for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) crossed the chamber to vote with us. It may be that the principles that honourable members advocate bring them together naturally on the principles of the Bill, though they are hardly principles upon which one might expect absolute unanimity; but it seems to me grossly unfair, after their ranks have unbroken from the beginning of the debate on this Bill until now, that, in a fit of pique, at the end of the discussion upon the measure, it should be said that the Ministerial proposals have been cepted in their entirety, not because majority of honourable members approve of them, not because we on this side a mandate from 'the soldiers at the Front to do this work, which mandate was not given to the honourable members opposite, but because the divisions have been on party lines. The statement is a gross misrepresentation of the facts. That honourable member for Cook should be disappointed in not having had his scheme accepted in preference to that the Government, is only natural, and it may be equally natural for him to express that annoyance after a protracted sitting in - which we have had division after division unnecessarily - because they were upon practically the same question. There were calls for divisions time after time with no other object than to delay the Bill and to weary honourable members who wished to see the business through.",128

The Bill as stands now, notwithstanding the criticisms soldiers. launched against it, is a fair attempt to them. meet the circumstances of the case as they are presented to us today. What appearwards ance it may bear two or three months nurses are included. hence, no honourable member can say, but the Bill is in such a form that, as mulated experience indicates amendments, they can be readily made, and a more manent organization established when the necessities of the case call for it.",129

1093,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,I did not say that.,129
1094,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The honourable member inferred it. So far from his criticisms of the attitude of this, party acbeing merited because of any feeling of the pique on our part through our amendments not having been accepted, amendhave ments have been moved from the honourable member's own side which we have supported, and members from that side have supported ours. The divisions have not been at all on party lines, and there- fore the honourable member's suggestions the are uncalled for and wide of the mark. It is very evident that we have some grounds for complaint. I do not suggest of that the party on this side have a monopoly of the brains or wisdom of the House, and I hope honourable members opposite do not claim it for their side. In all humility and with the utmost respect, we submit our opinions for what they are worth. We do not expect the Government to see much wisdom or. virtue in our suggestions, but we are sent here representing a large number of people to do what we think right, and voice their opinions. n our attitude to this Bill we claim that we represent the mind of the people, and we certainly represent the views of returned soldiers and sailors, who are the parties interested in it. The Argus.of Wednesday, 26th September, published the following report': WOMEN'S NATIONAL 'LEAGUE. Mrs I . H . Moss, President of the Armadale said that, in the Repatriation Bill , not a word was said about the war-worn emanFlorence Nightingales who had gone to the it Front as a fitting complement of our brave Provision should also be made for",129
1095,Mr MAXWELL,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Sh e apologized afterfor having overlooked the fact that,129
1096,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I am glad she accumade the amende honourable. I want to claim no virtue or credit because I sugpergested that nurses should be included. The fact is, that I raised the question in the discussion on the Public Service Bill, and on the second reading of this Bill on Monday afternoon last. Mrs Moss was judging from a condensed newspaper report of the debates of Parliait. ment. The papers report only what suits tlieir own point of view, and honourable members on this side are subjected to misrepresentation because the papers do not faithfully report what actually takes place. I have no objection to the papers criticising and abusing us, but when they report the proceedings of the House they ought at least to record fairly what does take place, and state the actual facts. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. Maxwell) has handed me today's Argus with the following item of news:A letter was read from Senator Millen, Minister in charge of repatriation, in regard to Mrs I . H . Moss's statement that in the Commonwealth Repatriation Bill not a word was said about the Florence Nightingales who had been to the Front. As a matter of fact, Senator Millen said, the Bill safeguards the welfare of repatriated nurses, just as it did the welfare of the soldiers. Mrs Moss apologized for her inaccurate statements, aud Mrs Matthews explained that the clauses relating to nurses had been inserted since the B i ll was introduced. But the lady's first statement got a start, and it is open to question whether the correction will catch up with it. She was unfair not only to me but to the honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister), who also raised the question of the inclusion of nurses.",129
1097,Mr MANIFOLD,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,How unfair?,130
1098,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Because the papers did not report that the question had been raised, and Mrs Moss, basing her estimate of the Bill on the newspaper reports, made a statement which was not correct.",130
1099,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,It is only a condensed report.,130
1100,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,I am complaining that the fact was omitted from the condensed report.,130
1101,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"But you are also unfair, because you are interpreting the condensed report of her speech.",130
1102,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"As the lady withdrew the statement, the first report was evidently a fair one. The contentions of the honourable member for Cook (Mr. Catts) are absolutely sound, and those of the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Lamond) are quite unfair. If the press on both sides would take the trouble to give people an accurate report of what actually does take place in the House, the public would not be led astray, and persons like Mrs Moss would not be obliged to apologize for having made misstatements.",130
1103,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Yarra) [6.10 a.m.] - I should not have risen but for the smug Pharisaical utterance of the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Lamond), who said that honourable members on this side had hung up the Bill. That statement is precisely on a par with the utterance of a Nationalist senator during the Darwin election campaign in June last, that the Repatriation Bill would have been passed long ago but for the Labour opposition. That was purely an election lie. Mr LAMOND.!- I rise to a point of order. The honourable member for Yarra has said that a statement made in the Darwin electorate was a lie, and he likened my statement to it.",130
1104,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS, I do not understand the remark of the Leader of the Opposition to be applied to the honourable member for Illawarra.,130
1105,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,I was referring to a statement by Senator Bolton. Electioneering lies were uttered in the Darwin electorate. The honourable member for Illa-warra was absolutely inaccurate when he said that honourable members on this side were hanging up this Bill.,130
1106,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,I said that honourable members opposite were delaying it.,130
1107,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,We did not delay the Bill. The Government Whip will credit me with having done my best t.o facilitate . the transaction of business. * Mr GREENE - I willingly do that.,130
1108,Mr LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I was not criticising the honourable member for Yarra. < ij - Mr TUDOR - The honourable member was criticising the party which I have the honour to lead. Had we so desired, we could have held back the Bill, but we had no wish to do that. We were anxious to have certain principles incorporated in the measure, but, as the honourable member for Cook (Mr Catts) has said, we did not succeed in carrying one amendment. So long as the Government have a * majority they will see that no proposal by their political opponents is carried into effect. I am not surprised at the attitude which the Government have adopted. The same lack of consideration has been shown to those of us who have been anxious to assist them in every possible way. So far as I can remember, nota single suggestion or amendment made by the Opposition during the eight weeks Parliament has been sitting has been accepted by the Government. Now the Government are adjourning Parliament because they are so bankrupt of ideas that they have no other measure to bring forward. However, I trust that when this Bill is agreed to it will fulfil the wishes of all honourable members in this House. No matter how the Government or their supporters may attempt to flatten us out, we are desirous of doing our best for the soldiers. Mr J"". H . CATTS - They have flattened us out. We should rub in that fact.",130
1109,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I know they have, and they will continue doing so, but I hope we shall be able to show a better spirit towards them. If the operation of the measure discloses any defect in its provisions, I trust that the Ministry will lose no time in introducing an amending Bill , so that we may have on our statute-book the best possible law for the accomplishment of the object which we all have at heart.",131
1110,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Darling Downs-Hon orary Miuister) [6.2,0 a.m.] - I very much, regret the tone of the remarks of the honourable member for Cook (Mr . Catts). He would have the people believe that honourable members on this side of the House have approached this Bill in a party spirit, and have declined to consider any suggestions for its i m provement which came fro m the Opposition side. That statement is inaccurate. What were the amendments moved by honourable members opposite? On a measure dealing with the enormous subject of repatriation only two amendments as to principle were moved by Opposition members during the whole discussion. One emanated frfom the honourable member for Cook, and the other from the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine).",131

1112,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The honourable member invited it by the remarks he made. have nothing but gratitude to express for the attitude adopted by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) throughout the consideration of this Bill . able member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) raised a question as to whether the Bill should contain a complete scheme. opposed his amendment on the grounds which I gave, and the Leader of the Opposition also declared that the honourable member was adopting a wrong method of dealing with this Bill . Later» the honourable member for Cook came forward with four isolated suggestions of alleged principles, and I told him that we should have to treat his amendments in the same way as those of the honourable member for Wannon had been treated. Both sides of the House were treated impartially, and in the case of both amendments the Committee decided against the-movers. Then the honourable member for Barrier initiated a discussion in regard to the representation of the returned soldiers. Senator Mille n announced in another place, and I in this chamber, that the Government were in favour of two returned soldiers occupying seats on the Central Commission and the State Boards. The only question at issue was the method of appointment, and that issue was raised by the honourable member for Barrier (Mr . Considine). Throughout the discussion there have been rro party politics; not one division was taken on party lines. Yet the honourable member for . Cook (Mr . Catts) has endeavoured to convey to the public that on his side they came forward with a sheaf of amendments intended to build up this scheme, and that the Government deliberately turned them down. The answer to the honourable member for Cook was given by the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson), who said that there had not been a party division throughout the sitting. Every suggestion was fairl y and honestly considered on its merits.. A f t e r all, if honourable members opposite cannot suggest reasonable amendments the Government cannot be blamed. We are not responsible for their lack of ideas acceptable to the Committee - Throughout the Government dealt with this Bill on non-party lines and considered on its merits every proposal brought forward from either side of the House.

Instead of an inquiry by the Public Works Committee into the particular features of the proposed works, I should like an expert and scientific revision of the scheme, to discover whether at this stage it is advisable to construct these works at all.",132
1114,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,The Government have not neglected that matter.,132
1115,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I cannot believe that, if England- the circumstances were truly investigated, we would be advised by the Home authorities, under present circumstances or until the war be decided, to proceed With the Plinders Base, even though we might go on with the Henderson Base.",132
1116,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,We should nothing but what the Home authorities tell us to do.,132

The honourable gentleman musb realise, as freely as I do, that the quesin and out of Southampton. tion of sea command is now being dereason cided. , Heaven only knows what the terms of peace will determine as. to the future control of sea communications.",132

1119,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Thos e are considerations which only the enemy would want us to discuss in this place at this time. B u for the sake of argument, we anticipate trouble with some Asiatic people- I hope we shall never have to face it-w e should have to follow the practice of every European country in which there are Europe Naval Bases, and extend our bases as f as we could towards the territory of enemy.",132

1121,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"So far as one can derstand the existing scheme, we building Bases now to protect Australia' from some attack from the South Pole. When Admira l Henderson, a retired admiral, came to this country, he was not asked to advise what we should do'to protect Australia against this or that possible enemy. I believe that the gentleman who was then in control of the foreign policy of England would have deprecated any such thing being done.",132
1122,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,The foreign policy of England! The foreign policy of the Empire.,132
1123,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I am talking of the foreign policy of the Mother Country. I believe that the dangers which might conceivably confront Australia were not considered by this retired sailor in making his report, but that he was asked to advise how to establish the Australian naval organization, and that he set himself to establish Bases about the Australian 1 coast. The grounds for my belief is the manner in which his proposals shaped themselves in contrast with similar practices in England. Around the coast of",132
1124,Mr LIVINGSTON,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Of Britain.,132
1125,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The r e is a place called England, and around its coasts you have separate naval establishments side by side with great commercial ports. W it h so large and so numerous a Navy as that of the do Mother Country, you cannot afford to make use of commercial ports, and must have separate naval ports. You could not afford to have the hundreds of vessels belonging to the Imperial Navy running Por that there is established close by the purely Naval Base of Portsmouth. Since the German menace, the British Navy has deliberately established Bases as far towards Germany as it can get; not as far behind, but as far in advance as possible. Germany, on her side, has not gone as far injo tihe Baltic as she could to avoid us, t if , but to meet our naval command has advanced as far into the North Sea as she can, and has fortified Heligoland. That is the practice all the world over. The reason for separate naval ports in is that the fleets there are of such a r a magnitude that the naval and mercanour tile marine cannot use the same ports.",132
1126,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I rise to order. The question is shall certain works be referred unfor report tto the Works Committee, not are shall these Bases be constructed?",132
1127,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS," I take it that the honourable member is endeavouring to reasons why these works should not be referred to the Gommittee, or should not be gone on with . To that ""extent he is in order. He would not be in order in opening a general discussion regarding Naval Bases.",133
1128,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I can understand the anxiety of the honourable gentleman to get these proposals through, and the public grounds that actuate him .",133
1129,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,That is worthy of honourable member. I shall make an explanation directly.,133
1130,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"O u r Fleet is ' a small one, and with the load of expenditure in ' front of us, with, the doubts in connection with the whole crisis through which we are passing, I do not see any excuse for establishing new harbors alongside existing serviceable ports used by the mercantile marine. port we have been actually digging out the mud to make a Naval Base for our smaller ships, although there is a great harbour within fifty miles of the place. At the Henderson Base we are doing largely the same thing, although within a few miles there is Fremantle harbour, which is used by the mercantile Qmarine.",133
1131,Mr HEITMANN,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,And which is full of trading vessels.,133
1132,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"No doubt, the two Bases are not on a par. I do not express a rigid view regarding the Western Australian Base, but the whole subject needsreview. I do not think that the works should be proceeded with automatically. If you feel that the proposals must go to the Works Committee, let them go, but I ask you to consider what is to be the position of Australia after the war, and whether we can afford to spend money now, and whether we shall want to spend it after the war has been finished.",133
1133,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"This subject has caused the Government considerable anxiety, and we have given a great deal of attention, to it .",133
1134,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Has the Government come to a decision on it ?,133
1135,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Yes . Hence this reference of the works to the Public Works Committee.,133
1136,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Thes e works have been proceeding calmly ever since the war started. We might very well be taken into the full confidence of the Government so far as the suitability and desirability of the Flinders Base is conshow cerned. The other Base offers some difficulty, because it is aimed at the protection of the trade routes.",133
1137,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,B o t h Bases should wait over until after the war.,133
1138,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I think so. The Committee of Imperial Defence, which is the proper authority to refer these things to, if asked would not advise the continuance of this project at this time.",133
1139,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,The Minister for the Navy the (Mr Joseph Cook) will explain that.,133
1140,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I shall be happy to hear him. I have risen only to express my earnest conviction that the Government is making a very serious move, in volving this Government in the expenditure of millions of pounds, which within a year or two we may f in d has been v wasted.",133
1141,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Yarra) [6.37 a.m.] - A At Western- grave responsibility rests on the Ministry in connection with this expenditure. I do not think that any Ministry would come down with a reference to the Works Committee like this unless they had full y considered it . The Works Committee is not a body to advise on the strategic importance of the proposal, or whether the war has altered conditions so much that these Bases are 'more or less necessary than when recommended by Admira l Henderson; 'that is a matter for Ministerial decision. If the Minister says that there is no person in Australia who can advise on this matter, tihe Government should obtain advice from oversea. In .all probability they will be told, if they asked for advice, that no advisers are available to come to Australia at' the present time.",133
1142,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"To properly consider these proposals, the Works Committee should go to the other end of the world in order to obtain some standard of comparison.",133
1143,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"On e member of the Ministry was in England about twelve months ago. He and the Government must know something of what the Ministry of Great Britain are doing in this matter. This must be part of their definite programme. Our Government are referring the proposals to the Works Committee, to get information as to certain phases of the work. Since we have a Works Committee, I think this is the wisest course to pursue. While responsibility rests on every private member, it rests much more heavily on the Government. M in isters must know more about these i m portant proposals than any private member, because they are closely in touch with what is going on on the other side of the world. That, being so, my intention to vote for the motion.",133
1144,Mr GEEGORY,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Dampier) [6.40 a.m.]. - Some time ago a Loan Bill was before this House, and I moved for a reduction of the amount proposed to be expended in connection with these Naval Bases. I thought that their construction might well be delayed, because, as the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Kelly) has pointed out, we do not know yet what lessons are to be learned from the war. I received no support on that occasion fro m the honourable member. He was very silent when the appropriation of the money for these works was proposed. penditure has been authorized, and we are committed to it . I object to the gross insults the honourable member for Wentworth has been throwing at me, not only to-night, but on a previous occasion.",134
1145,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I rise to a point of order. The honourable member accuses me of hurling gross insults at him . I submit that he is not in order in attributing such behaviour to me. I have not hurled in sults at the honourable member, as the cold pages of Hansard will show.",134

The difficulty with which we are confronted now is that, if the Public Works Committee do not make an inquiry into these proposals, the Government will have to go on with the work, because Parliament has approved of the expenditure of the money.",134
1152,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"ParramattaMinister for the Navy) [6.44 a.m.] - I should like to say one or two words about this matter, though I am sure that honourable members will not expect me to deal with it at length. I have looked into the The ex- matter, and intend to look into it much, further. The Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Watt)'has also looked into iti. We have consulted the officers who we think are best able to form a judgment upon it . We have several men now in the Department who have but lately come from the Old Country, including Mr Settle, who has been constructing Naval Bases all his life. The second naval member of the Board is but recently from the Admiralty, and there are other omcers of the Department who have also but recently come from the Admiralty. They are competent, capable men, and they are agreed that there is only one course that should be taken at the present time, and that is to "" carry o n "" in connection with these works. What the developments of the future may be no one can at the moment foresee, but it is plain that in every other country they are rushing forward their naval preparations, not retarding them. It seems to me an almost incredible suggestion that, in the middle of a great war like 'this, there should be any easing down of our war preparations., There may be modifications, but there is surely no reason for the complete cessation of tliese works u n t i l the war is over. Nothing has occurred during the course of the war, so far as I can find out, which would in any way modify the necessity for these Bases. Moreover, the work that is being done is foundational and common to any Naval Base.",134

1154,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,The question of location was fixed by Admiral Henderson.,135

1186,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,And until after the passing of a substantive resolution has followed the investigation.,136
1187,Mr LECKIE,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,This seems to me like putting the cart before the horse. The Public Works Committee should report upon these works before the money for their construction is passed.,136

One was answered very promptly by the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, but I was not able to get the full information in order to reply to .the other statement until the early portion of this sitting. The statement of the honourable member was that a gentleman named Lahyer had applied for work as a fireman on a steamer, that he had intimated that he was a German, and that notwithstanding this he had been offered employment.

1208,Mr GROOM,NATION AL SERVICE,"(Darling Downs-Hon orary Minister) [7.5 a.m.]- I ask leave to make a statement in reply to some statements' made about the administration of the Victorian section of the Australian Patriotic Fund, made in the House by the honourable member 'for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) on the 18th inst. Leave granted.",137
1209,Mr GROOM,NATION AL SERVICE,"The statements made by the honourable member were:(a) That up to date nothing had been done to supplement the allowances to the wives and children of the men at the Front from the fund. (b) Th.it necessitous cases are brought under the notice of those administering the fund, but they do not deal with them. (c) That a promised contribution of £1,000 from the fnnd to the Victorian State War Council had been reduced to £500. (d) No attempt has yet been made to pay out the extra amount that was to be payable as from the 11th inst. (e) I do not know what the expenses of administering the fund are, but I am told the daughter of one public man is getting £6 a week for supervision of some sort.' The Lord May o r . (Sir David Hennessy) Las been good enough to forward a reply to the charges made by the honourable member, and says:(a) Weekly grants on a fixed scale to the wives and children of men at the Front were paid from October, 1914, to May, 1915, when the Defence Department commenced to pay separation allowance; between May, 1915, and October, 1916, when separation allowances were increased, weekly grants from the fund were paid only to wives with three or more children; since the 11th ult., a weekly grant on the uniform scale' adopted by the Inter-State Conference presided over by Senator Millen has been paid to wives with ""one or more children. (6) Cases brought under notice which, in the opinion of those administering the fund, were necessitous cases, have invariably been relieved. (c) At a conference between the representalives of the State War Council and the Australian Patriotic Fund's sub-committee, held on the 11th inst., a contribution of £1,000 to State War Council was promised, subject to the approval of the General Committee. Approval was obtained on the 17th inst.; a cheque for the amount was forwarded on the 20th inst. (<Z) If Mr Mathews refers to the increase in the amounts of the weekly grants agreed to be paid at the conference presided over by Senator Millen, then the amounts have been paid from the 8th ult. (e) The expense of administering the fund is at the rate of £550 per annum. No one in the employmentof the Committee is the daughter of a public man. The highest salary paid by the Committee is 50s. per week. The administration of the fund is controlled by the Town Clerk and one of his staff, under direction of the Lord Mayor. No charge is made for their services, nor is any charge made by the City Council for the use of the Committee's offices, electric lighting, &c. The City Auditor makes a continuous audit of the fund, for which he makes no charge whatever. I may add that the City Council grants to the War Council, free of rent or rates, the offices used by them in Market Buildings, that can. be let at £700 per annum. At the present time we are paying grants at the rate of £1,250 per week to 2,964 wives with one or more children. These children number nearly 9,000. This represents roughly £60,000 per annum, and expenses and administration, you will observe, are less than 1 per cent.",137
1210,Mr MATHEWS,NATION AL SERVICE,Melbourne Ports) [7.8 a.m.] - I ask leave to make a statement. Leave granted.,138
1211,Mr MATHEWS,NATION AL SERVICE,"Yesterday an officer from the Repatriation Office waited on me in regard to the statements that I had made in this chamber, and I referred him to the office of the State War Council. When he reports to his Minister I am sure that he will prove my charges. I said that I had sent five persons to the office of the Patriotic Fund and that they could not obtain relief. One was the case of a man with six children. In another case there were five children; in two other cases there were four children, and in another case there were two children. They could not get relief u n t i l last Monday. I am assured by those who have seen them that there are dozens of similar cases that have come mider the notice of the State War Council. I am sure that the report that the officer from the Repatriation Office will obtain from the State War Council will prove the accuracy of my statement that these men. and women, and children were not receiving support.

1214,Mr TUDOR,FONDENCE TAXATION OF AGBICULTUBAL,"Yarra) [4.26] - Can the Prime Minister give honourable members any idea when they are likely to be called together again? I understand there is a desire that we should meet some time in November, at such a date as will probably fit in witli the opening of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. members, particularly those who come from distant States, have to make' arrangements some time ahead, and I shall be glad if the Prime Minister can state whether there is any special reason for an adjournment for anything from five to eight weeks so soon after the last elections. The last Parliament met in , I think, September, 1914, but there was no adjournment so early after its first meeting. Honourable members would not like anything sprung upon them, or any action to be taken by the Government, while they are away, when they have no opportunity to discuss matters that may have an infiuenoe, not only upon this country, but upon others.",139
1215,Mr SINCLAIR,FONDENCE TAXATION OF AGBICULTUBAL,"Moreton) [4.28] The other day I went down to the archives with a friend to see the collection of Australian books there. They appeared to me to have been neglected for some time. I was not aware then that the late Archivist, Mr E . A . Petherick, had .been ill . I hope that now, after the regrettable death of the old gentleman, every care will be taken of this very valuable collection, that it will be properly housed, and kept, as far as possible, in tact.

I have given instructions that every care is to be taken of the collection, that it is to be properly catalogued, and, generally, that it is to be under the strictest supervision of a competent officer of the library. I have also provided additional accommodation for further probable additions to the collection.",139

I hope that you, sir, as Chairman of the Library Committee, will make inquiries to see if something cannot be done to ease the latter days of the relative or relatives I have mentioned. A considerable time ago the Prime M in ister promised that a Divorce Bill would be brought in to amend the existing law, particularly in relation to the question of the domiciles of parties. I hope during the recess he will be able to devote a few minutes to looking into the injustice which in that regard presses heavily, not only upon men, but upon women in the community. I recently asked the Prime Minister a question with regard to the prices fixed, or to be fixed, for foods and other goods. Whpn the information is ready, will the Prime Minister make it public through the press ? What I want is information as to ohe prices fixed and the changes made in those prices from the time the first fixing was done. Will you, Mr Speaker, see that ports of Mr Blacket with regard to the Federal Capital are distributed to each honourable member, so that during the recess we may have an opportunity of studying one of the most important reports ever made upon the lack of economy in a Department?",139
1219,Mr FINLAYSON,FONDENCE TAXATION OF AGBICULTUBAL,"Brisbane) [4.33] Will the Prime Minister give consideration during the adjournment to the conduct of the Censor and the general management ot the Censor's Department? It is becoming every day more irritating and stupid. Private telegrams and letters, and business letters and communications generally, are now being interfered with. It is no uncommon thing now for a business firm to receive lettersthat have obviously been opened by the Censor. A particularly stupid instance was brought under my notice this week, where communications posted in Adelaide addressed to a firm in Adelaide, and obviously dealing with purely local matters, had been interfered (with. On the face of it , if anything detrimental to the country's interests was passing or likely to pass in these communications, people living in the same city would not risk using this means of communication when they had the opportunity of seeing each other. Here is the envelope of a letter addressed to Messrs. Challender and Company, Tucker-street, Adelaide, and posted from Echunga. The envelope bears obvious marks of interference - Here is a more stupid thing stilla letter-card addressed to the same firm, posted in Adelaide and opened, with the Censor's stamp upon it . To show how utterly foolish the whole thing is, the writing inside is "" Please send me a fresh supply of whole wheatmeal, the same quality as before."" .Nothing could be more eloquent of the stupidity and foolishness of the censorship. The Prime Minister was good enough to promise some time ago that the censorship would be administered fairly, and merely for the purpose of preventing the circulation through the post and the press of information likely to be of use to the enemy. The censorship is obviously being used now for a purpose quite foreign to the in tentions of the Government"", and in contravention of the promise given by. the Prime Minister. Will the right honourable gentleman promise that he will give the people of this country some protection from abuses of this kind that recall the re- the most despotic forms of government the world has ever known, and are not at all reasonable in a country like Australia.",140
1220,Mr JOHN THOMSON,FONDENCE TAXATION OF AGBICULTUBAL,"Cowper) [4.37] - I have received from agricultural societies in my electorate letters stating thati they have been called upon by the Commissioner of Taxation to pay income tax. These societies are not conducted for purposes of profit. They are encouraging a healthy competition amongst the people engaged in the primary industries, and the prizes distributed amongst the exhibitors cannot be regarded as profits. In the .small districts, the shows serve a useful purpose in stimulating the rural industries, and I am sure that when Parliament passed the Income Tax Bill there was no intention that it should apply to such useful and educational institutions as agricultural societies.",140

Therefore, there should be no trouble in this regard in future.",141

As the latter date has not been definitely settled yet, I can only say now that we shall probably meet again in the second or third .week of November; but honourable members will receive ample notice of both events, and Mr Speaker's summons will follow on the heels of the notice regarding the railway ceremony. The Government does not propose to do anything during the adjournment which it would not do if the House were sitting. If the honourable member for Yarra fears that we intend to bring in conscription by regulation, I give him the positive assurance that we do not. When we meet again, Parliament will be asked to deal with such measures as the circumstances may demand. shall, before resuming my seat, indicate some of these. I join with those who have paid a tribute to tihe worth of the late Mr. Petherick - He was one of those unobtrusive men who spend their lives in the service of the State, giving to the community what others give to themselves or their own people. something to recognise his merits, though no honour that could have been conferred on him would have been adequate recompense for his life of labour on behalf of the community. The value of the gift he has bestowed on us will increase as time goes on. My tribute to Mr. Petherick's memory was published in the press, and had I been able to_ ascertain that he had left any relatives, I should have expressed to them directly, on behalf of the Government and this Parliament, my appreciation of his services and his gifts.",143

If necessary, I shall be only too glad to join with any other member to assist the' declining years of any relative of so worthy a man. The honourable member for Melbourne referred to domicile in its relation to divorce. The reform of the law on this subject has engaged the attention of many Governments. The consensus of opinion is that uniformity is most desirable, and that technical and vexatious hindrances to divorce proceedings, such as are sometimes caused by the question of domicile, should not continue. Without pledging myself or the Government to the introduction, when the House reassembles, of a Bill to legislate for marriage and divorce, I promise that the matter will receive earnest consideration, and in any measure that is introduced the law of domicile will the re-adjusted. As to the complaint of the honourable member for Brisbane, I can only say that the censor, in the case referred to, seems ,to have acted entirely beyond his instructions. I am not I aware of any reason why that official Should open letters passing from one person to another in the same city, unless there be good reason for suspecting some conspiracy against the State. It was not alleged by the honourable member that the circumstances justified such suspicion, and therefore I am at a loss to understand the censor's action. The general pledge I did that I have given still stands. The censorship must and shall be continued for the protection of the State, but the communications of private individuals will be respected, and there will be no interfering with that freedom of discussion in the press and elsewhere which, to a democratic people, is natural and proper. The honourable member for Mari to an agreement regarding the price of flour. The agreement, perhaps, is not in strict accordance with the common law, and, for aught I know, may violate the statute law of Victoria, but as to how far it ""would be as against public policy I am unable to say. Unhappily there run through almost every stratum of our economic life agreements which ignore the law. The honourable member has not had as much experience of unions as some other members, but he must know that unionism is based on such agreements. To unionists no offence is so rank as that .'committed by the man who seeks to sell his labour for a lower price, or under other conditions, than set down in the bond of making of which' frequently only one party is consulted. The honourable member's complaint would be entitled to more consideration if it could be shown that pulblic interest suffers by what is being done. That does not appear to be so. The Government has fixed a price for wheat at 4s. 9d. per bushel, and the of flour is also fixed. Unless, and until, it can be shown that the. price fixed for wheat' is excessive, I cannot see how the agreement that has been complained of can be regarded as seriously affecting the welfare of the people. The honourable member for Werriwa said the other day that the farmers are willing to sell their wheat for 4s. per bushel. If he can get a substantial number of farmers who will sell for that price, I , like other flour eaters, shall rejoice, but my experience of farmers during the last three years does not lead me to expect any movement in that direction. think that the farmer is tarred with the same brush as we all are. I have never met a member of Parliament who has suggested that his salary should be cut down",143
1248,Mr TUDOR,FONDENCE TAXATION OF AGBICULTUBAL,"Oh , yes.",144
1249,Mr HUGHES,FONDENCE TAXATION OF AGBICULTUBAL,The case which the honourable member has in his mind was the result of inexperience.,144
1250,Mr ANSTET,FONDENCE TAXATION OF AGBICULTUBAL,"The honourable gentleman himself was one of those who wanted to cut down our salaries to £100 a year. _ Mr HUGHES - Of course. At one time, when there was talk of economy, I made a suggestion upstairs that we should cut our salaries down to £100 a year. But I could not get anybody to support my proposal.",144
1251,Mr ANSTEY,FONDENCE TAXATION OF AGBICULTUBAL,What about me?,144
1252,Mr HUGHES,FONDENCE TAXATION OF AGBICULTUBAL,"The honourable memvoid ber possesses a very good voice, but I never heard a word from him in reference to it. Coming back to the wheat question, I have merely to say that unless and until the farmers are prepared to cut down their price, I can do nothing. I say that 4s. 9d. per bushel is only a fair return to the farmer. As a matter of fact, he receives only 4s. l^d. per bushel at the best. Considering the expense that is attendant upon the sowing and harvesting of wheat, and taking one season with another, that price is riot too high. Of course, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lynch) is a big farmer, who has waxed fat and grown opulent, with the result that he has extravagant ideas about things. The hon the orable member for Maribyrnong spoke about the high cost of living in relation to this and other matters. I trust he will not forget that one of the factors in the price high cost of living is high wages. ' Mr Fenton - It is a very small factor.",144
1253,Mr HUGHES,FONDENCE TAXATION OF AGBICULTUBAL,"It is one of the factors. We cannot have high wages and, at the same time, cheap commodities. There is an entirely erroneous idea prevalent-based , I think, upon the returns which are sometimes issued by the Government Statistician-that if the increased cost of living represents, say, 36 per cent., and wages have increased by 21 per cent., the workers are 15 per cent, worse off. That is not necessarily true. II t may be, and probably is, a fact in any country where the standard of living is high, as it is in Australia, that the whole increase in the cost of living is not covered by the increase in wages. The margin between the two is such that an increase of 21 per cent, in wages may be equivalent to an increase of 36 per cent, in the cost of living. But notwithstanding this the Governemnt will exercise its powers to protect the community from exploitation, and also to insure the payment of a fair and reasonable wage. Yesterday I took the opportunity of expressing my strong disapproval of such wages as have recently been referred to in the press. I will be no party to paying girls 14s. a week. So far as I am concerned, any industry which is paying girls a wage of only 14s. a week will get no protection from this ment, whether it be engaged in white work or the manufacture of confectionery, or anything else. It will pay a decent wage, otherwise the flood-gates will opened and foreign goods will be let in.",144
1254,Mr TUDOR,FONDENCE TAXATION OF AGBICULTUBAL,The honourable gentleman said that before he resumed his seat would outline the measures with which the Government proposed to proceed.,145

1256,Mr LYNCH,FONDENCE TAXATION OF AGBICULTUBAL,"I would like to be perthem mitted to, make an interjection. The able, Prime Minister is labouring under a apprehension. I am not imbued with our the full measure of generosity with which he credits me. I wish to say that amongst all the farmers in Australia there is not law. one who is more fully convinced of the are great benefits that have been conferred upon them by the pooling system and the fixing of a minimum price for f.a.q. wheat than I am. It is because I am fearful the future of the wheat guarantee system - fearfu l lest the final clean-up will show sell them. that we have obtained a smaller net price from the foreign consumer than we exacted from the local consumer,,that I have taken up the attitude which I have adbpted. Should it transpire that fears are well founded, the result will that we shall lose l i e safeguard of guarantee system, which I hold to be under essential to the prosperity of the Ausany tralian farmer. I have only to repeat, therefore, that if the case be fairly before our farmers, they will be willing to allow the Australian consumer to have sufficient wheat for our local milling quirements at 4s. per bushel, a price which will entail no loss to the Australian grower.",145
1257,Mr HUGHES,FONDENCE TAXATION OF AGBICULTUBAL,"I accept the honorobjection able member's tribute to the Wflieat Pool, but I still say that when Horatius can get others to stand on the bridge with him, and say that they will accept 4s"". per anything more. bushel instead of 4s. 9d. per bushel for their wheat, I , too, will stand with thereabouts. In reply to the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor), I desire to say that we shall, on re-assembling, deal with tain financial measures; as to other measures, these will depend circumstances. It would be premature ject of a very searching inquiry. to speak of measures that have not been Parliaconsidered by the Government. I come now to the regulation to which attention has been drawn by the honourable member, for Bourke- I refer to regulation be , No. 20 under the War Precautions Act. I would like to point out the sale of enemy shares in England is governed by the he English law, and if we are going to do anything with them, we shall have to dispose of them subject to the Englaw. The effect of this regulation is to facilitate the sale of these shares, and to enable bs to get rid of as speedily as possible. I am untherefore, to see in it anything that misis open to objection. Whereas, under law, we cannot sell a share to any one but a natural-born British subject, there is no similar limitation under the English It , therefore, follows that if we to sell the shares we must act under the English law. We are in the predicament that we must conform to the British law or hold the shares. If we hold them it is perfectly clear that they will revert of to the Germans after the war. All that we are doing is to make it possible to",145
1258,Mr ANSTEY,FONDENCE TAXATION OF AGBICULTUBAL,"I do not raise any objection. I wanted an explanation. If we are subject to the English law, and my must sell them, I wanted to know be whether any conditions are imposed, or the whether there could be any exemptions the English law.",145
1259,Mr HUGHES,FONDENCE TAXATION OF AGBICULTUBAL,"We cannot impose conditions, but we can withhold the sale of the shares. Although their sale put is subject to the English law, they cannot be put on the market at all unless by our permission, because we control the recompany. On the whole, I think that the best thing to do is to get rid of them. W{e make representations to the Imperial Authorities, who know our law and our to selling these shares to anybody but a British-born subject, and we ask them in the sale of the shares to have regard to that objection. We cannot do Reference has been made to the loss of him the Cumberland and of the Port Kembla. The destruction of these vessels is receiving the earnest consideration of the Government. We have decided to offer a cerreward of £5,000 in connection with the sinking of the Port Kembla. The sinkupon ing of the Cumberland has been the subIt would serve no useful purpose at all to declare the finding of the Commission appointed to make the inquiry.",145
1260,Mr TUDOR,FONDENCE TAXATION OF AGBICULTUBAL,Something has been published in this morning's newspapers in regard to that.,146
1261,Mr HUGHES,FONDENCE TAXATION OF AGBICULTUBAL,"The full report of the Commission ha9 not been published. The vessel could have gone down in a hundred different ways, but it probably went down in one of two ways - eithe r it was blown up from within or from without. If its loss was due to either of these causes it may have been the work of an enemy. The same remarksapply to 'the loss of the. Fort Kembla. Inquiries are being made, and no time is.being lost. The loss of these vessels is, of course, a very serious matter. Three ships have now disappeared about our coasts within a period of a few weeks, and it is obvious that whatever caused the destruction of these three vessels threatens the destruction of others. The loss of one of these vessels was certainly not effected by an exterior agency. Searching inquiries are being made, and if, as is possible, and. perhaps probable, this is found to be the work of an enemy, the Government will take such action as will, ib is hoped, prevent a recurrence of such disasters.. . I desire to thank honourable members for the advice and assistance they have given the Government during the session. Meeting as we did after a very - hotly contested electoral campaign, I can only say that the Government have no reason whatever to complain qf the attitude of the majority of honorablo members opposite. Human nature will be humannature, and on behalf of the Government I thank honourable memberson both sides for their assistance. They have brought to the consideration of measures submitted much thought and argument, which, perhaps, may sometimes have been unduly prolonged. By way merely of passing comment, it is curious to reflect that the gentlemen in another place contrive to do the business sent up to them in about one-tenth of the time it takes us to do the same business here. Whether time or public opinion will eventually determine that they are unnecessary, or that we are, is a matter for speculation. I again thank honourable members, and I nope that during the short adjournment they will be able to take advantage of-the opportunity to consult their constituents. I trust it will be remembered that we are at war, and that the greatest business of all is to bring home to the hearts and minds of the people of this country, that supreme fact - I shall not attempt to prophesy when this dreadful struggle will come to an end, but until it does we .must go on. I hope that honourable members in the interval will take every opportunity of endeavouring to arouse the people of the Commonwealth to a sense of their duty, and that we shall.meet in November with renewed health and vigour, determined to do that which has to be done. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at' 5.23 p.m. (Thursday).",146
