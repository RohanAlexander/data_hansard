1,Mr WEST,Unknown,"I desire to bring under the notice of the Attorney-General a very - important matter, namely, the remarks of neglected, - Mr Justice Higgins in regard to the regisdustrial tration of the Actors Union, of which [60] 'following report appears in --today's Ag*f- ' An order was yesterday made by Mr Justice Higgins in the Federal Arbitration Court directing the cancellation of registration of the Australian Actors Union, his Honor' remarking that in making the order he was "" compelled to do a stupid piece of injustice."" Although a number, of grounds were submitted on behalf of the applicantsthe theatricalmanagersin support of the application, the one mainly relied upon related to proceedings by the deputy registrar in Sydney. It appeared that the notification of the application for the registration of the union was published in the Gazette on 16th December, i g n , and on n t h January the deputy registrar granted the: certificate, forwarding a notification of the fact to the principal registrar in Melbourne. Subsequently the mistake in issuing the certificate before thirty days had passed for the receipt of objections to the registration was discovered, and the certificate was finally issued as of date 7th February last. Counsel for the union argued that the issue of a certificate' on n t h January was a mere nullity,- and did not. affect the valid act after the lapse of the required period. His Honor, after remarking that he was compelled to do a stupid piece of injustice, said the mistake had hurt no one, but he was obliged to give effect to the objection, because it had been taken. At one time he had a discretion in matters of this sort, but the last amended act said that if an organisation were registered erroneously, or by mistake, the registration must be cancelled. He had drawn up a certificate of registration.",14
2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,It is not customary in asking questions to read long extracts from newspapers. The honourable member should condense his quotation.,14
3,Mr WEST,Unknown,"If I am infringing, the practice of the House, I shall content myself with handing to the Attorney-General the report from which I have quoted. I ask him to see if he can prevent injustice being done to a section of the community which should not be treated unfairly.",14
4,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I shall look into the matter, and see if anything can be done to remedy the state of affairs complained of. DESTITUTE MOTHERS' ALLOWANCE.",14
5,Mr OZANNE,Unknown,"Has it been brought under the purview of the Prime Minister in the Geelong Times of ist August, 1912, the following appeared:-. At yesterday's sitting of the Court a family of five. young children, the youngest being twins, were formally charged - with being and they were committed to the In Schools. A similar course was taken the in ' regard to another family of four. In view of such conditions existing in a country so sparsely populated, and in order to preserve home life, will the Prime Minister take into consideration the granting of .allowances to destitute mothers with families, and so save the children from the cold State nurseries? Mr FISHER. - My attention has not previously been drawn to the matter. - While it would be congenial to myself and my colleagues to do what is suggested, it is doubtful whether the work comes within our constitutional powers. I think that, as the. Commonwealth has undertaken the responsibility of. providing invalid and old age pensions, the States might' themselves look after cases of the kind referred to. NA RAILWAY.",14
6,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Regardin g the proposal of . the Treasurer to spend 000,000 this year on the transcon 7 tinental railway, I ask the right honourable gentleman . where he proposes to get. the money. The expenditure is. not a charge on the Estimates for the year. Is it - proposed to borrow?",15
7,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That course was determined upon when an Act was passed last session providingcredit with which the Commonwealth could take up stock at any time. To all intents and purposes, the money necessary for the construction of the line has been' provided.",15
8,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But not from 'actual wording. revenue. - Mr FISHER - No . There was no pretence that it would be. DEFENCE. IMPRISONMENT OF CADETS' PARENTS.,15
9,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In the absence of the 'Honorary Minister, who usually represents the Minister of Defence, I ask the Prime Minister if his attention, has been to a statement of Mr Crawford, a memrently, ber of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, to the effect that, owing to financial embarrassment caused by the 'heavy fines inflicted on parents for the attendance of their sons at drill, - some the parents will have to go lo gaol on - Monday next? Will the right honourable gentleman take steps to have the fines - uiittcd ? i Mr FISHER - I am not acquainted with the facts. It is most undesirable country that parents should be sent to gaol for the offences of their children, and I shall, ascertain what can be done to prevent that; but, if the defence system is to be of any value, the law must be obeyed. ELECTORAL DIVISIONS: NEW SOUTH WALES.",15
10,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Has the Minister of Home Affairs any information to give, the House regarding the redistribution of the New South Wales electoral divisions? ' Mr KING 0'MAU.EV - We are expecting a report very soon. ROYAL COMMISSIONS BILL.",15
11,Mr THOMAS BROWN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Has the attention of the Attorney-General been directed to the report in this morning's Argus bt a speech by Mr H . Y. Braddon, president of the Sydney Chamber of Conv merce, in the course of which, criticising the Royal Commissions Bill, he said Time was when they could' have faced that with equanimity, having faith in the men on the Bench, but that confidence no longer exists. Is there any justification for this reflec.tion on the honour and probity of our Judges ?",15
12,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Apparently, Mr. - Braddon, when making his speech, was ignorant of the scope of the Bill, and its I ' shall, take an opportunity to consider the matter more closely.",15
13,Mr THOMAS BROWN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Has the honourable gentleman noticed that that reference by the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce seems to implicate, not merely Royal Commissions, but the whole Judiciary of the State?",15
14,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have before me the paragraph from which the honourable memdrawn ber has been quoting. It would, appabear the construction that it is a reflection upon the Courts, but I ' do not the believe it was the intention of the president of the Chamber of Commerce to renonflect upon the Courts. There is no ground of at all in the measure to which he alluded to justify such a statement; and there is certainly no. reason to believe that the reCourts of the Commonwealth or of the States are not in every way calculated to inspire confidence in the people of this FEDERAL CAPITAL.",15
15,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I wish to ask the Minister of Home Affairs when he can make a statement to the House as to what it is proposed to do during the current financial year towards the completion of the Federal Capital? We know that prizes have been, awarded in a competition for the best design ; and I wish to know whether the design which secured first prize is to be adopted, or whether the plan to be followed will embrace the best features of several designs. When will the Department be in a position to do something definite?",16
16,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We have apthat pointed a committee of the officers of the Home Affairs Department to go into the whole thing, and I am expecting almost every day to have a report put before me, recommending either that one of the designs be followed, or that the best features of several designs be taken. I have asked the officers to hurry up, and hope to be able to make a statement to the House within a few days.",16
17,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What induced the Minister to put on the Estimates for this year a smaller sum than was voted last year? Has he any guarantee that the Treasurer will be able to find sufficient money for the work he speaks of?,16
18,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The whole proposal might as well be abandoned if the Government are not going on with the work.,16
19,Mr JOSEVH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Hear , hear ! Mr K f NG O'MALLEY - Las t night the honourable member for Parramatta complained that ,Â£300,000 of the amount voted was not spent, but that is because we can get only a certain amount spent each year. If the money voted can be spent, and all the works started, you will have them tailing in, so that everything will move clockwork. - Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - I wish to are ask the Prime Minister, in the absence of the Minister who represents the Minister of Defence in this Chamber, if he will give consideration to the claims of the the Treasurer. Federal Capital to the holding of the first compulsory military camp there, within the next two or three months, instead of holdrumours ing it at Albury as usual ?",16
20,Mr FTSHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I shall bring the matlarly ter under the notice of the Minister of fence.,16
21,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Will the Prime Minister state whether it is proposed to builrl the Federal Capital out of revenue, [60]- 2 or to provide loan money for the work in the same way as for the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway ?",16
22,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The vote for the Federal Capital this year is for work to enable practically the whole of the necessary pre^' liminaries to be effected before the next financial year begins. It will be time enough in the next financial year to say how .the Capital shall be built. I hope the work will be carried out as economically as possible, whatever Government is in power at the time.",16
23,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Did I understand the Minister of Home Affairs to say he will not be able, so far as he sees, to spend more than the amount on the Estimates for the Federal Capital during the current year? Mr KING O'MALLEY - That was not what I desired to convey to the honourable member, because no doubt this amount will involve other amounts; but the matter to which the honourable member refers can be arranged for through the Treasurer as we go on.",16
24,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I wish to make perfectly clear what we should apprehend from, the last answer of the Minister of Home A f fairs. I understand him to say, generally speaking, that amounts would be added to amounts, and change would succeed change, according to the universal law of matter j but I really want to know whether the Minister proposes to spend the whole of the ^110,000 which he has on the Estimates for this year, and which is a little less than last year, on the preliminary work for the Federal Capital; and whether, in addi-. tion, he intends to ask the Treasurer, iri dovethe expectation of having his request like granted, for such additional sums as will be required to show that the Government in earnest in this matter? Mr KING O'MALLEY - When we have spent the ^110,000, then immediately, if we. can spend more, we shall appeal to  going about Victoria, and I see by the press in the other States, and particuin my own State, that similar stater Dements are being made there, to the effect that it is the intention of the Government not to do anything this .yenr with regard to the Federal Capital, will the Prime Minister, if those statements are untrue, give them a denial, or if they are true, will he tell the House arid the country so?",16
25,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"This Government is the only Government that ever did anything towards making the Federal Capital where it is, and preparing for its proper construction and development. The amount on the Estimates is an amount which will enable all the preliminary work to be done. A policy will be put before the country regarding the Federal Capital before any great expenditure is incurred.",17
26,Mr FULLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In view of the Prime Minister's answer, claiming all the credit in connection with the Federal Capital, may I ask him if it is not a fact that the Act under which the Federal Capital was established was passed by Parliament at the instance of the late Government, and that I , as Minister of Home Affairs, had the privilege of conducting it in this House?",17
27,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Whic h Act was that?,17
28,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Will the Minister of Home Affairs state whether the amount on the Estimates for the Federal Capital makes any provision for the railway from the Capital to Jervis Bay? Mr KING O'MALLEY - No .,17
29,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In view of the desire of the Prime Minister to get more credit than perhaps attaches to him in regard to the Federal Capital, I wish to ask him if he will pledge himself to give, out of the Treasurer's Advance, to the Minister of Home Affairs, such additional amounts as the Minister has promised us this morning that he will ask for when he has expended the ;Â£.110,000 now provided?",17
30,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In courtesy to the honourable member, let me inform him that the Treasurer puts on the Estimates the amount that he intends shall be expended upon any work, except in unusual circumstances. WORKS ESTIMATES .  the House when he intends to proceed with the consideration of the Works Estimates, and whether they are to be dealt with before the general Estimates?",17
31,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wit h the concurrence cf the Opposition, I should like to put through the Works Estimates on Tuesday, before continuing the debate on the Financial Statement.",17
32,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member can have the concurrence of the Opposition in almost anything, but not in that. NA MILLS.",17
33,Mr FULLER,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,Will the Prime Minister delay action in regard to the erection of the Commonwealth Woollen Mills until the House has had an opportunity to deal .with the proposal during the consideration of the Estimates?,17
34,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,That would be an impossible position from the point of view of responsible government. The Government must take the responsibility of its actions.,17
35,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"H as the Prime Minister forgotten the fact that last session, although the Government, in the first place, took the responsibility of fixing the site for the Naval College at Jervis Bay, they afterwards met the views of some honourable members with regard to it? Will he take similar action in a broader way on this occasion, and let the House consider where the Commonwealth Woollen Mills ought to be situated?",17
36,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,My previous answer answers that question also.,17
37,Mr FAIRBAIRN,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Does not the Prime Minister think that a naval college is in quite a different category from a woollen mill, seeing that a woollen mill requires labour and a naval college only requires brains ?",17
38,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"The question raised by the honourable member is. not a matter of whether one thing differs from another. It is a question of responsibility. NA VESSELS. M i . HIGGS asked the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice- 1. Has he read the cabled information under date 27th July"" The Toronto correspondent of the Times states that as a result of the conference between Canadian Ministers and the Admiralty, Canada's offer of a contribution to the British navy will include four convertible armed 25-knot ships to be built for the Canadian-Pacific Railway Company, and two small vessels, but of similar speed, which are being built in Vancouver for the Canadian-Japanese service "" ? 2. Is it the intention of the Government to modify the Australian Naval Programme so as to include the construction of convertible armed merchant vessels to be used during peace in carrying mails, passengers, and cargo between. Australia and Europe? ' Mr FISHER (for Mr ROBERTS) - The answers to the honourable member's questions the are as follow:- ' 1. Yes. 2. The matter is under consideration. EUROPEAN MAIL CONTRACT.",17
39,Mr HIGGS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"the Postmaster General, ufon notice What is the average number of knots per hour steamed by contract mail steamers carrying Australian mails between Fremantle and Marseilles?",18
40,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"for Mr Frazer) There is no fixed time of arrival and departure of contract mail steamers at Fremantle or Marseilles. The contract is between Adelaide and Naples, and the average rate of speed maintained between these ports by the steamers under contract to the - Commonwealth, during the past six months, was 15 knots.",18
41,Mr HIGGS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"the Minister of External Affairs, upon notice I. Has he read the following statement appearing in one of a series of articles by the Rev. Father Mimnagh, written on a trip to Great Britain (see Bundaberg Daily News, n t h J u l y , 1912) : "" I learned on my outward journey that some of the men working on the Grosse Kurfurst were immigrants who, disappointed with Australia, were at all costs coming back to England. Emigrants with trades evidently they were who were tempted by the reports of the high wages paid to their classes under the Southern Cross, and once there finding no avenues of employment returned to their own land again. These people will have no kindly memory of Australia, and no good word to say of it, the original fault though being their own in pretending to be agricultural labourers. . . . The whole method , of choosing those people to go to Australia needs re-casting if the best are to ensue "" ? 2. Will the Minister for External Affairs appoint a temporary officer in each of the principal ports of the Commonwealth to make inquiries (during a period of say one month) amongst the third-ciass passengers and the crews of outgoing vessels bound for Europe, with a view to ascertaining how many State-assisted immigrants are returning because of inability to obtain employment in Australia?",18
42,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"The answers to the honas orable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. 2. Neither temporary nor permanent officers possess the power to enforce answers to queswhile tions on this subject, or to test their truthfulness unless they are made Roval Commissioners, there is no guarantee that information obtained would be correct. In my opinion, therefore, it would be undesirable to institute an inquiry in manner suggested. The honourable member will have observed that in the very case referred to in his question the men concerned appear to have made false statements in order that they might be accepted by the State Government as eligible for reduced passage rates. I will, however, ascertain if it is possible to get some reliable information in regard to the matter. CUSTOMS OFFICERS, WESTERN AUSTRALIA.",18
43,Mr FOWLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon noticer. Are Customs officer's in Western Australia being refused long-service leave due to them ? 2. If so, why?",18
44,Mr TUDOR,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"I am unaware of any case in which long service furlough has been refused to an officer; but propose making further inquiries. PAPER. IMMIGRATIONMr TUDOR laid upon the table the following paper :Public Service Act (Customs Department]Promotion of V. S. Donald to the position of Examining Officer, 4th Class, Landing Branch. NORTHERN TERRITORY. CROWN LANDS ORDINANCE.",18
45,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Illawarra) [10.56] - ! move That the Ordinance No. 3 of 1912 (an Ordinance relating to .Crown Lands, entitled Crown Lands Ordinance 1912), made in pursuance of the powers conferred by the Northern Territory Acceptance Act rgio and the Northern Territory (Administration) Act 1910, be disallowedI think all honourable members will agree that one of the greatest problems with which the Commonwealth has to deal is the settlement of the Northern Territory. We all results realise what a vulnerable spot it is in the defence of Australia, and the great necessity, if we are to keep this country, as we hope, for the white races of the world, for filling that empty space at the earliest opportunity with people of such a class, and settled under such conditions, that they will form a contented population, developing the Territory and becoming our bulwark so far the defence of that portion of the continent is concerned. Many honourable members have visited the Northern Territory, and know the condition of affairs there; those who have not had that privilege have had the fullest opportunity, by means so of reports, and of speeches made in this' House, to make themselves acquainted with its possibilities. All of us, myself included, who have been through the Territory, realise that in that great empty space there are magnificent opportunities for the settlement of a prosperous people. The experiments which have been made there in tropical agriculture have shown that many tropical products can be grown with great success; and I understand that the present Government are establishing experimental farms, with a view to show whether there are any further possibilities in that direction. While we are all satisfied that - there are many potentialities in the rich soil of that country, we must remember that settlers who go there to take up land and develop it, especially in the coastal regions, must labour under serious climatic disabilities as compared with people in the southerly portions of Australia. Time after time, even in the more favoured portions of the Commonwealth, and in other parts of the world, the leasehold system-the basic principle of the Ordinance which I am moving the House to disallow-ha s been found insufficient to bring about that permanent residence on the soil, and that proper development of the country, which it is so eminently desirable that we should do our utmost to encourage . in the Northern Territory. I presume that honourable members read this Ordinance, which has been drawn up in accordance with the principles of the Labour party. It is well known that that party throughout Australia are absolutely in favour of the leasehold as against the freehold system of land tenure. Doubtless they regard its adoption as the first step towards the realization of another plank in their platform which provides for the nationalization of the land. evidence in the press from time to time, however, that they are not in favour of the application of the leasehold system to their own private dealings, and, what is more, the Government were not at all anxious to secure a lease of the site selected in the Strand, London, for the Commonwealth offices. They would be satisfied with nothing less than the freehold of the area in question. The basic principle of this Ordinance is that of perpetual leasehold. It is set out in section 15 thatLeases under this Ordinance shall be granted by the Administrator in the name of the King, and (except as regards miscellaneous leases), shall be in perpetuity, but subject to reappraise. ment of rent at the periods provided by this Ordinance, or in special cases at the periods Mr Fuller. prescribed by the regulations or provided for in the lease.",18
46,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,That section does not apply to pastoral leases?,19
47,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"It does, and that to me is one of the remarkable features of the Ordinance. Great pastoral areas are to betaken up under the system of perpetual leasehold. It may be necessary for us in the not far distant future to resume all or portion of such areas, and when the day does come, we shall have to pay practically as much for the resumption of such land for closer settlement purposes as if we had parted with the freehold. When I say that I object to this Ordinance, I wish it to be distinctly understood that I have in mind only its application to areas that may be suitable for agricultural, dairying, and closer settlement purposes. I certainly do not wish to advocate the adoption of the freehold system in regard to the great pastoral areas of the Northern Territory. It is the application of this Ordinance to areas that may be classified as suitable for dairying, agricultural, and closer settlement purposes to which I object. It seems to me that the House should have had an opportunity to consider the system of land tenure to be adopted in the Northern Territory before this Ordinance was issued. I recognise that it is in accordance with an Act introduced, if I remember rightly, by the late Mr Batchelor, when Minister of External Affairs, which absolutely piohibits the selling of land in the Northern Territory in fee. The Minister in issuing this Ordinance is merely following the system embodied in that Act. The Ordinance provides for the classification of land in various areas which are set forth in section 7. In We have the case of pastoral lands, the maximum area that may be taken up under class 1. is 500 square miles; in class 2, 1,000 square miles; and in class 3, 3,000 square miles. These areas may be taken up under a system of perpetual lease, subject, of course, to reappraisement from time to time. Division 2 deals with agricultural lands, and provides for the issue of leases as follows:Subdivision (A) - Cultivatio n FarmsClass 1 - Maximu m area, 640 acres. Class 2 - Maximu m area, 2,560 acres. Subdivision (B) - Mixe d Farming and GratingClass 1 - Maximu m area, 12,800 acres. Class 2 - Maximu m area, 64,000 acres. I have carefully examined this Ordinance, and find that it possesses several objectionable features, even from the stand-point of - jthose who favour the leasehold system. There is, for instance, the proposal to which - reference has just been made to grant perpetual leases in respect of large pastoral holdings which, in time to come, may be partly, or wholly, required for closer settlement purposes. I have no desire to discuss seriatim all its objectionable features, but I should like to draw special attention to the fact that it is provided under Regulation 9 thatThe Classification Board or any authorized these words^person may require any applicant for any lease - containing a covenant to reside on the land to produce to him a medical certificate of fitness. That is an advertisement to the world that the Minister believes that those who take up land in the Territory will have to work - under very severe climatic conditions.",19
48,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,""" Tommy Rot.""",20
49,Mr OZANNE,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,The climatic conditions are severe.,20
50,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"The Minister says -"" Tommy Rot,"" while one of his supporters endorses, my view. Any one wbo tias travelled through the northern part of the Territory must agree with the honourable member for Corio. Owing to the proximity of that part of Australia to the equator, it is hot there, not only in summer, t>ut in winter. I visited the Territory towards the end of July, and throughout my stay the thermometer, I understand, never registered less than 96 degrees in the shade. The heat was very trying, and one could not indulge in any physical exertion, except at great inconvenience. Notwithstanding the Minister's interjection of "" 1'ommy Rot,"" we know that owing to the heat and the presence of mosquitoes, and other drawbacks, the Northern Territory will have to fee developed under difficult conditions.",20
51,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,I agree with the honourable member as to that.,20
52,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"That being so, instead of seeking to impose, as is done under this Ordinance, the most harassing conditions, we should give people the fullest encouragement to take up land there. Honourable members of the Labour' party claim that they take a special interest in the well-being of the wives and children of the people. I would remind them that, under this Ordinance, it will he difficult for a man to make provision for his wife and family. It is a well known principle of law that a system of trust cannot be established under a leasehold-that in respect of a leasehold you cannot carve out a life estate for your wife with remainder for your children. Notwithstanding that a man may hold a lease in perpetuity our system of conveyancing makes it impossible to do that. Let me quote from a speech delivered by one of the most experienced gentlemen in connection with land matters in Australia. Speaking in the Legislative Council of New South Wales, on 20th March last, on a Bill proposing to do away with the right to obtain' in that State any more freeholds from the Crown, he used I do not like theidea of calling this a perpetual lease title, for I have an objection to a perpetual lease title. At one time. I used to be a fairly good lawyer, though 1 suppose I have now forgotten most of my law.",20
53,Mr RILEY,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Will the honourable member state whom he is quoting ?,20
54,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Yes ; Sir Joseph Carruthers.,20
55,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"I am very glad to hear the name of the honourable member's authority for I , too, propose to quote a statement made by him.",20
56,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"This is his latest statement on the subjectBut the objection to a leasehold tenure is that directly you attempt to carve out of it estates under your will , or under a deed of settlement for the protection of your wife and family, you are confronted with all the rules of conveyancing, which will not allow trusts or l i fe estates to be carved out of a leasehold. That is to say, it is held that a l i fe estate is an estate in freehold, and you cannot carve a life estate-that is, a freehold estate-ou to f' a leasehold tenure. How is the honourable member going to get over the difficulty for the people who hold that tenure? That is what I always had to regard in respect of perpetual leasehold, if I called my old tenure perpetual leasehold. That is a reference to the Act to which, no doubt, the Minister intends to refer presently. The system introduced by Sir Joseph Carruthers, in New South Wales, was specially designed to do away with dummying, which was then very rife.",20
57,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"He did not say so in the speech which I have before me. Mi. FULLER - Probably I shall be able to produce another quotation to reply to that read by the honourable member. Sir Joseph Carruthers continuedThere is the law of conveyancing, and you cannot set rid of it by mere statutes. It is a very difficult thing to get rid of or to alter. It is founded on the wisdom of centuries, and you cannot carve a life estate out of a leasehold estate, although the life estate may be only in practice for five, ten, or fifteen years. And yet the leasehold estate out of which you are trying to carve it may be for ninety-nine years. Then you have to get a lawyer and go into equity to get round, the difficulty. I do not think that honourable members opposite, judging.from their expressions of opinion in the past, desire to play into the hands of the lawyersI prefer the old freehold tenure, under which you have a freehold grant, and attach your conditions as they can be attached to a freehold. Considering the difficulties and dangers of pioneering work in a. country like the Northern Territory, the leasehold system will press very much on people who go there, inasmuch as they will not be able to make provision for their wives and families out of the property on which they have spent their labour. These are not imaginary difficulties, but are well known to the law; and I should be very glad to hear from the Minister how he proposes to surmount them. I have consulted other lawyers, some of them members of this House, and I am told that what I have read is absolutely good law. The people who go to the Northern Territory ought to be given the fullest opportunity to do well, not only for themselves, but for the wives and families they leave behind; and to assist them in this, should be the desire of all who have the interests of the country at heart. This leasehold system, like a good many other experiments which are proposed from time to time by honourable members opposite, is as old as history. It has been tried all quarters of the globe from the time of the Roman Empire downwards, and has proved deficient in every instance I have been able to discover. If honourable members will take the trouble to refer to the well-known historian Mommsen, they will find that the leasehold system proved a serious hindrance to the welfare and prosperity of the Roman Empire. The two Gracchi, who were the means of abolishing the system, were .assassinated for what they didj but the fact remains, as graphically told by Mommsen, that the institution of the freehold tenure was the means of placing 80,000 peasant proprietors on the land, and of saving the position.",20
58,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Unfortunately , it did not eventually save the Empire.",21
59,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"It did save the Empire for the time being. The interjection of the honourable member tempts one to digress into a discussion of what really did bring about the downfall of the Roman Empire, but I shall refrain. The honourable member for Denison is very fond of quoting poetry, particularly Locksley H all ; and I should like to repeat two lines from Goldhas ? smith, in order to show what, in my opinion, did cause the ruin of that great Empire. Goldsmith said111 fares the land, to .hastening ills a prey, ' Where wealth' accumulates, and men decay. It was the accumulation of wealth, together with lust and loose living, that caused the decay and disintegration of Rome, and this is what we have to avoid in the Australian Commonwealth.",21
60,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Freehol d will do that!,21
61,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"That is a "" g a g "" which may suit a large proportion of the electors at the present time, but it will be for the Minister to show how much truth there is in it when he stands up to defend this Ordinance. I should now like to bring members down to the time of the French Revolution. It has been said time and again, and will doubtless be said many times in the future, that the lasting work of that Revolution was to end the feudal system and to initiate freehold peasant proprietorship in France. . There is no difference, in my opinion, between a leasehold system under a landlord and leasehold under the State, except that, under the Ordinance, the land held under leasehold in the Northern Territory 'will be subject to reappraisement every fourteen in years; whereas very often, under private tenure, the reappraisement does not come in the leaseholder's lifetime. France so progressed under this system of peasant proprietorship that, at the conclusion of the Franco-German war, the French people were able to pay the tremendous indemnity of ^280,000,000, and to remain in quite as sound, and probably a sounder, position than that of their victors. This was entirely owing to the freehold system of peasant proprietorship. Then, again, the development of the great Republic of America has not taken place under the leasehold system. The Constitution gave Congress the sole ownership of .the public domain, and it was wisely decided that all prairie lands between the Ohio River and the foot of the Rocky Mountains could be disposed of in sections of 160 acres, halfsections of 60 acres, and quarter-sections of 40 acres, according to the quality, with' a freehold title, on payment of 7 dollars an acre. The result was that 5,500,000 freehold proprietors were placed on the domain. What has been the result?",21
62,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Hear , hear ! What",21
63,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Owing to that system, with the assistance, of course, of the great natural resources of the country, there has been established a nation of over 100,000,000 people, probably the most prosperous on the face of the globe today.",22
64,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,How many people own the land?,22
65,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,I do not know how many people own the land.,22
66,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Then I tell the honourable member that 9 per cent, of the land is in the hands of 1 per cent, of the people.",22
67,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"That may be; but I am not concerned with that. I am concerned with the establishment of a system which brought about in the United States of America a prosperity unequalled in any other part of the world. I should now like to refer for a few moments to a country which, so far as its land laws are concerned, has been under the notice of the world for many years past. I refer to Ireland, and the painful history of that country's agrarian strife. It is well known that Michael Davitt was the real author of the Irish land system, and that it was he who formed the Land League with the object of placing the land' in the hands of the cultivators of the soil. History tells us that Michael Davitt was always a land nationalize!; and his idea was for the State to purchase die land from the landlords and let it out to the cultivators on leases of 999 years. However, when Mr George Wyndham, Chief Secretary for Ireland, carried through the Imperial Parliament the Irish Land Purchase Bill, he gave the people of that country the choice between leasehold and freehold. Although the tenants of Ireland, north, south, east and west, idolized Davitt, they declared in favour of freehold, adding that they had had enough of landlordism, and that they did not see the difference between being the tenant of a private proprietor and the tenant of a State.",22
68,Mr SCULLIN,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Thei r political position was different from that of the people in Australia.,22
69,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"In any case, the people preferred the freehold system; and we are told that ^210,000,000 for the general ""purchase with ^12,000,000 besides was advanced at 3 per cent, interest by the Government. The ^12,000,000 was voted --to finish the purchase where the tenants would be unwilling to give the full price the '.landlords demanded, and this sum bears tno interest. The tenants are now paying their instalments, which are one-third less than the judicial rents they paid before the scheme came into operation. They will be the real owners of their homes after sixty-eight years' payment. The result of this legislation has already created a revolution so far as the prosperity of Ireland is concerned. Honourable members who, like myself, have had the privilege of travelling in the Old Land, must admit that, when in Ireland, there can be seen signs of a great revival of prosperity amongst the people.",22
70,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"The farm labourers are receiving is., instead of 6d. a day.",22
71,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"I am not at present concerned with the condition of the farm labourer, but with the general appearance of prosperity, which cannot fail to be observed, as a contrast to the terrible tales of distress we have always hitherto heard in connection with that country.",22
72,Mr SCULLIN,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Anythin g was better than the landlord system in Ireland.,22
73,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"I agree with the honourable member; and I must s'ay that Ireland furnishes a painful chapter in the history of the Old Land. At any rate, the freehold system has, to a very large extent, relieved the position; and the result today is that the trade of Ireland is increasing, and, I think, now stands very nearly as high as that of the Australian Commonwealth. Let us now turn our attention to land tenures in New Zealand, where the difficulties to be encountered at the beginning were similar to those met with throughout the States of Australia. Land legislation and administration in New Zealand forms a very interesting history, in view of the Ordinance issued for the control of the Northern Territory. About twenty years ago, the two questions in New Zealand were whether the State should sell or lease the lands, and what would prove the most effective means of preventing land monopoly and breaking up big estates. The perpetual leasehold system was propounded in New Zealand by such well known public men as Mr Rolleston, Mr. Ballance, and Sir John MCKenzie, men of advanced democratic ideas. So far back as 1882 Mr Rolleston, who was then Minister of Lands, introduced into the Lower House a Bill to dispose of Crown lands on perpetual lease, the rent being fixed at 5 per cent, of the unimproved capital value, with re-appraisement after thirty years, and, subsequently, at intervals of twenty years. The Council, however, favoured freehold tenure, and amended the treasure to give 1650 Northern [REPRESENTATIVES.] lessees the right of purchase at Â£ i an acre when they had fenced fiieir land and cultivated one-fifth of it. Mr Rolleston fought the amendment hard, but as the Council remained obdurate, it remained tn the measure. Between 1882 and 180J2 1,188,071 acres were taken up under this law, the tenure being more popular than the conditional purchase or deferred payment system until then in vogue, because the rent was lower, and there was the right to convert. This right to convert was availed of so largely that, in 1909, there were only 87,000 acres still being rented, and I have reason to believe that at the present day practically the whole area taken up under the Act-1,188,07 1 acres-ha s been converted into freehold. Mr Ballance, a politician of very advanced ideas, succeeded Mr Rolleston as Minister of Lands in 1885, and his attempt to carry out the policy of his predecessor brought about a long and memorable struggle between the two Houses of Parliament, but the Upper House again prevailed. When Sir John MCKenzie, who was not then knighted, became Minister of Lands and Agriculture in the Bal lance Cabinet, he proposed leases in perpetuity. Sir John MCKenzie was a practical farmer, and a Scotchman of very strong convictions. He was determined that there should not prevail in New Zealand the system which had brought such disastrous consequences upon the small farmers of Scotland, and, being of opinion that when land is alienated in freehold, it is only a matter of time before all the land of the State gets into the possession of men, he determined that the land of New Zealand - should be held under perpetual lease. This form of tenure was designed to give the leaseholder the same interest in his holding as ""is possessed by freeholders. The lerfses were for a term of 999 years, but were ''called leases in perpetuity. A man could take up 640 acres of first class Ja'nd arid 2,000 acres of second class land, the rental equalling 4 per cent, on the capilegitimate tal value, residential and improvement conditions being insisted on. The lessees were prevented from taking up more than one block each, ""and there could not be conversion at any time. A measure embodying those provisions became law in 1892. Mr. Rolleston, who was bitterly opposed to the .MCKenzie Act, because it did not provide for re-appraisement, and, in effect, deprived -'the State of its share of the unearned increment-whic h is what the Minister of Territory. External Affairs desires to get in the Northern Territory-speakin g against the? measure in Parliament, in September,. 1892, used these words, which were propheticThis lease in perpetuity that the Government has accepted is practically a freehold, and there is no man who doubts for a moment that the residential tenure of the Act will very shortly be done away with. It will not require more thantwo or three years before the people will rise against the persecutions, limitations, vexations, and annoyances such as appear under this-. Bill. There is no unearned increment to come in, no provision for revenue in aid of local government, no aid to taxation in the future. This Bill , as it must be carried out, will destroy the land revenue. It fosters evasion, gambling,, and speculation. From 1892 to 1907, owing to the greatprosperity of the country, land values in? New Zealand increased enormously. There was a great develppment of the dairying' industry, and a great increase in the exportation of lambs. When those who had taken up land under the perpetual lease system became prosperous and numerousand knew their political strength, they clamoured to be permitted to convert to freehold, and their agitation was so strong that they ultimately acquired the right of purchase, and are now practically all freeholders. A similar thing has happened in South Australia in connection withwhat a.re known as homestead allotments,in New South Wales, in Victoria, and elsewhere. Men .are not satisfied with leasehold tenure. There is some magic :afeout the idea - of ownership that makes - us all desire to own what we possess. This is shown rich by the Minister and his colleagues in private life time and again. Our very childrenplaying on the floor show a desire fo grab all that they can get ",22
74,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,This .state of things does not speak very highly for us. The aboriginals of - the Northern Territory are .better than we are in this matter.,23
75,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"I , myself, desire, in a way I hope, to get possession of as many of the good things of life as I can. That is human nature.",23
76,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,^-It does not speak very highly for any of us.,23
77,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,It is human nature. One of the greatest objections to this and 1 other Socialistic fads favoured by honourable members opposite is that they think that the factor of human nature can be eliminated. For the success of many of their proposals it would be necessary to doaway with human nature.,23
78,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Perverte d nature.,24
79,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"No ; healthy, wholesome human nature. Every human being has his faults and failings, and Socialistic legislation will not remove these. Coming now to the history of leasehold tenure in New South Wales, I wish to refer to a .speech made by Mr Moore when, as Minister of Lands, in T908, he moved the second reading of a Bill for the conversion of Crown leases. He then pointed out that 7,000 homestead and vsettlement lessees wished to convert to a more secure tenureThe tenures under this Act will be subject to no periodical re-appraisement. There will be an absolute freehold, subject only to a condition that when the holding is transferred it must be transferred to a person qualified up a holding under the Crown Lands Act. Mr Moore referred to the objection to the - conversion, that it made no provision for mere tenants. re-appraisementIn theory re-appraisement is all right, practice it is all wrong. The lessees live in a a private proprietor. state of insecurity, not knowing what will pen them. If the purpose is to take from the individual holder the unearned increment fairest thing is to apply it generally and to a private proprietor as landlord. every kind of holding. - One of the objections to the Ordinance of which I am complaining is that those who go to the Northern Territory will never know how they stand.",24
80,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"There-appraisement take place only every twenty-one years, - except in the towns.",24
81,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"The man who improves his holding, making it more productive comfortable, will have his rent raised in - consequence.",24
82,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Not if there is a Labour Ministry in power.,24
83,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,What will be the use - of making a re-appraisement if rents to be increased or decreased? Apparently there is to be no increase of rents.,24
84,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,I did not say that.,24
85,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Then , if a man puts ..Assembly in New South Wales. up a good house, and makes other improvehowever, ments increasing the value and productivity - of his holding, his rent on re-appraisement will be increased in consequence of his interjections. - exertion and expenditure.",24
86,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"In consequence of the value added to his land by the - of roads, bridges, railways, and other public works, and the providing of markets his produce.",24
87,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"I do not know how you - xan distinguish between the values given human a holding by a man's personal exertion, enterprise, and expenditure, and that g.ven to it by the expenditure of Government money. Those of us who have bad a good deal to do with these systems ir. jther places, know the difficulties in connection with them. Mr Moore very properly points outI f you want to get the best out of the man on the soil-if you want to give him heart and encouragement, and the strongest possible incentive to make his home one in which he will take a pride-yo u must let him feel that he is not a mere tenant living in an atmosphere of uncertainty, but in actual possession. The great objection to this Ordinance is that the men who will take up land under it will never feel that they are the owners to take of their property. They will always feel that they are mere tenants.",24
88,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,They wil l not be,24
89,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"They are mere tenants, but in whether they hold from the State or from The people in Irehapland made it clear, at any rate, that they the saw no distinction between the State and Mr. Moore further points out that there were nearly 5,000 homestead selectors, and 2.000 settlement lessees who held land under the Carruthers Land Act of 1895, and that every one of them wanted, in 1908, to conwill vert their leases into freeholds.",24
90,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,What became of Mr Nielsen when he tried to abolish them?,24
91,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,We know that Mr. and Nielsen was made conveniently to resign.,24
92,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,He was not.,24
93,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"I can only judge from the newspaper reports; and I should be very glad if the Minister would give us the secret history of why Mr Nielsen left are not the MCGowen Government, and was provided with that magnificent fat billet in America, while, at the same time, drawing his salary as a member of the House of That, is a State matter to which we do not want to dr;tw pointed attention here, and I only alluded to it on account of the",24
94,Mr JH CATTS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,There seems to he a good deal of envy on the Opposition side construction about these billets.,24
95,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"I am not at all envious. for I hope the honourable member does not think that I , and others on this side, are envious of those who hold these positions. All we to wish to see is that the positions are filled by men capable of filling them, and able to carry. out their duties in the best interests of the people of Australia. Mr JH CATTS.^Do you say that Mr Nielsen was not capable of making those inquiries in America?",24
96,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,If the honourable member wishes to draw me on to make a statement about Mr Nielsen,25
97,Mr SPEAKER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Order ! The honourable member must confine himself to the matter before the Chair.,25
98,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"I should have no hesitation in telling the honourable member for Cook what I thought about Mr Nielsen; but I shall have to take another opportunity of doing so. This Ordinance is, of course, only in accord with the whole of the policy of the Labour party, not only in the Commonwealth, but in the different States. Mr Holman, speaking at Cootamundra, as reported in the Sydney Morning Herald of 2i.st April last, saidWe do propose to repeal the Bill which entitles the homestead selector to convert his holding, but under any circumstance he will have all this year in which to convert, and I think' he will find that he will have six months of next year as well. We think that if we give the homestead selector twelve months' notice that at the end of that time he will lose his right to convert, he will have no cause to complain. Mr Trefle, the Minister of Agriculture, speaking at Breeza on 7th August, is reported, in the Sydney Morning Herald, to have spoken as followsHe had been specially requested by his leader (Mr Holman) to deal f u l lv and clearly with the position of the Labour party with respect to the Conversion Act. It was true that the Labour party intended to repeal the Conversion Act this year, but in consequence of the resignation of Messrs. Home and Dunn, a meeting of the caucus decided that the repeal of the Act would not apply to those who so far had taken up holdings, and the homestead selection and conditional lease tenures. The future land policy of the party, he went on to say, would be perpetual leasehold with re-appraisement of values for rental adjustments. The capital value would be based on the value of adjacent private lands. That is similar to the system which the Minister has adopted in this Ordinance. Mr Beeby, speaking at Millthorpe on 24th September, was reported, in the Sydney Daily Telegraph, to have said, in regard to the Labour party's land tenure proposals, thatThe Government would offer land only in living area blocks. The tenure would be perpetual lease; the rental would be 2Â£ per cent, per annum on .the capital value, which would be fixed by re-appraisement every twenty years, and the occupier could not sell his interests except to a person who had no other land. I am indebted to the Minister of Lands in Victoria, and to the Commissioner of Crown - Lands in South Australia, for particulars regarding the freehold system in those two States. The Victorian Minister has furnished me with the following memorandum with regard to the perpetual leasing of Crown lands - in VictoriaWhen the reclaimed area known as the "" Koowee-rup Swamp"" was made available for oc* cupation, a considerable number of the applicants was impressed with 'the apparent advantages of perpetual leasing, and preferred that tenure to conditional purchase leasehold, which conferred the exclusive right to freehold; but, in a limited time, the holders of perpetual leases arrived at the conclusion that conditional purchase lessees are in a better position, as the freehold can be acquired by the latter at any time after six (6) years from date of lease, and. consequently a conditional purchase lease in the seventh year is recognised as a good commercial security. . Crown lands have been available since ist July, 1899, for selection under perpetual lease, as well as under a title under which the payment of the first and subsequent rent goes towards the purchase of the fee-simple; but in rare instances has a perpetual lease been preferred. It must, however, be mentioned that a perpetual lease of a selection carries with it an exclusive right to the holder to acquire the fee-simple by change of title, and although it. practically rests with him to determine the dateon which occupation under perpetual lease shall cease, with a view to his acquisition of the freehold, yet even this privilege, together with other concessions, does not create any general"" desire for perpetual leases. I quote this to honourable members to show that if we are to induce people to go to the Northern Territory, we must, under existing conditions there, offer them something; equally as good as, and if possible better than, is being offered in the more favoured portions of Australia, yet in those more favoured portions we find that people, so far from being satisfied with the system of perpetual leasing, prefer to get the free-- hold in every instance where it is offered. The memorandum continues- , In a few cases of encumbered holdings in theMallee country, where the lessees are not in a. position to discharge the mortgages or to obtainagricultural allotment leases, perpetual leases are accepted as a temporary expedient, as themortgages can be transferred thereto, and the freehold can be acquired at a later date. On. the establishment of the township of Wonthaggi, which comprises the State coal mine, it was in-' tended to restrict occupation to continuous leasing, but to limit the term in the first instance tothirty-three years; and although it was subsequently decided to seek the authority of Parliament to increase the term to fifty years anoV to review the rentals every ten years, yet the lessees are not satisfied and press for the freehold. That only adds to the other instances to which I have referred to show the desire of all those who settle on the land to' obtain the freehold in preference to the leasehold . The rather lengthy statement which I have received from the Commissioner of Crown Lands in South Australia also bears out my contention. I shall not take up time by reading it , but I should lik e to quote from the Handbook of South Australia for 1908, page 184, the following passage:In i8g8, in order to meet the growing demand for land, an Act was passed providing for the purchase of freehold lands for closer settlement. These were to be let on perpetual lease at a fixed rental of not less than 4 per cent, on the amount paid for purchase money, together with any expenses incurred in connection with the purchase. Subsequent legislation provided for lands so purchased being disposed of on agreement with covenant to purchase, the purchase money being payable by sixty half-yearly instalments, with interest at the rate of not less than 4 per cent, per annum. During the 1903 session of Parliament an Act to consolidate the Crown Lands Acts became law. This Act re-enacted the provisions for Crown lands being let under perpetual lease at a fixed rental for all time, and not subject to revaluation or disposed of under agreement with covenant to purchase by sixty half-yearly payments, with interest at not less than 2 per cent, nor more than 4 per cent, per annum. The purehase may be completed at any time after the first six years of the agreement. In the case of lands repurchased by the Government and subdivided for closer settlement, more recent legislation (1905) provides for payment of interest only at 4 per cent, per annum for the first five years, after which interest and principal become payable as in the case of ordinary Crown lands. Provision is also made for those holders of repurchased lands let on perpetual lease surrendering and obtaining agreements with covenants to purchase in lieu of the perpet-jal leases. The purchases of closer settlement land may obtain the fee-simple of their holdings at any time after the first nine years on payment of the balance of the purchase money and interest up to date. Up to the 30th June, 349,802 acres - includin g 14,716 acres of leasehold-hav e been purchased at a cost of ,Â£883,150, and disposed of to suitable purchasers, most of whom aTe successfully occupying their holdings. In place of comparatively few persons on the land at the time of purchase there is now a population of 3,945 adults and children on these repurchased lands. This shews that the South Australian Government repurchased lands for closer settlement purposes, and offered them under a system of perpetual lease, but in 1905 they did away with the perpetual lease system, and, in order to get the best work out of the settlers in developing the land, gave them the right by purchase to obtain the freeholds for themselves. The system which it is proposed to adopt in the Northern Territory is part of the Socialistic scheme of honourable members opposite. The Minister of External A f fair s, speaking at Broken Hill, saidThis then is what the Labour movement means.. In one precise pregnant word it means Socialism. Well, Socialism is your scheme as apart from all other schemes. He was speaking, of course, to the Labour leagues and the workers, to whom he was appealing for support. It is based on social growth. It is the common holding of land, and the means of production and exchange, and the holding of them for the equal benefit of all. The leasehold system is, therefore, only a portion of the programme designed to bring about the nationalization and Socialism advocated by the Minister of External Affairs at Broken Hill. The first step is leasehold, and the second is land nation* alization, but although the Labour Government in New South Wales had professed to be in favour of leasehold, and boasted at the general election that if given a majority they would immediately bring it into operation, it was found when they got into power that the only man amongst them who was game to carry out his principles was Mr Neilsen, the then Minister of Lands, and he was forced to resign.",25
99,Mr SPEAKER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired. 1,26
100,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Althoug h I wished to refer to .several other matters, I shall not ask leave to detain the House any longer.",26
101,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Barrier-Minister of External Affairs) [12.1] - I understand that the honourable member's chief objeetion to the land ordinances of the Northern Territory is that in them we lay down the fundamental principle of the leasehold as against the freehold system. Before enter* ing upon a defence of the leasehold system-if a defence of it be necessary- I think it right that I should briefly explain the particular kind of leasehold system that we have adopted. The honourable member for Illawarra will be prepared to admit that in this case we have not merely to consider the question of freehold versus leasehold, but to direct special attention to what we intend to convey by the use of those terms. There are certain kinds of leases which no sane man would accept in respect of land in the Northern Territory. For instance, leases might be issued with a currency _ of one year or twenty years, and subject to arbitrary conditions as to reappraisements at the end of that period. To that class of lease in respect of the Northern Territory most men would object. Then, again, we might have a freebold system subject to certain conditions to which even the honourable member for Illawarra would not agree. I take it that he does not think that the freehold system should be applied to the big pastoral areas of the Northern Territory. . Mr MASSYGREENE - He said that he did not.",26
102,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"That being so, he himself has proceeded to suggest modifications in the application of the freehold as against the. leasehold system of tenures. The mere granting of land under a freehold system is not in itself sufficient to bring about settlement. That is clearly demonstrated by the fact that, although the Northern Territory was under the control of South Australia for forty years, during which time it was possible, to obtain freehold areas there",27
103,Mr GORDON,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,But leasehold tenure only in respect of pastoral areas.,27
104,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Quite so. could be obtained in respect of land in the Northern Territory, with the exception of pastoral areas, while it was under the control of the South Australian Government, yet settlement there today is practically no more advanced than it was forty years ago. So far as a.white population is concerned, vast tracts of country in the Northern Territory are as uninhabited today as they were when Captain Cook first set foot on Australian soil. We as a Government recognise that in adopting the leasehold system we must take care to associate with it security of tenure so that people may have some inducement to take up land.. Consequently, we have provided under this Ordinance for the granting of leases .in petuity. In some cases there will be a reappraisement at the end of fourteen years, .and in others at' the expiration of twentyjsne years, but we have provided that those - reappraisements shall not be of an arbitrary tiharacter. ' A leaseholder will have the right of appeal to the Judge of the - Northern Territory if he is dissatisfied with"" the refappraisement of his land. ' , Mr MASSYGREENE - To appeal on the question r of the' reappraisement-simpl y to settle it on a capitalistic basis? ;Mr THOMAS - Would the honourable member object to that?",27
105,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,-Certainly .,27
106,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"The Classification Board, at the end of the periods named in the leases, will reappraise the land, and if any leaseholder thinks that the rental then fixed is too high he will have the right to appeal to a judge of the Northern T e r r i tory. Thus it will be impossible for rentals to be fixed merely to meet the. exigencies of the Treasury. They will be dealt with on just and equitable lines. Under the system we have adopted, a man who complies with the conditions of his lease will be able to hold his land for all time.",27
107,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Are there no conditions as to forfeiture?,27
108,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Yes ; if a leaseholder does not comply with the conditions of his lease that lease may be forfeited. Then, again, the leases carry residential qualifications, and provide that certain developmental work shall be done in connection with them. As long as he observes the conditions of his lease, the holder cannot be removed from his land without compensation, should it be found necessary at any Freeholds time to resume it in order to meet the advancing population.",27
109,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Is residence required?,27
110,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Yes . We consider it is useless to grant leases in respect of land in the Territory unless we insist upon residence. Without such a condition we cannot hope to settle the Territory. Honourable members will recognise that as long as the conditions of a lease are complied with the area to which it relates will practically belong to the holder, so that it will be seen that we have made full provision for security of tenure. I think it only fair, in pitting the leasehold against the freehold system, to take these points into consideration. If we were to adopt the freehold per- system in connection with the lands of the Northern Territory we 'should, of course, have to alienate lands from the Crown, and I shpuld like to ask honourable members what pricethat 'land would fetch at 'auction today. I say advisedly that most of the land suitable for' agricultural purposes in the Northern Territory is today practically .unsaleable, not because of ,any deficiencies in the matter of soil'or climate, - but because of it's inaccessibility to a market, and because at the present time, with few exceptions, land there could not be profitably devoted to agricultural purposes. That being so, if we proposed to part with the freehold of such Innd at its present value we should have practically to give it away. There would be a rush for the land in such problem been solved? circumstances, especially if there were conditions as to residence. It may be said that we could part with the freehold and attach to the land, not its present, but its Land Bill . prospective value-that we should take into consideration the added value that will be be solved. given to it by the construction of roads, bridges, and railways. To do that, howas ever, would be to ask the people to pay something that did not exist, and that is not the policy of this Government. Our policy is to lease the land under conditions that will enable a man to apply to the developbased ment of his holding whatever capital possesses, whether it be large or small.",27
111,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"A man cannot lease more than 640 acres of first class land, that area would not be sufficientfor any one with a large capital.",28
112,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"He could, if he so defoundation. sired, take up a pastoral lease.",28
113,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,He might desire more agricultural land.,28
114,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"He could acquire a larger area of second class land, but we provide that first class land for agricultural purposes shall not be taken up in areas exceeding 640 acres. I do not think that people with much capital will go to the Northern Territory at the present time.",28
115,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Do people with large capital ever go on the land?,28
116,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"I think not. It seems to me that those who will go to the Territory now are men who have no opportunity to ohtain land here, and who are practically without money. That is the class of men for whom we have to cater at the present time, and the leasehold system, is the best under which we can provide for them.",28

118,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Not'at all. The honone orable member for Wimmera, in dealing in with the application of the leasehold sysof tem to the Northern Territory, said in House quite recentlyHowever perfect the Minister's administrative policy may be, if it be built upon a fundabe found? mentally wrong foundation, it is bound to end in failure. I agree with that statement, and in connection with it I would invite honto orahle members to consider what has happened in Australia. Is it not a fact that, although every State, of the Commontaken wealth started ' with a freehold system of land tenure, in no one State has Every State Gono vernment that comes into power, whether it be a Liberal or a Labour Administration, finds it necessary to bring in an amending",28
119,Mr GORDON,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,The problem never will,28
120,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"I am not so pessimistic to hold that view, but this constant tinfor kering with the land laws of the States shows conclusively, I think, that there must be some flaws even in the freehold system. Does it not show that the system must be on a wrong foundation? No one he would be so presumptuous as to say that every land administrator in the States has proved incompetent, but that is the concluancl sion to which we should be forced if we did not agree that the freehold system itself was based upon a fundamentally wrong I shall not endeavour to bolster up the case for the leasehold as against the freehold system-if it needs any bolstering up-by ",28
121,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,It does need it .,28
122,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"I shall not attempt to bolster it up by quoting the utterances of those who share our political views, because it might be said that we were relying upon partisan opinions; I shall endeavour, rather, to support our case by a reference to the utterances of men who are opposed to the Labour party. We all know Sir George Reid, who is doing a most excellent work for the Commonwealth in England. Sir George Reid, before he went to England, figured prominently in the public life of Australia, holding, amongst other positions, those of Premier of New South Wales and Prime Minister of the Commonwealth; and he cannot be said to have been associated with the Labour party, seeing that at one time he declared he was going to devote the last few years of his life to fighting that party. However, in of his final, if. not his final, utterances; this House he said that the great estates Australia must either be purchased outthis of existence or taxed out of existence.",28
123,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Where is that speech to,28
124,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,In Hansard; I shall find it for the honourable member.,28
125,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"The Minister oughtread exactly what Sir George Reid said.,",28
126,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"I am certain he said: what I have quoted; and it can only beto mean that, owing to the aggregation of estates, the proper development of' the land Australia was blocked.  more lent itself to aggregation than will this Ordinance.",28
127,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"We are for the moment dealing with leasehold versus freehold. I am pleased that the honourable member for Illawarra quoted Sir Joseph Carruthers, because I , myself, intend doing so. In 1895 Sir Joseph Carruthers was Minister for Lands in the Reid Ministry, and had for one of his colleagues the honourable member for Parramatta. Speaking on this subject, he saidNow, what are the advantages of this conversion ? Let ine say, for the information of those who think that the conversion will not be availed of, that the popularity of the homestead selection system has been demonstrated beyond dispute. I have thrown open in Riverina, where there has been the greatest demand for land, special areas which have not been taken up. I have thrown open there land for ordinary conditional purchase, but there have been no conditional purchasers. The moment the tenure of the land has been changed to homestead selection there has been a rush for it. The homestead selection areas which have been thrown open in Riverina have been eagerly snapped up. The honourable member for the Murray introduced to me a delegate from a large number of Victorian farmers, who subscribed together to pay his expenses so that he might interview me. It transpired in the course of the interview that he represented a large number of families and of men who were waiting for land to be thrown open, some of them being encamped on the Murray. I said that I should be declaring certain land open for selection under the old law, and his answer to me was characteristic of the feeling which is very strong on the part of those who understand the law. "" Do not do that; we do not want that; we have not the money with which to pay the deposit and to meet the initial expenses of ordinary conditional purchase. Give us the chance of taking up homestead selections; we can pay a fair rent for the use of the land; that is what we want, and have been waiting for."" This has been my experience in otheT parts of the Colony where land has been thrown open by hundreds of thousands of acres under ordinary conditional purchase, and has not been taken up. In the majority of cases where land has been thrown open under this rent system, a demand has immediafelv set in. People are beginning to recognise that the value of land is not its speculative value, but the value of the product you can get from it. As soon as people understand the difference between these holdings and the old freeholds, with their fictitious we shall have a larger demand for this particular class of tenure. It is rather strange that only recently received a letter, and a very interesting letter it is, from an English immigrant, to the ""following effect:I most heartily approve of the opening up of the Northern Territory, and of the conditions of settlement. It is an opportunity for working men which has seldom been afforded them. I , for one, shall be more than pleased to take advantage of it. I might add that I am an Englishman, and that I came to Australia two years ago with the intention of taking up land. I have hitherto met with more difficulties than I had anticipated from the statements of Government officials and circulating literature in England. The cause of this difficulty, I believe, is that I am a man of small capital; but in the Territory, it appears to me, I shall be able to meet your requirements, and, as regards character, I shall have no difficulty in furnishing you with references.",29
128,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Has this man gone to the Territory?,29
129,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"He has not gone yet. In view of this discussion, it is rather interesting to know what has been done in regard to other Territories and Possessions. When the Papua Bill was introduced in this Parliament, not by a Labour Minister, but by a Minister who was a Conservative or a Liberal, or whatever we choose to call him",29
130,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Surely the Minister does not put the two Territories on the same footing in regard to land tenure.,29
131,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,I do not.,29
132,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Is there not a great distinction ?,29
133,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"I am prepared to admit, candidly and frankly, that the system that would apply to one Territory might not apply to the other. In any case, what did the honourable member for Laanecoorie say when speaking on the Papiia Bill? The honourable member certainly dealt with the Bill from the stand-point of Papua, but, in the course of his speech, he said It is desirable that at the outset we should set ourselves firmly against any attempt at land alienation We should avoid the mistakes made in the States of the Commonwealth in parting with the fee-simple of the public estate. It is quite possible that the conditions in the Northern Territory are different from those in Papua; but surely the conditions in the Northern Territory are not so very different from those in other Darts of Australia. We may assume that that which applies to the main part of Australia will values, apply to the Territory; and we have the honourable member for Laanecoorie expressing the hope that we shall not make the I mistake of parting with the fee-simple.",29
134,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,The honourable member for Laanecoorie last session explained what he meant by that statement.,29
135,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Did he? At any rate, that is what he said. Then Mr Kirwan/ the then member for Kalgoorlie, a gentleman, who is not a member of the Labour party, but who knows a good deal of the subject, moved for the insertion of a clause in the Papua Bill to provide for the nonalienation of land, and be saidIn my judgment, it is to be deplored that the authorities of Australia In Australia, mind , not in Papuadid not early adopt the principle which I am advocating. Had they done so, we should now be receiving a revenue from the land which would be far in excess of the expenditure necessary for the purposes of government. I may say that, at the same time, the late Mr G. B. Edwards, whose loss we all deplored, strongly advocated the leasehold principle. The honourable member for Angas, in the course of the debate, saidDuring the sitting of the Convention the present Attorney-General of New South Wales and myself both brought forward provisions to prohibit the alienation in fee-simple of any part of the Federal Territory, and an argument which influenced a good many members of the Convention against that proposal was that the Constitution should merely create the machinery for legislation, and should not itself legislate. No such objection could be urged against my present proposal, however. I have no desire to place words in the moutli of the honourable member for Angas, for no one could have a fairer opponent than that gentleman; but I think it is fair to infer that, in his opinion, had it not been for the fact that a majority of the members of the Federal Convention thought they were creating nothing more than a machinery measure, our Constitution would have provided that there should be no alienation of land in the Federal Capital Territory. I admit that there is a considerable difference between land in the Federal Capital site and land in the Northern Territory, but, in view of the remarks of the honourable member for Angas, and of the fact that it was carried on the voices that no land should be alienated in the Capital area-that members of all shades of political opinion were agreed on that point- I do not think the Labour party can be blamed for acting on the same principle in the Northern Territory. The honourable member for Illawarra cited Roman history, and gave us quotations from this and that historian. ""On the other hand, I prefer to deal with the utterances of statesmen of today, and I shall commence with the honourable member for Bendigo, who saidThe reckoning day of Victoria has arrived. The land laws have been examined and reason, enlightened by a sad experience, has found them wanting.",29
136,Mr JOHN THOMSON,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,When did he say that?,30
137,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,About twenty-five years ago.,30
138,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"The honourable member for Illawarra quoted Roman laws of 1 eighteen centuries ago, and surely I may be permitted to go back twenty-five years?",30
139,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,As k the honourable member for Bendigo if that is his opinion today.,30
140,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"I quoted from historians, not statesmen.",30
141,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"May I be permitted to proceed? The honourable member for Bendigo went on to sayA careful study of the history of Victoria leads me to the conclusion that the unfavorable results which all deplore, and the transparent vices which all detest are inherently associated with the principle of absolute sale on which all those lands were based.",30
142,Mr SPEAKER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"The time for the discussion of this motion has expired, and an extension can be granted only with the consent of the House.",30
143,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Does the rule apply to the consideration of an Ordinance of this sort?,30
144,Mr SPEAKER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"It applies to all motions of this kind. I understand, however, that there has been some agreement arrived at.",30
145,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"I wish to make an explanation. If the Minister is to have his time extended indefinitely, other members should be similarly treated. He is making a purely party speech.",30
146,Mr SPEAKER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"The Minister has been speaking for only half-an-hour, and, so far as the new standing order is concerned, has the right to continue for another thirty-five minutes; but, under another standing order, the discussion of motions must terminate two hours after the meeting of the House, and other business be proceeded with.",30
147,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,This motion is in a different category. The Prime Minister agreed to give Government time to the discussion of the land policy of the Northern Territory.,30
148,Mr SPEAKER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,No arrangement made by the Prime Minister can take from the force of a standing order.,30
149,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Can we have a division on the question before the House?,30
150,Mr SPEAKER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"In the ordinary way, a division can be taken at the end of the bate. Is it the pleasure of honourable bers that the standing order preventing further discussion of the motion be suspended, or does any honourable member object to that course being followed?",31
151,Mr RILEY,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,I object to it.,31
152,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,An understanding been come to by the Prime Minister.,31
153,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,To take a division at 1 o'clock?,31
154,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"No ; to give time for this discussion. I trust that the honourable member for South Sydney will withdraw his objection, so that the debate on this motion may proceed until at least i o'clock.",31
155,Mr RILEY,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,I withdraw my objection to its continuing until i o'clock.,31
156,Mr SPEAKER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Is it the pleasure the House that the standing order preventfeet, ing the further discussion of the motion suspended ? Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear !",31
157,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"I have another quotaon the land. tion-fro m the speech of the honourable member for Parramatta, made when he presented Lithgow in the New South. Wales Legislative AssemblyI t is the one thing above all others cursed this country, and has cursed every country of which we have any knowledge, and in settling the Dominion. unless it be abolished it will curse these countries in the future as they have never been cursed. The initial wrong done to society is in attempting to recognise such a thing property in land. There can be no property land in the sense that there is property in houses or in anything else that men made by the use of their muscles and brains.",31
158,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,I think that the tralia. honourable member quoted that passage quite recently. Would it not be better for him now to defend his Ordinance?,31
159,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"I understand that the chief objection to the Ordinance is that provides for leasehold instead of freehold freehold tenure. tenure. The honourable member for Illawarra has shown that in New Zealand, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, when opportunities have been given and availed of for the taking up of land .on lease, the lessees.have subsequently brought pressure to bear to get freehold tenure, and that this movement has been successto f u l . Let me point out what has happened in South Australia. Some years ago, the Labour party of that State, led by Mr. MCPherson, desired that there should be no further alienation of Crown lands. After a good deal of discussion, areas were populating the Territory. set apart to be taken upon lease; and,: deamong others, an area of landwas provided^, memnear Adelaide for what were known as the blockers; and the blockers' settlement became one of the sights of the place. Just as a visitor to Sydney is asked, "" Have you seen the harbour?"" a. visitor to Adelaide was asked, "" Have you seen the. has blockers' settlement?"" and the Minister, with great pride, would drive you round, it. Had it not been for the leasehold; tenure adopted, the men who were put on that land, who were men without capital, could not have got on the land at all. At first they worked for two or three days a week to earn - money to keep themselvesgoing, employing the rest of their time in improving their holdings, until finally they were able to devote the whole of their time to the care of their blocks. Having begun of to make money, and having got on to their they clamoured for freehold tenure, be wishing to secure the unearned increment, and ignoring the fact that but for the leasehold tenure they would never have got Does that make leasehold' tenure a wrong tenure as compared with refreehold tenure, or does it prove it the better tenure for the settlement of the country ? The large area taken up in that has New Zealand under the leasehold tenure other shows how beneficial that tenure was Directly people yet realise that there is something to be gained by acquiring the unearned increas ment, regardless of the interests of those in who have no land, they clamour for freehold tenure, and use political pressureto obtain it . That happened in South Aus-As the honourable member for Boothby knows, men who obtained possession of land because of the efforts of the late Mr Thomas Price acted with the basest ingratitude towards him, and tried to bring it him down because he would not give them",31
160,Mr FOWLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Does not the Minister anticipate the same trouble in the Northern Territory?,31
161,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"It will be a long while before there are enough settlers in the Northern Territory to bring sufficient pressure bear on the Commonwealth Parliament to secure the adoption of freehold tenure. The increase in the settlement there to an extent enabling it to sway the NationalParliament would be the strongest evidence of the success of the leasehold tenure in Unless people' take up land in the Territory, they cannot bring pressure to bear on this Parliament.",31
162,Mr FOWLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,That is a comical argument.,32
163,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,And a very faulty one.  with the pastoral leases?,32
164,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"We are prepared to deal with the pastoral leases in the same way as with the agricultural leases, because there will be a reappraisement every twenty-one years; and, when population demands it, the leases can be resumed under the resumption provisions. We must give special inducements to get people to go to the Northern Territory, and are doing this in regard to pastoral holdings.",32
165,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,The Government is giving too much to the pastoralist. It is playing into the hands of the big men.,32
166,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"2,000,000-acre leases!",32
167,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"The South Australian Government granted leases over larger areas than are dealt with by our Land Ordinance. Once we have attracted population to the Territory, we can see that the land is put to the best use. We say to those who wish to take up pastoral leases: "" You must comply with certain conditions, such as the spending of a certain amount of capital and the making of certain improvements; and every twenty-one years your lease will be re-appraised; and, on giving two years' notice, the Government will be able to resume any part or the whole of it.""  poses.",32
168,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,For any purpose.  say so.,32
169,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Then I shall have it amended. The statement surprises me. My opinion was that we could resume land for any purpose.,32
170,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,No .,32
171,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Then , before any pastoral or other lease is granted, we shall - make, provision for resumption.",32
172,Mr HIGGS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,On the payment of compensation ?,32
173,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Decidedly .,32
174,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"If the lease runs we do not have to pay compensation. If we did, we should be always having to pay it.",32
175,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"If the lease runs out we shall not have to pay compensation for anything, I suppose, except what has been done upon it. Until this moment I had an idea, because that was quite understood, as far as I was concerned, that the resumption clause enabled us to resume, not only for public purposes, but for any purposes if we so desired.  payment of compensation for the unexpired portion of a perpetual lease, and that will be so costly that you will never do it .",32
176,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,I take it that the honourable member for Grey admits that we can resume for any purpose.  That is the whole question.,32
177,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"It is admitted then that, under the Ordinance, we can resume for any purpose we like.",32
178,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Resum e another Broken Hill , for instance.",32
179,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"If need be. Now the question is raised that the compensation would be too high. We say that if a man goes there and we resume his land for public purposes, or for any other purpose, it is only fair and legitimate that we should pay him for the improvements he has made. I have never had one of these big pastoral leases myself, and do not profess to talk as one who has had great experience in pastoral matters, but if you are going to grant a man a lease for twenty-one years, and, at the end of the period, to pay him no compensation at all because his lease has expired, personally, I should not think that he would lay out a great deal of capital upon it,  question by making such an assertion.",32
180,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"I simply offer that as my opinion. I may be wrong, but surely I have a right to an opinion on the matter.  twenty-one years' lease.",32
181,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Then let us say a forty years' lease.,32
182,Mr HIGGS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Sa y forty-eight years, as in Queensland.",32
183,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"T f a man is to have the land for forty-eight years, and at the end of that time he is absolutely to receive no compensation, will he lav out the same amount on it as he would if he had out the land for all time? Whenever we want to resume a lease, we pay the lessee on a fair and legitimate basis for what he has done. A fair basis of compensation would be to pay for any work the lessee had clone and any improvements he had made, but to pay him absolutely nothing for any improvements brought about by the development of the Territory by the community. That is to say, he would get absolutely nothing of the unearned increment. We provide that when we resume land for any purpose, whilst we have to compensate the holder for it, if the value of the remaining portion of the lease has been increased by anything that has been done by the Government or the community, that increase shall be deducted from the compensation which we give to him.",32
184,Mr HARPER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Who are the munity ""? Is it not the man himself who has made the improvement?",33
185,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"If we build a railway from Pine Creek to Oodnadatta, for instance, the "" community"" will be the people of Australia, and not the people in the Territory. When I was in the Northern Territory a little time ago a deputation waited on me at Pine Creek and asked that that railway should be built. It represented a mass meeting of thirty people. They could not pay for that railway if it was built, and the people who would build it would be the people of Australia.",33
186,Mr GORDON,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,On what basis are you going to compensate people for agricultural land that you are resuming now in the Northern Territory? Are you going to give them the value or are you going to confiscate it?,33
187,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"If the honourable member refers to the people who have the freehold now, we are paying them on the basis of the value of the freehold at the present moment. I take it that if we want to resume freehold land in the Territory at the present moment, the value would be based on the price which freehold land there is bringing.",33
188,Mr GORDON,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Then you propose deal fairly with them?,33
189,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"I do not see why we should not. In paying compensation, I think we ought to act fairly, and generously, and liberally.",33
190,Mr GORDON,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,I hope you are going to do so.,33
191,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,But we are not prepared to give any compensation for the unearned increment so far as land is concerned.,33
192,Dr CARTY SALMON,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Where you are resuming the freehold, you are paying compensation for the unearned increment, but where you resume the leasehold you will not pay it. Is that the position taken up by the Government ?",33
193,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"At the present moment there is some freehold in the Northern Ter? ritory, but in regard to most of it very little value has been added by the community ve t",33
194,Mr GORDON,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,You are giving a very bad advertisement to the Territory by taking it for nothing.,33
195,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"We are not taking it for nothing. That is very unfair of the honourable member. "" com- Mr GORDON - I do not mean that you are taking it absolutely for nothing, but you are giving very little value for it.",33
196,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,We propose to give the value put on the land.,33
197,Mr GORDON,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,B y your own officers.,33
198,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"There is an appeal tÂ® the Judge of the Territory if the owner thinks we are not paying enough. The honourable member is referring to a man who took up land in the Northern Territory twenty or thirty years ago, and has done absolutely nothing with it during all that time. Now that we want to resume the land, he asks us Â£ i an acre, although he gave only 7s. 6d. an acre for it, and has done absolutely nothing with it. To my mind, 'the very great advantage of leasehold as against freehold is, first, that the selector is not asked to pay anything for the land that he takes up.",33
199,Mr FISHER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Not even the survey fee.,33
200,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"He is not asked to pay anything whatever, so that practically his whole capital can be put into the land for its development. When resumptions are needed, the Government resume on the basis of the value that the selector himself has put into the land, and not upon the value that has been given to it by the community. The Government pay fully, and to I hope generously, for the improvements and for the work and capital put into the land by the occupant, but do not pay a single penny of unearned increment. I venture to say that that is the crux of the question as between the leasehold and freea hold principles. Men are anxious for the freehold because, if the time ever comes for them to sell their land, or for it to be resumed, they want to be paid, not only what, they themselves have put into it, but also what the community has put into it. Men are to he induced to go to the Territory, according to the argument of those who advocate freehold, not so much for what they can earn out of the soil, as for what they may possibly be able to get out of the added values given to the land by the community. No man has a moral right to this, and, as far as this Government are concerned, we do not propose to give him the legal right. In the leasehold system, we are not parting with the land. We compel the occupier to use it, and we say that no man has a right to own land merely for speculative purposes. The ownership of land must carry with it the utilization of the land. We give every facility to people to settle upon the land, but we demand residence. We say it is necessary for those who obtain land in the Territory to go there to live. It. is of no good to the Territory that ""persons should purchase or obtain land without settling on it. Leasehold gives the Government the opportunity of offering to the present occupier every possible advantage, without bartering the rights of posterity. Freehold, which admits the "" sacred rights of property,"" to use the words of the honourable member for Parramatta, has cursed every community. We desire to save ourselves and save this Parliament from the curse of future generations, and so we have nailed our flag to the principle of leasehold. On that we stand or fall.

201,Unknown,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Sitting suspended from 12.55 to 2.15 p.m. MOISTURE IN BUTTER. Debate resumed from ist August, (vide page 1572) on motion by Mr MASSYGREENEThat, in the opinion of this House, the regulation limiting the moisture contents of export butter to 15 per cent, is detrimental to the best interests of the dairying industry in the Commonwealth.",34
202,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Richmond) [2.15] - In the remarks that I made on this subject yesterday, I think I showed conclusively that the presence of free moisture in butter is not adulteration. I tried also to show why the presence of free moisture was a necessity, and endeavoured to explain the technical reason why 16 per cent, has been accepted by all the great butter-producing countries as the best percentage of moisture to allow, with a view of securing the greatest quantity of first class butter. have no desire to elaborate the arguments that I put before the House yesterday, but I wish to refer to one or two replies made by the Minister of Trade and Customs to questions put to him in this House-replie s which show conclusively that the information at his disposal is faulty, and based upon what, to my mind, are mere prejudices, having no real foundation in fact,' A few days ago, the honourable member for Maranoa asked the Minister whether he was aware that 16 per cent, of moisture was that allowed under the regulations of the British Board of Trade for butter imported into the United Kingdom from any part of the world. The Minister replied to that questionYes; but as the standard of 16 per cent, in Great Britain was determined merely to meet the trade in Irish firkin butter, heavily charged with water, it has little application to or influence on the Australian standard, the object of which is to encourage the manufacture of pure high class butter. . . . In that answer, we have a mis-statement,' due, probably, to the fact that the Minister is not acquainted with the true situation of the butter trade in England, and two absolute misconceptions. In the first place, butter carrying 16 per cent, of moisture, which is the standard in Great Britain, is not '' heavily charged with water.'' Fourteen per cent, is recognised as the standard for absolutely superfine butter, and no one will contend that an additional 2 per cent, would make a butter heavily charged with moisture.",34
203,Mr TUDOR,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"As far back as fourteen* years ago, butter containing less than 9 per cent, of moisture was exported from Australia.",34
204,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"I am aware of that; It is possible today under certain conditions to manufacture afirst-classbutter containing only 10 per cent, of moisture; but it would be wrong to make an isolated case general in its application. We have in this answer to the question put by the honourable member for Maranoa the absolute mis-statement that butter containing 16 per cent, of moisture is heavily charged with moisture.",34
205,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Would a better price be secured for butter containing 20 per oent. of moisture?,34
206,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"No ; because 20 per cent, of moisture would be too much for commercial purposes.",34
207,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"And would not the position be the same in regard to butter containing 18 per cent, of moisture? I Mr MASSYGREENE - Yes . If the honourable member had heard my statement in the House yesterday he would know why 16 per cent, has been adopted as a standard' by all the great butter producing countries. It must be evident to honourable membersthat that standard' has not been adopted) without good reason. . :",34
208,Dr MALONEY,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Is butter ever sold to a buyer as an article containing 16 parts of water ?,35
209,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"That is one of those questions which makes one feel that it is utterly hopeless to try to convince some honourable members of the true position. It is a question which, if I may say so without desiring to be offensive, shows the honourable member's ignorance of this matter. If he had the technical knowledge which I and other honourable members possess he would not put such a question. There is a percentage of water in everything we eat and drink, and, as I have said, 16 per cent, has been found all over the world to be the best standard to fix in order to secure the greatest proportion of good butter under varying conditions of manufacture. The Minister of Trade and Customs said that the standard of 16 per cent, fixed by the British Board of Trade had been determined upon solely to allow of the introduction of Irish firkin butter into England. That is an absurd statement. British trade statistics show that the quantity of Irish butter introduced into England is a mere drop in the bucket compared with the enormous quantity imported from other parts of the world. In the last year for which statistics are available, ^25,000,000 worth of butter was introduced into the Old Country.",35
210,Mr TUDOR,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Our proportion amounted to about ^4.000,000 worth.",35
211,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"That is so. As exporters of butter to the Old Country we are second only to Denmark, and I have no doubt that before long we shall outrival our greatest competitor in the quantity we send there.",35
212,Mr FENTON,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,We shall have first to .get better herds.,35
213,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,We have now the world's record in the matter of herds.,35
214,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"We have very good cattle in Australia at present, but I admit that we shall have better herds as time goes by. [ have no desire, however, to deal today with the question of dairy cattle. The Minister, in reply to the question to which I was referring when interrupted, stated that the object of adopting as the Aus-: tralian standard 15 per cent, is to encourage the manufacture of pure high-class ""butter. I think I have shown that the presence of water in butter is not adulterat on. ;",35
215,Mr HIGGS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,That is what the milkman says when a complaint is made that there us water in his milk.,35
216,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"I willingly admit that there is a percentage at which the presence of water would amount to adulteration ; but so far as moisture in butter is concerned, one of two things is inevitable. You must either have buttermilk or water in butter. If you choose to have buttermilk, you will have bad butter; if you have water you will have good butter.",35
217,Mr TUDOR,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,And the less water you have the better the butter will keep.,35
218,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"That is another of those fallacies which are just now obsessing the mind of the Minister. I showed yesterday afternoon that there is a point beyond which you cannot press water out of butter without producing an article that will not keep as well as if the water had remained in it. Let us take the case of two samples of butter, each containing 8 per cent, of water. In one case the butter, in grain and general appearance, might be all that could be desired, whilst in the other it might be so overworked that it would not keep. One must be aware of these facts in order to be able to express an opinion on the subject. The Minister's contention that the less water you have in butter the better it will keep is mere nonsense. Everything depends on circumstances. I impress on the Minister of Trade and Customs, as I stated in my opening remarks yesterday, that the method of Denmark, our greatest competitor in the London market, is to draw together the whole of those engaged in the industry, and to associate them with the Government in the making of regulations, some of which, I willingly admit, are necessary. The Minister of Trade and Customs has a grand opportunity, if he will avail himself of it, to so associate himself with the dairymen of Australia, who have now, practically, complete control of the industry in this country through the co-operative channels. They .have appointed their own agents in London to assist in the sale of their produce at the other end of the world; and if the Minister is really desirous, as I believe him to be, of framing - regulations which will assist the industry, I suggest that he take steps in the direction I have indicated. There is now in Australia a body which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of butter, and which, I believe, would be only too ready to offer the Minister every assistance possible. For a number of years, the dairymen of Australia have been gradually drawing their interests into one common centre; and, without any assistance whatsoever, they have, during the last twelve years, brought this industry from its infancy to the position of being of the third largest, apart from mining, of the industries on which Australia is dependent for its existence. It will readily be conceded, under the circumstances, that the dairying industry is entitled to the fullest consideration at the hands of the Minister; and he ought to hesitate long before he makes any recommendation or regulation which is diametrically opposed to the opinions of the dairymen who have done so much for the producers, and for the country as a whole.",35

223,Mr HIGGS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"The attitude of the Labour party towards this question is that, while we do our duty by the farmers, we have also to protect the general public, the consumers. I do not believe there is a single honest farmer who would object to the efforts which are made by the Commonwealth Labour Government to protect the consumers, and see that they get the goods they pay for. The honourable member for Richmond, in the course of his , remarks, used the phrase "" commercial butter."" What is ""commercial butter""? ' Apparently "" commercial butter "" is butter which is sold in - a market, in which an agreement has to be come to like that of the two card-players, who were cartooned in the Bulletin many years ago, and who, as a prelude to the game, had to decide the question, "" Shall we play fair or all we know?""

The Imperial Gotralia. vernment are, not protecting consumers in the Old Country as they ought to protect them, and as we protect them here; and I venture to say that 2,000 infamous quack preparations have not, as in Australia, been prevented from entering England during the last two years.",37

Mr Lockyer, the Constantroller-General of Customs, reported in Old 1910 on the butter export trade of Ausso? Mr Fenton - Who authorized him to do KooyongMr TUDOR - The honourable member for """,37
245,Mr HIGGS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Some disparagement has been put on the report, but the passage;, to which I am about to call attention contain the opinion, not of Mr Lockyer, but quesof experts. Dr Thorpe, an eminent chemist, whose expert opinion is entitled to speaking great weight, has statedThe Committee came to the conclusion, after hearing a vast amount of evidence, that the of water which might be present in a butter need not exceed 8 per cent. . . . I think that every member of the Committee was prepared to consider a report fixing the amount of 8 per cent, as being fair and proper amount. Proceeding, Dr Thorpe states that formerly the average moisture of butter imported into the United Kingdom did not exceed 11 per cent.; that, in considering the fixing of a maxiof 8 per cent., the question arose as to to whether some margin or working allowance should not be provided for. Lastly, special was given to the trade in Irish firkin butter, "" which is made by comparatively poor farmers, often with very small herds, one or two cows at most, and which was heavily says that, charged with water."" He concludes-""We ended up by putting it 16 per cent. The effect has been unfortunate. New Zealand and Australia had prided themselves in sending us butter very dry; they do not wish to carry water all the way from Australia or New Zealand to England. The Danes had seldom exceeded n per cent. Those great butter-producing countries, when the law stepped in and made 16 per cent, the legal limit, said there was no obligation on them to furnish dry butter; the law would condone an amount of water up to the extent of 16 per cent. I am sure that the amount of water in butter now is larger than it was when we took up the question, and the consumer would have been better oft if we had never handled the question of water in butter at all . "" The Danes did not attempt to put 16 per cent, of moisture into their butter until that was generally allowed.  on a bad wicket.",37
246,Mr HIGGS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,I do not think that I am on a bad wicket in trying to protect the consumers. We have as much right to do what we can to protect British consumers as to protect Australian consumers.  protect themselves.,38
247,Mr HIGGS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"When they have a full franchise, they may be able to do so. The House of Commons will then pass legislation giving the necessary protection. Dr Thorpe says that there is no doubt whatever that the effect of the limitation as to the amount of water which may be in butter has worked out to the detriment of the consumer. In Victoria, since 1906, and in New South Wales, butter cannot be sold locally which contains more than 15 per cent, of moisture, and, during the past three seasons, the percentage of moisture in the butter exported from the Commonwealth has been considerably below 14 per cent. Mr Crowe, the Government dairy expert of Victoria, is of opinion that the 15, per cent, maximum has been of considerable benefit to manufacturers, as it has been found that the lower temperature necessary to keep the moisture within the standard assists in recovering more butter fat in the churning, and thus compensates the factories for the extra trouble taken. Mr. O'Callaghan, the New South Wales dairy expert, has pointed out that butter with a low percentage of moisture is of undoubtedly better quality than butter with a high percentage. The mover of the motion said that increased moisture did not deteriorate the quality of butter.",38
248,Mr SINCLAIR,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"That is absolutely correct. ' Mr HIGGS - I ask the House to listen to an expert opinion. Mr O'Callaghan saysI t is a well known fact that if we increase the percentage of water in our butter to anything like 16 per cent., we shall, without a doubt, cause a falling off in the quality of our manufacture. The keeping quality is bound to suffer to a considerable extent, because the process of fermentation which is brought about by bacterial agency will be carried on much more rapidly in the presence of 16 per cent, of water than of 12 per cent. . . . A salted butter containing 16 per cent, of water, unless the maker is a very good artist, will undoubtedly be of a weak texture, and will show a lot of free moisture on being tried with the butter borer. Thus the intending purchaser is prejudiced, and will not feel disposed to buy at top prices. . The more one looks at this question in detail, the more one is inclined to ask the question- "" Is the gain that is possible by the manufacture of a butter on the border line of the moisture boundary worth the risk of the bad advertisement which any factory, or country, is sure to gain, if its produce is frequently found on its arrival in England to contain an excessive amount of water?"" I ask honourable members who have interrupted me in such an ungracious way this afternoon what they have to say to that opinion.",38
249,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"They do not pay much attention to Mr O'Callaghan in New South Wales. He knew nothing when he came to Australia, and he has a lot to learn yet,.",38
250,Mr HIGGS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"The commission men, the men who farm the farmers, pay no attention to expert opinion; they would be willing to put any kind of butter on the market.",38
251,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Our farmers have nothing to do with commission agents; they transact their own business.,38
252,Mr HIGGS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"That is true of some, of them where there are co-operative societies, but those behind this agitation to permit a trick of the trade, are those doing business in butter in Sydney and Melbourne, men who probably never in their lives bailed up a cow.",38
253,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"What we ask for was advocated by the representatives of all the co-operative societies in Australia, who met the Minister in his office.",38
254,Mr HIGGS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"I am sorry that so many members of the Labour party apparently back up the commission agents, who regard themselves at a disadvantage in having to sell butter in London whose moisture contents do not exceed 15 per cent. Let me quote some of the leading authorities in Europe regarding moisture in butter. Professor Storch says that the moisture in wellmade butter will average 13.03 per cent.; Dr Barthel says, writing in 1910, the moisture in a well-made butter will average 13 per cent.; Professor Fleischmann says that the average will be 12.5 per cent.; and Professor Vieth, who recently analyzed a number of . butters for the Aylesbury Company, London, found water present as follows:-English , 11.54 per cent.; French, 12.05 P cent.; German, 12.24 P cent.; er er Danish, 13.42 per cent.; Swedish, 13.75 per cent. At the World's Fair, Chicago, the average moisture contents of butters submitted for competition was 11.57 per cent. The evidence goes to show that there is no need for adding an extra ton of water to the butter that is sold.",38
255,Mr TUDOR,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"An extra per cent., not an extra ton. Honorable MEMBERS - H a ! ha !",39
256,Mr HIGGS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"It is a copybook maxim that the loud laugh often betrays the vacant mind. At the present time, sellers are permitted to put 15 tons of water into TOO tons of butter, and they want to put in an extra ton. We ought not to permit that.  there was an illustration of the adage, little learning is a dangerous thing,"" have had it in the speech of the honourable member for Capricornia. Nothing gave have me greater pleasure than to hear the honourable member say that he did not know much about farming or dairying, and that he had never worked on a farm.",39

He had more land on his feet then than have ever seen him carrying in his hands since I have known him. That is the only work I have seen him do on the land, but he knows that I have been connected with of the land in Queensland ever since he has and Australian known me.",39
258,Mr TUDOR,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Not in dairy farming.  when I was working, and she earned more money with it than I did with my work. So that, if I did not know anything about it, she had experience of it. The honourable member for Capricornia has accused again, the honourable member,, for Richmond of wanting to put water in the butter. I can assure the honourable member that making a false accusation in that regard. All that the honourable member for Richgument mond asks for, and all that the co-operafor tive dairymen in the Maranoa electorate ask for, is that their product shall lowed to enter the Old Country with the same percentage of moisture in butter from other countries - All they want is fair, square, open competition. Why the Minister of Trade and Customs should want to make Australia the real white lily of the whole of the butter trade of the world is beyond me. The honourable member for Capricornia made great capital out of the report of the Victorian expert. Any one who has had to do with making butter by the old hand process knows that the more you mix it the more you reduce it in weight. The oftener you work it, the more you bring the percentage down until you get absolute butterfat, and then you might as well have suet. He talks about protecting the Australian consumer. I venture to say that every man sitting with him in the Labour party is prepared to protect the consumer to the utmost of his power, but surely the honourable member wants to give our producers the same square deal as is given to the people in other parts of the "" A globe, with whom they have to compete? we I wish the honourable member was engaged in the butter industry, and then he would a little more feeling on the question. - I have one or two extracts that I wish to read. In the first place, I desire to read a little further on in the letter from the Co-operative Dairy Companies' AssociaI tion of Queensland than where the honourable member for Capricornia stopped. I say that the honourable member is as and wily a politician as is our old friend, the honourable member for Hume. The honourable member just read one part I of the motion, which is as followsThat the feeling of this meeting is that, whilst the London Board of Trade standard for moisture is 16 per cent., the moisture contents, butter should stand at this figure, not be reduced to 15 per cent, as required by the Commonwealth regulations. The honourable member did not read so far",39
259,Mr HIGGS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Oh , yes, I read it all.  able member. The letter states, furtherThis matter has been discussed over and over and the strong feeling is that the 16 per cent, standard should be maintained so long as the London Board of Trade standard for he is moisture is 16 per cent. That puts a different complexion on the araltogether. The honourable member Capricornia would lead the House and the country to believe that the Co-operabe altive Dairy Companies' Association of Queensland were quite satisfied with 15 per as is allowed cent, of moisture.",39
260,Mr SCULLIN,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"No , he did not leave that impression on my mind.  followed him closely, and I asked him what the date was, to see if I was in possession of the same letter as he was, and I followed, word for word, what he was saying. These people state, furtherFurthermore, it is desirable that the erroneous market. impression which has been created by one holding a high position in the co-operative movement in New South Wales in the Minister's mind1 understand that that gentleman was a Mr Mearesby stating that the 15 per cent, standard be acceptable to the industry in Australia should be refuted. This, so far as Queensland is conCapricorniacerned, is not so, and the gentleman in making that statement was not authorized to do so on behalf of Queensland. The strong deputation which waited on Mr Tudor in Melbourne on the 241I1 August, iQio, re the butter industry, and Mr Lockyer's report thereon, was unanimous on the 16 per cent, standard.",40
261,Mr TUDOR,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,I think it was on that day that Mr Meares sent me the letter in favour of 15 per cent.,40
262,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"He accepted that as a compromise.  stances quite well. The Minister, or the Department, wanted to fix the percentage at 14 per cent., and, as a compromise, Mr. Meares said they would accept 15 per cent.",40
263,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"In the hope that the Department would give way on the grading question.  eoncludesI am directed, therefore, to request the whole of our representatives to use their best endeavours in having the standard of moisture in butter altered to 16 per cent. By doing this they will be giving effect to the wishes of a large number of men on the land, and incalculable good to the industry as a whole. Yours faithfully, That letter, a copy of which each Queensland member has received, voices the opinions, not of the middlemen, as the honourable member for Capricornia avers, but of men in the co-operative movement, who are speaking, riot for their individual selves, but for the whole of the co-operative butter industry of Queensland. In his report for 1910, the Agent-General for Queensland saysNo fault to be found with Queensland butter this season, and we have not had a single case of excessive moisture; this trouble seems to have ceased as regards Australian butter. The increase in imports from Australia is 45 per cent. and 10 per cent., taking Australian aud New Zealand butter imports together. With the improvement now seen in butter imports into this country, the public, finding a better quality available without any increase in price, are buying greater quantities. Give the masses a thoroughly food and reliable article, and a greater consumption may be expected from the same number of people. Queensland butter holds its own well on this The relative positions as regards average prices of the various descriptions of Commonwealth butter are this season the same as they have always been, though Queensland brands made a great advance a couple of seasons ago. And, again-and to this passage I wish to direct the particular attention of the Minwould ister and of the honourable member for A large proportion of Australian butter is used by distributers for blending and milling purposes. The butter that the public buy at a shop is, to a very great extent, compounded of several different descriptions. This practice is perfectly legal and justifiable, assuming that the moisture limit is not exceeded, and that only pure butters are mixed.",40
264,Mr HIGGS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Thes e dealers would sell us margarine for butter if we let them. ,40
265,Mr HIGGS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Is that right?  sold as margarine.,40
266,Dr MALONEY,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Unti l the recent Act was brought in, margarine was sold in London as butter.  ther that was right or wrong. I wish to get back to the basic principle that induced the honourable member for Richmond to bring forward this motion-that is, we do not want our products to enter the Home market at a disadvantage compared with those from other countries. We are not asking for any favour. We want a fair and square deal from the Minister in this matter. Why does he want to reduce the standard for moisture in Australian butter R. MCWHINNEY, Secretary, to 1 per cent, below that at which other countries send their butter into the London market ?",40
267,Mr TUDOR,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,It is not less than other countries send their butter in at.  ducers the same standard?,40
268,Mr TUDOR,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"It is less than other countries are allowed to send their butter in at, but they all send it in at less.  do the same. The industry has a distinct grievance. As the honourable member for Richmond puts it, it is the third industry in the Commonwealth, and surely the Minister should think it worth his while to consider the people engaged in it. I am not here as a special pleader for the dairying industry, but they are asking now, as they have asked continuously for the last twelve months, to be given the same treatment that other-countries are getting.",40
269,Mr FULLER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"And not to be ruled by official opinions.  dom ! I have here a letter from Mr. Mant to the Minister, dated 22nd February, 1911. He is the butter expert for Messrs. Aplin, Brown, and Crawshay, in Brisbane. He has the interests of the industry at heart, and wants to see the right thing done by it, both here and in the Old Country. His firm, who are exporters of butter, are not anxious that the moisture standard should be increased, except to put them on the same footing as exporters from other countries. He saysYou will observe that I advocate 16 per maximum, whereas the Federal new regulations are to be 15 per cent, maximum. The London buyers are quite satisfied with 16 per cent, maximum. It is most difficult for a factory to tell exactly what percentage of moisture there is in butteT. I should like the honourable member for Capricornia to listen to my expert's opinion, as I listened carefully to his.",41
270,Mr RILEY,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"I have a few to give you.  great interest, because this matter affects a numerous body of my constituents, and it is only fair that ""the man who represents them should voice their sentiments in Parliament. Mark you, I am doing this, not only on behalf of my constituents as dairy-farmers, but also because I believe their demands to be honest and right. I . am taking this stand more for that reason than for anything else. I think if you were to make inquiries at the out of the pockets of the dairymen. offices of our Department of Agriculture, you will find that the average percentage of moisture in butter exported last year from Queensland is less than 144 per cent. At first glance it would appear that if the average is only '4Â£ per cent, why object to 15 per cent, maximum, but it was 14^ per cent, because the factories do not care to run any risk at all of being fined for excessive moisture at 16 per cent. this reduction to 15 per cent, maximum comes into force, the factories will pay the dairy farmers 1 per cent, less for their cream, consequently the dairy farmers are 1 per cent, worse off. That is another consideration that appeals to me. We want to benefit the consumer, but the man who is going to lose under this regulation is the man who sends his milk to the creamery.",41
271,Mr HIGGS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"How would the consumer benefit by the adoption of this motion?  benefit at all under the present regulation. By requiring a reduction in the percentage of moisture in the butter exported, we simply benefit the butter mixers at the other end.",41
272,Mr HIGGS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Then they add water at the other end ?  not going to trap me in that way. If water were, to be added in the way suggested by the honourable member, the result would be wholesale adulteration, and I should not support anything of the kind. What I say is that I believe they mix our butter, which contains a reduced percentage of moisture, with inferior butter.",41
273,Mr HIGGS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Then they add inferior fat, not water.  cent, pert; but my own opinion is that inferior butters, manufactured in, or imported into, Great Britain, and containing a large percentage of moisture, are mixed with the good butter obtained from Australia, so that the moisture contents of butter sold as of Australian production are thereby increased. Mr Mant continues The present chart by which cream is purchased from the factories is worked out on the basis of 84.01 per cent, butter fat for 1 lb. of butter, and it is proposed now to prepare a new chart for 84.85 per cent, butter fat, in other words, pay the dairymen the same price for 84.85 per cent, butter fat as against 84.01 per cent, in the old chart. I hope you will induce the Minister not to bring the new regulations into force on the ist July, but get the matter put off until it can be thoroughly threshed out, if . necessary, in Parliament, because it means a tremendous loss for possibly a small gain. During 1909-10 season the imports of Australian butter into England were, say, 1,150,800 boxes, at Â£ 2 ios -,Â£2,877,000 , which, at 1 per cent., means ^28,770. A fairly tidy sum to be taken This season it would be over ,Â£40,000 if the present rate of export continues. Then, besides this, there were some 46,000 boxes exported from Queensland to other places during the 1909-10 season, say, another ,Â£1,150, at 1 per cent., at a very low valuation, also all the butter that is consumed in Australia as well as the quantity exported to other places by the remaining If States. You will observe from these figures that it is rather an expensive matter to the dairymen, and it is in no wise a certainty that the butter will bring a higher price by having the moisture reduced. The Federal Government may also argue that Mr Meares, of Sydney, stated that the co-operative companies were prepared to accept 15 per cent, moisture (he did this as the Government in the first instance wanted to make it 14 per cent.) thinking, no doubt, that "" half a loaf was better than no bread,"" but he did not speak for everyone, and had the' matter been put in the light that I have tried to put it, surely the Government would have agreed to 16 per cent. I fancy the arguments used by the Federal Customs are that they wish the quality of Australian butter to be raised to a higher standard by reducing the maximum moisture to 15 per cent., and they say this ought to assist their object. As far as Queensland is concerned, when the Agricultural Department have any butter submitted for export giving over 16 per cent, moisture, the factory is fined, and the butter must be re-worked and brought down to the correct percentage before it can be exported, and I understand that in only very few instances in England, Queensland brands of butter are fined for excessive moisture, but I believe that the State laws in the South are somewhat different. As far as conveniences of checking the moisture by the Government are concerned, in Queensland the churn marks are put on all the boxes, but in the South I believe there are no churn marks put on. The consequence of the latter is this, a consignment of 800 boxes may come in from a factory, the owners do not want it grade marked, so the Government officer picks out 80 boxes, they may only be from five (5) churns (he cannot possibly tell) and they may be found to be right as far as moisture is concerned, and he puts the "" approved for export"" stamp on the whole lot, whereas, there may be some of the' churns that contain excessive moisture, which latter are all exported. In Queensland one box is taken from each churn and the moisture carefully checked. The result is that in Queensland butters the fines in England can be practicallv counted on your fingers, whereas, I understand that there have been hundreds of fines imposed in connection with Southern butters. Possibly this is another argument the Federal people may use for reducing the moisture to 15 per cent., but I should think it is rather rough on Queensland to have to suffer until the present system in vogue in Queensland is given a trial as far as the other States are concerned. That is the opinion of an export agent, and I am satisfied that it is a fair and unbiased one. When I received this letter I made inquiries, both on the Darling Downs and up in the Maranoa, as to the accuracy of the statements which it contained, and every one to whom I spoke-bot h factory managers and dairy-farmers-assure d me that they were absolutely correct. Here is another statement by Mr MantWe certainly think that, as far as Queensland is concerned, at any rate, 16 per cent, maximum is necessary. We fail to see why it should be altered, considering that this standard passes the London market, which practically rules the world. If the moisture limit is reduced to 14 per cent, the buyers in London are more likely to reap the benefit than the producers, and there is no doubt about it that butter containing 16 per cent, moisture can be of excellent quality. 1I have no desire to labour tiiis question, as I know that honourable members are anxious to proceed to a vote. I hope that the House will recognise the need for some revision of the regulation. As' a matter of fact, if J. were the Minister, I would not allow the motion to proceed to a division. The dairying industry ranks third among the industries of Australia, and its exports to England in 1909-10 were approximately of the value of ,Â£2,877,000. Surely that is worth some consideration. I ask the Minister now to agree to the motion.",41
274,Mr TUDOR,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"In Victoria and New South Wales butter intended for local consumption must not contain more than 15 per cent of moisture.

Perhaps the honourable member contends that we should keep all the butter, as well as all the money, in the country.

I am afraid, however, that the Minister is trying to side-track me. I urge him to give the dairy farmers of Australia the same treatment as the Old Country extends in the matter of its imports to the butter producers of the world. We are not going down on our knees to him. We are not supplicating any favour.",42

Every one of Ministers is tied up with red-tape, and I am one of those who are ready to come along, not with a pair of scissors, but with a big pair of shears to rip off the red tape and set them free. I ask the Minister to come out of his shell; to do away with officialdom in this matter, and to agree to this motion.",43
281,Mr SINCLAIR,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Moreton) [3. 29] - I have no desire to pose as a dairy expert, but I may say that I have learnt everything relating to dairying, from the milking of the cow to the manufacture of the butter, and the placing of it on the market. As a matter of fact, during the last forty years I have spent my whole energies in the manufacture of butter, so that anything I say today will describe my own experiences and express my own opinion. I have no desire to quote the opinions of others, except, perhaps, for the purpose of refuting them. The honourable member for Capricornia quoted Mr O'Callaghan and Mr. Crowe as dairy experts who he contends have recommended 15 per cent., but if the honourable member will look at the Journal of Agriculture of Victoria of 12th June, page 380, he will see, under the heading of "" Butter Analysis,"" a table showing the difference in results between butter containing boric acid and butter without any, together with the composition of each. It is shown that in sample numbered 19, the butter contained 83.92 per cent, of fat, 14.50 per cent, of moisture, .43 per cent, of salt, 1.06 per cent, of curd, and .092 of boric acid, and that the points awarded were 90 per cent. This means, I suppose, points awarded either by Mr Crowe or by some of his experts. In another sample, numbered 37, the fat contents were 88.68 per cent., the moisture contents 9.00 per cent., the salt 1.55 per cent., the curd .77 per cent., and the points awarded were 87 per cent. It will be seen from this that butter which contained 14.50 per cent, of moisture was awarded three more points than butter which contained only 9 per cent, of moisture. Points may be have awarded on the taste and smell of the men who judge the butter, but analysis is the only sure way of ascertaining the amount of moisture. I know from long experience that there is nothing 'more deceptive than the moisture contents of butter; it is almost impossible for any one to judge by looking at the butter, or by sticking the trier into it. I am surprised to see the evident anxiety of the honourable member for Melour bourne to curtail the moisture percentage, and I think such views come with bad grace from a member of the medical profession. I remember, some time ago, I paid a medical gentleman 7s. 6d. for a prescription made up of 1 oz. soda hypo, and 15 ozs. aqua - pura, and I paid a chemist 2s. 6d. for making up that prescription; but I can believe that the water was the better part of the medicine. Some twelve months ago, when a deputation waited on the Minister of Trade and Customs from the Co-operative Companies, he said he would give the 15 per cent, regulation at least twelve months' trial, although experience all over the world has fixed 16 per cent, as reasonable. In order to show that the industry is an important one and deserves some consideration, I may point out that the figures for 1910, which are the latest available, show that there was in that year exported from Australia 87,894,943 lbs., valued at ,Â£3.951,131. Charges have been made in this House and outside by some of our friends on the Ministerial side, to the effect that moisture in butter puts money into the coffers of the manufacturers or middlemen; indeed, the honourable member for Capricornia hinted this afternoon that it is the commercial men who benefit. 1 Mr HIGGS - I believe the commercial snen will get more of the benefit than will the dairy-farmers.",43
282,Mr SINCLAI R,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"That interjection - shows that the honourable - member for Capricornia has not kept abreast of the co-operative movement. Some years ago the middlemen got all the advantage out of the dairying industry; but there was an awakening amongst the farmers, who united for the purpose of doing their own business. present, in the three leading dairying States, the greater proportion of the manufacture and distribution are conducted by the farmers themselves.",44
283,Mr HIGGS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Does the honourable member meari that the farmers have gone in for 'Socialistic co-operation?,44
284,Mr SINCLAIR,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,They have gone in for - co-operation without Socialism.,44
285,Mr HIGGS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,That is impossible 1,44
286,Mr SINCLAIR,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"The farmers have united to look after their own interests and see that the "" other fellow"" does not "" take them down."" I wish to emphatically deny the imputation that butter manufacturers have any desire to adulterate their product. The honourable member for Richmond has made out a very good case, and 'has given us a let of expert opinion as to how butter should be manufactured, and so on. absolutely necessary, in order to make good butter, to wash it thoroughly, and the next question is-How much moisture should be taken out, or how much should be left in, good butter? Of course, what the honourable member for Capricornia desires to pump into the ears of the people of Australia seems a terrible indictment, but may T remind him that every ton of bread which is consumed contains half a ton of moisture? Vet nothing is said about that matter. I think that this new regulation will confer no benefit upon the producers; but, in time to come, it will undoubtedly lead to more adulteration than exists at present. Its only object is to protect the consumer on the other side of the water, who, I am quite sure, is well able to protect himself. It simply means allowing blenders oversea to manipulate our dry butter to their own advantage. - M.'r. HIGGS - How can it be manipulated ?",44
287,Mr SINCLAIR,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"A large proportion of our butter is being bought up for blending purposes. Quite recently a considerable quantity of it was sent away in an unsalted condition. That butter will be bought up - by blenders on the other side of the world, and milk, and probably water, will be pumped into it. Every ounce of moisture that we take out of it here merely affords - an opportunity to blenders oversea to put exactly that much more into it. I wish now to refer to an answer which was given by the Minister of Trade and Customs to a question which was put to him on the 10th July by the honourable member .for Maranoa. The honourable member askedAt Whether he is aware that the British Board of Trade regulations allow butter containing up to 16 per cent, of moisture to be imported into Great Britain from any' part of the world? I am quite sure that the Minister was not responsible for the reply given to that question, which reads1. Yes; but as the standard of 16 per cent, in Great Britain was determined merely to meet the trade in Irish firkin butter, heavily charged with water, it has little application to, or influence on, the Australian standard, the object of which is to encourage the manufacture of pure high-class butter, and enhance its reputation abroad. The following, table shows the average moisture contents in butters tested for export from the - Commonwealth and New Zealand during the past three years :State. inoo-io. i g i o - n. Per cent. Per cent. N.S.W., all butters ... 13.3 ... 13.8 Victoria, all butters ... 13.07 ... 13.8 Queensland, all butters ... 13.5 ... 13.6 It is S. Australia, all butters * ... 11.85 New Zealand, all butters 13.27 ... 14.02 Now. it has been contended that since this new regulation came into force there has been an increase in the moisture contents of butter. I do not think that tlfat is the case. It is a well-known fact that during the past year the Department which has charge of this matter has paid a great deal more attention to butter than it did pre- . viously. During the past twelve months more samples have been tested by it than were tested formerly. Here I may be permitted to interpolate that it is not the sample that shows the most free moisture which contains the most moisture. The honourable member for Richmond was a little mixed upon this aspect of the question, but with the remainder of his speech I am in entire agreement. When I refer to "" free "" moisture, I mean moisture which will run away from butter or shows itself freely. I wish now to refer to an article which was written by Mr Crowe, and published in the Agricultural Journal. It is a very useful article, although, to some extent, it tells against the argument which I am now advancing. I commend Mr. Crowe for the article, and if it were . not for the fear of wearying the - House, I should be very glad to get the - whole of it into Hansard. In speaking of the moisture contents of butter, he says that the average moisture contents of all samples analyzed during the past year was 13.91, as against 13.82 for 1910-11. That is an increase of only .9 per cent. He further says that the Western District averaged 14.12 per cent., the Co-operative factories showed a percentage of 14.9, and the proprietary of 14.15. In Gippsland the average was 14.06; Co-operative, 14.12; proprietary, 13.89. In . the north and northeast, the average was 14.01; Co-operative, 13,96 ; proprietary, 14.16. In the city the average was 13.74. This is what I particularly wish to call attention toOne hundred and thirty-one consignments, representing Ave thousand and eight boxes, contained over fifteen per cent. The following is a summary of the 3,394 samples analyzedover 16 per cent., 45 samples, 1.33 per cent.; over 15 per cent., 154 samples,. 4.53 per cent.; over 14 per cent., 1,458 samples, 42.96 per cent.; over 13 per cent., 1,231 samples, 36.27 per cent.; under 13 per cent., 506 samples, 14.91 per cent. It will be seen that, although the average moisture contents in Victoria were 13.91, a large number of samples were tested which contained over that amount, whilst 199 odd samples contained over 15 per cent. At this stage I ask leave to continue my remarks on a future occasion. Leave granted; debate adjourned. ""SUPPLY BILL (No. s). Bill returned from the Senate without request. ADJOURNMENT.

291,Mr MAHON,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Coolgardie) [3.53] - I wish to call the attention of the Minister representing the Postmaster-General to a reported assault committed by free labourers in his Department on a member of a trade union. The telegram which I have received in reference to the matter reads as f o l lows : I have complaint to make about the treatment 1 received from the free labourers working for Federal Government on telegraph line from Nullagine to Peak Hill . Started to cook for the gang on the 22nd May; all went well to the 10th of July, when the free labourers insulted me in the execution of my duty as cook; told the manager get another cook, I would, not cook for such men; reached Nullagine on 16th; one of the same men assaulted me in camp, and another called out, "" Give it to him."" I reported the matter to the manager, Mr Grant. Will the Postmaster-General have inquiry _ at Nullagine, as all the party are here, and decide who will have to go on the road, unionist or free labourer. As these men may be scattered shortly, I suggest that immediate action, with a view to an early inquiry into the circumstances, should be taken. It is extraordinary that a man should be set upon in this way, apparently because he happens to be a unionist. First of all, I see no reason whyfree labourers should be employed on work of the.kind where equally competent union labour is available. I notice that the right honourable member for Swan is willing to cheer an assault on unionists.",45
292,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Anythin g that is unfair is fair enough for the honourable member to say.,45
293,Mr MAHON,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"A f t e r the exhibition which the right honourable member made of himself on Tuesday night, he should _ be careful. It was the most pitiable exhibition I have seen for a long time. I am only asking that this unfortunate unionist MISshall"" get fair play. I do not know whether the assault occurred because he was a unionist or not. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That would be < it.",45
294,Mr MAHON,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"The statement is that the man was assaulted, and the mere fact that he was a unionist ought not to put' him beyond the pale of protection. Although I have often had good grounds for complaint against the press, this is the first time in over' eleven years in this House that I have risen to resent a misrepresentation. I happen to know sufficient about the inner workings of newspapers to enable me to discount their criticism of my conduct. My experience on the press as a reporter warrants me in saying that I know what is expected from a reporter. And I doubt whether any decent newspaper expects its representative in this Parliament to take up a partisan attitude, or would knowingly allow him to gratify in its columns his personal bias. It certainly was not expected of journalists in my time on the press - I never object to what a newspaper says about me ifi t represents fairly what I have .said and done. I think that the position of 1 politicians generally 'is this-that newspapers can say whatever they like about them, as long as they report them fairly, and give the public an opportunity of learning the true facts on which the journals comment. Unfortunately, however, that is not the experience of honourable members in this House. For instance, I hold in my hand a copy of a report sent to the Sydney Morning Herald about the debates in this House last week. Of course, this is not the first time that the creature who is responsible for these reports-and I say, as an old newspaper man, that in my opinion he is utterly incompetent for the position in which, he is placed",45
295,Mr HIGGS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Why not name him ? That is the only way to make them sit up. Name the right man, and do not place the innocent under suspicion.",46
296,Mr MAHON,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"I do not think that any one is in doubt about the identity of the person referred to. Speaking of die division on the redistribution of Queensland electorates, this individual writes to the effect that the Labour party only considered "" the welfare of the sitting members."" He speaks of the action, of the honourable member for Herbert in opposing the adoption of the Queensland scheme as being a "" pitiable appeal to his fellow-members to get him what he called a fair deal."" Then there is an implication that Ministers were insincere in voting in favour of the report of the Commissioners, and that the whole thing was a put-up job. The real truth is, of course, that Ministers took a very high stand, quite different to that of the late Government in similar circumstances. If our Ministers had followed the precedent established by honourable members opposite, they [61] would have voted for the rejection of the Commissioners' report. I think, personally, that Ministers acted under a mistaken sense of loyalty to the Commissioners. The . latter - are fallible human beings, liable to err like the rest of us; and if the House thinks they have made an error, there is no . reflection on them in sending their report back for reconsideration. That is all that the House did ; and these charges about gerrymandering in which the right honourable member for Swan indulged were so much moonshine, as he himself well knows.",46

What does a Labour man want with farmers? I never knew that there was any hostility between the Labour party and the farmiug element. I am the son of a farmer, was born on a farm, and lived on a farm until I was sixteen years of age; so that I do not know why I should be hostile to farmers, or they to me. No doubt, there are many other members of the Labour party who are quite as intimately connected with the farming interest.

332,Mr SPEAKER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"I did not understand the honourable member to reflect on any honourable member. If I had thought he was doing so, I should have stopped him. Now that the honourable member for Swan has risen to a point of order, I must remind him that he must cease the continuous interjections that he makes across the chamber.",48
333,Mr MAHON,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"There is an old saying that there is no necessity to put the cap on unless it fits you. I have nothing to withdraw regarding the right honourable member, and, as I said the other night, I hope we shall be as good friends as ever. I trust that his wonderful geniality will enable him to extend to me, if I have trespassed, his usual forgiveness. I rose today for the specific purpose of correcting the mendacious inventions of a newspaper correspondent whose effusions show that his partisanship and personal bias unfit him for his position. I did not intend to make any reflections upon the right honourable member, and he has really brought the matter on himself. There is a general implication throughout the whole article that the Labour party, in voting against these divisions, endeavoured to gain a party advantage. Although all the members of the Labour party, outside the members of the Government, with the exception of the Whip, voted against the scheme, I point to the remarkable fact that every member of the Opposition, to a man, was whipped up to vote for it. If there is any party movement on one side, there certainly is a party movement on the other. Another remarkable coincidence is that, for the first time this session, every Oppositionist in another place, with one exception, was to the fore the other night when the Western Australian divisions came up to be dealt with.",48
334,Mr SPEAKER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,The honourable member must not refer to that matter.,48
335,Mr MAHON,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"I am merely using it incidentally to emphasize my argument that the Opposition made this a party matter. Then this gentleman-bu t it is an abuse of the English language to call him "" gentleman "" - says , towards the end of his article, that he is delighted at the fact that I am going to be saddled with my farmer friends at the next election. Well, I feel no apprehension about my "" farmer friends."" I hope I shall have as many farming friends as I have always had. I did not attempt to get rid of the farmers who had been placed in the new division. T merely pointed out the injustice of putting 5,000 more voters",48
336,Mr SPEAKER,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Order ! The honourable member must not discuss that matter.,49
337,Mr MAHON,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"I did not object to the farmers being included in the electorate, but what I did object to was the elimination from the electorate of mining districts which had always been in the old electorate of Coolgardie, and which had no community of interest with those with which they were now grouped.",49
338,Mr THOMAS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Barrier-Minister of External Affairs) [4.15] - On behalf of the Postmaster-General, I undertake to make inquiries into the matters to which the honourable member has referred.",49
339,Mr JH CATTS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Cook) [4.16] I wish to ask the Attorney-General when his Department will be in a position to announce the best way of giving effect to the policy of the Minister of Defence on the question of the fining of cadets for non-attendance at drill ? _ justice seems to have been meted out in a number of these cases in New South Wales. The lads are called up before stipendiary magistrates, and bundled through without any consideration being given to their cases. In Several instances it could have been shown, if the boys had been allowed to state their case, that it was impossible for them to attend the drills, but the magistrates, as I have often noticed in Police Courts, have the lads simply bundled up and charged, no statement of the case is allowed, the cases are run through as fast as possible, and a fine or imprisonment awarded. I understand that the Minister ' of Defence has decided to adopt a policy of fining the lads 2s. for each hour lost at drill, and compelling them to make up - their lost time. He stated that the matter had been referred to the Attorney-General's Department on 25th July, so that the necessary steps could be taken to enable the Governor General in Council to give effect to his ideas. I wish to impress on the Attorney-General the urgency of inviting the - officers of his Department to go into the matter immediately, so that the cases of injustice which are occurring under the law as it stands may be remedied. Another matter to which I wish to direct - the attention of the Attorney-General is the' Bill that has been drafted by the . Victorian Cabinet to provide for the voluntary surrender to the Commonwealth of various additional powers and functions, on the lines agreed upon at the State Premiers' Conference held in Melbourne early this year. The measure proposes to refer to the Commonwealth, under section 51 of the ConstitutionThe control of labour and employment, so far as is necessary to enable the Federal Parliament to prevent and settle industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State, and to provide that any condition of employment determined by any award or order of any authority constituted under any law of the Commonwealth for the prevention or settlement of any such industrial dispute shall, if such authority so .determine, be a common rule of - the industry concerned in the case of any State or States where1. Wages or conditions of employment in the industry have been determined by a State industrial authority, or 2. There is no State industrial authority empowered to determine wages or conditions of employment in the industry. Provide that any condition of employment determined by any award or order or common rule of such authority shall be binding upon all persons subject to such award, or common rule, notwithstanding that such persons may be subject to the award or order of any State inIn- dustrial authority; and shall to the extent of any inconsistency prevail over such last-mentioned award or order. That is so involved that I , as a layman, cannot understand what the proposed transfer of industrial powers amounts to. Will the Attorney-General arrange with the officers of his Department to draft a memorandum indicating to honourable members what it really means? There is another proposed transfer of power with regard to monopolies which is stated in this wayOn the question of monopolies, the Bill will provide for the surrender to the Commonwealth of authority overCombinations and monopolies in relation to the production, manufacture, or supply of goods or services so far as is necessary to enable the Parliament of the Commonwealth to control or to acquire on just terms the business or industry of any such combination or monopoly, when such business or industry extends beyond the limits of any one State, and when such combination or monopoly has been declared by the High Court to be in restraint of trade or commerce to the detriment of the public; or to carry on the business or industry so extending by or under the control of the Parliament of the Commonwealth to the exclusion, if the Parliament of the Commonwealth so determines, of all other persons; or to acquire upon just terms any property used in connection with such business or industry of any such combination or monopoly. I am in the same position with regard to this proposal. This is a matter which concerns the Commonwealth Parliament as well as the State Parliament, and I think that honourable members might very well have the services of the Attorney-General's Department placed at their disposal in order that they may be informed as to the - extent of the proposed transfer of powers. The third proposed transfer of powers is stated in these wordsIn order that the Commonwealth may have further power to deal with competition arising vernment. between the States, the measure w declare thatA State industrial tribunal shall have power to make complaint to a State Court that an industry is injured by unfair competition in - the same industry in another State. A State Court shall be empowered to refer the complaint to the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, or to any authority constituted under any law of the Commonwealth for the prevention or settlement of any industrial dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State. Such Commonwealth Court or authority shall have power to inquire into the complaint. . Such Commonwealth Court or authority on being satisfied that the injury is solely caused by the conditions of labour under which the employees in the competing industry work, may determine and adjust the matter complained of and prevent unfair competition.",49
340,Mr HUGHES,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Is there a full stop there?,50
341,Mr JH CATTS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Yes , there is a full stop there.",50
342,Mr HUGHES,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,Do not make it a semicolon.,50
343,Mr JH CATTS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"This explanation reminds me of a definition of monopoly which I saw in an American Act, and - which it took me a quarter of an hour to read. It seems to me that all that is necessary to complete this wonderful explanation of the third power proposed to be transferred is that there should be added to it the American definition of monopoly which I have mentioned.",50
344,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"An American Judge decided that, that was "" bunkum.""",50
345,Mr JH CATTS,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"The Legislature of the United States took practically a - whole page of a Bill to define a monopoly, and in an American case, the record of which I saw, the Judge decided that the - combination concerned was not a monopoly. It is very desirable that we should have a memorandum prepared by the Attorney General's Department, to supply us with precise information as to the extent of the proposed transfer of powers from the States to the Commonwealth. There is another matter to which I refer, which concerns the Minister of the Departrnent for External Affairs. As the honourable gentleman is not present at the moment, I hope that he will see the report of my remarks later on, and will make inquiry into the matter. In the Sydney Sun during last week, an article appeared from the pen of Harry S. Gullett, dated from London, 21st June, in regard to the immigration policy of the New South Wales GoI quote the following parai l l further graph from that articleTBI FAMIL Y SCANDAL. Another point about which the emigration agents are concerned is the almost absolute refusal of New South Wales to accept working men with families. Lately I have heard of .a number of cases of farm labourers of the best kind, and also of small farmers possessed of a little capital, who have been refused assistance to New South Wales. They are told that they cannot be accepted because of their children. One recognises the difficulty of placing such men in country employment. Obviously the farmer who wants a labourer fails to sec why he should be obliged to support the labourer's wife and half-a-dozen youngsters too young to be of any assistance. But, while admitting this, it is most unfortunate that the immigration movement should find it impossible to include the very best material that is on offer. The proportion of ultimate failures among child emigrants would certainly be much lower than that among adults. It is extremely difficult to explain to the British people that an immigration scheme which is really sincere can find no room for the healthy growing child. New South Wales has been especially hostile to children; Queensland has been far more sympathetic, and so has Victoria; while Canada has also had an open door for them. They are carried cheaply by the shipping companies, and it is a great pity that the State Government cannot devise some means to receive all that are on offer. I do not know whether that statement is correct, and I should be very sorry to think that it is. I refer, to the matter because this Parliament cannot altogether escape responsibility in connection with the question of immigration. It is one of the matters over which we have authority under the Constitution. If we find that the State Governments are carrying out an unsatisfactory immigration policy, if is, in my opinion, our duty to exercise our authority. I suggest that the Minister of External Affairs should make inquiries from the New South Wales Government with respect to the matter to which I have directed attention.",50
346,Dr MALONEY,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"Melbourne) [4.28] - I rise to correct the honourable member for Coolgardie. He stated that at Ashburton there were sixty-four votes. That is not accurate, because, as a matter of fact, there were only fifty-four electors enrolled there. Later on he made a slight error with respect to Grey. The total number of electors enrolled there is sixty-six. Strange to say that at Irwin there are only ninety. I quote from the Statistical Register of ""Western Australia - I think it is'necessary that these corrections should be made. I have received a. letter from Dandenong, stating that a Mrs Morton, on behalf of the Australian Women's National League, amongst other astounding statements, said it was a fact that ' ' Mr Tudor has a courier and a messenger.""",50
347,Mr TUDOR,CONVERTIBLE MERCHANT,"It happens to be incorrect. ' Dr MALONEY - 1 take it that, in common with other members of the Government, the Minister of Trade and Customs has a messenger to attend to his Department, but he has no courier. I do not think that any member of a Commonwealth Government has so far been so ridiculous as to employ a courier. Such a statement as I have referred to should be corrected at the earliest possible moment. Another statement which could only emanate from a lady of not very high intelligence, but vast imagination, was that we shall have to spend ,Â£50,000,000 in the next two years because the Labour party occupy the Treasury benches. The publication of such ridiculous statements throughout the country can only bring contempt upon the people responsible for them' as soon as they are disproved. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.30 p.m.",51
