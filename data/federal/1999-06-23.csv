But what this difference between the coalition and Labor. The coalition is fulfilling a serious election and no substance as far as the protection of has been on the statute books a National Cultural of the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage provision for a National Cultural Heritage protected objects. The act was designed to heritage objects. The fund was intended to assist in the transfer permit, from private ownership to public institutions, to and benefit from the existence of these objects from 1986 to the fall of the Keating government fund and no appropriation was made in respect the kudos for introducing the legislation, Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation the public collecting institutions .in Australia-the were neglected during Labor's 13 years in ignored cultural heritage issues.

MAIN COMMITTEE 7273 I say, not surprisingly, only in the sense that preservation in public collecting institutions defined in the existing act as 'objects that are of Australia, for ethnological, archaeological, reasons'. This preservation is to enable benefit of all Australians, and it is appropriate bill does is highlight yet again a fundamental promise with this bill. Labor was all promise movable cultural heritage was concerned, for there Heritage Fund since 1986, upon the passage Act in 1986.

Currently our museums and a key object comes onto the market and such the operation of the existing act, in circumstances in place, should have been brought to the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court for the Arts and Territories. I refer to this act could operate without the establishment of Australia in 1985 the painting The Bath of Diana: Glover for more than $500,000.

It should be noted that without an export permit, the painting would have and interest in the painting would be vested and the questions of law were referred to being argued that the minister's refusal to grant of the applicant's right to export the painting. the Australian people an identifiable and that the painting remained in Australia, together in the painting should the applicant export or it would be forfeited to the Commonwealth.

In an article in the Media Unfortunately, the Fund has never been 'funded' have never been activated. Not only are the public of the scheme is undermined by injustice to owners 'unexportable' objects. There has only been one request an export permit and this was refused. That was Labor's legacy to the preservation that the applicant in the Waterhouse case merely painting to an overseas buyer. The applicant within Australia-keep it, sell it, lease it, give within Australia. Certainly, the effect of the purchaser and the potential market price for such objects.

We do know that ultimately the National Gallery of Australia for $780,000, its foundation-approximately a million dollars But the outcome could have been that the painting in a lounge room, in storage. The consequence that the painting merely remained here, possibly the light of day, never to be inspected by benefit it was barred from export. In a broad sense, one could say the Australian nation has within its boundaries a painting of the Australian people benefit by the continued heritage is rather hollow if a mechanism is not painting for one of our great collecting institutions. decision to refuse the export permit was based of the greatest importance to Australia's cultural artistic viewpoint.

Therefore, he says, it can be expected to go to higher health insurance premiums and an expensive way to stem the rise in private health of the recent announcements where the minister NA 7312 approved rises in premiums of between four annual rate of inflation, this is the initial evidence The increased premiums, as he said, provide suggest that the government's policy of providing insurance will only serve to fuel excess inflation insurance. The minister's efforts to therefore claim budget when he is massively trying to expand of the public system will certainly never come that we will see, as Don Harding said, significant as a result of the increase in subsidies that insurance. One of the areas that the minister likes to large area of medical expenditure, the area of are here debating this today because we are going the A¥A has done with general practitioners Australian yesterday which indicated that general and to the AMA, 'Go back to the drawing board.'

This is just handing over fees and transferring the cost to the public. Let us get a few of the facts on the table In fact, it was as a result of Labor implementing that the cost of health care in Australia has its determined effort to pour money into private health sector, where costs are growing way that this minister will be known for and all expenditure look set to fail.

NA",228
91,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"Due to an administrative error by the Department of Health and Aged Care which confused private expenditure on health with private health fund expenditure, this answer replaces my previous answer to question No. 209 (Hansard, 11 May 1999, page 4165) to the honourable member and also addresses question No. 732 (Notice Paper, 10 June 1999, page 2004). In relation to the honourable member's original question, the data below shows the proportion of recurrent funding of health services met by private health insurance for 1994-95 and 1995-96. The data also shows the proportion of total health expenditure and total recurrent health expenditure funded by private health insurance for 1994-95 through to 1996-97 (detailed information on health expenditure is not available beyond 1995-96). met by private health insurance, by area of expenditure, 1994·95 to 1996·97 (per cent) 1994-95 1995-96 1996-97 10.9 10.4 10.9 met by private health insurance 4.2 3.4 69.9 70.1 2.9 2.8 28.8 21.9 15.6 16.0 5.7 5.4 11.5 11.0 11.1 Medicare Office Closures: Belmont, New South Wales (Question No. 305) Ms Hall asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 7 December 1998: (1) What was the cost to the Commonwealth of closing the Medicare office in Belmont, NSW, including obtaining a release from the lease of its premises. (2) How long did the lease have to expire. (3) How many staff were employed in the office. (4) What was the total annual remuneration paid to the staff. (5) What proportion of the staff is still employed by Medicare or Medibank Private. (6) What was the projected operational cost of the office for the period of the lease. (7) What is the projected operational cost for the Medibank Private office at Charlestown, NSW.",229
92,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The costs of vacating the Belmont Medicare Office were kept to a minimum through an extensive program of recycling office material. These modest costs were included in the Health Insurance Commission's (HIC) normal operating costs. The HIC does not release leasing information as it negotiates leases with a range of major commercial property owners and managers throughout Australia. Release of this information may compromise their ability to negotiate the most favourable terms for the Commonwealth. (2) The lease had two years, three months to run at the time of closure. (3) Two full time and three part time staff. (4) $139,203. (5) All. (6) The Belmont office closed on 27/3/98. The operational and projected operational costs for the period of the lease, assuming the office remained open, are as follows: 1996/97-$164,098; 1997/98-$187,119; 1998/99-$250,438; 1999/00-$257,951; 2000/01-$265,689; TOTAL = $1,125,295. Operational costs cover salaries (and from '98/99 salaries on costs), rent and other minor expenditure. (7) The operational costs for Medibank Private offices are met solely from funds raised by the company in operating the Fund in competition with other private health insurers. This is a commercialin-confidence matter. Job Network: Placements (Question No. 480) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Employment Services, upon notice, on 9 March 1999: (1) How many successful (a) Flex 1, (b) Flex 2 and (c) Flex 3 placements have been made in each of the 29 Job Network regions in each month since May 1998. (2) What is the (a) name, (b) date of cessation, (c) name of the participant to which the contract was subsequently allocated and (d) operating regions of each national participant who has withdrawn from the Job Network since it commenced operating. (3) What sum has the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business paid to national providers for Flex 3 payments. (4) What portion of the sum referred to in part (3) has been paid by the providers for assistance to the unemployed such as wage subsidies, training and clothing and fare assistance. Mr Abbott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Table 1 details the total number of placements for Job Matching made from 1 May 1998 to 30 April 1999. Table 2 shows the number of job seekers who have commenced assistance under Job Search Training. Table 3 shows the number of job seekers who have commenced assistance under Intensive Assistance. These data are based on the regions in which the Job Network Member sites operate. (2 and 3) No national providers have withdrawn from Job Network since its commencement. There is only one national Job Network Member-Employment National Ltd. The amount paid to Employment National Ltd for the provision of Intensive Assistance services is commercial-inconfidence. (4) The payment of wage subsidies, training and clothing and fare assistance is at the discretion of Job Network members and will depend on the needs and circumstances of individual job seekers and the relationship between the Job Network member and the employer. The Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business pays Job Network members for achieving outcomes, not for providing individual forms of assistance such as wage subsidies, training or clothing and fare assistance.

the survey conducted by Centrelink on Job Search Training ask specifically whether the Job Network was responsible for placing the respondent in employment; if not, why not. (2) Is it a fact that the questionnaire has no capacity to determine whether the Job Network was responsible for assisting a respondent find employment.

The survey is used to measure the level of employment and education or training outcomes around three months after completion of assistance. The survey does not ask whether or not the Job Network member was .responsible for placing job seekers into employment, because information about whether job seekers were placed directly into employment by the JST provider or another Job Network member is available from Departmental computer systems.

Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's qU,estion is as follows: The Guidelines for the. Pork Producer Exit Program (PPEP) containing a number of eligibility criteria specifying that Recipients will only be eligible for financial assistance under either the FFRS or PPEP but not both. A number of applicants have read this as meaning that a recipien- of FFRS income support is precluded from the PPEP. The policy intention of this part of the PPEP Guidelines was to prevent ""double dipping"" into both the FFRS and PPEP. To clarify this, I recently agreed that the Guidelines should be interpreted to Decade for Human Rights Education on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, to Promote and Protect Universally Recognised Human and protection of human rights in the Asian the promotion and protection of human rights in strengthening the rule of law Somalia iii the field of human rights ' xenophobia and related intolerance on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Human Rights resolutions is available on the Internet, Rights"", then ""Resolutions"", then ""1999"".

Indonesia: Australian Visa Restrictions (Question No. 676) . Mr Wilkie asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 1 June 1999: Do restrictions, stemming from the East Timor electoral process and associated violence, apply to the issuing of visas to Indonesians wishing to travel to Australia; if so, (a) what are the details and (b) do the restrictions apply to previously successful applicants who met the conditions of a previously issued visa. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No. Applications for visitor entry to Australia from Indonesia are assessed against exactly the same legislative criteria as apply elsewhere in the world. The decision to grant a visitor by assessing the applicant's ability to fulfil certain legal.and policy criteria determined by the Australian Government. The legal criteria for the grant of a visitor visa require, among other things, that the applicant meets Australia's health and character standards, has adequate funds for support for the period of the visit and that the applicant intends a genuine visit to Australia. When deciding whether or not an applicant intends a genuine visit, visa processing officers must take into account relevant considerations such as the applicant's personal circumstances, incentive to return home and financial situation. The likelihood of an applicant overstaying or seeking to remain in Australia is also a matter that has to be assessed. Because of differing risk factors exhibited by visitors from different countries, different approaches are taken to assessing whether the applicant meets the legislative criteria. Applicants from most low risk countries are able to access the Electronic Travel Authority. Applicants from high risk countries apply for a traditional paper visa and are required to undergo a higher degree of scrutiny. Applicants from Indonesia must apply for. a paper visa.
