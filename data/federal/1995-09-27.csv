2,Mr JOHNS,COMMITTEES,"Petrie-Special Minister of State, Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters) (9.31 a.m.)-On behalf of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: York Park North office construction, Barton, ACT. The new building will replace inadequate accommodation which is currently used by the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. The existing buildings are inadequate because they are located in four separate locations around Canberra, resulting in inherent corporate inefficiencies. The new accommodation will involve the construction of a four-storey building with a net lettable area of 14,000 square metres with 150 basement car spaces, 30 surface car spaces and associated engineering and landscape works. The outtum cost of the project is $40.129 million and is inclusive of base buildings, fees, holding charges, contingencies and escalation. If parliamentary approval is obtained, construction can commence in June 1996, with the project being completed by December 1997. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Reference",11
3,Mr JOHNS,COMMITTEES,"Petrie-Special Minister of State, Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters) (9.32 a.m.)-On behalf of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Redevelopment of Hinkler building site, Barton, ACT The new building will replace the Australian Federal Police's current unsatisfactory headquarters accommodation, which is currently scattered in five different locations around Canberra. By consolidating in one building, the efficiency and effectiveness of the services offered by the Australian Federal Police will be improved. The location of the site in Barton means that the Australian Federal Police headquarters will be in close proximity to Parliament House, the Australian Federal Police training college and other Commonwealth agencies with responsibility for the administration of justice. The work will involve the construction of a six-storey building of 14,000 square metres of net lettable area, which will incorporate office accommodation for the Australian Federal Police, basement and roof plant rooms, public facilities and staff amenities, including a museum, cafeteria and auditorium. In addition, associated engineering site services and landscape works and surface and basement car parking will also be provided. The cost of the project is $39.158 million and is inclusive of base building fees, holding costs, contingencies and escalation. If parliamentary approval is obtained, construction can commence in February 1997, with the project being completed by August 1998. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",11
4,Mr JOHNS,COMMITTEES,"Petrie-Special Minister of State, Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters) (9.35 a.m.)-On behalf of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Relocation 10 Tenninal Regiment and Anny Maritime School. The 10 Terminal Regiment transfers cargo and troops from one mode of transport to another at sea, road and rail terminals. The Army Maritime School trains defence personnel in the seamen operated terminal and fitter marine trades. The combined unit will consist of 180 regular soldiers with 170 general reserve soldiers. The two units are currently dispersed over four sites in Sydney. Relocation will improve training opportunities and reduce administrative costs. The relocation of 10 Terminal Regiment and the Army Maritime School to one site will save some $3 million in annual operating costs. The relocation will also provide increased training opportunities and locate the unit closer to its primary user-that is, the 3rd Brigade. The Public Works Committee tabled its report on 18 September 1995 recommending the project at an estimated cost of $25.9 million. The Department of Defence has noted the committee's recommendation: namely, to advise the committee of the results of the environmental assessment of the project being conducted by the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency and to continue the public consultation process during the detailed design and construction phases of the project. Works are planned to commence upon approval with construction completed by the middle of 1998. I thank the committee for its support. I commend the motion to the House.",11
5,Mr ABBOTT,COMMITTEES,"Warringah) (9.37 a.m.)This relocation of 10 Terminal Regiment and the Army Maritime School may very well save $3 million a year in running costs but, as the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns) pointed out, it will cost $25 million. The government plans to recoup this $25 million by selling land on Middle Head. The move to Townsville, according to the Public Works Committee report, is 'justified by the need to rationalise land-holdings'. In other words, this whole move is not justified by defence reasons; it is justified by budgetary reasons. This is a money making exercise rather than a defence exercise because, as we well know from previous bitter experience of with this government, rationalisation is simply a code for selling. A very telling passage in the Public Works Committee report states that this move will generate 'enough revenue to more than cover the cost of this project'. In other words, the sites at Middle Head, Georges Heights and Woolwich, which are currently occupied by 10 Terminal Regiment, are going to be put on the market for the highest possible bidder in order to cover this government's budgetary black hole. These are the sacred sites of the people of Sydney. These are the last unspoilt headlands in Sydney Harbour, and this government is going to sacrifice them on the altar of its budgetary difficulties. Future generations will condemn this government if it is allowed to get away with this despicable move. The people of Sydney, the people of Mosman, the people of my electorate, are faced with the spectre of Mirage Middle Head. It is more than simply that; the fact that something like this is happening shows the debasement of governmental process under the gentlemen opposite. Here we see a new and strange principle of government: namely, that the military must pay themselves for any move they seek to make. Under this government, and enshrined by this move, we have a pay as you go armyan army which has to live off the land. I ask: what would happen if, for instance, the Office of the Status of Women had to justify and pay for its move by selling its land-holdings? Of course there would be an absolute uproar. But this is not something relatively new, and some would argue peripheral, to the real function of government. This is the basic fundamental function of government: to protect the nation from such external enemies. The army is the most essential thing that any government runs. This government is saying that the Australian Army must operate on a pay as you go basis, that the Australian Army must live off its own land. It is a strangely medieval principle. In those days it used to be called the right of pillage. This government has brought this back to life in a bizarre permutation of the user-pays concept. Under this government you have to pay for the roads that you drive on, you have to pay to go to government schools and soon you will have to pay to watch television. The poor old army has to pay to make any move that it deems necessary. The fact of the matter is that this is a disgrace. It is a bad move and is an even worse principle. The coalition policy on this matter is quite clear. As enunciated by Senator Newman, the coalition's policy is that any move by the army must be justified for operational and not budgetary reasons. I say to members opposite: stop playing games with the people of Mosman, stop playing games with the people of Sydney and leave 10 Terminal Regiment where it is. If you have to move it, accept the principle that public land should stay in public hands.",12
6,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"The honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) has just said that this move should be justified on operational grounds. It has been. Surely it seems more logical to have the maritime part of the army in the part of Australia where those they work with are situated. What happens now is that when the army has exercises-and most of their exercises are off Townsville-they have to go to Townsville by road and sea at a cost of millions of dollars a year. It is much better for operational reasons to locate them where the main group they work with are. That is the reason for the transfer from Sydney-a lot of good the maritime services are in the middle of the city-to Townsville. By doing this, we will save over $3 million a year. I thought that members of the opposition, who are very concerned about saving money, would be interested in saving $3 million a year. I am happy to arrange for the honourable member, when we are there again in about a month for another movement-and I have already discussed this with him-to come with us on our tour of inspection. I am more than happy to arrange for him to talk to the defence personnel before that. It is my understanding that we are not going to sell off that land. If I represented that area, I would share his concern about this land being sold off. It is my understanding from inquiries I have made and from evidence we have received at our hearings-I am not a minister, so I cannot give a definitive answer-that it is not going to be sold. I point out to members the point we stressed at our hearings. The purpose of it transferring this unit from Middle Head to Townsville is an operational requirement to bring that part of Australia's forces to where those they work with are, and that is in Townsville. Even if they were going to work with the people from Holsworthy that would still involve a distance. Most of their work is with the forces we already have in Townsville. We looked at six other sites including Darwin, Mackay and Brisbane. On all the evidence it was found that the best site was Townsville. It will save the taxpayers of Australia $3 million a year-not an inconsiderable sum of money. The whole purpose of the move is operational. I am more than happy to debate this with the shadow minister for defence. I am sure that the shadow minister for defence would agree that, for operational reasons, Townsville is the best possible location for this unit of the Australian Army. Question resolved in the affirmative.

7,Mr MACK,SYDNEY AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"North Sydney) (9.50 a.m.)No matter how the lily is gilded, the Sydney Airport Curfew Bill is a result of public pressure since the third runway opened and 1994 the coming election. It is also clearly a response on behalf of the government to the private member's bill of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), who simply got in first. Both bills, and virtually all of the debate, are examples of what could be called the 'Easton petition syndrome'-a common disease which attempts to minimise the responsibility when things go wrong, transfer blame to someone else and seek political advantage. Frankly, the spectacle of government and opposition speakers blaming one another for the disaster of the third runway is sickening to the Sydney public. The truth is that the Federal Labor Party gave into airline interests in the 1940s in establishing an international airport at Mascot. Even then the evidence was clear that the site was unsuitable. From 1951 on the coalition has consistently supported the airport expansion irrespective of its recent hypocritical Damascus experience. Indeed, in only 1993 the coalition flirted with the removal of the curfew altogether. Any credit resulting from Labor's attempt in 1972 to find a new airport site was more than cancelled by its late 1980s reversal and the leasing of terminals to the airlines followed by its decision to go ahead with the third runway-an approval, I might add, which was only made possible by the collusion of the New South Wales Liberal government. The only government with even relatively clean hands on this issue was the Wran Labor government, which effectively prevented the construction of the third runway from 1976 to 1988. The Carr Labor government's credentials are yet to be seen but there seems little hope, given its inaction over the last six months. Only the partisan and gullible will be taken in by the arguments of either major party as to who is to blame for the current situation-both are equally culpable. Make no mistake: the public anger at the betrayal of the residents of Sydney by both major parties will not go away, irrespective of this bill or the installation of any of the election sops proposed so far by the government or the opposition. The level of protest and civil disruption in Sydney is going to escalate as has happened at other airports around the world. Whoever is in government next year will face the spectacle of increasingly angry demonstrations and decent men and women being dragged away by police. They will also be haunted by the catastrophic scenario of a major accident with horrendous loss of life. Irrespective of this bill, the fact is that since the first international flight arrived at Mascot in the 1940s the place has been run to suit the airlines. Since then captive governments have poured in billions in subsidies, assisted by the captive regulatory authorities. From an area about the size of two football fields the airport has steadily gobbled up a large area of Sydney. Huge areas around the airport have been given over to airport related infrastructure. Thousands of homes have been demolished. Now hundreds more will be demolished at Tempe in the near future and thousands more along the flight paths will slowly decay and cease to be livable. In addition to being the worse environmental disaster to befall any large Australian city, over half a billion dollars has now been spent or committed-more than double the amount the public was told it would cost-with more to come. It is amazing or perhaps a sign of guilt that no-one has raised the fact that the cost of the third runway has already more than doubled with the proposed expenditure of $260 million of remedial work in a forlorn attempt to ameliorate noise problems. Even this is only the tip of the iceberg. Vastly more will be spent in the future. Major health studies already under way which have not yet been completed will lead to new expenditure and no doubt legal actions. New standards are being set which will have repercussions at airports around Australia and pressures will mount in all expanding urban areas from Broome to Brisbane and eventually in Melbourne. Yet after all this we have a third-rate airport at Sydney which can't even cope with the Olympics. It has no long-term future and has become a massive health hazard to both passengers and residents alike. It is almost unbelievable that all of this has been done without any cost-benefit studies which would have shown the massive economic cost and detriment to Sydney in terms of urban consolidation. I can only reiterate yet again that it is testimony to the failure of the two-party system that we have reached the present position, having ignored the long-term economic, social equity and environmental effects of continuing to expand Australia's major airport in the densest part of Australia's largest city and the enormous implications that flow from such an action. The problems of urban consolidation and minimising the sprawl of Sydney and other major cities have been well recognised since the 1960s. While both state and federal governments have preached ad nauseam about the need to stop urban sprawl for almost 20 years they have achieved little by their ineffective developer-driven solutions of attempting to force high density housing on an unwilling community while having no transport and land use policy and no policy of conservation of residential land, which are the only effective answers to urban consolidation. What has not been recognised in the urban consolidation debate is the economic, social and environmental effects of Kingsford Smith airport, burgeoning since 1945 like a black hole, absorbing housing, attracting motor vehicle traffic, breaking down the urban environment for kilometres around the airport. At every stage in the history of Sydney airport both government and opposition have served the private interest rather than the public interest with decisions made based on the next election. Virtually nothing said in the debate of this bill by government or opposition suggests that the future will be any different. The Leader of the Opposition's bill to entrench the curfew in legislation-which is certainly the catalyst for the government's bill in spite of the many denials-is little more than window-dressing. It does nothing to improve the current situation and allows substantial increase in traffic in the curfew period in the future. Given the Leader of the Opposition's consistent support for the expansion of the airport over the last 20 years and his strong support for the construction of the third runway, which was well ventilated at public meetings in his own electorate prior to the runway's construction, his bill cannot be considered as other than unprincipled electoral opportunism. The pretence of the opposition that it was misled by the environmental impact statement is patently false and hypocritical. It was clear as a bell what would happen following the third runway construction, as thousands of Sydney residents and even a reading of Hansard can attest. In fact no-one who looked sensibly at the conclusions of the EIS or the costs believed them-not even the airlines or the regulatory authorities. The government's record is even worse given its 12 years of office, the selling out the airline interests in the late 1980s, the attempted misleading of the public with the third runway environmental impact study in terms of its environmental effects, and the public expenditure. Nevertheless, the government's curfew bill provides the first small reversal of half a century of expansion at Sydney airport, although the restrictions contained in the bill do not go anywhere near far enough. It certainly does not go anywhere near giving the residents of Sydney any guarantee of a decent night's sleep. It does not deal the myriad of problems in the curfew hours resulting from he uncontrolled use of light aircraft under 2000 feet, helicopters, and the many propeller-driven aircraft. It also ignores the problem that no curfew exists at Bankstown or other airports in the Sydney region. It is no satisfaction to anyone who cannot sleep because of aircraft noise, despite what type of aircraft it is or what airport it came from. However, the bill does tighten movements in the shoulder period and tightens exemptions and imposes penalties. But many loopholes still remain and, on the record of the airlines, the regulators and executives of the major parties, there can be little public confidence of any substantial improvement. In spite of many. reassuring but ultimately worthless statements over the years no financial penalty has ever been imposed and exemptions have been handed out like confetti. Notwithstanding the assurances of the current Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), it is unrealistic not to expect that the airlines will fully exploit, and be permitted to exploit, all the loopholes in the future, as they have done in the past. The legislation does at least, for the first time, allow for the provision of information to the public and at least establishes some framework for public consultations and, as such, the people of Sydney should be grateful for small mercies. In broad effect, however, the bill has only marginal benefits, as have other remedial measures that the government is implementing or talking about. Measures such as the insulation of 4,200 to homes have minor benefits for a handful of those affected by noise in Sydney but introduce new problems of fire, air conditioning, and confining people to their homes. It leaves many thousands of other properties with no redress, a degraded environment and substantial losses of property value. In many cases their homes are their only financial asset. Acquisition of a handful of residences goes some way to compensating some of the residents who are now subject to impossible noise conditions immediately adjacent to the airport but it is a tragic irony, when state and with federal governments have been talking urban consolidation in Sydney for over 20 years, that now the federal government is demolishing homes and reducing low income accommodation. Some reward for the 'true believers' ! The minister's suggestion of a cap on total movements at the airport is again to be welcomed. However, in the face of the reality of a 25 per cent increase in jet movements to the north when the new control tower comes into operation in the near future, you can forgive Sydney residents for being cynical. The proposal of reopening the east-west runway is certainly something which most residents of Sydney want, on the basis that it would share the noise more equitably. But given that the advantage would be only temporary at best, with the relentless increase in air traffic and the strong possibilities that it is likely to be manipulated to increase air traffic to the north, as the airlines have already signalled, it is obviously no long-term solution. Many arguments have been canvassed on safety aspects of reopening the east-west runway, and the opposition's position must be treated with some scepticism in the face of its record of consistently supporting airport expansion. The likelihood of a future coalition Minister for Transport carrying the personal responsibility for accidents at the airport is really stretching credibility. Almost certainly, the use of the east-west runway would be watered down to cater mainly for general aviation and regional airlines and would result in increased north-south heavy jet movements together with an increase in the overall airport capacity. Nevertheless, a reopening of the east-west runway is desirable if it can be achieved, properly managed and does not result in additional growth of air traffic. But it is certainly no panacea. It is of marginal benefit, as are the various suggested improvements in flight paths. Underlying this bill and almost everything that has been said in the House by government and opposition speakers is the brutal acceptance that a few thousand people at Kurnell can be sacrificed to minimise electoral fallout for the rest of Sydney. Every speaker in this debate seems to think no-one lives south of the airport. In spite of the impassioned hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition of sharing the noise, everyone seems to be satisfied, like 'good Germans', to virtually exterminate the residents of Kumell in a futile attempt to curry electoral favour with the vastly greater numbers of voters north, east and west of the airport. Just as the third runway meant a dramatic increase in noise to the north of the airport, this bill heralds a literal nightmare for Kurnell residents. Suggestions of confining flight paths to the Cronulla sandhills and the heads of Botany Bay or that southbound planes euphemistically go 'out to sea' are a cruel attempt at deception which will certainly not fool anyone at Kurnell at least. The truth is that no matter how you twist and dive there is no way out. Nothing in this bill, or anything that has been said in this House by the major parties, addresses the main issues of Sydney airport in any substantial way. No amount of marginal amelioration on scheduling, flight paths, the curfew or runway usage will have any real effect on the noise and environmental problems of Sydney airport. Neither will it have any effect in stopping the economic and environmental haemorrhaging of Sydney in respect of the urban consolidation effects of the airport. These costs, which have never even been considered, would make the cost of a new airport and the required infrastructure almost insignificant. No amount of marginal tinkering will alter the fact that Sydney airport will always be a third-rate airport on its present site and continue to be a major economic handicap to Australia. Australia's air services in the future can never be properly satisfied at Kingsford Smith or even with Badgerys Creek as an overflow airport. The disadvantages of dual airports are well known. The major airlines will never leave Kingsford Smith unless they are forced to and will continue relentless expansion on that site. The only effective long-term solution now possible is the development of Badgerys Creek as a replacement airport and the phasing out of Kingsford Smith over the next 15 years. A site for a new airport completely outside any future Sydney conurbation must also be found if the history of Kingsford Smith is not to repeat itself at Badgerys Creek. The last 50 years of airport planning has been an unmitigated failure in Sydney at least. Surely, now that this fact is almost universally accepted, except by those trying to justify their past involvement, we can plan for the next 50 years. Unfortunately, that is doubtless a forlorn hope, given the virtual impossibility for decisions to be made in the rigid two-party system of government except on the basis of short-term partisan advantage. This is the fundamental reason why the collective decision making of a succession of individually intelligent people over many years has brought us to our present disaster. The Leader of the Opposition's threat to block privatisation until the east-west runway is re-opened and the noise problems of the airport are solved can be criticised on many grounds. At best it offers only temporary relief and attempts to raise false public expecthe tations. It does however offer the government an opportunity to back away from privatisation which can only compound all the present problems. If Kingsford Smith is privati sed there hope for any real solution in the long-term future. The residents of Sydney will have no alternative but to mount a campaign of such ferocity as to deter any intending purchaser. This is an appalling prospect opening up an endless and destructive war of civil disobedience, endless legal actions, ever more disruption of airline services and further millions of taxpayers' money wasted. On one point the Leader of the Opposition is absolutely correct. No privatisation should take place in the face of the present problems. Where he is wrong is holding out any suggestion that the problems of Kingsford Smith can ever be satisfactorily resolved by the reopening of the east-west runway or other virtual placebos. Certainly every possible amelioration should be pursued in the short term but the fundamental problems cannot be solved except by redevelopment of the site. Privatisation of Badgerys Creek would at least have the virtue of making the redevelopment much more attractive in principle. Of course, such a proposal will be anathema to the current airline interests who hold a virtual monopoly for the next 30 years or so thanks to one of former Prime Minister Hawke's deals at Kirribilli House in the late 1980s. It will also be anathema to the many countless bureaucrats and indeed members of this House who have been part of the problem over the years. It will be resisted by a few thousand regular airline users and staff of Sydney airport who take a selfish short-term view. Yet no-one who looks at the broader view of Sydney as a whole and the economic efficiency of Australia's airlines into the future could deny the need to at least carry a comprehensive cost-benefit study into the redevelopment of Sydney airport and its environs housing some 200,000 people at relatively low density and the construction of a replacement airport at Badgerys Creek. Nothing of public value can be achieved by continuation of mutual partisan vilification and divisively attempting to set residents of various parts of Sydney against one another. The present Minister for Transport was an undeniable major factor in the demise of the is no state Labor government in 1988. History is very likely to repeat itself at the next federal election but nothing will be resolved at Sydney airport. I can only urge the minister to at least examine this constructive proposal.",14
8,Mr SINCLAIR,SYDNEY AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"New England) (10.07)Unlike the member for North Sydney (Mr Mack), I believe Mascot not only is ideally located but also is one of the best airport sites for any capital city anywhere in the world. I regard the present legislation and the overreactions of people in Sydney largely to be the product of mismanagement and mishandling by the present Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), who I regard as inept, incompetent and deliberately abusing his power and prerogatives in a way which I believe is objectionable. Sydney airport has several prime functions. Without doubt, the growth of the city and the growth of passenger travel into Australia, both tourist and business, depend very much on an ability to handle a large number of people safely, in all weathers, without delays in approach to Sydney airport and in such a way that, of course, the people around Sydney are subjected to no more noise than is absolutely essential. This legislation is the result of the government, yet again, playing catch-up politics. As in so many other areas, they have tried to rely on beating people around the ears instead of trying to find constructive and positive solutions. Again, unlike the member for North Sydney, I do not believe Badgerys Creek or its accelerated development in any way will provide an answer to Sydney's traffic problems as far as air movements are concerned. Badgerys Creek is situated in one of the most rapidly growing areas of Sydney. The population there, without doubt, will become quite intensely concentrated in future times. Not only that, but because of Mascot's proximity to the coast it is possible for about 50 per cent of all landings on the so-called north-south runways to be over water. Over Badgerys Creek, every landing and every take-off has to be over land. I do not believe the hilly terrain, the infrastructure that is necessary to provide access to Badgerys Creek, the distance from the centre of the city, any more than the fact that it is over that rapidly growing outer suburban area of the city, make Badgerys Creek a suitable site for the airport. For all these reasons, therefore, I see restricdifficult tions being imposed not only on Mascot but also on the proposed development at Badgerys Creek as an inadequate solution to what are recognised as future major traffic problems. There are other aspects I should identify, too, when talking about the problems of Mascot. Firstly, representing country New South Wales, I find quite unacceptable any suggestion that there should be undue political inhibitions placed on access to and from Mascot. Mascot, of course, is the desirable venue for people seeking to come to Sydney from intrastate for business, pleasure or family reasons. To suggest, should Badgerys Creek be developed, that it would in some way be an alternative is absolute rubbish. Badgerys Creek is miles away. It takes away the advantage of being able to get into Sydney in the morning and leave again at night. If you keep people coming in and out of Sydney, it avoids some of that traffic movement that is an undoubted problem in Sydney itself. When you have people moving in and out of Mascot, you at least avoid having people using the roads quite as much, to the disadvantage of other residents. My concerns really revolve around four areas. The first relates to political interference. I believe the Star system, the new airport take-off and landing schedule, has been developed in a way I believe has prejudiced the noise incidence in significant residential areas of the city. I believe that the support being given by Ansett and Qantas to the maintenance only of the north-south runways and not the east-west runway is based purely on political pressure being applied to them, and for no other reason. I believe the whole basis for the movement out to Badgerys Creek, and that area's rapid development, is not an answer but a politically expedient device. I will return in a moment to the whole concept of political involvement which I see as a fundamental problem in any rational discussion of the airport. The second problem is a physical one. Sydney is Australia's major aircraft destination, and to suggest that disciplines in some way be imposed so it will become more for people to land into and take off from this magnificent Mascot airport site I think is ridiculous. Therefore, we have to find a way to accommodate this. Thirdly, we need to take account of the impact on residential areas around Sydney. If there are ways by which the level of aircraft noise can be contained, ways in which the noise can be spread so that you can avoid aircraft circulating, avoid aircraft cutting across main residential areas, avoid aircraft having their engines at full throttle or in reverse thrust so that it does not in any way accelerate that noise contamination, of course those things need to be addressed. The fourth area, which is just as important, is that we have to look at ways in which the facilities we have can be better utilised. It is in this area that I see the answers to many of the present problems. For example, I would like to know why the control tower is not open. I find the political intervention in the process of both the take-off and landing procedures, and also in the way in which aircraft are now being routed around Sydney, not a product of trying to contain the noise problems-which quite properly the member for North Sydney and others have identified in this debate-but it is there simply because I think the minister and a few of his colleagues want to keep aircraft from their particular parts of Sydney and relocate them elsewhere. Were they acting on behalf of Australia, they would start by identifying the problem in the broad and by trying to contain the noise level generally, rather than trying to redistribute it in a manner that penalises some and advantages others. Frankly, that is the way I see the operation of the standard arrivals system as it now operates. I certainly believe that the closing of the east-west runway has accentuated the traffic flow and the noise problems over particular parts of Sydney. In the time available, let me briefly talk about four issues. These concern me because there seems to be all sorts of ways by which this government has fallen into that typical Labor Right trap of New South Wales of trying to do things for their mates and forgetting about the general interests of the people of our community. I acknowledge totally that there are problems in the way in which international competition has affected the viability of our airlines. I know, for example, that Ansett has had problems, in spite of the preferred position that it has been given in access to airports. The honourable member for North Sydney referred to negotiations that occurred while Prime Minister Hawke was in office. Such negotiations certainly gave them a position in the ownership and operation of their terminals that made it almost impossible for Compass to succeed. Let us look at Qantas. Qantas knows that it has been starved of capital by this Labor government. They know that, if they are to be able to compete in what is quite an exciting future for air traffic and air transport around the world, they have to be able to re-equip. They have to have capital in order to re-equip with aircraft that will be able to provide the services desired. They also have to be able to maintain services in a range of destinations or to a range of destinations that will attract sufficient passenger volumes. I believe a number of destinations have been closed by Qantas not on the basis of a rational assessment of potential traffic but on the immediate projection of what the cash flows will be with the capital that they have available. The government has been heavy handing them over privatisation. I totally support the move toward privatisation but it should not be predicating their long-term future. As far as Qantas is concerned, the government is in the position of saying to them, 'Don't you say anything in favour of reopening the east-west runway.' For that reason, and because of the privatisation pressures that have been applied, it is my view that Qantas's view on the reopening of the east-west runway should be totally ignored. I believe it is there for the wrong reasons and because of pressure that has been applied inappropriately. As far as Ansett is concerned, I believe the same argument applies. Let us look at the situation regarding the agreements with Air New Zealand. One can find that political pressure has certainly been the way in which Ansett has been told that Air New Zealand mayor may not be allowed to buy into them. In terms of opening our air services with a single aviation market, there has again been an intrusion based peculiarly on a political basis. In a debate in the New Zealand parliament, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. David Cay gill, said that the New Zealand government's actions 'had been inconsistent and weak, and had given Australia the impression that New Zealand was powerless' . Prime Minister Bolger replied: ... the government had not engaged in knee-jerk reactions; it had not, as some in the Labor Party suggested it should do, thrown out the Australian airline, Ansett New Zealand, in retaliation. It was absurd to suggest putting up the barriers again. Prime Minister Bolger continued: The real reason for the withdrawal was not a failure of New Zealand to honour the undertakings of the memorandum of understanding: the Australian Minister of Transport had said it all when he said that the understanding on a single aviation market was affecting the Australian Labor government's proposal to float the Qantas airline. Ansett was very concerned about its position in terms of arrangements with Air New Zealand and they were in the same position as Qantas because of privatisation and the federal government being able to heavy hand them. In my view, those are the only reasons that both Qantas and Ansett did not come out in support of the call-and full marks to Hazelton Airlines for putting this view-that the east-west runway be opened. If you look at the why, where, how and what of the traffic flow, you have to understand that there is not just the need to reopen the east-west runway and to spread the traffic; there is also the matter of the height in which aircraft are now directed because of this operation of standard arrivals system. Also, there is a significant redirection of aircraft heights of movement which I do not believe minimise noise in the way that they could. If one looks at the influence of politicianspoliticians from the Labor Party and, in particular, the minister-at opening and improving Sydney airport, one has to accept that an honest and rational approach has not been given to the issue. I believe that is very much to the disadvantage of those people whose homes are under the flight paths and who are prejudiced by increasing airport noise. What we have to do is ask a few significant questions. Why has there been no increase in air movements? Why does the minister continually refer to simultaneous operations when there are no simultaneous operations? In every other major airport across Australia, east-west and north-south runways in virtually similar relativity to those at Mascot operate quite satisfactorily-at Tullamarine, at Brisbane, at Perth and at Adelaide-and no complaints are lodged. Why? Because there is no political intervention in the way there is at Mascot. There is a way in which you can significantly increase traffic movements at Mascot without disadvantaging the residents around Sydney and flights would not be delayed the way they are now. I can tell you, as somebody who flies in and out of Sydney all the time, that there is hardly ever an air traffic movement that is not delayed on the way into Sydney airport, even when a prior landing slot has been given. In my view, landing slots have nothing to do with aircraft noise; they are all about maladministration of the airport. What concerns me is that there is an entirely wrong approach and answer being given by the minister, who is suggesting that in some way simultaneous operations are dangerous. At the moment, with the take-off and landing pattern, because planes are using the parallel runway they do not cross on the ground but they cross in the air. The nature of traffic movement into Sydney is no less dangerous in the air than it is on the ground. I believe that again it is a matter of political interference rather than any pragmatic and practical understanding of the real at way in which you can best contain aircraft movements with efficiency, expedite aircraft movements without aggravating the noise problem, and move and allocate traffic patterns to aircraft without in any way prejudicing the noise problems which rightly are the concern of all those who live around that area. We need to have a look at a number of other problems as far as the operations of the political intervention are concerned. I do not know whether, when we get the new radar in November, there is going to be, as the member for North Sydney suggests, a 25 per cent increase in traffic to the north. If there is, it needs to be spread. That is one of the reasons the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has introduced the bill he has and has been advocating, as we all do and as he does in the amendments to be moved to the legislation, the re-opening of the east-west runway. You are not going to be able to achieve, through the political manipulation of traffic flows, the containment of air noise. That is the fundamental problem in this whole question and until we get to a straight and reasonable application of the technology that is now available, a technology of utilising the slots so that traffic flies straight into Sydney, minimising the distance flown, you are not going to be able to efficiently use what is a prime located airport. I mentioned a little about Badgerys Creek. I understand and recognise that at some stage a second airport is going to be necessary for Sydney. I do not accept that the surveys in any way demonstrate that Badgerys Creek is a prime location. Of course, with the Olympics 2000 coming up, there is a feeling that something has got to be done in order to meet the increased traffic flow. But Badgerys Creek still has far more disadvantages in the long term than it has advantages. The people of that part of Sydney are going to be far more subject to aircraft noise than they expect. The increased traffic flow from the new infrastructures, essential to move people and freight from that airport, is going to be a further disadvantage. It is yet another example of the way political interference has disrupted what could be a rational and reasonable development of the Sydney metropolitan area. I think that at the moment more movements per hour could be achieved at Mascot throughout the day and I believe that the curfew needs to be applied, as this legislation suggests, but needs to be applied having in mind that you cannot succeed in promoting the growth of traffic into Sydney unless you do something about allowing more traffic movements through the day. Nothing at the moment can be seen as achieving that, under the present minister's policy. I would like to know why aircraft cannot operate east of the airport. There are very traffic movements and traffic turns in a line between the coast and straight into the north-south runway. There are, on the other hand, many to the west of the airport. I see absolutely no reason why that cannot be changed. I certainly do not follow why there is more holding at Mascot than at any other international airport. All these questions are matters where the political involvement of the minister and the government have been to the disadvantage of people in Sydney. There is no doubt that the environmental haemorrhaging on which several members have commented is more a product of politics than it is of proper management. Mascot is a primely located airport. Mascot is a facility which has enabled Sydney to grow. It was because of the advantages of Mascot to a large degree that the Olympic bid was successful. Now there is to be even more political intervention because the minister refuses to open the tower. The minister seems to be determined to maintain through Stars, the operation of standard arrivals, a flight plan which I believe contributes to noise, not relieves it. The minister is determined that the east-west runway will not operate. The minister is determined that aircraft will not operate east of the airport. I believe these are all disadvantages. I strongly support the amendments which are to be moved by the Leader of the Opposition. I believe the government yet again has been shown to exploit its numbers in this place and its power base within the business world and is totally neglecting the reasonable needs of the residents of the city of Sydney. Sydney will not be able to grow, if Sydney is to continue to be the commercial hub of Asia, none of those things will be possible without efficient economic access through Mascot. It is not possible by the present political steps being used by this Labor government to see the advances that could otherwise be possible. I very strongly support the foreshadowed amendments and the additional legislation introduced by the Leader of the Opposition and believe that the minister needs to withdraw his sticky fingers from what I see as an absolute mess in the administration of this few department. The sooner he does so the better chance there will be of the resolution of the traffic flow problems and the noise contamination about which all of us are concerned.",18
9,Mr KEATING,SYDNEY AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"I have seen some shabby things done in my day in this parliament, but this is about the shabbiest. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has been going around the business community talking about the micro economy, how he is going to improve Australia's lot in life, how we are going to make the place more competitive, how he is going to run a better wage system. When they ask him questions he talks about a productivity commission. He also talks about microeconomic change. When they ask him these questions he is always going to improve the courts and the wharves, he is going to improve the infrastructure, he is going to hop into the unions-he is going to do all these tough things. But in the biggest single microeconomic reform in the state of New South Wales, the third runway at Mascot airport, what does he do? He hocks the whole thing for a few votes in his own seat of Bennelong. If the business community need any proof that this person is a completely straw man they have got it here. Here they have the gateway to Australia, the greatest microeconomic change in civil aviation in this country in 20 years, and what does he want to do? He wants to cut its efficiency virtually in half to pick up a few votes in his own seat, which he has won reasonably comfortably since he came here in 1974. It is not as if there are five or six seats sitting around the airport and you can say, 'There is a bit of rent politics here.' This is so low you would need a pair of binoculars to find it. This is about a handful of votes in Bennelong. So what does the Leader of the Opposition say? He wants to take the runway which he supported and championed for years and years and years. 'When is this government going to have the courage to build the third runway at Sydney airport?' 'When is this government going to do the right thing about the needs of the commuters of New South Wales?' 'When is this government going to do the right thing about the tourism potential of this country build the third runway at Sydney airport?' This is what he was saying through these. The government takes the decision, squibbed by so many others, at the urging of the then coalition state government under Premier Greiner in New South Wales. It builds the runway under budget and under time and then puts into place the most ambitious, in world terms, noise abatement program anywhere. Not only that, it has forced aircraft to take aircraft patterns which minimise the damage and noise to the surrounding communities. But I know and John Howard knows that if we seek to try to have traffic on the east-west runway across two parallel runways the result will be a dramatic collision. This was always known. The problems at Mascot airport were always known. While ever we had intersecting runways, we were always in the cart for a major collision. We nearly had one not so many years ago. Not only did the incoming plane nearly clean up one on the cross-wind runway; it also nearly took out one waiting to take off. We nearly had three aircraft all rolled into one in what would have been probably the worse accident in Australian airline history and probably in the world. I cannot remember a time in the last 20 or 30 years when three major aircraft have been involved in such a collision. That is what was on the cards and was only narrowly missed at Sydney. This has been on for years. Running a cross-wind runway was always dangerous. The two parallel runways and the two parallel low paths will always provide a higher level of safety and efficiency and, for the city and the country, a higher level of throughput. John Howard wants the nation to believebut he particularly wants the business community to believe-that he is the tough guy who will do the things that Labor would not do. He will hop into the wharfies and the people on the ships. The fact is that we now have turnaround times on the wharves the same as those on the European ports. We now have less than 18 crew, on average, on Australian ships. It was 28 a few years ago. He wants to convince the business community and that he will go for these big micro-economic changes. But on one he has actually supported, one that is actually built, one that has substantially lifted the capacity of Mascot airport and one that has lifted safety enormously what does he want to do? He wants to open the east-west runway, which will introduce a major safety factor. At the same time, in the doing of this, he will tug away at what is without a shred of hyperbole the greatest micro-economic change to the state of New South Wales in the last 20 years. We now have this parallel runway sitting there and working. Safety has improved. The noise abatement program is going into place. For a few miserable votes in one seat-his seat of Bennelong, which he already holdshe is going to junk and jettison the greatest micro-economic reform in civil aviation in this country in 25 years. That puts into some stark perspective where the Leader of the Opposition would really go with the economy. He is the fellow who nearly did everything. He wanted to float the dollar, but he did not do it. He wanted to deregulate the banking system, but he never got around to it. He wanted to knock the tariff wall over, but tariffs actually went up while he was Treasurer. Mrs Crosio--Great Gunna Howard.",22
10,Mr KEATING,SYDNEY AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"Gunna Howard. He was gunna remove the exchange mechanism and put in a float. He was gunna knock over the banks. He was gunna knock over the tariff wall, Gunna Howard. He left it to this Labor government to do all those heavy tasks. We have done them, even on this one, which matters mightily to the tourism industry of this country, the city of Sydney as it approaches the Olympics, the state of New South Wales, all those people who fly from the country seats and all those people from rural New South Wales and the country electorates who want to get access to Sydney. They will chop the numbers in half by a proposal to run through a cross-wind runway. Mr Tim Fischer interjecting",24
11,Mr KEATING,SYDNEY AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,Are we going to have a little debate over here? Mr Howard interjecting,24
12,Mr KEATING,SYDNEY AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"No, you will not. You will obey the standing orders. Not only has he shown us his form on the runway, but now he is saying he will actually jeopardise the government's budget, he will actually vandalise the government's budget, by tearing away at the central element of the asset sale program-that is, the sale of Kingsford Smith airport, a $2 billion change to the budget. For John Howard, it is the worse of all circumstances: turning over a micro-economic change, one he actually supported, simply for a few rotten votes he wants to pick up in his own electorate. At the same time, he is abusing the numbers they have in the Senate to roll out a central part of a $2 billion asset sale program for the Commonwealth government. A lot of people in Australia have been looking at John Howard. I have been saying he is the same as he was in the late 1980s but that he is now older and worse. But they say, 'No, he has air brushed away his past. He is a new person.' All of his apologists in the media ought to now see him as he really is that is, weak and sneaky. Here he is knocking over a micro-economic reform he has championed himself for a few miserable votes in his electorate. At the same time, he is not just putting his bill and his argument and having his bill run the gamut of the House of Repre·· sentatives and the Senate but he is now saying that if he does not get his way he will knock $2 billion out of the budget numbers.",24
13,Mr GEAR,SYDNEY AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,Vandalism.,24
14,Mr KEATING,SYDNEY AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"So he wants to vandalise the budget on the way through. Are people going to call this good policy, high principle? Are they going to say these are reasonable tactics to get his way when he was one of the people urging the government for years to build a third runway? He knows, as well as any member of this House knows, that an east-west operation intersecting two downwind runways is a recipe for a major accident. Mr Howard interjecting",24
15,Mr SPEAKER,SYDNEY AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,Order! The Leader of the Opposition has had his chance in this debate.,24
16,Mr KEATING,SYDNEY AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"No, I know I do not. On 8 February 1989 he had this to say: In the interests of safety, airport facilities should be upgraded immediately including the construction of the third runway. The current congestion at the airport is causing increased noise pollution and becoming a serious threat both to travellers and local residents. The Government is playing carelessly with a situation that could too easily result in a major tragedy. The risk must be averted.",24
17,Mr BEAZLEY,SYDNEY AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,What's that from? A cross runway.,24
18,Mr KEATING,SYDNEY AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"That is the same tragedy you are now trying to bring on. As the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) is passing notes around the place, let me read what he had to say in 1991: Any further delay in deciding on a third runway for Mascot could mean loss of life as well as economic insanity. With Mascot now operating at near maximum capacity, and air traffic controllers bending over backwards to extract maximum efficiency out of our present archaic runway set-up, the risk factor must be greatly increased. That is the very archaic runway set-up they now wish to go back to. Listen to this. On 10 September 1991 their former tourism spokesman, Mr Jull: ... renewed his call for the third runway project to commence following an aborted Qantas 747 landing. While not wishing to overdramatise the incident he said, 'It follows hard on the heels of a potential disaster involving a Thai jet last month. In light of this, it is impossible to understand why the Government is dragging the chain over the third runway. Increasing concerns over air safety and continuing delays at the airport make the immediate commencement of the project even more urgent.' Can you believe these people? Can you believe they brought this bill in for these tawdry political motives after saying these things so unambiguously and with such clarity? This is the daddy of all Howard quotes: I mean theirthis is our, the government'srefusal to build the third runway over the last 6'12 years has been based on their assessment of the politics of it. I mean their right wing numbers men openly boast that they're not going to be so stupid as to build a third runway and lose all those seats in Sydney. I have always regarded that argument incidentally as nonsense. Listen to this. John Howard said: I grew up under the flight path in the St George area of Sydney and know something about the politics of that area, and I've always regarded the issue as being grossly exaggerated in terms of the impact on local residents. There are a limited number of people who are severely affected by aircraft noise. The great bulk of the rest of them are only mildly affected. In any event, they bought their houses knowing full well that they were under flight paths. In any event, there are many sections of my electorate in areas such as Lane Cove and Hunters Hill who have just as much aircraft noise and areas frequently under flight paths as people living near the airport. That is what he said. If you want an example of a complete lack of principle, a complete duplicity and complete dishonesty of purpose and dishonesty of motive, you have seen it in the Leader of the Opposition's bill and his threat to abort the important sale of important public assets in the form of the FAC assets, with the principal one being the Kingsford Smith airport. That is where we are. The John Howard of the late 1970s is always gunna do these things. Mr Haviland-Gunna.",24
19,Mr KEATING,SYDNEY AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"Yes, Gunna Howard. The float, deregulation, labour market reforms and tariffs were all left to this government to do. The wharves, the ports, the telephone system and the removal of the domestic and international interface in the carriage of air passengers were all left to this government to do. Mr Cleary-The progressive party-the ALP.",25
20,Mr KEATING,SYDNEY AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"I thought rats only squeaked. These were the things that John Howard sought to build his reputation on. He has talked about the labour market and the micro-economy. In terms of the labour market, he is now saying that he will go back to his old agenda of flexibility downwards and cutting the pay of working Australians. Then he wants to hide it by talking about a fuzzed up no disadvantage test, again dishonestly smothering his motives. I hope that every business in this country understands this point. When it comes to the tough things like the ports, the wharves, the telephone system and the changes to the rail system, those big changes which the government has put into place, he says he will be the one who will improve those sectors; yet he failed the first major micro-economic test-that is, the needs of the gateway city of Australia, Sydney, in terms of air travel and the need for another runway, the need for safety and the need for access to Sydney by country people in New South Wales. All these things he puts asunder for the tawdry political purpose of shoring up the 3Y2 per cent margin he had in the seat of Bennelong at the last election. He is running around the country saying that he is going to lick the government, yet privately what is he worried about? He is worried about his own seat. He is really worried whether he is going to lose the three per cent margin in his own seat. I do not think he is fooling anyone here. I heard the newly elected mayor of Hunters Hill say last night on radio that she was not being duped by this exercise and that she knows all about the Howard advocacy and support for the third runway from years gone by. I do not think the airport noise people are going to take any notice of this ritual and late incantation. It is not a case of an airport noise problem here; it is the member for Bennelong's 'Portnoy's' complaint. He has got the 'Portnoy's' complaint, Mr Speaker. What we have here is a man who will put asunder every decent tenet of government in this country and every decent tenet of policy respectability, of policy reasonableness and of policy imperatives to improve the lot of one of Australia's great industries-tourism-and the access of people in and out of Australia's most busy airport, Sydney airport. These are the things which matter and which are going to matter in the next election. When we say that Mr Howard is weak, we give the example of saying he is weak because he now will not support something that he has formerly supported strongly. He is sneaky because he is now trying to pretend that he is really about trying to abate aircraft noise when in the past he has said they were exaggerated claims. He is weak and sneaky but, worse than that, he is into vandalism as well. The vandalism is that he wants to put a spear in $2 billion of the budget's figuring, simply because if he stamps his foot in the House of Representatives he does not hear the ricochet in the Senate. So he is going to try to beat up on the budget by knocking out the Kingsford Smith airport. This exercise speaks volumes about John Howard's incapacity to lead this country and how he would be unsuitable as Prime Minister of Australia. (Time expired)",25

29,Mr BRERETON,SYDNEY AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"Kingsford-Smith Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport) (10.47 a.m.)-in reply-The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) is fond of talking about headland performances. This performance of his has been about a particular headland that runs from Hunters Hill to Woolwich smack bang in the middle of his own electorate of Bennelong. This has been the headland performance to end all headland performances where the opposition would sell out, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said, every principle of economic management and every principle of financial probity. Why? For the burghers of Hunters Hill and the burghers of Woolwich to prop up his own 3.5 per cent margin. In doing so, he runs against every single piece of expert advice that has ever been made available, and he has not a scrap of substance to put against that expert advice. I first came into this House last year and indicated the advice of the Civil Aviation Authority, which was in very firm terms. The advice stated: The CAA reaffirmed its position that, on safety grounds, it strongly advises against the use of the east-west runway in intersecting operations with the parallel north-south runway system. This position is based on the following considerations: It has been accepted internationally that parallel runway operations are an improvement in safety over intersecting operations. . More complex three runway configuration operations would increase workload and complexity for air traffic controllers and pilots, with conflicting traffic patterns both on the ground and in the air. A large number of aircraft would need to cross the active east-west runway to position for take-off on the parallel runways, or taxiing to the tenninals after landing. It is estimated that aircraft would be expected to cross the east-west runway every 45 seconds or less. With the use of the intersecting east-west runway, the required safety corridors to accommodate aircraft carrying out missed approaches could not readily be provided. That was the advice of the Civil Aviation Authority then. At the time the opposition said, 'Oh well, they're discredited anyway. They've got a dreadful reputation.' A few things have happened since then. I think that was very sound advice and it is advice that has been reaffirmed by Airservices Australia. Airservices Australia-the body that replaced the Civil Aviation Authority-gave written advice dated 14 August 1995 formally reaffirming the position that, while parallel runways are available at Sydney airport, Airservices Australia itself, with its statutory responsibilities for safety, 'would not be prepared to restore simultaneous independent runway operations involving the use of the east-west runway in intersecting operations with the parallel north-south runway system'. There is the new body that replaced the Civil Aviation Authority saying, 'For God's sake, don't do it on safety grounds.' What of the other body that was set up to manage air safety-the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. That authority has new leadership and comprises the world's best expertise. It has a new charter principally charged with policing safety. What did it have to say? It had a lot to say. On 3 August 1995, it indicated in a written statement that simultaneous runway operations: . .. is an air traffic control procedure which permits simultaneous landings and take-off of aeroplanes on intersecting runways. The Civil Aviation Safety Authoritythese are the safety expertsis of the view that the restoration of Simops procedures at Sydney airport while parallel runways are available would be less safe than the current parallel runway system in operation. So there are two principal pieces of advice reaffirming the earlier advice from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. The opposition have come into this House and spoken about evidence before the Senate committee. Let us go to the operators themselves and see what they had to say. They not only gave evidence before the Senate committee but also felt obliged to put out their own press release. They quoted from their evidence in response to Senator Parer. I refer to the press release of the Civil Air Operations Officers Association-that is, the air traffic controllers. Their president quoted his response in the Senate to a question from Senator Parer, the chair, who asked: Are you suggesting that cross-runway operations are not safe or just less safe? Mr Lorschy replied: They are less safe. So here we have the Civil Aviation Authority, Airservices Australia, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the air traffic controllers themselves. Who comes along next? Qantas comes along next, with Ansett. What do they have to say? They have gone to print-they have made their position clear-with a joint statement from the managing director of Qantas and the managing director of Ansett. They said that their operational experts-that is, the experts of the airlines themselvesregarded the parallel runways as 'inherently more safe and efficient than intersecting runways'. They went on to quote the absolute necessity of this airport operating at between 80 and 85 take-offs and landings per hourbecause that is what it needs to do to meet the needs of Sydney. They indicated what happens if you return to the bad old days. They gave the figures in their press release-that is, without Simops, there would be 44 to 48 movements per hour on those intersecting runways and, with Simops, the best they ever got was 55 to 60 movements but with less safety. This is after $250 million has been spent developing a first-class runway system which is more safe and gives you 80 to 85 take-offs and landings per hour-landings that are needed for all the tourists coming to Australia, for all the domestic passengers in Australia and for all the rural air travellers who need access to Sydney. That great demand that the airport faces each day has led to the delays that have ricocheted through the whole air traffic system of Australia, and has finally been overcome with a system that will provide 80 to 85 take-offs and landings per hour, supplemented by Badgerys Creek, the new development at Sydney West airport. This is what Mr Strong and Mr MCMahon said: 'We accept the advice from the regulatory authorities.' Those gentlemen accept the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, Airservices Australia and the air traffic controllers. Qantas and Ansett accept the advice. The opposition, of course, says that it does not believe it. The opposition believes that its views on safety are more important. On behalf of those two great airlines, these two gentlemen said that they accepted the advice from the regulatory authorities and from their own technical experts that safety and efficiency would be diminished by permanent reopening of the east-west runway. Those two gentlemen say that the key point is that intersecting runways are inherently less safe and less efficient. Those are very strong views from the people who are best able to know. They said that the industry could not support the opposition's proposal, which experts believe will cut capacity and cause unnecessary delays not only to Sydney travellers but also to those using the whole of the national network. But, of course, when there are a few lousy votes in the electorate of Bennelong, and when the Leader of the Opposition's own neck is on the line, all the credentials go out the window. He is prepared to come into this House and say that if he is ever elected he will overturn all that advice and return to a less safe and less efficient mode of operation. He has made it very clear in this debate that he is going to put jets on the east-west runway. He said that it is going to be intercepting with jets. It is that which brings the capacity down. If it is not intercepting with jets, the member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) knows what it is: it is pulling the propeller driven planes out of the jet stream and raising the capacity of the airport from 85 to 95 landings per hour with 10 more jumbos coming down the north-south access, because they would eliminate 10 small planes which travel much more slowly and prevent those 10 jumbos from landing at the moment. The member for Bennelong says no, that is not what he is going to do. He said he will reopen the east-west runway for jet operations. He says that he is not about the 10 extra jumbos. Pigs he isn't! He will not admit it to his own electors. In the course of this debate the opposition has said that such operations are working quite well overseas, and it bases its whole case on what it says is better evidence than that coming from those bodies that I have just mentioned. The first piece of evidence is from a body called US Consultants Flight Transportation Associates. I have had a look at the report from that body. The House needs to be aware that the claim that use of the three runways in concert is safe and allows greater capacity is far from the findings to be found in the report. In fact, that is not what the report finds at all. The report was prepared in 1989 as a theoretical computer modelling exercise of capacity options at the airport. That was its purpose. In no way does it represent a detailed analysis of operational or safety issues. It does not go to those things at all. We have only to look at the introduction to the report to see that it is no evidence at all. This is the introduction that the opposition never refers to and which it has never put around the press gallery. The report says this: The capacity of the airport under existing conditions and under a number of hypothetical future alternatives has been estimated. It should be emphasised that examination of a hypothetical alternative does not imply that this scenario has been deemed to be feasible with respect to engineering, economic, environmental, statutory or other aspects. That is the qualification in the very report that the opposition relies upon to say, 'Oh no, believe us because we are able to quote the US consultants, Flight Transportation Associates.' The other thing the opposition relies upon is the claim that intersecting runways are operating on a similar basis at major overseas airports. They gave the example of Heathrow. There is no such thing in Australia; there is no comparison. There is no comparison internationally either. Let me go through the examples they have given. They spoke in this debate about the parallel operations at Heathrow airport. While there are two parallel runways and one intersecting cross-runway at Heathrow, the cross-runway is only used when there are excessive cross-winds on the parallels-the same as KSA at this very moment. What was the amount of traffic on the cross-runway last year? It was 1.4 per cent of movements at Heathrow. So that one is out the window. The next big example given was Los Angeles. They said that there is a similar situation at Los Angeles which works perfectly well. There is no similar situation at Los Angeles, because there are no cross-runways at Los Angeles. At Los Angeles there are four parallel runways, not a cross-runway configuration. So they are wrong again. Then they quoted Copenhagen, where they said there were two parallel runways and an intersecting cross-runway. But the experts will tell you that the parallels there do not work with Simops. The cross-runway at Copenhagen is restricted to small planes under 11,000 kilograms-no major planes at all. Nine per cent of the movements at that airport are those small planes on the cross-runwayexactly what you have ruled out by saying that you want to put jets on the cross-runway. So the example of Copenhagen goes out the door. The last example was San Francisco. The opposition said that San Francisco had the same thing, but it is not the same thing. There are not three but four runways at San Francisco. There are two sets of parallels. They do not use Simops either. There are no intersecting operations of jets on those runways whatsoever. They do not intersect. The arrangements at San Francisco are not in any way similar to Kingsford Smith. Kingsford Smith is an airport under great pressure. It is an airport vital to the interests of airports all around Australia-to the travelling public, to tourism and to investment in this country. Never in the 25 years as an elected representative in one parliament or another have I heard irresponsibility of the order of that of the Leader of the Opposition yesterday when he said that he was going to hold up the airport privatisation bill if he could not get his way for his constituentsthose burghers of the headland at Hunters Hill. He is going to hold up $2 billion worth of investment-$2 billion worth of investment that he is not even prepared to tell the truth about. Yesterday he assured the office of the Premier of Victoria that this would not hold up the privatisation, the leasing, of Melbourne airport when he knows it will. Each of the bidders has indicated that they want to bid for Sydney first. Each of the bidders has said that they will not bid for a minor asset.",26
30,Mr HOWARD,SYDNEY AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,They don't have to.,29
31,Mr BRERETON,SYDNEY AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"The Leader of the Opposition said that they do not have to. They say that they will not bid for a lesser asset, and Melbourne and Brisbane are worth less than half of Sydney. Sydney is their principal ambition, although if they cannot win Sydney they are happy to bid at the same time or later for Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. But they will not bid for those first up if that precludes them, under the cross arrangements, from subsequently bidding for Sydney. That is the reality. The Leader of the Opposition is putting off the whole process, because you cannot bid for Brisbane and Melbourne without at the same time bidding for Sydney. The contenders have all made that very clear. The advisers to the government, BT, have indicated that there would be a huge hit on the revenue if you go down that path. All the advisers-Finance, Treasury, BT Australia-have said that Sydney has got to come first. You have just put the knocker on it. Through this gross abuse of power in the Senate, you are going to use your numbers for a $2 billion hit on the budget of this country. In the process what else are you going to do? I will tell you, because it is not just Brisbane, it is not just Melbourne. At the moment, a multimillion dollar development of Adelaide airport is on the line as well, because that is to be funded from the leasing process. I'll bet you haven't told Dean Brown what you have done to him. I'll bet you didn't tell his office when you were telling porkies to Jeff Kennett's office-because this blows out the Adelaide airport extension by another 12 months. ",29
32,Mr BRERETON,SYDNEY AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"It absolutely does, have no doubt about it, because it is funded out of this process and the whole process is off as a result of these irresponsible actions of the Leader of the Opposition and this abuse of office in the Senate. What does it mean for the Sydney Olympics, with a critical time frame totally dependent upon Sydney airport being leased in the middle of next year and with funds from that to construct the airport at Badgerys Creek on a critical time line to be completed in 1999? That will be blown out now, as a result of this irresponsibility, by a further 12 monthsthat is, not available in time for the Olympics. What of the bidders themselves, those firms such as Lockheed, international bidders, the British Airports Authority which have had senior executives working here for up to 12 months, full time, preparing the consortia getting their bids together? What is the message to them? They have indicated that, as this whole process under the government plan was two years from first announcement to completion of the first tranche in June-July of next year, that is absolutely critical to continued interest. They have made that very clear to the government. But what is the opposition doing? 'No trouble at all. Let's rock it out. Let's not have the legislation passed through the parliament' - even though you say you support it'Let's not pass it through the parliament. Let's defer it and force it to be reintroduced after the next election.' That is a 12-month delay. What message does that send to international investors? What does that do for confidence in Australia? I repeat: in 25 years, I have never seen such gross irresponsibility, such utter stupidity. And I tell you this: everyone in Australia, the investment communities, the people who know the fibs you told in the past when you were campaigning so strongly for the extension of the airport and the construction of this runway know enough to be sure they are not going to let you get away with it. You might prop yourself up with your burghers in Hunters Hill, but you have certainly lost heaps with the rest of Australia. (Time expired) Question resolved in the affirmative. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",30
33,Mr HOWARD,SYDNEY AIRPORT CURFEW BILL,"by leave-I move: (1) Clause 1, page 1, line 2, omit ""Curfew"", substitute ""Operations"". (2) After Part 3, page 15, insert the following new Part (comprising clause 20A): ""PART 3A-OTHER NOISE ABATEMENT NA Ministerial direction to AA 20A. As soon as possible after the commencement of this Act, the Minister must give a direction under section 16 of the Air Services Act 1995 to require Airservices Australia to revise the noise abatement procedures for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport to disperse more equitably the noise generated by the operation and use of aircraft landing at, or taking off from, the aerodrome by increasing the use of the runway known as the east-west runway."". (3) Title page, omit ""and for related purposes"", substitute ""and to impose other noise abatement measures at the Airport"". I welcome the opportunity of moving this their amendment. It is, of course, the amendment which is going to put the member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) and other people on the spot. It is the amendment to reopen the east-west runway and it affords me the opportunity of saying a few things about the amazing contribution to the debate this morning by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I have one message for the Prime Minister: it is about time he made up his mind how he is going to attack me. One day the Prime Minister misleadingly claims that there is going to be a wages explosion under a coalition government. The next day he misleadingly says that I am going to cut wages. One day the Prime Minister says that I am a dangerous economic revolutionary and the next day he says I am a do-nothing troglodyte. The Prime Minister really ought to make up his mind just how he is going to attack me. Turning to the specifics of the amendment, I want to deal with a few of the lies that have been peddled by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) and by the Prime Minister. The first lie, of course, is that in some way the decision that has been taken by the coalition is going to punch a hole in this year's budget. That is what you said, didn't you? Yes, you said that, didn't you? Ah, you didn't. Where is the $2 billion hole in this year's budget? Has it gone already? That is what you and the Prime Minister said. Both of you said that I was punching a $2 billion hole in this year's budget and, when I confront you with that, what a deafening silence from the other side. The truth is there is no money in this year's budget at all from airport privatisation, and that is on page 3-214 of the budget papers. Not only were you caught out about the link between foreign debt and interest rates by your own budget papers, but your dishonesty on this issue has also been exposed. There is no hole being punched in this year's budget. Not a dollar has been taken out of this year's budget by the decision announced by the coalition yesterday. So lie No. 1 of Keating and Brereton on this issue has been nailed. There is no hole at all in this year's budget: let me make that perfectly clear. The second point I make very clear is that we are in no way opposed to the privatisation of the airports at Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide or, indeed, anywhere else in Australia. We are not opposed to their privatisation, and in fact we are not opposed to the privatisation of Sydney airport. But we are opposed to privatisation at any cost. It passes very strange that members of the Australian Labor Party-who for years said that privatising anything was anti-Australian, who for years said that to sell the Commonwealth Bank was like burning down the gum tree, that to sell the Commonwealth Bank would be to dishonour the memory of Ben Chifley and John Curtin, and we were told we stood for everything that was obscene and indecent in Australian life because we dared to argue the merits of privatisation-is now saying, 'We will privatise, and to hell with the consequences for the people of Sydney.' That is what you are arguing. You are really arguing that privatisation, no matter what the cost, is the right way to go. We are not arguing that; we never have. I have never argued that you should privatise something irrespective of its impact on the public interest. I have always said that you privatise an asset when you are satisfied there is a public benefit. My argument on Sydney airport is that you privatise it once you fix the noise problem. It is as simple as that. I am not saying, 'Don't privatise it'; I am saying, 'Fix the noise problem first.' It is as simple as that. It has nothing to do with economic vandalism, it has nothing to do with the comparative credentials of the Prime Minister and me on economic policy; it has everything to do with whether you care about the interests of the people of Sydney, and you do not. You talk about holes being punched in budgets, you talk about it being a great microeconomic reform. I now know what is really wrong with the prime ministership of this country. If Paul Keating believes what he did at Sydney airport was the greatest microeconomic reform for New South Wales in the last 20 years he is even more stupid and illiterate on economics than I thought he was. That is the most extraordinary proposition. (Time expired)",30
34,Mr CADMAN,MEASURES,"Mitchell) (11.13 a.m.)The Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) comes to the table pure and unaffected by the politics of this process in his own eyes. What about the directives you have given to the CAA? What about the typical standover Labor tactics you have used to get answers out of supposed safety bodies to get the answers that you want? What about the instructions? You think that those organisations do not leak. Let me tell you that you have a lot of unhappy personnel in those organisations who have had to bow down, against all their professional training, to instructions you have given to write and present reports so as to fudge this issue through the federal parliament, simply because the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Keating) claims that he knows better than you and better than your officials. It was the Prime Minister's idea that we should have the shambles in Sydney that we now have. It has destroyed the lives of hundreds of people. You have failed to give any real economic and rational application to the full and proper utilisation of that tremendous resource at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. The department and the authority hold reports that they themselves have commissioned about the full and proper use of that facility; reports that have been provided by consultants with international reputations on the proper operation of airports, but the minister has refused to recognise them. This is a politically driven process. I have hundreds of letters from people in my electorate, as have other members, saying that for the first time their lives have been disrupted. The quality of life and the health of their families have been affected. I have a copy of a letter written to Mr O'Keefe by Mr Allen Blewitt, who has lived for 22 years in the electorate of Grayndler, which is under the flight path. He is now living under the flight path in Cherrybrook, where the minister's decisions have so dramatically affected him and his lifestyle. Minister, you cannot get through on this one. Laurie's truck has to stop somewhere. It was the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) who used that expression when he thought he was branding the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the coalition's efforts to expose the government; but the fact is that he has branded you and the way in which you operate. The fact is that Sydney needs Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport to operate fully and properly, and Badgerys Creek needs to go ahead. The half-baked process you have used with both of them puts the lie to your real interest in this matter for the benefit of the people of New South Wales. You have refused to recognise that there should be a proper and full economic use of the facility at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. You are talking about levels of operation that are not in the best interests of the people of Sydney. The load should be shared. The load should be spread. There are people in your electorate and my electorate that are willil1g to share that load, but you are not prepared to accept a perfectly reasonable proposition. In return, the coalition has stated that it will withhold its support until some reason and rationale come to you and your leader. It is no good his strutting the country and claiming that he represents all Australians. Most Australians know that he does not. The Prime Minister's example on this issue illustrates how he believes a narrow minority interest overrides the interest of the majority. That is the game that he is playing. He is playing the narrow field to gain benefit from a few people. He needs to think of the member for Lowe (Mrs Easson). He needs to think of a wider range of people. He needs to act as a national leader. One of the reasons that he will not be re-elected to office is that people see the arrogance of the way in which he makes decisions and the way in which you support him. It is all cap in hand, no matter what the rationale, the logic or the economic outcomes. You will get the privatisation. All the minister needs to do is have a good look at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport, adopt the recommendations of consultants that have provided information to the authority and to your department and make good use of the airport. Then you will get the privatisation that you so earnestly want-despite the feelings in this instance of many members of the Labor Party who do not want the privatisation to go ahead. You will get our support if you do the right thing and use Sydney properly to the benefit of all Australians.",31
35,Mr HOWARD,MEASURES,"I could certainly pick up from where the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) left off in saying that this issue lies exclusively in the hands of the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). If the minister is prepared to accede to the very reasonable request of the coalition, which is to reopen the east-west runway, there is absolutely no reason why his plans for privatisation cannot proceed. It is as simple as that. Any suggestion that it is being delayed by the opposition is absolute nonsense. It would be a valid criticism if the demand that we were making were an unreasonable demand. But it is not an unreasonable demand to ask that the noise burden over Sydney be spread around. The government keeps quoting some remarks that I made in 1989. The remarks that I made were not made on the basis that all of the noise from aircraft in Sydney should be exclusively dumped on one part of the city. I am not asking that the noise be taken away completely from the people under the north-south flight path. All I am asking is that it be spread around. The government are running a fear campaign on health, they are running a fear campaign on industrial relations, and now they are resorting to a fear campaign on aviation policy. The fear they are using on this occasion is the threat of aircraft collision. You people have really hit the bottom of the barrel. It is a measure of how desperate you are about your electoral prospect that your leader should come into this place and start raising the spectre of collisions over the skies of Sydney or on the ground at Sydney airport, to score some cheap political point. You know the safety record of airlines in this country has been outstanding and you know the safety record at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport has been outstanding, and you know it was outstanding while you had the simultaneous operation of both the runways. Mr Ruddock-That is right-for 13 years.",32
36,Mr HOWARD,MEASURES,"Yes, for 13 years. Yet you people come into this place and try to run the safety argument. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) did not even know that the east-west runway intersects only one runway. He said at one stage during his speech that it intersected both of them. For a bloke who allegedly grew up in Sydney and understands Sydney, he does not even know the configuration of his own airport-and he expects to be taken seriously in this debate. I direct the House's attention to the mountain of evidence that has been given before the Senate inquiry on the issue of safety. Pilot after pilot, air traffic controller after air traffic controller came before that inquiry and said it was perfectly safe to reopen the east-west runway. Only last night, after an interview I did on television, I was rung by a former managing director of Qantas who said that he completely supported the stand I was taking and that it was perfectly safe and perfectly feasible to reopen the east-west runway. The truth is that you took a political decision to close the east-west runway. That was documented in the Laurie Oakes article I read out to the House yesterday. It was all about your own political convenience. You talk about headlands in Hunters Hill but what about the people in Mary Easson's electorate who also live under the north-south flight path? What about all the people who live in the inner suburbs of Sydney? Don't you think they ought to be consulted or are you so obsessed with your political attacks that you forget the situation in which many of those people are placed? This is not a complicated issue; it is a very simple issue. It has nothing to do with punching holes in budgets. I have already demonstrated that it has no impact at all on this year's budget. It is all about the fair sharing of a burden. One of the great Australian traditions is that Australians will always support the fair sharing of a burden. If they are told there is a problem and that some burden has to be assumed in solving that problem, they will go along with that solution, provided they are honestly apprised of the facts and the burden is fairly shared. We are not asking that some areas of Sydney that now have noise become completely noiseless, what we are asking is that there be a sharing around of the burden. It is a very simple proposition. We are not opposed to privatisation but we are opposed to privatisation at any cost. We believe the public interest has to be cared for in privatisation and that any privatisation has to run the test of public benefit. This privatisation fails the test unless and until the noise burden is tackled and the third runway is reopened. In the great Australian tradition to which we all ought to subscribe, the burden ought to be fairly shared. It is as simple as that. It is in the hands of the minister. He will be the person indicted at the bar of public opinion if the public interest is not properly served and not properly met on this issue.",33
37,Mr BRERETON,MEASURES,Kingsford-Smith Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport) (11.23 a.m.)-The opposition must think the public to be absolute fools with very short memories. This is the opposition that would pretend now that we did not have the debates of 1988 and 1989 and would pretend that they did not say any of the things they said then. Let me remind them: they knew right from the very start that the construction of the parallel runway involved traffic travelling on a north-south axis. That was the whole basis of their repeated advocacy of this development.,33
38,Mr CADMAN,MEASURES,But it didn't involve the east-west runway.,34
39,Mr BRERETON,MEASURES,"The member for Mitchell interjects. Let me remind him of what he said on 13 January 1991: The recently completed draft EIS was prepared on some of the most exacting grounds yet seen in Australia. The EIS allows three times the normal period of public input, provided $100,000 for groups opposed to the third runway to prepare submissions and has established a large number of government funded information booths to display the EIS. The EIS had said all this. It said how it was going to operate. Here you were wrapping it up: Mr Cadman branded the opponents of the third runwaythat was meas short-sighted. That is what you were saying then. He continued: Rather than see the irrefutable merits of the runway they have put self-interest before Australia's long-term national interest. They are jeopardising the long-term safety of travellersthe 'safety of travellers'because of intersecting runways. He said: Opponents of the runway should remember that there are strict legal guidelines for preparing EIS and it has been completely independently drafted. This was the greatest endorsement that anyone could possibly make of the process. You knew right from the very start. You said it not once but repeatedly. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) said it. He said this on 16 September 1991: The EIS has already found that a third runway would mean an overall reduction of more than 50 per cent in the total number of residents affected by aircraft noise. That is true, because the EIS, which the opposition are wrapping up-and it was not just Tim Fischer; it was not just the Leader of the National Party",34
40,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MEASURES,Order! The minister should refer to members by their electorates.,34
41,Mr BRERETON,MEASURES,"There were many others. Senator Brownhill was in there. The then Premier of New South Wales, Nick Greiner, was in there. Charles Blunt was in there. The list goes on and on. We have got all the quotes. Here is Tim Fischer-'a 50 per cent reduction'. That is true. The EIS said that all the traffic was going to be on the north-south axis. The whole basis of your contention that this was a good thing was that it was going to improve safety . You spent a lot of time talking about safety. It was not just John Howard who said on 8 February 1989: In the interests of safety, airport facilities should be immediately upgraded, including the construction of the third runway. The shadow minister for transport said on 14 December 1988: The government's indecision on the runway has put at risk the health of our flourishing tourism industry, the thousands of jobs it can provide, the lives of both domestic and overseas travellers. What were they talking about? They were third talking about Simops; they were talking about the dangers of intersecting runways. Mr Sharp--No, we weren't.",34
42,Mr BRERETON,MEASURES,"And today they would have the public believe that this was all an aberration. Listen, I have got 10 pages of yo,--r quotes and I am more than happy for this debate to go on and on. I will deal with each the one of them. You will be reminded over and over again that you were the greatest advocates of this. You knew exactly what it meant. You called for it. You campaigned for it. You charged around the countryside imploring its construction. Now, on the eve of an election, you put a $2 billion hole in the government's finances. It means a 12-month delay in this revenue stream. You put on hold the Sydney West airport. You put on hold the leasing of Melbourne and Brisbane airports. You put on hold the construction of the Adelaide extension. This is the dumbest thing I have ever seen any opposition do. (Time expired)",34
43,Mrs BISHOP,MEASURES,"Mackellar) (11.28 a.m.)This debate today is about the present. It is about individual Australians who are suffering as a result of your policy. The public are not foolish. They express themselves rather well. Here is a letter which states: The bill proposed by the government is not directed to solving problems but to off-loading problems, regardless of the consequences, coupled with a quick grab for funds. Since the opening of the so called third runway, the planning for Sydney's airport has been abysmal and riddled with problems. The thought that the government intends to keep and pass on these problems, which can only get worse, for prosperity through legislation is even more worrying. The public sees the problems very well. I said yesterday that your technique was to confuse and abuse. Precisely what you have done again this morning is confuse and abuse. Point No. 1 on confusion involves the safety issue. Where is the answer from the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) to our proposal about opening the east-west runway, which would put Sydney in the same position as Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth? The logic of the minister's argument, which is that somehow we in Sydney are less smart than the people who run the airports in Perth, Adelaide and Melbourne, just does not wash. If they can handle it in other parts of Australia, what is it about Sydney and the minister that says that somehow the people in Sydney are less competent than those who run it with perfect safety in Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth? It puts it back to the same situation where we were running it for 40 years and it was considered to be safe. Here we now have the minister saying that somehow we are not as smart in Sydney as they are in Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. The second point of confusion and abuse is the hole in the budget question. There sure is a hole in the budget. Do you know why? Because the sale of Qantas was $0.5 billion short. We were going to sell the AIDC and we are now not selling it. In fact, the government is going to buy back the shares. The ANL sale is less than satisfactory. We were supposed to see the Commonwealth Bank legislation in the May session. The Commonwealth Bank itself said, when the government announced it was to sell the remaining half, that it needed to see the legislation in May so that it could properly plan for the buyback of $1 billion worth of shares from the government, not from ordinary shareholders. They needed to see it in May. The best evidence we have at the moment is the answer I got from the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) the other day when he told me that they were not going to bring in the legislation until after the election because, in the words of the managing director of the Commonwealth Bank, an election might make things difficult for the government to deal with in the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. They planned for $5.3 billion worth of asset sales, not to retire debt or build something for Australia but to spend. It is like selling the house to pay the grocery bill. The $2 billion that is relevant to the first tranche of the FAC is projected for the next financial year-199697-not this financial year. Guess what? We are having an election between now and then. So the minister is right to say that there is a hole in the budget, but it is the government's fault. We are saying that before you privatise Kingsford Smith you have to solve the problems that are facing the people and not discount them, push them under the rug and say that it is somebody else's problem. That is the difference between us and them. We care about individuals; they care about stitching up groups and passing them on. They rule for the elite and the privileged. That same attitude has put us in the situation where, in the last 12 years, the people of Australia have become poorer while the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his predecessor have become personally rich. It is a bit rich for the government to come in here and say that we are putting a hole in their budget when we are talking about a budget we have not even seen yet. It is the budget that comes after the next election. If the Australian people are sensible, the government will not be running it.",35
44,Mr BRERETON,MEASURES,"Kingsford-Smith Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport) (11.33 a.m.)-The honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) has added to the falsities that I have already referred to earlier today. I indicated then the examples given yesterday of Los Angeles airport, Heathrow, San Francisco and Copenhagen are all incorrect in that none of them replicate the circumstances at Sydney with two parallel runways and one intersecting runway. They were wrong on those four, and in her contribution the member for Mackellar has just introduced three new airports. She referred to Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. Let me remind her that Melbourne has very occasional use of Simops. Why? Mrs Bishop-I am not talking about Simops; I am talking about cross-runways.",36
45,Mr BRERETON,MEASURES,"We all know what happens without Simops. You do not drop the capacity of the airport down to its old 55 to 60; you drop it down, in the expert views of Qantas and Ansett, to 44 to 48. That is what you do. That is what it was operating at before Simops was introduced. Mrs Bishop--Last week landings were down to 22.",36
46,Mr BRERETON,MEASURES,"You get the discovery award for the weather in Sydney last week. You are quite incredible. Let me indicate to the House that Melbourne, which only occasionally uses Simops, does not have a parallel runway. It is not an analogous situation. Neither of the airports at Adelaide and Perth have the capacity requirements of Sydney where the airline schedule is already 75 takeoffs and landings per hour in the peak periods. Mrs Bishop-So you are saying that Melbourne is smarter than Sydney.",36
47,Mr BRERETON,MEASURES,"No, it has less capacity, it has less demand.",36
48,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MEASURES,Order! The minister should respond through the chair when answering interjections.,36
49,Mr BRERETON,MEASURES,If you had any depthMrs Bishop--I am talking about safety.,36
50,Mr BRERETON,MEASURES,"We are all talking about safety. We are talking about how you get 80 to 85 movements through an airport with the that maximum of safety. When you do that, of course you run parallel runways because it is inherently safer than running cross-runways. Everyone tells you that. Adelaide and Perth not only do not have parallel runways but do not use Simops. They do not have any of the demand of Sydney. Members of the opposition continue to treat this House with contempt in terms of what they have said in the past and what they now would pretend they have never uttered. They claim repeatedly that they did not know about this. The fact is that they have known from the very start. They and their colleagues in New South Wales knew about this. It was Nick Greiner, the then Premier of New South Wales, who said on 7 February 1989 in advocating this construction: Many Sydney people, particularly those to the south and the south-west, will benefit from lower noise and traffic levels if the extra runway is built. You knew right from the start. You were actually talking then about the reduction in sound on the east-west runway. That is what you were doing. I have a lot of quotes. I have every one of you. You are all on toast over this. Now you pretend that it did not happen. Charles Blunt, who was then a big number amongst the opposition, said on 15 February 1989: The Hawke government must reverse its policy. A third runway is essential. Kingsford Smith is at capacity. Safety and operating standards are under pressure. A new runway will add 40 per cent extra capacity and reduce noise over residential areas. Where? The east-west, and you knew it all along. You knew it from the very first moment. It is in all your submissions. When time permits, I will go through a few of those submissions you actually made on the EIS itself. They are a damning indictment of you then and even more so now.",36
51,Mr RUDDOCK,MEASURES,"I want to put my support for the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bennelong, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), in the context of privatisation. The term CSO---community service obligationsis well understood in privatisation when it is debated in relation to other proposals, but here we are simply talking about a community service obligation. The inclusion of the amendment will ensure that the second runway, which has always been part of Kingsford Smith, is able to continue to operate as it before. The Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) is fond of quoting those who have advocated and supported a third runway for Kingsford Smith airport, but that was entirely consistent with the maintenance and utilisation of the second runway, the east-west runway, which is the purpose of this amendment. It is interesting that the minister is wanting to refer people's memories and has drawn upon quotes in favour of the development of a third runway as if it is in some way inconsistent with the proposition that is being put now. It is in no way inconsistent. Community service obligations are entirely consistent with valid privatisation arrangements. I have an equally long memory on these matters. I can remember when the Labor Party brutally exploited its opposition to the opment of any third runway in Sydney over many years. For almost the entire time that I have been in the parliament they have exploited that matter. They said that it was their position that they were opposed to any further development and enhancement of Kingsford Smith. I believe the minister, if we want to delve back into the quotes, was one who was arguing that way. I think it is more germane to look at what Labor ministers and Labor members have been arguing recently. I hope the minister took the opportunity to read the remarks I made yesterday because I quoted from his colleagues the member for Lowe (Mrs Easson), the Minister for Social Security and member for Sydney (Mr Baldwin) and the Minister for Consumer Affairs and member for Grayndler (Ms MCHugh)Mrs Crosio--You didn't say much else except quotes.",36
52,Mr RUDDOCK,MEASURES,"I certainly drew attention to the fact that each of those members advocated not years ago but only months ago the reopening of the east-west runway. When they had to front the people in their own electorates, and when they had to go on the record in front of their constituents, they were playing the same game that we know members of the government are prone to playingthat is, they are opposed to the government in has their electorates but when they come down they line up and vote with the government every time. I can guarantee that, at the end of this day, when we vote on this amendment, the member for Sydney, the member for Grayndler and the member for Lowe will vote against the interests of their constituents, against the propositions that they put to constituentsto that is, the east-west runway ought to be in place and operational, as we have always argued. We saw the enhancement of the facilities at Kingsford Smith as including the operation of the east-west runway. That is the point that needs to be understood.",37
53,Mr CADMAN,MEASURES,Why did Punch resign?,37
54,Mr RUDDOCK,MEASURES,"The honourable member for Mitchell raises a very valid point. The  the few people on the government benches who was prepared to put his job on the line and resign from the government to take a different position on this matter. It was government members who were continuing to campaign against the third runway. I hope that the minister, when he is delving into his bag of quotes, will be prepared to dig out the quotes from the honourable member for Sydney, the honourable member for Grayndler and the honourable member for Lowe and also the quotes of his many colleagues as they sought to maintain seats like St George, as it then was, and Barton in years past when they were arguing against the expansion of Kingsford Smith and any additional runway capacity. That was their position. In relation to this issue, this government led their constituents to believe one thing and then put another approach in place when they came into office.",37
55,Mr SWAN,MEASURES,"I would like to make some comments on the amendment moved by the member for Bennelong, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). I do so because I think this whole debate justifies the tag that he is the Ronald Biggs Australian politics. He is running around this House pretending that he does not have a past. But, unlike Ronald Biggs, he does not have a future. That is what this debate demonstrates. It demonstrates that he does have a past and he cannot pretend to ignore it. Even more disturbingly he has now demonstrated that he is an economic vandal-so insensitive to the needs of the tourism industry of this country that he could propose to have the capacity of Sydney airport. The tourist industry is one of those industries that have been the great economic generators and job generators of the last decade. He wants to go in and vandalise that industry. But worse than that: what are the consequences of this amendment for people who live in Brisbane? What are the consequences of this amendment for the Brisbane airport? I will tell you what they are. If he halves the capacity of Sydney airport, they will be going to Brisbane. I would like people in Brisbane to very clearly understand that it is a policy of the Liberal Party to increase movements at Brisbane airport by at least 10 per hour. So when they have problems in Brisbane with aircraft noise, they can point to whom would be responsible if he had his way-J.W. Howard. That is what this means. If he is going to have the capacity of Sydney airport, where are those planes going to go? If they had a choice between Melbourne and Brisbane, I am sure they would take Brisbane. When we debate the problems of aircraft noise in Brisbane, let it be clearly understood in the northern suburbs of Brisbane both north of the river and south of the river what the policy of the Liberal Party is on aircraft noise theremore international flights into Brisbane and less out of Sydney. That is the policy of J.W. Howard. I will have great joy in explaining Liberal Party policy to the residents of Brisbane. But worse than that: not only is he an economic vandal when it comes to the future prospects of the tourist industry; it brings us to the very basic question of aircraft safety. One of the great pleasures and responsibilities of I have had since I have been in this House is of being a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. The most chilling moment I have had on that committee was when we went over to BASI, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, to see the simulation of an accident that nearly happened at Sydney a couple of years ago on those intersecting runways. Not only did the two planes nearly hit but also, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said this morning, there was one sitting beside them. Had that collision occurred, in excess of 1,000 people could have died. You have the hide to come into this House and argue that, somehow, those sorts of intersecting runway patterns are safe-flying in the face of all that evidence that has come from BASI, just ignoring it. Why? So J.W. Howard can protect the residents of his electorate. But let us not worry about air safety and let us not worry about consistency because one thing is for sure: he will say the anything and do anything to win a vote. It does not matter whether people could be killed; it does not matter about consistency when it comes to air safety; it does not matter about the future prospects of the tourist industry-none of that matters. What we have got is this craven, opportunistic push for power. The victims here are the users of Sydney airport, the tourist industry of Australia which is the generator of jobs for so many young Australians-and, of course, those people who live in Sydney themselves and are affected by the airport, because you have got no constructive policies to put up as an alternative to those put forward by the government. The noise control plans put forward by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) and the insulation plans for those affected are all very important, but you have got no constructive alternative.",38
56,Mr BRADFORD,MEASURES,"The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) should stick to his hysterical outbursts against banks and running Queensland elections which tum 19-seat majorities into 16-vote majorities, because he knows absolutely nothing about aviation. Bringing Brisbane into the picture this morning is absolutely irrelevant. It is desperate. The government must be desperate to bring that particular member in here to try to fight their cause. He has done them no help at all. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) made very clear this morning what the issue was and, as he said, it is very simple. Where does the minister at the table, the Minister Transport (Mr Brereton), live? He lives on the end of runway 07 at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. Where does the member for  of runway 25 at Sydney airport. That is the reason the east-west runway has been closed at Sydney airport-for blatant political reasons. The minister has been caught out and the defence of himself this morning will be recognised for what it is: it will be recognised as absolute hypocrisy. That particular runway has been closed for blatant political reasons, that is, to put all of the noise at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport on to the residents to the north and the south of the airport. That is the reason this decision has been taken. Let there be no confusion over the issue. The fact is that we on this side of the House supported-I certainly supported it in the years before I entered this parliament when I was a member of a council in the northern suburbs of Sydney-the construction of the second runway at Sydney to increase the capacity of Sydney airport as an interim measure. I was involved in studies back in the 1970s. All of the studies put forward the reason for the construction of the second runway as being to increase the capacity until the second major Sydney airport, which has now been chosen to be sited at Badgerys Creek, could proceed. Because the government has decided since then to close the east-west runway, what has happened is that the capacity of Sydney airport has been reduced. I think members in this place have made it clear that there was never an understanding that the east-west runway-07/25-would be closed: it was always going to remain open. That was absolutely fundamental to the whole process: if that was not going to be the case, all the money that was spent on the parallel runway to increase the capacity of the airport would be wasted. That is where we are at today. Instead of a capacity of 100 to 120 movements per hour, we are getting 60-because of the decision to close the east-west runway. Safety is not a factor. That is a red herring and the minister knows it. For him and the for Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the honourable member for Lilley to start talking about the occurrence of a near miss at the intersection some years ago is a furphy. It is simply a misrepresentation of what actually happened. Simops was the procedure that was operating at the time. As a result of that incident the procedure was changed. As I recall it, the pilot of the aircraft that was largely at fault that day was foreign and misunderstood the instructions he was given. After that, the procedures were changed and Simops was operated on a restricted basis for Australian domestic flights. It worked from then on and can work perfectly well today. I could put an argument as to why Simops could come into operation at Sydney airport tomorrow, but we are not even talking about the reintroduction of Simops with the operation of the east-west runway. Does the minister understand that we are not advocating a reintroduction of simultaneous operations? We are advocating the use of the eastwest runway for properly programmed departures and arrivals. It is an insult to the air traffic controllers at Sydney airport or anywhere else to suggest that that cannot occur perfectly safely. It can. It works everywhere else in the world. It can work at Sydney airport, but it will not be allowed to work for blatant political reasons. Neither the minister nor the Prime Minister or anyone else on the government side can wriggle out of that. This is a lie. The minister has been caught out. The people of Sydney and New South Walesfrom country and metropolitan Sydney areas-know it. He will not be able to argue his way out of it.",39
57,Mr BRERETON,MEASURES,"Kingsford-Smith Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport) (11.53 a.m.)-We know who has been caught out here. Right from the very start of this process the opposition, through their many utterances, knew clearly",40
58,Mr CADMAN,MEASURES,"No, rubbish!",40
59,Mr BRERETON,MEASURES,"You didn't know? Well, let me",40
60,Mr CADMAN,MEASURES,Did Punch know that?,40
61,Mr BRERETON,MEASURES,go through the EIS.,40
62,Mr CADMAN,MEASURES,I raise a point of order. The minister is making claims that are absolutely spurious. He is saying that his colleague the member for Barton resigned without reason.,40
63,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MEASURES,Mr Reid)Order! There is no point of order. You are debating the point.,40
64,Mr BRERETON,MEASURES,"The fact is that the Civil Aviation Authority and the FAC established the preferred operating mode for the airport well ahead of the decision to build the runway. It was inherent in it from the very start. It was the very basis of the EIS. It was the essential factor in it-that the airport was going to get its efficiency and its added safety by a parallel configuration that was going to eliminate traffic on the east-west axis and leave the majority of people better off because there were more winners than there were losers. You repeatedly said that. You knew it absolutely. The member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) said a few moments ago that that near disaster was just one of those little things and that it has since been changed and fixed up. This is what the opposition was saying at the time. On 10 September 1991 the member for Fadden (Mr Jull) renewed his call for the third runway project to commence following the aborted Qantas 747 landing. This happened at the same time. The member for Fadden said: While not wishing to overdramatise the incident, it follows hard on the heels of the potential disaster involving a Thai jet last month. That was, of course, the DC9. Mr Sharp-DClO.",40
65,Mr BRERETON,MEASURES,"The DClO, yes, that almost took out the Ansett domestic jet and that in tum would have very likely involved a 747 that was parked at the intersection. If that had occurred it would have been the worse air tragedy in the history of the world. Mr Bradford-The Thai pilot didn't understand his instructions.",40
66,Mr BRERETON,MEASURES,"That is why we are not running Simops; that is why we are running parallel operations. Mr Jull went on: In the light of this, it is impossible to understand why the government is dragging the chain over the third runway. Increasing concerns over air safety and continuing delays at the airport make the immediate commencement of the project even more urgent. The then Leader of the National Party was in there, too. On 13 August 1991 he said this: Any further delay in deciding on the third runway for Mascot could mean loss of life as well as economic insanity. With Mascot now operating at near maximum capacity and air traffic controllers bending over backwards to extract maximum efficiency out of the present archaic runway setupthe cross runwaysthe risk factor must greatly increase. That was not the only thing that the then Leader of the National Party said. He said this: The federal government must make three decisions: firstly, to accept the expert advice that the third runway is environmentally more friendly than the present two runway set-up; Because it eliminated east-west traffic. He went on: Secondly, safety is of paramount importance. Finally, he said: The vital tourist industry must no longer be choked off through a lack of sensible economic thinking. All this was four short years ago. The opposition knew this. Those opposite like to think that the electorate does not know and will forget the state of the opposition's knowledge. Mr Sharp-You won't tell them the truth.",40
67,Mr BRERETON,MEASURES,"I will tell you what: one thing about me, right through this whole airport debate, right from the start: as someone who has represented this electorate at a state level and at a federal level and who has had the airport in his electorate for all those years-and it still is in my electorate-I have been consistent right through. I have been absolutely and utterly consistent. At that time when I was saying that there were major implications for those living under the north-south flight paths, what was the opposition doing? The opposition was saying, 'Get on and build it. Build it at any cost. Take no notice of the opponents.' The opposition was going to great lengths to mislead the public to the implications of the third runway construction. (Time expired)",40
68,Mr SHARP,MEASURES,"I commence my remarks by reiterating the comments of the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) who spoke here a few moments ago and who made the interesting point that by reopening the east-west runway, which is the substance of the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), we would cut the capacity of Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport by half. Those of us on this side of the House who were here for question time yesterday heard a contradictory point being made by the Manager of Government Business in the House, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley), who said that the sum consequence of reopening the east-west runway would be to increase the capacity of Kingsford Smith airport in Sydney. It is quite indicative of the chaos, disorder and dishonesty of this government that on the one hand we are told that reopening the eastwest runway will increase the capacity of Sydney airport whilst, on the other hand, we have had the example here this morning that reopening the east-west runway will actually decrease the capacity of Sydney airport by half. I found the honourable member for Lilley's contribution to this debate most instructive. also pass the comment that, if he feels it a great honour to be a member of the committee looking into aviation safety, it might be worth his while to actually turn up to it. My recollection of events is that the only two times he turned up was when BASI gave evidence to us about a possible crash and when he had the opportunity in Brisbane to get himself on the television. It might be instructive for him to take a little more time to participate in something that he claims to be so proud to be a part of. I move to the substance of the amendment and to the substance of the government's attack on the opposition's amendment to reopen the east-west runway. The government's attack is that to reopen the east-west runway would make Sydney's airport unsafe. Let us have a look at that. I see the honouras able member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) here today saying that that would be so. Your old mate Bob Carr-you remember Bob Carr; I think he is the Premier of New South Wales now, when he is not breaking promises-has been writing to people in your electorate and other electorates saying that, in his view, the best solution for Sydney's airport is to reopen the east-west runway. Mr Leo MCLeay-He knows nothing about airports.",41
69,Mr SHARP,MEASURES,"He may not know anything about airports, but I can quote people who do know something about airports who would agree with Bob Carr, your mate. Sollie people who would have some knowledge about airports and their operations are air traffic controllers. A spokesman for CivilAir, the union which represents air traffic controllers, was quoted in an article in the Australian of 17 December last year as saying: We could re-open it I guess, but it would take time to work out the procedures. The article also said: The controllers say they could devise new operational procedures to operate Sydney as a threerunway airport if the political and community will is there to re-open the east-west runway. Not only does he believe it but international experts who look into these matters believe it. For example, a gentleman who represents US I Flight Transportation Associates, in a letter to such mayor Barry Cotter-who would be known to the honourable member for Watson and to the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton)-said: ... internationally accepted standards exist for the simultaneous operation of crossing/intersecting runways and, as such, these standards should allow for the safe and efficient operation of Kingsford Smith International Airport, as has been the the past. The international expert confirms that you can operate the airport safely. In addition to the view represented by that gentleman and your mate Bob Carr, the Australian Federation of Airline Pilots, in evidence given to the Senate committee, said exactly the same thing. The Board of Airline Representatives and the Regional Airlines Association say exactly the same thing. The simple fact is that this government is telling the people of Australia something completely untrue in order to cover up for its incompetence and dishonesty over the closing of the east-west runway.",41
70,Mr BRERETON,MEASURES,"Kingsford-Smith Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport) (12.03 p.m.)-We have heard in the last few minutes one member of the opposition say that they do not want to bring back Simops, but we have just had from the man who would be Minister for Transport an indication that he prefers the viewMr Sharp-I have read a letter.",42
71,Mr BRERETON,MEASURES,Are you backing away from this? Mr Sharp-What I am telling you is an accurate reflection of the letter.,42
72,Mr BRERETON,MEASURES,"No, that is not true.",42
73,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MEASURES,Mr Newell)Order! Members will not debate across the chamber.,42
74,Mr BRERETON,MEASURES,"You said that there were international experts who said this could be done. Then you referred to a letter, and that letter dealt with the question of Simops, specifically at Kingsford Smith airport. In the last few minutes we have had the opposition say that it does not want to bring back Simops, but the man who would be responsible has indicated that he will. Mr Sharp-Read from a letter.",42
75,Mr BRERETON,MEASURES,Are you backing away from what you have just said? Mr Sharp-I'm not backing away.,42
76,Mr BRERETON,MEASURES,You're not backing away. You said it can be used safely using case in Simops and you have based this upon that letterMr Sharp-Yes.,42
77,Mr BRERETON,MEASURES,"I'm glad you said yesto Barry Corter leading the fight against the airport as the advice that you would follow. It is very instructive that the shadow minister would be so revealing because he, like me, would be faced with the advice of the government's experts-and these are the views of Airservices Australia, given formally after proper consideration. Mr Sharp-Don't believe Airservices Australia.",42
78,Mr BRERETON,MEASURES,"Are you saying don't believe Airservices Australia? This is their advice: they have reaffirmed that, 'While parallel runways are available at Sydney airport, Airservices Australia would not be prepared to restore simultaneous, independent runway operations using the east-west runway in intersecting operations with a parallel north-south runway system.' That is the formal advice of Airservices Australia. The shadow minister just said he does not like that advice; he prefers the advice that specifically says you can go back to Simops. This is instructive and revealing because he would be the minister in a Howard government who would have to instruct Airservices Australia not to do what they have said they are committed to do---that is, to operate the airport safely. They have said they are not prepared to. To get your way, to impose your will, to do this bit of crazy business on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) to prop up his seat of Bennelong in the interests of those burghers of Hunters Hill, you would be, clearly by your own admission, reintroducing Simops with less capacity, with less safety against every piece of advice. Mr Sharp-Oh, it is not every piece of advice.",42
79,Mr BRERETON,MEASURES,"Every piece of adviceit is the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, Airservices Australia, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, the Department of Transport, the safety experts of Qantas, the safety experts of Ansett. You have not got one expert, except for the one you just quoted who gave specific advice about bringing back Simops, which a speaker a few moments ago said was not the intention of the opposition. Which is it? Tell us-elaborate, make it clear. No wonder people are confused. You have come the full circle from being the great advocates of this in the interests of safety, in the interests of capacity. To avoid accidents it had to be built at all costs. You knew from the very start that the EIS said that all the traffic would be on the north-south access. Of course you did. You knew it absolutely. It underpinned the whole EIS and your very submission on the EIS made it clear. You quoted the figures, the actual numbers of the people who would be better off and the people who would be worse off and then you said, 'Because more people will be better off than worse off, it should be built.' Now you come into the House saying you did not know. Of course you knew. There could be no more absolute hypocrisy than we have seen from you today. No-one will believe you. And, of course, we all know about base political motive. But the most revealing thing today is the shadow minister's comments in this debate. (Time expired)",42
80,Mr SHARP,MEASURES,"The Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) says that all the expert advice substantiates his case. His senatorial colleague the former Minister for Transport, Senator Collins, in the Senate last year on 29 November, as reported at page 3464 of the Senate Hansard, in answer to a question from Senator Parer, said: The CAA is in the position that if a decision is taken to re-open the east-west runway, it will it workable. That is on top of comments that the Minister for Transport, Senator Collins, as he was at the time, made in the Senate in 1991-that he believed it could be made to work and that it would be safe and effective to keep open, at that stage, the east-west runway. You would have to look at a whole host of people who know about aviation safety. I challenge anybody in this chamber to judge who knows more about aviation safety in this country-the Minister for Transport sitting opposite, or the people who fly the aeroplanes and have the lives of people in their hands every day, people such as the Australian International Pilots Association, which gave evidence to the Senate inquiry into aircraft noise just recently. In a submission to the Senate inquiry into Sydney's aircraft noise problems, the pilots called for the government to reopen the east-west runway as the only way to ease the noise and air traffic congestion problems. In the same submission they also said that the new flight paths in Sydney have increased rather than decreased the aircraft noise problem. You have always promised the people of Sydney that you were doing everything to fix the problem, but in fact you were not. The fact we are debating this amendment today, and that earlier this morning we were debating the legislation regarding aircraft curfews, is proof evident that you have not been doing everything to fix the problem of aircraft noise in Sydney. It took the private member's bill of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) to flush you out, to get you to enact this legislation, otherwise you would not be here today debating this issue. So when you have been telling the people of Sydney, who are outraged about the aircraft noise that you have pushed over their heads, that you have done everything that could be done to fix the problem, the fact is that you have not. The fact we are here now debating this is proof evident of that. We need to understand that. Many people have spoken on this matter, not just those I have quoted. The Regional Airlines Association, with Hazeltons, were in this House yesterday indicating to us why the make east-west runway should be reopened and how you can make that operation both safe and effective. A whole host of people, including the airlines' board representatives, have said that you should reopen the east-west runway, that it can be done safely and effectively. All these people know more about aviation than you, me or anybody else in this chamber. All those people know more than you or me, and they say we should reopen this east-west runway. Do you know the reason the government is taking this stand? It is to cover up for the decision made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) back in 1989. I will quote again from the Laurie Oakes article in the Bulletin in December of last year: The original proposal was supposed to be that aircraft should take off only to the south and land from the south so that they flew over water rather than houses. Clever Keating changed that and sent them roaring over suburbia. The east-west runway was supposed to continue operating, but it was Keating who killed that idea, too, and ensured that all planes operated on the north-south axis. That is the reason there is outrage in Sydney today. That is the reason, in the House tod.ay, the minister feels most uncomfortable havmg to defend what he is defending. It is because he has to cover up for his now Prime Minister who then, as Treasurer, influenced the cabinet to close the east-west runway and to put all flights out of Sydney airport on the north-south axis. That is the reason we are here today. It is the reason those people in Sydney have had the quality of their lives destroyed, the value of their houses decimated, and it is the reason they have had to get out into the streets to demonstrate against the decisions, actions and incompetence of this government.",43
81,Mr BRERETON,MEASURES,"Kingsford-Smith Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport) (12.13 p.m.)-The further the shadow minister, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) goes, the deeper in it he gets. This is the fellow who wants to be the minister for transport. Mr Ronaldson-Answer the charge.",44
82,Mr BRERETON,MEASURES,"The charge? I will give the charge, well and truly. The honourable member said that the regional airlines propose to operate along the lines of the opposition's proposal and that it can be done safely. That is simply untrue. I have with me the propo-al of the regional airlines, and it does not mvolve jets on the east-west runway, it does not involve intersecting runway operations at all, and it does not involve Simops. It involves, and I quote, giving 'maximum capacity'-and that is so that no-one has to go to Badgerys Creek, I might say. The proposal goes on: It is imperative to open the east-west regional aircraft that have a very low nOise factor. In fact, they say, a bus on the road would make more noise than their planes. Then they said this, and it is very instructive: Every non-jet aircraft taken out of the main streamthat is, the north-south streamtraffic flow allows more jet traffic onto 16-34 runways. That is the proposal from the regional airlines: there will be 10 more jumbos on the north-south axis, 10 more jumbos over the electorate of the member for Lowe (Mrs Easson). That is why no-one in her electorate will fall for the performance of the opposition. As I said yesterday, the performance of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) in saying that he would use his numbers in the Senate in a gross abuse of office to knock a $2 billion hole in this country's finances, to knock over any chance of Sydney West airport being ready in time for the Olympics, to defer the runway at Adelaide airport and to put on hold for about 12 months the aspirations of Brisbane and Melbourne was an act of insanity. It was a demonstration of his unfitness to ever govern Australia. The shadow minister, from his actions today, has put himself in exactly the same position. The shadow minister said today that he would override the firm advice of all the experts in the department and in each of the authorities; that is, in Airservices AustraliaMr Sharp-What about BASI?",44
83,Mr BRERETON,MEASURES,"BASI made it very clear, if you read its report. It is made absolutely and abundantly clear in its report into the Thai airline accident that the sooner Simops is eliminated, the better. Yet you have come here today clearly indicating that you prefer the views of one so-cal-ed expert from the United States who pubhshed a report, totally qualified, saying that he had not done any of the modelling and. that .it should - ot be taken as being an engmeenng solutIOn, a safety solution, or an operating solution - t Kingsford Smith airport. - ut you I?refer. hIS advice to the expert adVIce of AuservIces Australia, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, the - nway to Department of Transport, the safety experts in Qantas and the safety experts in Ansett. You who would do the bidding of the Leader of the Opposition were you ever in office would be totally responsible for a less safe operation of this airport. That clearly demonstrates to me that you join J.W. Howard as someone who has demonstrated his total unfitness to hold high office, to be responsible for the safety of passengers at our airports and to be responsible for maintaining a network so vital to the economic interests of Australia. It has been total and complete unfitness demonstrated by you in doing the wretched bidding of J.W. Howard for the sake of a handful of burghers in Hunters Hill and Woolwich. You should be ashamed of yourself. I move: That the question be now put. The House divided. [12.23 p.m.] (Mr SPEAKER - Hon. Stephen Martin) Ayes ............... Noes ...............

84,Mr SNOWDON,PAIRS,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (12.33 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The enactment of this bill would set the salary of the next Governor General after he is sworn in on 16 February 1996. Because section 3 of the constitution fixes the salary of the Governor General for the term of office, the salary fixed at the commencement of the Governor General's appointment must be set at a level that will still be appropriate at the end of the term. The Income Tax Assessment Act provides that the official salary of the Governor General shall be exempt from income tax. The Governor General Act 1974 provided for a salary of $30,000. It was amended in 1977 to increase the salary to $37,000, Morris, A. A. amended in 1982 to increase the salary to $70,000, and amended in 1988 to increase the salary to $95,000. It is now proposed that the Governor General's salary be $58,000. The salary will remain unchanged through the period of the next Governor General's appointment. In proposing this salary for the next Governor General, I would like honourable members to note that Sir William Deane has requested that the salary be set to take account of the non-contributory pension which he will receive under the Judges' Pensions Act after retiring from the High Court. Payment of this pension will continue during his term of office as Governor General. At the commencement of the term of office, the sum of Sir William's net pension and the proposed salary would be in the order of $130,000. The principle that has governed the calculanext year. tion of this amount is that used to determine the salaries of governors-general in the pastthat is, to keep the average salary over the notional period of the appointment somewhat ahead of the estimated average annual income, after tax, of the Chief Justice of Australia. The proposed salary, combined with Sir William's pension as a retired Justice of the High Court, is commensurate with the office. It is economically responsible and maintains the traditional relativity between the Chief Justice and the Governor General. I commend the bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.",46
85,Mr REITH,PAIRS,"On behalf of the coalition parties, I advise the House that the coalition supports the Governor General Amendment Bill. It is essentially an administrative matter. It is non-controversial. We have no difficulties with it in any way whatsoever. The coalition does note the remarks of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Environment, Sport and Territories and to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon) that the bill has come before the House effectively at the request of Sir William Deane, Australia's next Governor General. I am sure all members appreciate the request from him. It does give me the opportunity, on behalf of the coalition parties, to formally welcome the appointment of Sir William Deane as Australia's next Governor General. This is a very good decision from the government. It has been warmly welcomed by my leader, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), and I know by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), representing both parties within the coalition. We consider this appointment and the fact that it is a good decision to be a matter of great importance. This high office in our political system is very important to the political well-being of Australia and its political institutions. We are fortunate that we should have a person of the calibre of Sir William Deane to hold the position as from I myself particularly welcomed one of Sir William's remarks in accepting the post upon its public announcement when he referred to the fact that political authority in Australia ultimately rests with the people. This is a very basic principle but a principle which lies at the heart of Australia's constitutional arrangements. In fact, as members would know, Australia's constitution only came into being after it was first approved of by the people in referenda held across the then colonies. You cannot formally change the words of Australia's constitution without the consent of the people. As the Queen's representative, this statement of, and endorsement by, Sir William Deane reflects the complexity of Australia's political arrangements. It also reflects the wisdom of the founding fathers in drafting Australia's constitution. If I may say, it is a very good remark for an incoming Governor General to make upon acceptance of his position. I will be brief-the bill requires little the comment as to its detail-but also take the opportunity afforded by the bill's coming before the House to also comment on and congratulate the outgoing Governor General on his term in that high office. There is no question that his period in office has been of benefit to the Australian nation, that he has upheld the traditions of the office and has accordingly received the acclaim of generations from all aspects and parts of the Australian community. In advance of his formal retirement, I also place on record the coalition's appreciation of the current nor-General's work in that post. With those few remarks, I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Snowdon) read a third time. ANL SALE BILL 1995 Consideration resumed from 20 September. Second Reading",47
86,Mr SNOWDON,PAIRS,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (12.41 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The ANL Sale Bill makes the necessary legislative provision to facilitate the sale the Commonwealth's shares in ANL Ltd, although agreement has been reached under which the finalisation of the sale to P&O Australia has been deferred until 31 October 1995. Finalisation of sale arrangements is subject to the satisfactory conclusion of negotiations on ANL's future industrial arrangements and the retention by the Commonwealth of a special share. ANL is a shipping company wholly owned by the Commonwealth. It formerly operated as the Australian National Line and was converted to a public company, with effect from 1 July 1989. The government first announced its intention to sell a substantial part of ANL in the context of the 1991-92 budget. A scoping study was undertaken which concluded in 1992 that, given its then trading circumstances, a sale of less than 100 per cent of the company was unlikely to be commercially feasible. During 1994 a further consultancy was undertaken as the first stage of a due diligence process into ANL. The due diligence process is a thorough examination of the Gover- company which, among other things, is designed to give a firm understanding of its assets and liabilities. That report was completed in August 1994 and its recommendation was that, due to ANL's poor financial position and bleak outlook, a sale was unlikely to be possible at that time and that the government's best option was likely to be a managed trade-down of the company. This would have meant an effective liquidation of the company. Rather than pursue this option, the government decided to appoint a new board, headed by Mr Neville Wran, to undertake further analysis, restructure the company and examine future options. The government also announced its intention to provide guarantees in respect of ANL's debt and any future the drawdowns under its promissory note facility so as to enable the restructuring to be carried out in a stable commercial environment. The ANL board carried out some considerable restructuring of the line, including the sale of ANL's interest in Australian Stevedores, the winding-up of joint ventures with of Howard Smith in bulk shipping and with Union Shipping in the trans-Tasman trade, the payout of a bank debt facility and the lease on the ship River Torrens and some rationalisation of overseas and corporate staff. Having received and pursued a number of inquiries, the board reported, earlier this year, that there was interest from a number of companies in the purchase of some or all of ANL, including proposals from two companies which may have involved the purchase of all of the Commonwealth's shares in ANL. In May 1995, the government agreed to the board progressing with potential bidders' expressions of interest in the purchase of the Commonwealth's shares in the company. In the event, one bid was received, being from P&O Australia, and this was not for the purchase of ANL with all of its existing liabilities. Based on that bid, the board and Commonwealth officials have been able to negotiate an agreement under which P&O would purchase the Commonwealth's shares in ANL, subject to a number of conditions. The government has had discussions with ANL unions, with the ACTO and with P&O on the sale option. Deferral of a decision to finalise the sale to P&O until 31 October 1995 will allow P&O and the unions, under the leadership of the Secretary of the ACTO, to conduct negotiations on ANL's future industrial arrangements. Subject to the satisfactory completion of those negotiations, the sale to P&O will be finalised. If the unions and P&O cannot reach a resolution acceptable to them and to the government, then the option of restructuring ANL to increase the potential for it to return to viability will be pursued. In order for the option of a sale to P&O be quickly carried out at the completion of the negotiations between unions and P&O, it will be necessary for the ANL Sale Bill to be passed by both houses of parliament by the end of October. P&O is keen to be in a position to take action to turn ANL's results around. Any further delay creates uncertainty, with the risk of consequent damage to ANL's market share in its various businesses. The substantive provisions of the bill do not monwealth's come into operation until the draft sale contract is signed. Should the contract not signed by the end of 1995, the legislation provides for its automatic repeal on 1 1996. The bill makes transitional and savings provisions in relation to ANL employee long service leave, maternity leave, compensation and rehabilitation, and certain retirement benefits that have become standard in legislaincluding tion providing for the disposal of major subleases Commonwealth assets, as for example sales of Qantas, ASTA and CSL Ltd. There are three major features of this bill which have arisen out of the negotiation the draft sale contract and the recent discusexpected sions between the government, unions and P&O in relation to the sale. The first feature relates to the provisions which flow from fact that P&O is not willing to purchase ANL's businesses nor take on all of ANL's liabilities. The second feature is the provision of an appropriation to meet any contributions required by the Commonwealth under the draft sale contract. The third feature is the need to provide for the protection of the future industrial arrangements that are being negotiated with P&O. To move the required businesses and liabilities out of ANL and convert ANL into a company with reduced liabilities, the bill provides for the transfer of certain of ANL's assets, rights, liabilities and obligations to a nominated company-<>r a subsidiary of that company-<>r to the Commonwealth direct. The nominated company, which is called 'RetainCo' in the bill, must be wholly owned by the Commonwealth. ANL, under P&O Australia's ownership, will continue to hold around $140 million of debt, in the form of ship and container leases to and drawdowns under ANL's promissory note facility. The assets, liabilities, rights and obligations to be transferred out of ANL will primarily be long-term ship leases and associated transaction documents, as well as several dormant ANL subsidiary companies. If a sale of ANL's shares in the Coastal ExpressLine business on satisfactory terms is not concluded prior to a sale to P&O, a holding company structure will be utilised to protect the Cominterests in this business. After the sale the Commonwealth will be continue to hold liabilities in the form of obligations under the long-term ship leases January transferred from ANL to RetainCo. RetainCo's obligations under the ship leases are, however, to be substantially matched by reciprocal income streams under long-term subleases of the ships to major companiesANL after the sale. These long-term are either in place or the subject of in the negotiations in train. The liabilities of RetainCo, in total around $183 million, will progressively diminish over of time as the leases are paid out and it is that RetainCo will be at least cash neutral to the Commonwealth over the long term; that is, there should be no net call on the Commonwealth funds to meet RetainCo's all of obligations over its life. The bill provides for a Commonwealth guarantee to be granted in respect of the obligations transferred to RetainCo. As the company will not be a commercially operating company in the ordinary sense, a guarantee will be required to give comfort to financiers that it will be able to meet its obligations. There is the possibility that RetainCo or an ANL company transferred to the Commonwealth may require operating funds in its initial year and the bill appropriates any funds necessary to provide working capital for 1995-96 for RetainCo or for the holding company. The bill also appropriates up to $15 million to meet any Commonwealth contribution required under the draft sale contract. There are three elements to this contribution. first element is to cover the contingency that relevant financiers may exercise change of ownership rights which would impose tional costs on the Commonwealth. Those financiers have, however, already provided principle consent to the change of ownership. Other elements of the $15 million include expenses, such as legal costs, related to the transfer of businesses out of ANL to RetainCo or the Commonwealth direct, and a continwill gency to provide for the possibility that ANL's operating results up to the date of sale are significantly worse than forecast. Current expectations are that only a small percentage of the $15 million will be required. In respect of the industrial arrangements be negotiated in respect of ANL, the bill provides for the articles of association ANL to contain special articles which will enshrine the outcome of those negotiations. The special articles will not be able to altered or removed without the consent of the minister, and the ministerial consent is to an instrument required to be laid before parliament and subject to disallowance. The consent will not be effective until the disin allowance period has expired. The bill proand vides for the minister to have the power to seek injunctions in the Federal Court to action, enforce the observance of the special articles and to prevent their removal or alteration. The bill also provides for alterations to ANL's tax position as a consequence of the sale. ANL's accounting period is to be bill to the House. aligned with P&O's and the holding of the special share by the Commonwealth is to deemed not to prevent ANL being treated a wholly owned subsidiary of P&O for tax purposes. ANL's accumulated tax losses, about $70 million, for the period before the sale will be extinguished and will, therefore, not be available to P&O to offset against profits post-sale. The government believes that a sale is the preferred option and the bill will facilitate the realisation of a long-term future for ANL. ANL is currently losing around $2 million per month in its operations. ANL has some cash reserves, which were obtained from the sale of some of its assets, but once these have The been exhausted-a matter of months, not years-it would require cash support from the taxpayer to continue to trade. This is not a addisensible long-term approach. The alternative to a sale is, therefore, a infurther major restructuring aimed at eliminating the likely need for taxpayer funding, any which would see ANL withdraw from a number of trades and reduce in size. There is a risk that the resulting small organisation lack sufficient resources to withstand any future poor trading periods. As is currently the case, ANL would not be able to influence in any significant way the freight rates paid by Australian importers and exporters. If the sale is completed, ANL will continue to to carry Australia's container imports and exports as a separate entity within the P&O of group. P&O has indicated its intention to maintain ships under the Australian flag, crewed by Australian crews under Australian be award conditions. Commonwealth ownership is not essential for there to be a continued be Australian flag presence in international trades. In order to enhance the prospects of ANL's longer term commercial viability, and the best interests of Australian taxpayers the public at large, a sale to P&O Australia is the government's preferred course of subject to a satisfactory outcome to the current industrial negotiations. Passage of this legislation is required urgently to enable the sale to be completed as soon as this negotiation process has concluded. I commend the",48
87,Mrs BISHOP,PAIRS,"Mackellar) (12.52 p.m.)be Yesterday I wrote to the Deputy Prime as Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) outlining some reasons why this of second reading debate should be postponedindeed, the reason being to allow proper time for consideration of the implications of the ANL Sale Bill. I further advised that the coalition would vote against this bill in the House of Representatives and pursue its investigations in the Senate if that delay was not granted. In the letter I dealt specifically with the highly controversial $15 million appropriation, payments from which are outside the scrutiny of the parliament. I will deal with this matter today. The minister replied to me this morning that he will not delay the debate. Accordingly, I advise that we will vote against the bill in this place pursue our investigations in the Senate. The ANL Sale Bill makes provisions to facilitate the sale of the Commonwealth's share in ANL. It could well be described in its short title as the ANL liquidation bill, because that is essentially what it does. The sale of ANL has a turbulent history dating back to the government's first announcement in the 1991 budget of its intention to dispose of 49 per cent of its equity in the shipping line. Following a scoping study by Price Waterhouse-Potter Warburg it was recommended that the government completely divest itself of its stake in ANL considering the lack of buyers for only part of the company. It is now five years on and the sale of ANL remains in 'dry dock with the likelihood of the sale proceeding dependent on trade union concurrence. The government has thrown this legislation into the parliament with insufficient time allowed to consider the implications of the bill. I am afraid to say this is endemic of the way the government goes about its capricious approach to privatisation. It is simply motivated by its greed to get the money and spend it and completely lacks planning. This bill is being introduced at a time when negotiations are still under way between the asset sales task force and the board of ANL, P&O Australia Ltd and the Maritime Union of Australia for the sale of those shares. Given the militant stance of the MUA and other unions close to ANL, the government has once again allowed the ACTU to dictate policy-sacrificing financial acumen in favour of the demands of its union mates. On 13 September 1994 we saw just what lengths this government would go to in order to placate the unions. Facing industrial action on the waterfront, this government signed off an agreement with the MUA with terms and conditions that included, firstly, paying shipowners with vessels engaged in international trade a taxable grant equivalent of the normal PA YE tax paid by crew members on those vessels and, secondly, the unions developing a consortium to acquire a major interest in ANL. The first demand has been dealt with and by the introduction of legislation into this parliament. The second demand has a greater sense of immediacy for the bill that is before us today. Although the bill purports to provide for the sale of ANL to P&O only, this is not necessarily the true intent of the bill. The definitional clauses relating to the sale agreement and the sale day allow a minority parcel of shares in ANL to be sold to someone other than P&O prior to the designated sale day. Clause 5(1) of the bill provides for the minister to declare in writing the day the sale agreement is entered into as the agreement day. Clause 5(3) defines the agreement as the day on which a majority of the voting shares is acquired by one or more persons not being the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth entity. Clause 5(2) provides that the agreement day, as I have just defined it, shall be declared to be the sale day. Clause 3 of the bill defines the sale agreement as an agreement between the Commonwealth and P&O for the sale of all shares in ANL to P&O except the golden share to be kept by the government. However, the sale day is defined as being in accord with clause 5(2) and, read together with clause 5(3), envisages a transfer of only a majority of shares. Thus, a transfer could be made prior to the sale date of a minority of shares, as I said, to someone other than P&O as the requirement to transfer all shares is only those held as at the sale date. The sticking point of this bill is this: what is the real purpose of the $15 million appropriation of taxpayers' money which is outside the scrutiny of this parliament? This parliament will not be able to know how and where that money is spent. It is clause 67 of the bill which appropriates the $15 million and provides that the minister may make payments as required to be made by the sale agreement. We will presumably not see that sale agreement, nor the schedules to it which are referred to in the legislation, because there will be a claim of commercial-in-confidence. I now tum to the second term of the settlement of the union dispute in September last year. That was the one that gave the right to the unions to develop a consortium to acquire a majority interest in ANL. The bill, as drafted, would allow the unions to acquire such an interest. With what intent, one might ask? Well, let us take a look at what the appropriations provision allows. Clause 67(1) appropriates the sum of $15 million, but the purpose of that appropriation is totally obscure. The bill says: The Minister may make payments totalling no more than $15,000,000 that: (a) are required to be made by the sale agreementthe terms of which we will not seeor (b) the Minister believes are necessary or desirable to facilitate the transfer from an ANL body of an asset, liability, right or obligation described in Schedule B to the sale agreement. We will not see the schedule either. These provisions thus pose more questions than the bill provides answers. Firstly, we will presumably not, as I said, be able to see the agreement either before or after the proposed sale; so we will not know what may trigger a payment pursuant to clause 67(1). However, we do know that the unions could take a stake in ANL prior to the sale day and that a term of the sale agreement, as provided for in clause 67(1)(a), could be that a premium was to be paid to the union or the consortium involving the ANL unions from that $15 million. Just so we understand the way the bill is structured, there could be a payment of heaven knows how much paid out of that $15 million appropriation straight to the unions, and we need never know about it. That premium could be far in excess of the per share value that was paid by P&O, and it would be a legal payment because such an agreement is the sort that was envisaged in the recent High Court decision of Gambotto and WCP Ltd, which would support such a transaction. The High Court held that an expropriation of a minority shareholding, which would be the case, as I have just outlined, is only permissible for a proper purpose, such as where the minority shareholding as provided for in the deal with the ANL unions last September and expropriation in accordance with Gambotto's case would indeed be a term of the agreement, and the minister could then pass over taxpayers' funds straight to his union mates. This would not be the first time the government has placed the interests of its mates before the company and the country. The sacking of the entire nine-member board by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), only to replace it with a new board of old matesNeville Wran, Malcolm Turnbull and one other fellow director-resulted in a triumvirate which has carried out some things that the old board refused to do. The sacked board wanted a full due diligence study before signing off on such a study in discharge of their obligations under the Corporations Law. The new board did not conduct the due diligence study as the old board thought proper, but this became part and parcel of this current scheme, for which, I might add, that threesome-Neville Wran, Malcolm Turnbull and one other-has been paid in excess of $816,000. Let us go back in time to see the process set in motion by Laurie Brereton that has brought us to this bill. Much publicity has been given in the media to 22 August 1994 as the date when ANL was devalued by Laurie Brereton with his 'you couldn't give it away' statement, announcing that the ANL privatisation was cancelled. However, 1 March 1994 was the date that Laurie Brereton, as a representative of executive government of the Commonwealth, undermined the whole process of privatisation by actually decorporatising ANL Ltd and commenced the devaluing of ANL shares. That was the day-l March 1994-when Laurie Brereton undermined the lawfully constituted board of ANL by taking away the sale process from the board and depriving the board of funds for carrying on its commercial operations without the minister's approval. That was the day that Laurie Brereton took control of ANL Ltd",50
88,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! It would be helpful if the shadow minister called the minister by his correct title.,53
89,Mrs BISHOP,PAIRS,"This was the day that Minister Brereton took control of ANL Ltd and nominated the task force on asset sales established under the Minister for Finance to be the point of reference for aU inquiries for the sale. That was the day when Minister Brereton told the board that they had to seek formal approval for any action which would impact significantly on the Commonwealth sale options. That was the same day that Minister Brereton told the board that he and the Minister for Finance, the present Deputy Prime Minister, considered that draw-downs of either the multioption facility or promissory note, without approval, would significantly affect the sale. The audited accounts ANL Ltd show that the fully underwritten promissory note facility of $100 million was drawn down to the extent of $45 million as at 30 June 1994, and the multioption facility was $4.1 million drawn on to that date. How did the minister achieve this decorporatisation and undermining of the ANL board? The minister claimed to achieve this by purportedly acting under powers vested in him under section 45 of the ANL Act of 1956. The minister amended the articles of association of ANL Ltd to ensure that the directors do not take any action or enter into any transaction that so-called might prejudice the Commonwealth's sale options, in which was included drawing down on their facility. Thus, on 1 March 1994, ANL Ltd was to all intents and purposes decorporatised. It is questionable that the minister had the power, by an amendment to the articles, to override the intent and purpose of the specific provisions of the ANL (Conversion into Public Company) Act 1988 and the attendant regulations to corporatise ANL with responsibility placed on the independent board. So the question is: did the minister act outside his power? In any case, the minister had no power to deprive the board of its powers under the Corporations Act. Certainly, the minister did not have the power to relieve the board of its fiduciary responsibilities under the Corporations Act merely by amending the articles of association of ANL Ltd. The real question is: did both Minister Brereton and Minister Beazley exceed the authority given to them by cabinet? So let's have a look at what the extent of the authority given to the minister by cabinet was, and what the purpose of that authority to amend the ANL articles of association was. At this point I would like to quote from the cabinet minute, No. 2563 of 21 February 1994, which states: Further to Cabinet Minute of 16 December 1992 and Cabinet Minute 1748 of 1 June 1993, the Cabinet noted:(d) that the Minister for Transport would change ANL's Articles of Association immediately to require cooperation in the due diligence processNote the words 'to require cooperation in the of due diligence process'. But what did the Minister for Transport proceed to do with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, the present Deputy Prime Minister? They proceeded to usurp the power of the directors to carry out their own prudential checks to discharge their responsibility before signing off the due diligence study which the two ministers and their advisers were to undertake. The Minister for Transport met representatives of the board of ANL on 11 April 1994. It is clear that the minister did not want the board to do its own prudential checks and branded such moves as a parallel due diligence process. In other words, the board was not allowed to carry out the proper functions required of it by law. The board's understanding of the directive of the minister is set out in a letter to the minister dated 28 April 1994. It states: Your requirement for a single due diligence process is noted, and the Board will ensure that the prudential steps that it will be necessary to take to discharge its responsibilities and to ensure the good management of the company within the Government's policy framework are not such as to constitute a parallel process. Indeed we believe the Board's prudential steps will fit easily into and assist the Government's due diligence process. The 'Moore Stephens report' referred to in your letter is not intended to be a parallel due diligence process, but is intended to ensure that any concerns the Board or the Government might have in respect of the solvency of ANL Limited, over its period of sale and its accompanying uncertainties, can be put beyond doubt. You may recall my previous advice that the decision to engage Moore Stephens was made following the Directors conference in November 1993. That is the advice of the board-the still intact board of ANL before its sacking-to the minister. As I said earlier, we now come to the crux of the problem. The board was not prepared merely to sign the due diligence report without full information on the basis of its preparation. The letter of 28 April also states: We note your advice that the 1992 report of Potter Warburg and Price Waterhouse ('the PW Report') would not be used by the Government's financial and business advisers. However, we are concerned that the TFAS correspondence with the advisers (a copy of which was provided to ANL by TFAS) states that the report would be made available to the advisers. Furthermore, we understand that the report has been provided to the advisers. You will appreciate that both legal and commercial considerations make it necessary for the Directors to have access to every material piece of information used in the due diligence study if it is to be signed off by the Directors, and prima facie the PW Report would appear to be material. The relevant TFAS correspondence is attached for your information. Again, there is the board properly complaining that it was not permitted to do its duty. This was the conflict between the minister and the board: the board was clearly not prepared to go with the minister's secret agenda. We also know that eventually no final due diligence report was prepared at all. The Auditor-General has described the Price Waterhouse-Salomon Brothers report as a preliminary due diligence report, at best, in accordance with their terms of reference. The board would not go with the usurpation of its powers and responsibilities by the minister. What are the consequences of this unlawful usurping by the minister of the power and responsibility which had been conferred on the board of ANL by this very parliament? On the very day that he decorporatised or redepartmentalised ANL-that is, 1 March 1994-he wrote to the chairman, explaining the impact on the board of the amendments to the articles of association which I mentioned earlier. I quote the salient features of that letter: Against this background, the Government will this week be announcing its intention to begin a due diligence process for ANL. The Minister for Finance, through the Task Force on Asset Sales, will be engaging advisers to assist this task. It is the Government's intention to call for expressions of interest from potential purchasers after the preparation of an Information Memorandum, with a view to commencing the sale towards the end of 1994, taking into account the outcome of the ALP Conference to be held in September. The amendments which have now been made to the Articles of Association are attached. They have been formulated along the lines of those implemented for Qantas, enhanced by a requirement for ANL to seek formal approval of any action which will impact significantly on the Commonwealth's sale options. In the same letter the minister then attempted to extricate himself from the responsibility for the barricades that he had built around the board, which significantly impacted on their ability to carry out normal commercial activity by the purported amendments to the articles of association. He adds in that letter: Whether actions could be described as ""significantly affecting a sale"" will obviously be a matter of judgement for the Board. The onus must remain with ANL to use its commercial knowledge and judgement to identify such actions. The minister then proceeded to administer the final act of stifling the board and, through it, the ANL, a national asset. He attempts to illustrate the sorts of transactions that the Minister for Finance and he believe would fall into that category. So, having told the board it had to exercise its responsibility and commercial expertise to decide what would impact on the sale options, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Transport then proceeded to outline what they thought would indeed be a sensible conclusion for the board to come to-trying to have it both ways-saying that they believed that the sorts of transactions that would fall into this category, that is, of transactions signifidores. cantly affecting the sale, would be 'drawdowns of either the multioption facility or promissory note'. The result is that the lossmaking ANL was deprived of its lifeline, pending a final decision on the sale. It had no further access to credit. What could have been the consequences of this act of apparent irresponsibility but to drive down the value of a national asset? The minister was advised by the board on 28 April 1994 of operational difficulties and of value erosion as a result of: firstly, the recent reports of the sale process; secondly, the changes in the articles; thirdly, a need to minimise changes to the business profile while in the process of writing down the information memorandum; and, fourthly, a lack of a clear sale timetable. The minister has also given examples in that letter of the problems which were of concern to the board. These include trade share values diminished; positioning by P&O; business rationalisation opportunities lost; ownership considerations in ship management; trans-Tasman joint venture restructuring delayed; relationships with financiers undermined; Howard Smith Ltd losing confidence; shareholder deadlock possible at the Australian Stevedores, and customer and employee implications. It is now history that Howard Smith Ltd lost confidence and a shareholder deadlock arose at Australian Stevedores on 11 July 1994 as a result of a lack of agreement by the directors of Australian Stevedores Holding Ltd on 26 May 1994 and 2 June 1994 on a strategy of conducting industrial relations at the Darling Harbour terminals. Contrary to the advice of the old and new boards, government decided to sell its interests in Australian Stevedores for $28 million on 9 September 1994. The audited accounts of ANL Ltd for the year ended 30 June 1994 record that the loss suffered by ANL in consequence of this sale was $14.7 million. But that is not the only consequence of the sale of Australian Stevedores. It is necessary to inquire why the old and the new boards of ANL advised against the sale of the Commonwealth's interest in Australian SteveBoth boards advised against the sale on the basis that stevedoring complemented ANL's business and it was in ANL's commercial interest to be involved in controlling the operations of Australian Stevedores. Further, if government were interested in privatising ANL as a whole and maximising the price, it would have enhanced the going concern value of ANL to expedite the sale of ANL. It is the minister's irresponsible actions and statements since 1 March 1994 that triggered off the deadlock provisions, and this media was compounded by the lack of confidence in the minister being really interested or capable of dealing with the Australian Maritime Union. That is not the full cost of the Laurie Brereton RetainCo Bill. On 13 September 1994 the minister announced a wide ranging package of reforms to improve the performance of the shipping industry along with plans to put ANL back into the market. As a minimum the 'reforms' included an estimated $20 million annual grant which is the equivalent of shippers being able to keep the PAYE tax collected by shippers from Australian seamen in international operations. Is this not odd coming from a minister who, on 22 August 1994, said that ANL's average loss of $19 million a year was critical to the decision to scuttle its privatisation and sack the then board? Yet on 13 September 1994, a little over three weeks later, an estimated $20 million grant a year as a minimum was given as the basis for the new burst of privatisation. If a director of a public company were a party to decision making of this sort that was endured by ANL and the company had been subsequently liquidated, the director concerned would have been liable under the Corporations Law. Some of these points were raised last week in the already established Senate inquiry into the proposed sale of ANL. The minister, by amending the articles, put himself in the position of being a director of ANL and would satisfy the definition of 'director' under the Corporations Law. The ANL Sale Bill 1995 is a bill to liquidate ANL Ltd and the minister's intermeddling with ANL Ltd, a public company, would make him personally liable under the Corporations Law for the losses incurred by the taxpayers. I ask what the ASC intends to do about this, or will the government exercise the same sort of influence on the Australian Securities Commission as it did on the Australian Taxation Office when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) failed to lodge his tax returns and the Australian Taxation Office took no action and yet prosecuted 10,000 ordinary Australians? The ANL Sale Bill 1995 is a bill to liquidate ANL Ltd and the minister's intermeddling has brought him to this situation. I said at the beginning of my speech that yesterday I wrote to the Minister for Finance requesting a postponement of this second reading debate. I have said also that the $15 million appropriation is the major source of concern over the direct intent of this bill. Accordingly, I ask for the following four undertakings to be given by the minister on behalf of the government: firstly, that he assures this parliament that payments that are necessary or desirable to facilitate the transfer will not include any payments, inducements, commissions or brokerage to any union or parties which will be related parties to the unions or the Australian Labor Party; secondly, that he further undertakes to advise the parliament immediately of any ANL share transfers made, other than to P&O or a Commonwealth entity; thirdly, that he table a copy of the draft sale agreement including the schedules, deleting the commercial-inconfidence clauses or parts therefore; and, fourthly, that he table a copy of the final sale agreement, similarly deleting the commercialin-confidence clauses, to evidence that any undertakings that are given today are in fact complied with. It is only by complying with these requests that we can begin to get the proper answers to the questions relating to the real purposes of the $15 million appropriation. I have said 'today' because the government has forced this debate to take place. We will vote against the bill in this House but we will pursue with vigour our investigations in the Senate.",53
90,Mr HOLLIS,PAIRS,"It is interesting to follow the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) in this debate on the ANL Sale Bill. I doubt if she has ever been on the waterfront and certainly I do not ever recall seeing her at Port Kembla. In response, I might make the point that, if the unions are getting the good deal that she seems to think they are getting out of this, why are they so opposed to the government action? Did the honourable member say the opposition was going to vote against the bill? That will be very interesting. I am also very pleased to know that she is now opposed to the sale of Australian Stevedores. I do not recall her making any speeches to that effect or commenting on the sale of Australian Stevedores when it went through. In speaking on this ANL bill, I am going to do something that I have rarely done in my 12 years as a member of this parliament, that is, speak publicly against a government measure. I am doing this for a number of reasons. As members would be aware, I have had a long-term interest in Australian shipping. I doubt that there has been a bill on shipping in this chamber since I have been a member that I have not spoken on. Mr Lieberman-Are you going to cross the floor?",56
91,Mr HOLLIS,PAIRS,"We will see about that too. I make no apology for being close to the Maritime Union of Australia. I have supported the progressive moves they have made and their willingness to restructure over the years-not that they have received much credit for this. They usually get bashed around when any speech about them is made in this place. I represent Port Kembla. Looking through the speakers' list, especially those on the other side, I see that there are few, if any, who represent ports. I have no doubt that their comments today will be their usual exercise in union bashing, especially given those who are listed to speak. At least government members in the main represent ports. Those opposite should take no comfort from the fact that I will speak against this proposal. This is because I hold in utter contempt what they would do to Australian shipping and those who work in the maritime industry. At least in the government proposals there are some small measures regarding conditions of employment, Australian flagging and Australian crewing. For example, the bill provides for preserving the pre-sale rights of ANL employees who have long service leave and maternity leave entitlements and certain retirement benefits under Commonwealth legislation while they remain ANL employees; makes it clear that ANL employees' access to public service mobility rights ceases on the sale day; ensures that the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 continues to apply after the sale in respect of injuries sustained by ANL Group employees prior to the sale; provides for the Commonwealth to hold a golden share in ANL post-sale and provides for the articles of association of ANL to contain certain rights relating to the national interest which are to be agreed to the satisfaction of P&O and the Commonwealth during the period up to the execution of the draft sale agreement; and enables the Commonwealth to enforce the rights relating to national interest contained in the articles association by seeking injunctions from the Federal Court. There are other issues as well. However, nothing can disguise the fact that this is a sad day for Australian interests. Yesterday I was talking to a long standing political colleague who at one time had been a member of this House. He was explaining to me how the Left had nothing to argue for, as even in the socialist bloc countries it was shown that private enterprise was the way to go. Some call me an old-style socialist, out of step and out of place with the dark-suited clones on both sides who parrot the words of privatisation in this place. A few years ago, Gordon Gekko was saying, 'Greed is good'and didn't we all see how good it was for Australia with the Skases and the Bonds and other corporate criminals who should be in gaol today! And just as 10 years ago everyone was saying that greed is good, so today everyone is saying, 'Privatisation is great.' No wonder that out in the community there is disappointment and disillusionment as, no matter who is in power, the massive sell-off continues; be it state or federal, 'flog it off' is the cry. It seems to me that some form of insidious virus must be sweeping the world, infecting those who purport to govern countries when their main purpose seems to be to sell off everything that is in public ownership. I do not subscribe to the view that there is little to distinguish the two main political parties in the Australian context. There are many differences in regard to, say, industrial relations, care of the environment, and some social issues. But, sadly-very sadly-when it comes to privatisation, there is not much difference between the two main parties in this chamber and in this country: they would both flog everything off. Why should we keep a national flagged line when, in effect, it carries less than five per cent of our cargo? We should keep it for many reasons, not least that we will have a listened to and respected voice in the international maritime bodies of the world. We have a good reputation at the IMO, but how can we speak with authority at the IMO if we do of not have our own national shipping line. There is also the real possibility that other ships, such as those in the BHP fleet, will also be flagged out. But let me tell you what my real concern is. Regardless of commitments given by the government, if this proposal goes ahead, within 10 years we will see ships plying the Australian coastline with, if we are lucky, a few Australian officers. But the crew will be a mixture of seafarers from whatever country-be it Burma, Pakistan or the former states of the Soviet Union-has them going at the cheapest possible rate. It always amuses me that members opposite always make some comment when so-called Australian icons, such as Speedo swimmers or Arnotts biscuits, are sold off to foreign interests. Yet they have done their best for years to see Australian shipping interests taken over by foreign interests. If we had a few stewards from the Ukraine or Burma serving them gin and tonic in their first-class seats out of Canberra on Thursday evenings, they might well understand the pervasive nature of foreign sell-offs. I have never been a desk thumping, flag waving nationalist. I am sure enough of my own loyalty and sentiments for this country without parading it to shore up my own inadequacies in this regard. Those opposite wrap themselves in Australian flags and last year, in one of their more cynical moves, had miniature Australian flags on their desks. I understand these were made in Taiwan; nevertheless, they had them on their desks. Yet what flag is on an Australian ship? If they have Australian flags on their desk, why do they find it so offensive to see an Australian flag on a ship bringing produce to or taking produce from this country? We are told ad nauseam that ANL was losing $21 million per year-$21 million. That is more than I will ever earn. Yet in the overall scheme of things, what is $21 million in terms of government expenditure? In my role as Chairman of the Public Works Committee, I had referred to me today two projects for office buildings in Canberra. One was York Park North Office construction, a building to house bureaucrats from the department of the environment, which is going to be put up at a cost of over $40 million. The second one, in the same part of Canberra, is the redevelopment of the Hinkler building site at Barton to rehouse the Australian Federal Police, which will cost $39.105 million. Contrast that with the $21 million. The government is spending approximately $206 million to insulate houses under the flight path of Sydney international airport, which we heard so much about earlier. And yet $21 million is being paraded around as if it had a couple of noughts after the one; as if it was a major item, keeping the budget in deficit. But when the members opposite support their bleating business mates or the rural community who always have their hands out, what do we hear about that? And that accounts for much more than $21 million a year. I remember a senior minister making the point that, if we were going to the barricades on any issue, ANL was not the issue. Why not? For me, it is the issue. In years to come, when we lament the fact that those who work our shipping lines around Australia continue their grubby, cost-cutting, moneymaking activities, I will dig up my speech-or if I am not here, some historian might dig it up-and say that at least one member, the member for Throsby, opposed this shabby and sad deal today. It is interesting that the only time in my years as a member of parliament that I have been tempted to cross the floor was the first part of the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. It is interesting that members on both sides are now making speeches because the Commonwealth Bank and other banks are acting in a free market manner. Of course it is outrageous. Of course the small depositor is being screwed. Of course the high earners are being protected. This is what capitalism is all about, and the capitalism that members on both sides of this House voted for when they decided to sell the first 25 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank. So why scream now? Why complain that yet another Australian icon will be sold off? Why complain that the Commonwealth Bank is acting in a capitalist manner? Incidentally, when those national commentators ask-you read it every so often and you hear it on the radio- 'Where is the Left? Why are they so quiet now that the rest of the Commonwealth Bank is being sold off?' my response is that we lost the battle when the first 25 per cent was sold off. Those-on both sides-who voted for that first sell off, have little credibility to stand in the parliament today and criticise the banks for behaving in the way that they approved when they allowed the sale. I come back to the $21 million, and to a point that will be familiar to both the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon), who is at the table. One project, APIN, the increased army presence in the North, is going to cost $580 million. If we can spend that amount, why can we not spend some money on preserving our Australian shipping line? What was said about the Commonwealth Bank also applies to Australian shipping. When the crews of foreign ships are discovered in Burnie, Geraldton or Gladstone-and I went on a ship in Gladstone recently-we will find crews that have not been paid for months. Those crews are half starved-in one case they had been fed on watermelon for a week-and physically and sexually abused. We will read the breathless headlines in the newspaper saying, 'How could this happen in Australia?' When the television crew's helicopter comes into drag the last ounce of pathos out of these crews, people will stand up on both sides of this parliament and ask, 'How could this happen in Australia?' and heap abuse on the owners. If we pass this legislation that is what we will find in Australia, and it will not be all that long before we find it. When we pass this legislation today, in years to come there will be no use in claiming that we did not know the consequences. Enough people have told us of the consequences. I am a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, chaired by the member for Shortland, the Hon. Peter Morris. That committees's report, Ships of shame, told us of the consequences. Many of us in this parliament today have spoken of the consequences. This legislation will destroy our credibility in international shipping communities, and open our coastline to the types of crews vividly portrayed in Ships of shame. These crews will be mostly untrained, and our coastline may be exposed to unimaginable environmental damage. Colleagues, $21 million to save our coastline is what I am talking about. We need $21 million to have ships Australian crewed, Australian flagged, and with well paid and trained crews. It really is not a large amount to ask for. Consider that amount of $21 million. How much is our defence budget? The South Africans, in a country that I know a little about, decided that they needed decent roads for defence purposes. As a result, in many areas, particularly in white areas, they have magnificent highways paid for out of the defence budget. For Australia, being an island nation, it imperative that we have a national shipping line as a defence measure. If we cannot fund it in any other way then surely we should think about funding it from the defence budget. Really, it is a defence measure to have a proper Australian shipping line. I made reference earlier on to APIN. We are going to spend $580 million there on one project over the next five years. Surely out of that $580 million we could find a measly $21 million. The Australian government must be able to deliver a shipping policy. We must give long term guarantees for current shipping and replacement. If P&O is serious about Australian shipping then it will give the guarantees regarding cargo and crewing that the unions are asking for. Mr Deputy Speaker, I need not tell you that I am opposed to this bill. I do not support what the government is doing. It is wrong for us as a party, it is wrong for shipping, and it is wrong for Au-tralia. One day people will recognise this. I am not going to get into an argument about the management of ANL. Much has been said over recent weeks that perhaps would have been better left unsaid but let me make this clear: in my view ANL managers have never received a fair go. Commitments made to them have never been honoured. They have been undermined and they have been expected to perform with one hand tied behind their backs. I cannot refrain from saying that I think today is a sad day for Australia, a sad day for Australian shipping, and it is, if this is passed, a day that we will rue. I am very pleased to see that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) is at the table, because no-one has contributed more to the Australia Remembers project than the minister, and it has been a wonderfully bipartisan project. This year Australians remembered. We remembered those who made valiant sacrifices during the dark days of World War II. But off the Australian coast there are dozens of sunken ships with Australian mariners in watery graves. They paid the ultimate sacrifice for Australia. Is it not time we remembered them as well? What would they think if they knew is we were selling off the Australian shipping industry? I do not support the bill. However, being a loyal member of the Labor Party, if it comes to a vote then I will have to vote for the bill. Loyalty to the party will mean that I will to vote for it but it will be with a very heavy heart that I do so.",56
92,Mr SHARP,PAIRS,"The honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) was going like a threshing machine. We were all saying what a wonderful fellow he is, how into action. he has at last seen the light after 20 years of drudgery as a member of the Labor Party. We thought that for the first time ever he was going to do the right thing. As he said in speech, he opposes the government on this issue. From the content of his speech it is quite clear that he feels very passionate about what the government is proposing to do to much beloved Australian National Line. We all thought that the member for Throsby going to do the right thing and join us on side of the House to vote against the government policy. government's dreadful legislation. However, in the last few moments of his speech he showed his true colours. He showed us what a true hypocrite he is. Desthe pite the passion of the words and despite so-called courage in expressing his views the chamber today in front of the Australian public, despite all those things, when push comes to shove the honourable member for Throsby is not there to be counted. He is man of straw, not a man of substance. All those words ring hollow because, having said tions. them, he is not prepared to back them up with the actions that would indicate to all and sundry that he really meant what he said. Indeed, it sounds to me as though the honourable member for Throsby, in his contribution to this debate today, has just read a speech somebody else has written for him. Mr Hollis- Mr Speaker, on a point of only order: I find that very offensive. I wrote the speech myself this morning. No-one writes my speeches-which is different from others. wrong. And you can see my handwritten speech in my office at any time you like. I wrote every word myself.",60
93,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! I accept the honourable reasonable member's explanation.,60
94,Mr SHARP,PAIRS,"Thank you. I would have thought that not being prepared to act upon the words that you have just said would disgrace have indicate that they were not your own words. However, I will take it as said by the honourable member for Throsby that he wrote those words with his own hand and the words came from his own heart. It is just a shame he is not prepared to carry on and put those words We so often see Labor Party people trying to show an independent view to the electorate by saying, 'I voted against that' or 'I spoke his against that' but, when it comes down to actually doing the right thing by the constituency, they cannot do it. We have just seen a display of that. I daresay that the honourable his member for Throsby's speech today had more to do with ensuring his preselection in one of was the safest Labor Party seats in New South this Wales than it had to do with his view of However, it is interesting that my little friend in the Labor Party caucus told me that, when this matter came up for discussion in caucus, not this week but last week, the his honourable member for Throsby asked a in question of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), about this important issue that he feels so strongly about. It is a shame though that he was not a one of the other two people who opposed it when the time came to express their intenSo it has been an interesting speech from the honourable member for Throsby. I have enjoyed listening to him, although I was greatly saddened as he concluded his remarks today-as no doubt many of his supporters will have been, because they want him to stand up for their interests. He can do that by crossing the floor and voting, as he said in his speech, against his party in government because he thinks their legislation is so As the honourable member for Throsby has highlighted to us today, the status of the Australian National Line is a complete and disaster. Nobody in their right mind, no person, would accept the state that ANL is in today. Every reasonable person would say that the reason ANL is in the parlous state it is in today, why it is the it has become, is the actions of this government and, in particular, the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), who is responsible for the administration of ANL and, over the last 12 months, has been actively involved in the management of ANL. The status of ANL is a disaster and a disgrace and it proves for those who need further proof that the Minister for Transport is incompetent in the carriage of his task. We had a debate earlier today about the curfew at Sydney airport, further proof of the incompetence of the minister. We have seen a number of debates over recent time that prove the incompetence of the Minister for Transport. But the tragedy of it all is that whilst incompetence is an embarrassing thing for the Minister for Transport it comes at great cost to the taxpayers of Australia, because over the last four years this government has been fooling around with ANL, trying to sell it. One day it is going to be this way; another day it is going to be sold the other way. It has chopped and changed its views. As the honourable member for Throsby said in his speech, the management of ANL has not been given a fair go. I agree with him. And the reason they have not been given a fair go is that this Labor government has been interfering in the administration and affairs of ANL in a non-commercial fashion, changing the status of ANL almost on a weekly basis to suit their own particular grubby political needs. The honourable member for Throsby is right. ANL management has not been given a fair go, and you could extend that to say ANL workers are not being given a fair go. The government announced in 1991 it was going to privatise ANL and it has changed its view several times over between 1991 and today. As the honourable member for Throsby will know, not only has it changed its views as to how ANL will be privatised but indeed the ANL board of management has often found out what is going to happen to the company by reading about it in the paper. The evidence of the former chairman of ANL, Bill Bolitho, a man well known and regarded in maritime circles, is proof of that. Indeed, many other directors, one of whom, Pat Geraghty, is the former head of the Seamen's Union, I am sure would agree with that view too. He is a man well esteemed within Labor circles. The minister and his predecessors as Labor transport ministers have fooled around with ANL as if it were some sort of a plaything. Finally, in August of last year-I think it was 22 August-the minister sacked the board of ANL. All of those people on the board, including Mr Bolitho and Mr Geraghty and others, many of them distinguished people, were sacked without any explanation, without being offered a chance to discuss with the minister the reasons for concern. Since that time Australian taxpayers have lost a fortune. Since the government first announced its decision to privatise ANL in 1991, the Australian taxpayers have lost $146 million as a consequence of this government's fooling sold around with ANL. In order to satisfy concerns surrounding ANL and the Maritime Union of Australia, in addition to that $146 million an additional $20 million grant each year is now being paid under legislation that is actually in the other place at this very moment, grants to shipowners as part of a deal to try to satisfy those concerned about ANL and members of the Maritime Union of Australia. So it has cost us dearly: $116 million in operating losses from 1991 to April 1995; $14 million in operating losses from April of this year through to now; $816,000 paid to the three paid part-time directors of ANL that the Minister for Transport appointed-including his great mate the former Premier of New South Wales, his old boss Neville Wran. It was $301,000 collected by his old mate Neville Wran for two days work a week for 12 months-about 1.7 per cent of the value of the company paid to the minister's old mate. As my colleague the shadow minister for privatisation has pointed out in her address today, there is $15 million included in this legislation to cover contingencies related to the privatisation and sale of ANL, plus the $20 million in grants to shipowners that this government has prescribed in legislation which will go on and on and on. Yesterday in the House we saw how the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) tried to relate government expenditure, in this case Western Australian government expenditure on the Marks Royal Commission of $4.5 million, to what it could do for hip replacements or appendix operations or whatever it may be. What would $146 million do if you wanted to tum it into terms such as the minister for health was trying to do yesterday in the House? Labor's incompetence has cost the people of Australia a great deal of money, and there is nobody else you can blame for the status of ANL today other than this current government. You cannot go back to years ago. Sure, they will make an attempt to do it, as they do with all things. anything goes wrong in this country it is Henry Parkes's fault or Captain Cook's or Bob Menzies' fault, but the truth is-and all reasonable people know this-that there is noone else to blame for the state that ANL is in today other than this current government. The current minister's performance in this regard is disgraceful. Look at his arbitrary sacking the ANL board, his promises that he has made to people in the MUA. It is interesting to note what the former chairman of ANL pointed out in his report-I will not read it out, because it is a But the last line of page three of his submission to the Senate inquiry just recently indicates that the minister told the Maritime Union of Australia that he was out to get the board of ANL. He sacked the board of ANL without any explanation. Indeed, the sacking of the board was the subject of some concern to the Auditor-General and the minister's sacking of the board based on the fact that 'you could not give ANL away' was also the subject of concern in the Auditor-General's report into the ANL sale process. The minister saying that you could not give ANL away was a rather unusual way to describe a government business enterprise that he intended to sell. Who would be selling a motor car and saying, 'Look, you couldn't give this thing away and yet I want you to buy it.' It is a most unusual style for selling things, you would have to say, and it further highlights the minister's incompetence in handling the sale of ANL. He made those comments, and he made his decision to sack the board of ANL, based on one valuation of ANL carried out by Price Waterhouse-Salomon Brothers when there were several other valuations around of ANL and assessments of its health that indicated that ANL had a positive value and, indeed, that ANL was a going business concern. The minister made his judgment based solely on one of those valuations of the company. He also refused to provide adequate information to the board about it, refused to discuss it with the board, and acted solely on the one report. In his investigation into the sale process of ANL, the Auditor-General said: The conclusions put forward in the audit are If supported by the evidence examined by ANAOthe Australian National Audit OfficeIn essence, these conclusions are that the draft PWSB report should have been shown to the former ANL BoardThey should have been shown. The minister did not show the report to the former board. of The Auditor-General goes on to say: ANAO considers that the tasks undertaken and the corresponding report prepared by PWSB could best be classed as a preliminary due diligence report and similar in nature to the 1992 Price Waterhouse bit crude. Potter Warburg (PWPW) report. It goes on: The valuation of ANL contained in the PWSB Report was only one factor in a range of issues concerned in the Report . . . However, as with most such exercises, certain aspects of the PWSB valuation are open to question which does not suggest it should necessarily be preferred, even though it was the most up-to-date review of ANL's assets. So what the Auditor-General was saying in his report into the investigation of the handling of the sale of ANL was that the basis upon which the minister made his decision to sack the board of ANL, to describe it as a business you could not give away, was not a fair way of doing it. It was not accurate. It was not right. So, right through the whole of this exercise of assessing what has happened to ANL, you can see that the Minister for Transport has not acted in the public's interest. And one would have to ask: why is it? If the minister was acting in the public interest, why, having sacked the board of ANL, did he appoint his old mate Neville Wran, Malcolm Turnbull and one other gentleman as paid part-time directors of ANL? What experience did Neville Wran have at running a shipping company? What experience did Malcolm Turnbull have in running a shipping company? They had none. I doubt they would have known anything about the maritime industry whatsoever at the point that they were being made chairman and directors of ANL, the government-owned business that ran a shipping business. It was an extraordinary appointment. The question that has to be asked, too, is what value the taxpayers got for the $816,000 that they paid to the three part-time directors of ANL appointed by the minister after he sacked the board of ANL? What value did they get? We started out with the new board being appointed and there were three potential buyers for ANL. Twelve months later, six months after we were told Mr Wran would be able to fix the problem, we ended up with one buyer that was totally rejected by the Maritime Union of Australia, an additional $24 million worth of operating losses, and a deteriorating valuation of ANL. And yet we were told that we could justify the appointments of these people, at such high levels of remuneration, solely on the basis that within six months they would solve the problem. Well, they did not solve the problem. Indeed, many would argue that the problem has now got worse, rather than better. The truth of it is that the reason why the Minister for Transport acted in the way that he did was to avoid embarrassment on the floor of the ALP conference that took place in September last year. Members of this House will remember the controversy in the build-up to the ALP conference in September last year surrounding the privatisation of ANL. It was quite clear, to all objective observers, that the minister was not going to get his privatisation item, which was on the agenda of the conference, supported by the conference. Indeed, Senator Robert Ray was recorded as having remarked that the minister would not get double figures in support on the floor of the ALP conference when he moved the privatisation of ANL. Consequently, in order to avoid embarrassment, the minister acted in the way that he did. Suddenly he sacked the board of ANL. Suddenly he withdrew ANL from privatisation. He went out and said, 'You couldn't give it away,' and implied that the former directors of ANL and the chairman of ANL were incompetent in the process. Then he appointed his mates to get their noses in the trough. When you look at it, the truth of it was that the handling of ANL was done solely for party political purposes. It was designed to avoid embarrassment for the minister on the floor of the ALP conference. That is why the minister acted in the way he did. His methods have caused considerable concern. The former chairman of ANL in his submission to the Senate inquiry that took place last Friday indicated many areas of grave concern about the way the minister acted. The former chairman claimed that one of the major assets of ANL, Australian Stevedores, was sold to Jamieson Equity for $10 million or $11 million less than its true value. One of the principal assets of the company was sold cheaply. The former chairman, Mr Bolitho, claims that the minister did not act in regard to his proper responsibilities as a minister of the Crown. The whole of the submission put forward by Mr Bolitho is littered with the most extraordinary claims levelled against LB, as he describes him, Laurie Brereton. Any other minister who did not have a hide as thick as a rhinoceros would be totally embarrassed by that report. Indeed, many other governments that were not as insensitive to proper ministerial responsibility as this one is would have required a minister to resign over the comments that have been made in the submission of the former chairman of ANL. However, in the style of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) attacking Vince FitzGerald last week, anybody who says anything critical about the government is described in derogatory terms. In this case, poor old Bill Bolitho, according to Laurie Brereton, is just a bitter old man. Vince FitzGerald was described as getting out of bed every morning and sucking on a lemon when he criticised the government. The government does not listen to the message. It tries instead to shoot the messenger. If the message about ANL was listened to, if people listened to some of the concerns that even the member for Throsby has highlighted in this House today, then they would say it is quite clear that the Australian taxpayers have lost a fortune over the handling of ANL. They would say it is quite clear that this government has been incompetent in the way it has handled the sale of ANL. They would say that this government has acted to the advantage of a few of its mates at the expense of the many, and they would say that the people working for ANL have had their futures disadvantaged substantially as a consequence of this government's incompetent and dishonest handling of the sale and management of ANL.  p.m.)-I was anticipating hearing some sort of a detailed analysis of the ANL Sale Bill from the member for Hume (Mr Sharp), the shadow minister for transport, as to concerns about its provisions. Instead, we mostly heard, 'Play the men and not the ball.' I found unconscionable his attacks upon the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). It would be better to do it on a more appropriate occasion when you are feeling that way, or maybe you could have a little chat together outside. To make the comments that the member for Throsby is a hypocrite, a man of straw and that he was only mouthing those wordsMr Sharp-You weren't listening to his speech, Peter.  his speech just as I was listening to your speech. In fact, I am quite disgusted, knowing you as I do, that you would utter the kind of comment that you made. It ill behoves you in your activities in other places to suggest that the member for Throsby is other than utterly sincere and utterly dedicated in the views he expressed. It is not a preselection matter. If you were a little bit up to date, you would know that he was preselected quite some months ago. I told you before, honourable friend",60
95,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The honourable member for Shortland should address his remarks through the chair.  honourable enemy? What am I supposed to call him? What is wrong with honourable friend? Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I address my honourable friend over there. It is common practice in the House of Commons. Please check your facts and material-through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to over yonder. Going through some of the comments that you made about operating losses, yes, I can add up and other people can add up; it is quite easy to do it year by year. But I notice that you did not take into account that there were other abnormal incomes in a number of those years and that in some of those years dividends were paid. The officers advising obviously also can count. To put a different slant on the picture, it is like any of the large corporations: yes, they may have losses from time to time when operating, other factors come in and there are other sources of income, but do the whole bit when you put it together rather than select just part of it. The attacks by the member for Hume upon the member for Throsby and ANL are really just part of the old pattern. Members of the National Party and its predecessor, the Country Party, go through the motions of supporting Australian shipping, but in reality they are hammering the life out of Australian shipping-denigrating Australians who work on ships and denigrating people who work on the waterfront rather than setting about the difficult task of how we should improve that business, that industry, and make it more competitive. The relentless attacks upon ANL by the member for Hume in his role as shadow minister for transport are simply in line with the long-established tradition of the former Country Party. One has only to look at its that performance in Australian shipping and especially ANL. We came into office in 1983 and inherited a shipping line, the Australian Shipping Commission, that was technically insolvent. The shipping line had been forced in 1977 to sell off its four major vessels and recharter them so that the proceeds of the sale could be added into the budget and reduce outlays for budgetary purposes in 1977-78, as I recall. That imposed a massive burden on the business. It was one of the factors the business was not able to overcome. The business was also forced to operate services for Country Party purposes, one to North Queensland and one to Darwin, that never made a dollar. In fact, $42 million of ANL's capital was lost on the North Queensland service alone. But it was seen to be politically desirable that Australian ships operate a service up to some of the North Queensland ports. The attitude of the National Party and the Country Party has always been the same: of denigrating Australian seafarers and their role. We see now an opposition that is literally clapping its hands with glee. At last, they appear to have what they wanted, and that is the disposal of ANL, Australia's national line. But they have been captives for many decades of overseas interests and of primary interests. Australia's shipping industry has never developed as it should have, given that we are the fifth largest market in the world on a cargo distance carried basis. Clapping their hands at this time along with the National Party and the opposition are the foreign shipowners. Foreign shipowners cannot believe their luck. For decades they have been trying to wreck ANL. For decades they have been trying to put ANL out of the Australian picture and leave AustralianEuropean trade to the European lines. Now they have achieved that. I suspect that some of the provisions in bill have not been fully understood by some members of the parliament. As I go through the provisions of the bill, I questions for further clarification. As we look through the provisions outlined by earlier speakers-and I will touch on some of them. I would like to see a greater clarification of those sections dealing with the appropriation of up to $15 million that may be necessary to meet any Commonwealth contribution required under the contract, or to cover the expenses of transferring the transferring items. It would be helpful if the detail of this provision was spelt out. What items are going to be covered? Under what conditions will financing be made available or expenses incurred? We need to know more about the appropriation of any funds required in respect of working capital for the current financial year for RetainCo or any former ANL companies transferred to the Commonwealth. I look at the third paragraph in the financial impact statement: the Commonwealth will continue to be exposed to potential liability in respect of $183 million of debt, mostly in the form of obligations under long-term ship leases which are to be transferred from ANL to RetainCo. I have a concern about officers who write that kind of material. Ship leases are normal commercial contracts; they are not debt. There would be rarely a company in this country that does not have a lease of one sort or another. It is not referred to in accounts as a debt. Ship charges and long-term leases are a potential liability , but they are not debt. Yet this goes to the flavour of the remarks I will make shortly-the quality of advice provided to governments and to decision makers on this issue. On a number of occasions in the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastru-ture, I have raised the quality of advice provided to decision makers in respect of aviation safety and budgetary matters. I raise it here again today because it is an issue that goes to the very heart of public administration. Good decisions are based on good, comprehensive, accurate advice-advice that has some background, depth and knowledge. Good decisions are not based upon partisan or this poor advice-advice that is inaccurate. The description of shipping leases as debt is not good advice neither to the government nor to want to raise some this parliament. We need, in the course of this transaction, to ensure that Australia's interests in P&O are fully protected. All associated with this process need to be vigilant to ensure that Australia's interests are given first priority. I suspect that some may not be aware of the ramifications of P&O's proposals and the role in these arrangements. But I have first-hand experience of the utter arrogant attitude that some British shipowners have towards this government, regardless of colour, towards industry in this country and particularly towards officers in this country. I refer to one firm called Acta Ltd. In the government's interests and in Australia's interests, I ask: who is managing ANL's interests in the Australia-Europe conference trade? Who has that responsibility? What are the conditions? Looking at what happens with the sale of those conference shares that go along with the sale of ANL to P&O, they are very valuable acquisitions for P&O. One might look at it and say, 'That's not worth much. That trade is losing money. That hasn't got a value.' Let me tell you it has a great value, because Australia's participation in that trade, carrying our own exports to and our own imports from Europe, is determined not by Australia but by the other foreign shipowners in that conference. I think that is a lamentable situation, but it is a situation which Australia has been locked into since about 1969 by contractual arrangements. They have changed from time to time, but it is extremely difficult to change them. They make those decisions. If I could quote from Lloyd's List Australia of 11 September 1995: P&O will keep Australian National Line as a clear brand name in the market, but will merge the administration and marketing operations, P&O managing director Richard Hein has told LLA W. It says: P&O has a maximum share of 25% of its biggest customer accountsANL's accountsand there are plenty of other accounts it does not have. ANL operates in the same trades as P&O, and the extra ANL capacity was clearly attractive. ANL's liner servicesthe services that carry containersare likely to be integrated directly into P&O's existing route pattern in Australia, despite the expansion of P&O onto its third and final major arterial liner trade next year when it enters the transpacific. ""We have very good direct trades, we're not traditionally proponents of hub operations"", said P&O Containers chairman Peter Let us just think about that. The acquisition or the addition of ANL shares in those container trades to P&O has the commercial result that almost a gross profit from that share becomes net profit. They are very handsome additions to P&O's business, and something which they have been after for years. That is why the foreign shipping lines are clapping their hands with glee at the prospect of what is going through this parliament today. We know that, in about 1992-93, ANL sold off seven per cent of one of its Asia conference shares for about $10 million. I am not able, with the information that is available, to extrapolate that into how much the other conference shares are worth today, but it is enough for me to say that these conference shares are very valuable to P&O. I want to know who is managing ANL's current interests in the Australia-Europe conference trade-who looks after it for ANL-because we were faced with a situation where ANL was told that it could not withdraw from contracts which were disadvantageous to it in respect of the European trade. But, if it did, on 12 months notice, then it would have to enter into a covenant for three years not to operate between Australia and Europe. That is the height, and an indication, of the arrogance that can come from European shipping lines in respect of Australian services. Much has been said about operational losses, but I want to mention something about final accounts. This is information that is available in the annual reports of the business, and they have been tabled in this parliame_lt and audited by the Auditor-General year after year. Along with the foreign shipping lines and the opposition that are clapping their hands with glee today are some of the Sir Humphreys of the past in this place. Sir Humphrey is alive and well. Yes, Minister is 95 per cent correct, but some of the Sir Humphreys-and some of the lesser Sir Humphreys who are around today-are also clapping their hands because they have and always wanted Australia out of international shipping; they have always wanted Australia Jollie. out of international aviation. In their policy, in the Sir Humphrey's policy, Australia should not be in it. It does not matter what the policy of the Liberal Party, the National Party or the Labor Party was or is; in their policy, the Sir Humphrey's policy, there is no role for Australia in those international aviation and shipping scenes. In fact, one senior official some years ago was able to say that, if other countries were silly enough to subsidise their shipping trades, we should take advantage of their stupidity and get out of shipping. That same policy is not postulated towards land based industries, but it is towards shipping. If we look at the systematic leaking of confidential information about ANL in the first half of last year, information mined that business seriously, that helped devalue that business seriously, it was information that could only have come from senior departmental levels here in Canberra. I should say that I do not think it was the Department of Transport. If you go through the Financial Review you can see the following: 9 March 1994, 'Potential bidders cautious about ANL'; 10 March 1994, 'Wharfies warn against ANL sale'; 14 March, 'Canberra waters down ANL sale conditions' - which refers to the content of a cabinet submission, cabinet documents obtained by the Australian Financial Review. I would like to get hold of cabinet documents. Mr Deputy Speaker, you cannot get hold of cabinet documents. These documents could only come from a very senior level. Another headline entitled 'Brereton hogties ANL board' appeared on 15 March 1994. The headline 'Rush to start ANL sale ahead of party talks' appeared on 21 March 1994, and the headline 'Advisers likely to recommend against ANL break-up' appeared on 7 June 1994. I can go through all the other ones that have come up, but the effect is that anybody who was contemplating renewing freight contracts with ANL or entering into a freight contract with ANL was absolutely discouraged. That business saw a rapid departure of long standing business and the prospect of new business because there was constant doubt being raised about its future-whether it would exist, where it would be and the fact that the board had gone. The people associ ated with that information have done this country a great disservice and have devalued a very valuable asset that belonged to the Australian people. I want to go further to look at the information and advice that has been provided, which I mentioned earlier. In the 1989 annual report of the Australian National Line, there is reference to its high gearing difficulties. The 1990 ANL annual report states: The lack of adequate shareholder equity, which was mentioned in last year's Report, caused difficulties throughout the 1980's, and remains one of the problems facing the Company ... The 1991 ANL annual report states: Although managing well in a cash sense, ANL that undermust expand its capital base. The report refers to the ALP annual conference decision to float part of the business-49 per cent. I have not got time to read all of the report, but it is there for those who want to read it. The 1992 ANL annual report states: Lacklustre trading profits during the recessionwhich the world sufferedwere exacerbated by high interest costs due to undercapitalisation and substantial costs in preparing for privatisation. The 1993 ANL annual report states: This privatisation of ANL is compounded by further uncertainty regarding the outcome of the Government's review of Part X of the Trade Practices Act, which regulates outwards conference liner shipping from Australia. All that information is on the public record. It is not new information; it is old information, as are answers to questions 686 and 688, which are also on the parliamentary record in 1993 and deal with the asset sales task force. I have a grave concern about the quality of advice being provided to decision makers on this issue. I think the minister that is involved-and the ministers that were involved-is entitled to better quality advice and more accurate advice than they have been getting. As I said earlier, this whole issue goes to the very heart of public finance and public administration. It is not just an ANL issue; it goes to the core of the role of the Public Service and what I believe is partisan activity by some members of the service. All those matters are on the record. They are not new; they are old hat. I want to return to the member for Sharp. Just to show his laziness, his inaccuracyMrs Bishop-He is not the member for Sharp.  though.  that. The member for Hume is not so sharp. I had him confused in another quote with Mr Blunt, who preceded some of his National Party members. The member again attacked ANL and the Maritime Union of Australia earlier today, as he has previously on 30 August, when he stated: But even at this very moment we are in the process of putting through a bill that will pay $19 million worth of seafarers' PA YE tax bills for them-a $19 million grant to pay for the seafarers' PA YE tax bill! That is utterly false. If he is so stupid that he does not understand it, it is time for somebody to explain it to him in single syllables. That provision is to rebate to the employers the tax they are paying on behalf of their employees. The beneficiaries will be those ship operating companies which operate more than 50 per cent of their trade internationally. (Time expired)  ever there was a case of the government being caught by its own incompetence, it has to be on ANL. This must surely go down as showing the risk inherent when you pander to special interest groups, put off making a decision and then get rushed into it by stitching up a grubby little deal. In other words, it is the risk inherent in how the ALP carries out the role of government. ANL was first listed to be sold in 1991, four years ago. In ANL's case, that is four disastrous financial years ago. Between 1991 and June 1994, ANL accrued further losses of $53.7 million-four years of wasted opportunity to tum the shipping line around under private control. As usual, the government went straight for the easy option of selling 49 per cent, but they found that was not viable. No-one would buy less than half a basket case, so they decided to sell the lot. Then the unions and the ALP factions got into the act. The unions, of course, did not want to sell any of it. A new buyer might try to run it as a going concern and cut away some of the fat that the maritime unions had built up over generations of rorting and featherbedding. The Left did not want to sell it because they do not want to sell anything. They think the bureaucrats can run business better than business people themselves. These, of course, are the same people who wanted to protect the banks from competition and to allow the two airlines to continue anticompetitive practices at the expense of consumers. They thought it would be much better if ANL was to continue running large losses and place further strain on the taxpayers. In their view, it is better to spt-nd money propping up a shipping fleet than on hospitals and education. The process dragged on and on until we got to 1995. We had two buyers-a French company and the British company P&O. The French dropped out, leaving only P&O. This sent waves of concern through the maritime unions, as P&O was known as a no-nonsense company. The maritime unions made it clear that they favoured the French company. When it was only P&O left, out came all the old furphies once again: platitudes about foreign investment and that all that was needed was restructuring, et cetera-anything but sell. This put the government in a real bind. The Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) had previously said that you could not give ANL away when in fact there had been a buyer. But then the ALP masters in the union movement said no. What to do? You can just see the Minister for Transport wondering how he could get out of this mess. After much discussion, when the government pretended it had a real say, the discussions were handed over to the real controlling parties, P&O and the unions, because that's how a sale worksthe buyer meets the people who control the assets to be sold. Since the maritime unions set maritime policy, including the sale of ANL, they met with P&O. The government sat back, waiting for further instructions from the unions on the outcome of the discussions. One thing the government was prepared to do was spray a bit of taxpayers' money around to give it all a little nudge. After all, it is the preferred ALP solution: if you have a problem, throw some more taxpayers' money at it and hope it gets you past the next election date. At least you can tell everyone exactly how much money you are spending, even if you are not actually dealing with the issue. If that is not enough, they put up taxpayers' money to guarantee the liabilities of a shipping line with a disastrous financial history. In a nutshell, they have used taxpayers' money to underwrite an agreement between a foreign multinational and the Maritime Union, which is hardly well known for its cutting edge approach to reform and commercial practice. I am sorry, but we cannot agree to support the ANL Sale Bill with the limited information available. We will not agree to the government using taxpayers' money and exposing the taxpayers to risk so that some grubby little deal can be cut to prevent the government looking completely ridiculous before the next election. The government's own rank incompetence got them into this. Taxpayers should not have to bail them out and foot the bill. If the government originally had the backbone to go through with their decision, instead of bowing and scraping to the plethora of vested interests, we would not be in this situation. ANL would have been sold long ago. The Auditor-General was in no doubt as to where the blame should go. For example, in his report he stated: A degree of uncertainty surrounding the objectives of the sale and the means of achieving the objectives would have aggravated any sale process. In other words, the government did not know what they were doing or how they were doing it. They got themselves into it; they can get themselves out of it. The government has tried many things. They have used taxpayers' funds to downsize crews, they have protected ANL coastal operations from any competition and they have done a deal on taxation of wages on shipping. After all this, ANL still runs at a loss. In a desperate attempt to pass the buck, they sacked the board and put in No.1 ALP mate old Nifty, Neville Wran, on the job. Never one to keep his nose out of the taxpayer funded gravy train, old Nifty rode into the job to get it ready for sale. Their reward for doing such an excellent job in delaying the real action was $816,000 plus expenses. Now Nifty has done such a good job that the government wants to have an appropriation in case the results are worse than expected. They want an extra $15 million appropriated, one of the reasons given being the potential for worse than expected operating results from ANL prior to the sale agreement. That's confidence for you, that's confidence ALP-style: give us 15 million bucks and she'll be right. But at least the main purpose of this exercise has been satisfied. Old Nifty and his sidekick Turnbull made a few quick bucks at taxpayers' expense on the way through and now the union and the buyer can slug it out. The Maritime Union has already made it abundantly clear they are not likely to negotiate a solution. So we are back to square one. We still have a union saying no, a government too weak to do anything and, in all likelihood, a buyer that throws up their arms eventually and walks away. So what will happen then? I think it is fairly safe to make this prediction. The election will be too close for the government to stand up to its union masters and we will get another restructuring package. Once again the taxpayer will foot the bill. Once again the government will mutter all the platitudes about how they are serious about selling. We might even get the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) wading into the fray again until Bill Kelty reminds him that the government is only a side player and his view is not required. The worse thing is that no-one should be surprised about any of this. It is par for the course for this government to fill their budget holes with asset sales but never really get anything done. That way you can do the same thing year after year. Already it looks like the Commonwealth Bank will fall into next financial year, but no worries-it has served the purpose of providing an artificial surplus for the financial year. That is the great thing about asset sales; you do not know it has failed until the end of the financial year and then you can make an earnest statement of intent about the next financial year. It has worked so well that between 1990-91 and 1994-95 the government offered $8 billion in asset sales but only delivered $3.7 billion in reality. They achieved less than half of the original target and now they expect us to believe they are going to sell $5.3 billion worth of assets in one year. That is now looking a bit unlikely, given the lower than expected returns of Qantas, the cancelling of the AIDC sale and now ANL. The most ridiculous aspect of these asset sales is that they are labelled as part of some sort of deficit reduction and national savings strategy. We know that the real deficit is at least $8.2 billion, because the government tell us so in the back of the budget papers. As far as national savings go, that is simply nonsense. How does the government think the private sector acquires these assets? It does by running down private savings. So the net addition to national savings is zero. The government knows this, but that does not stop them running around misleading the Australian people about the true state of affairs. Anybody who can stand there with a straight face and say that foreign debt does not impact on interest rates, despite their own budgetary papers, could tell you just about anything. But, even taking these factors into account, the ANL sale is special, because the government wants it to cost money. At least you could say that the asset sales that have been achieved have made money, but not ANL. The government want to break new ground. They want an asset sale that increases spending appropriations. On top of that, there are exemptions for taxes and fees relating to the sale. That is the point that we are at. Pending union agreement, the government want to privatise a fleet of trading ships and all related infrastructure for a net gain of basically nothing. Indeed, with the guarantee, it may end up costing a great deal of money. The government want to set up another ANL experience called 'RetainCo' to hold all the parts that you cannot give away. This name is, of course, short for 'Retaining the debt, liabilities and risk for the taxpayer to just execute the minister's sloppy deal'. This is all because they did not have the backbone to proceed with the sale when it was first decided. Of course, these appropriations are a story in themselves. For example, the government will be providing details on how they will offset the proposed spending. I will not hold my breath waiting for the details, because I am sure they have no intention of offsetting the new spending. That is the way it will go for a much vaunted election package. Senator Cook, who speaks in the Senate for the Treasurer (Mr Willis), believes that they can have all this new spending and not hurt the surplUS. We know that the government does not believe there is scope for any cuts to spending. It leaves only two options: either the surso pluses will be dramatically reduced, or the government will lift taxes so that they will win the next election and pay for it after all that. It is the same routine we got prior to the last election. Make lots of promises and say that growth will pay for them or the budget surplus will be bigger than you thought. You then break your word and lift taxes. That is how this tax and spend government works. All spending is sacred, and tax is a vast abundant pool to be utilised wherever possible. Of course, the Prime Minister's lower tax commitment to the Australian people should not be allowed to get in the way of lifting taxes. Perhaps they will not lift taxes again. What then? They will simply reduce the surplus or reduce national savings. This will flow straight through into higher foreign debt. The ALP choice will be higher taxes and higher foreign debt. This ALP approach stands in stark contrast to the approach that the coalition will adopt. When we say that we will privatise something, we will. We will not be held up by endless obstructions from special interest groups or bureaucratic wrangling or ministerial indecision. We will certainly not use the proceeds to wastefully pay for recurrent expenditure. It will be used to pay for debt reduction to lower the crippling PDI burden that this government is working on Australia. We already pay $9.3 billion to financial markets rather than to education, health or roads. This is a chronic misuse of taxpayers' funds. It is ironic that the party which talks so much about social justice is happy to spend so much money on debt interest payments instead of making Australia a better place to live. The sale of ANL has been a farce from day one. Through incompetence and a lack of will, the government has failed to get a relatively straightforward sale off the ground. The losses have continued to stack up, making the sale harder and harder. The government has failed to stand up to the unions and act in the national interest, preferring instead to play safe politics. Now it is back again asking the taxpayer to foot the bill. This is a perfect illustration of a government that is tired and no longer capable of making decisions in the national interest. They have lost the will to rule in the national interest and are now operating on the basis of damage control and grubby deals. It is the desire for power for their own sake, not for what you can do with it. This time they have given the game away. Australia has severe economic problems, and it is time for action, not scheming and empty words.",64
96,Ms HENZELL,PAIRS,"Capricornia) (2.35 p.m.)We almost got a bit of policy out of the opposition. The shadow finance minister, the  they are going to do something. On 21 August, in the Financial Review, it was reported:  called on the government to resist union pressure and just sell ANL. At the same time, the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), the opposition's privatisation spokeswoman, guaranteed that a privati sed Telstra would remain Australian owned but declined to provide details of the coalition's sales plans. Once again, we have a re-run of the MTIA appearance by all these shadow spokespeople. They are going to do something but they cannot tell you what and they are not going to tell you now. The ANL Sale Bill 1995 is the outcome of some constructive negotiations between the government, P&O and the Maritime Union of Australia. It covers a number of issues, and the sale will be deferred until 31 October 1995 until negotiations have taken place between the unions and P&O. During this period, P&O and the unions will negotiate in good faith in respect of ANL's industrial arrangements. Obviously, the sale will not proceed unless those arrangements come to fruition and then we revert to a restructuring of ANL. I want to raise a number of concerns, unlike our colleagues opposite who, as the member for Forrest said, want to rule the countrythey do not want to govern the country; they want to rule the country much in the way of the colonialists. One of the concerns of the Maritime Union members is that if it is ceded into foreign interest we will revert to a much older version of running our shipping. I want to raise a number of concerns on this matter, together with my colleagues the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) and the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris). First of all, one of my constituents, John Homan, has sent me a very extensive report on ANL. He is a ships engineer with 40 years experience in the industry, having previously worked for Royal Interocean Lines, and has been with ANL for 20 years. In a submission to me, he stated: Is it conceivable that in our country girt by sea, so wholly dependent on sea transport, we should become a taker of services with no active role to play? Can we surrender the protection of our national interests to commercial interests with loyalties elsewhere? Cromwell didn't think so, and the Dutch fought England in four bitter wars over his Navigation Act. Closer to home Billy Hughes didn't think so and bought a fleet of ships during the first world war to ensure that Australia could move its exports. Our ships are the visible part of a total industrial environment which includes stevedoring, ship repair, insurance, brokerage, freight forwarding, pilotage, port management, development and maintenance, shipbuilding and many other related activities and service industries. They are all interdependent for a continuous flow of inforrnation, trammg, and interchange of expertise and personnel. Together they have the ability to provide a high standard of economical services to shippers and importers. For working Australia, it gives a diversity of career opportunities, broad in its scope with a great deal of cross pollination between disciplines and different sectors of the industry. There are many reasons, far more compelling than the narrow dollar and cents argument why a complete maritime industry is not only desirable but essential if we want to realise our vision of the future. That is the considered view of a member of the Maritime Union. They are not out there really savouring it. In fact, they have been taking very constructive approach to these negotiacost tions. But, in consultation with members of the Maritime Union this morning-in Queensvessel land and in New South Wales-a great deal of concern was expressed by their rank and file. At a meeting in Brisbane yesterday, 140 bureaucratic members actually resolved to have the current negotiations broken off. But, of course, that since 1988. is not possible, as Paddy Crumlin explained to me when I spoke with him. There were national great concerns expressed at meetings also in for New South Wales. Yes, indeed, the meeting foreign did resolve not to support a Labor govern the ment unless it resolved to guarantee a long term commitment to the Australian National Line. It is not just an industrial issue; it is issue that concerns the whole country. Jennie George, the Secretary of the ACTU, said the Australian on 28 August: The unions and the ACTU have we should keep ANL in Australian ownership and not sell it off to foreign interests. There are differIn ent views about the line's financial state. The union would constructively address those problems. Public feeling went beyond industrial concerns. It would be a sad day for Australia as an island continent to lose its national Australian-owned shipping line. I believe one of the key points is that there is widespread concern in the community about these issues. It is not just a matter affecting the Maritime Union. That union represents the concerns of very many Australians. As Mr Homan has indicated, we are talking about major areas of our industry that would be beneficially affected, in terms of career and employment opportunities, by the decision to maintain our Australian shipping line. In my view, one of the most positive aspects of this bill is that, if the negotiations are not successful, the government has committed itself to restructuring the line. The union is aware that it will involve some job losses, but it is more concerned that we maintain a presence in the international shipping industry. Kenneth Davidson said in an article in the Age on 2 September: Those who blather about ANL inefficiency are complaining about the reluctance of Australa Ian seamen to accept Third World wages. The net to the balance of payments of about $7 million for every Australian vessel that becomes a foreign may not appear to be much in the context of a $28 billion-a-year current account deficit. In terms of the larger economic and strategic picture, which neither the Government nor its advisers considered, the ANL provided a good return for the net $9.6 million injection At the very least, history tells us that the way of salvation is not to hand over responsibility strategic industries to foreigners, particularly corporations like British Airways and P&O corporate heirs to the buccaneering tradition of the first Elizabethan privateers. They are strong words from Mr Davidson. I have quoted him before in previous speeches on this issue. History is instructive in this an matter. In the same article, Mr Davidson talks about the earlier history of our maritime in industry. For the interest of honourable members. I will quote Mr Davidson. He stated a firm view that in that article: 1923 when Stanley Bruce replaced Billy Hughes as Prime Minister of Australia, the Commonwealth Line had a fleet of some 54 ships in overseas trade. The fleet was initially composed of 26 enemy vessels confiscated at the outbreak of war and 15 ships bought in Britain in 1916 by Hughes after he had attended Imperial war talks with the British Cabinet. He goes on later in the article to state: The undermining of the line began in 1923 when Bruce was Treasurer ... Bruce prepared a financial history of the line that turned an ""actual gain of £2 million into a bookkeeping loss of nearly £3 million. He took this financial statement with him to the House, exclaimed over it in horror and when members had been sufficiently stampeded, brought in as the remedy an order to remove the fleet from parliamentary interference."" One Labor Party member at the time told parliament: ""The Line has been struggling for the last three years, under a cloud of uncertainty ... shippers are not likely to patronise the line if there is a risk that it will go out of existence in the course of a few months ... the present propaganda for the sale of the line is the culminating point after years of sabotage by the unsympathetic Government and the shipping ring The postscript to the original story is that Bruce became a director of P&O and a viscount after he lost his seat in the 1929 elections. P&O seems no less keen today than it was in the 1920s to get its hands on the government line. I think there is a ring of familiarity with some of those historical accounts. Now, somewhat closer from an historical perspective, I want to quote from the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee hearing of 22 September 1995. This is evidence given by Mr William Bolitho, the former chairman of ANL. This passage refers to some comments made by my colleague the member for Shortland, who was very well regarded by people who understand the maritime industry when he was Minister for Transport. Mr Bolitho says on page 1: When I became chairman in 1983, ANL was bankruptIn 1983-that was in the legacy of the Fraser government. The hypocrisy of the comments of the opposition speakers in this debate is outrageous. They are now going to oppose this bill, which at least is a constructive attempt to deal with some of the complexities. They are wringing their hands with glee because they are just dying to rip and tear at the infrastructure of this country for an ideological reason but with no real thought about the cost to the country. Mr Bolitho goes on to say: Liabilities exceeded assets by at least $200 million, and possibly as much as $300 million, all of which would have been lost if the business had been closed down. It had unhedged debt in US dollars of around $600 million and was indeed at that time a basket case. The minister of the day, the Hon. Peter Morris, took the hard decision to trade out of this situation and in doing so has saved the government those hundreds of millions of dollars. This massive potential loss, more nearly equivalent to half a billion dollars today, was saved to the Commonwealth by the minister's actions and ANL's actions in support of them. In 1983 ANL debt to the Commonwealth as $110 million, all of which would have been lost if ANL had been allowed to go under. That $110 million was converted to equity, which helped the balance sheet on paper but provided no funds as the money was already lost in the effective bankruptcy of the organisation. At that time, ANL was given $50 million in cash-nly $50 million, not the hundreds of millions set out in ministerial statements-and has since repaid loans of $20 million and paid dividends of $21 million. Factual cash flow analysis, as against ministerial statements, shows that the net cash input into ANL between 1983 and 30 June 1994 is therefore $9.3 million only. Mr Bolitho goes on to express concern about the Price Waterhouse-Salomon Brothers report. He says that the report that the minister relied on was flawed. He states: I will now detail some of those flaws. The report was preliminary in nature. Its valuation of ANL was not to be preferred over other valuations known to government. It was not a complete and thorough analysis. Certain aspects of its valuations were open to question. The minister's own department was concerned that the Price WaterhouseSalomon Bros report double discounted the value of ANL's major assets. Price Waterhouse-Salomon Bros did not seek any independent confirmation or verification of the reliability, accuracy and completeness of the information provided to them. In relation to the selling of the stevedoring assets, he says: There would appear to be no conceivable legal, commercial or prudential reasons for the haste in which ANL's stevedoring assets were sold. The only event on the horizonAnd so he goes on. Obviously, Mr Bolitho has a particular point of view. I refer to these issues because one thing we do know is that Mr Bolitho has a great deal of credibility in the maritime industry in this country. It is very important that, as we as the government move to deal very constructively with these issues, we take account of the fact that, as the member for Shortland said, decisions that government make must be made on the best possible available advice. It is vitally important when we are talking about the long-term welfare of this countryparticularly job creation and our national integrity-that we do look at issues over and above some short-term bottom lines. There is no doubt that this government has been very responsible in dealing with the need to cut its deficit. Every time we try to do something constructive, members of the opposition, who display considerable cant on this issue, simply get up and block our legislation in the Senate. Mr Ruddock-Are you going to vote against this bill?",71
97,Ms HENZELL,PAIRS,"The honourable member for Berowra is obviously going to make a huge contribution to this debate. These are vital issues. We are talking about the integrity of our future involvement in the trade. I recall the member for Shortland asking who represents Australia at the Australia-European shipping conference. It is my understanding that P&O have taken this role. On that vital run where we have been losing money, P&O have been representing the ANL interests. It is very important to understand that the one thing we will retain by having a restructured ANL is a seat at international shipping conferences. This issue was referred to in an article by Steve Lewis in the Financial Review of 24 August. One of the issues that I am concerned about, as he reports it, is this: The Federal Government is set to receive as little as $5 million-and could even end up paying out money-if it proceeds with the sale of shipping, ANL Ltd, to the British-based P&O Group. P&O has also been unable to give guarantees that it will maintain all-Australian crews on ANL's six international trading vessels-a politically sensitive issue which could prove decisive ... If certain conditions were triggered-such as the Commonwealth having to meet certain lease payments-then the Government could end up paying out to get rid of ANL. If we are looking to be fiscally responsible here, one would have to question whether that, in the end, is going to be to our benefit. We recognise that the restructuring could result in job losses. Indeed Mr Lewis comments on this: Restructuring of the ailing company would result in about 200 job losses, most of these white collar workers from the shipping line's head office in Melbourne. However, one positive outcome from the restructuring option is that it would leave Australia with a seat at the international shipping conference. There is no doubt that we are a very small player, but it is better to be a small player. Thinking about our role in APEC and, on a different note, about our role at the women's conference in Beijing, we have demonstrated time and again that even as a small player we can be very constructive and strategic at the international level. That has also been proved regarding French nuclear testing. It is very important that we look at the proposal. As I said earlier, one of the most constructive aspects of this bill is that, if the negotiations between P&O and the union are not successful, the option will lapse and the subsequent arrangements will be in place for a restructuring. None of these options are easy. There are no simple solutions. But the one thing we can say-and I am proud to say it-is that this is a government that will consult with the representatives of the union movement. This is always trashed by the opposition. We know that they will not support the Accord. They will make sure that industrial arrangements in this country mean a downward trend for workers' wages and conditions. We know this because they are ideologically committed to it. No amount of soft talking by opposition spokespersons or the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) will pull the wool over the eyes of workers in this country. At the end of the day, they may have concerns about our role but they certainly won't have any truck with the sorts of policies that we know, though they are kept under wraps, are the real agenda of the opposition. With my colleagues I express serious concerns. I think it has been constructive to have this debate in the parliament. I certainly reinforce the fact that the unions are prepared to negotiate. Indeed, P&O have admitted in their public statements that they know that if they have an agreement with the Maritime Union, the union will stick to that agreement. They know that the union will stand behind their words. I believe the union are being very responsible. I hope that the ministers involved will take heed of a number of issues when they are drawn to their attention as we continue through the processes involved in this bill. I commend the union and all those people in the community who have expressed concern about this issue to me. It is most importANL ant that a federal Labor government does listen to the concerns of the community. The Australian National Line is an icon, it is historically important and it is important to the economic future of our country. If we act in haste we may well repent at leisure. (Time expired)",74
98,Mr MCARTHUR,PAIRS,I wonder whether the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) will support the government when the vote is taken in the House? Her speech indicates that she has serious reservations as to whether the government wishes to sell ANL. Her speech was an apology for the disaster that surrounds this whole saga. Mr Ruddock-She will probably vote with the government and distribute her speech to the electorate.,75
99,Mr MCARTHUR,PAIRS,"Yes, she will probably distribute her speech to the electorate whether she supports the government or otherwise. It is very hard to ascertain what her view is. said that what is left is a reconstructed ANL. The situation is that because the government could not sell that portion to P&O it has had to be put into another company called RetainCo. The sale of the ANL is a legacy of disasters suffered by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). He has made a terrible mess ever since he took over responsibility for the ANL. Today in this parliament we have seen the disaster that he has suffered with the problem of noise generated by Sydney airport. The minister has got that wrong as well. This situation is an indication of the undue influence that the maritime union has on the sale of ANL and the union's desire to retain jobs at any expense. The diminished capital value of ANL is a result of the ineptitude of the government and the minister and procrastination with the privatisation program since 1991. The ALP Left is totally opposed to the sale of ANL. The honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), who is a very genuinely committed person, has clearly put the position of the ALP Left to this parliament. Even though is suffering losses and has problems, the member for Throsby wants to retain it. No doubt there has been a lot of argument in the government's back rooms as to the relative positions of the ALP Left and the ministerwho comes from the New South Wales Right. What is the value of ANL? A number of figures have been quoted during this debate. The range of figures, backed up by various valuations, has been remarkable. I leave it to honourable members to make their own assessment as to the value of ANL and the amount of its debts. After the potential sale of ANL to P&O what is the government going to do with the remnants of the ANL shipping fleet? Those important questions are before the parliament this afternoon. In August 1994 Minister Brereton told the parliament that selling ANL was out of the question. On that occasion we heard that famous statement: 'You couldn't even give it away.' As a result of that statement, commercial operators and potential investors were not encouraged to put forward a bid for ANL. As She it turned out, the minister may have been right because taxpayers are now faced with the prospect of literally paying money to enable a British shipping company, P&O, to take ANL off the government's hands---or portions thereof. This situation has occurred because Minister Brereton has been reckless in his dealings with the board of ANL. We have also seen the spoiling tactics of the Maritime Union which would not allow the government or the minister to sell ANL. The methods that the union used to ensure that ANL was not sold in the early stages are well known. All Australians should be aware of the attitude of this government. We need reform on the waterfront and in the shipping area, but the government has been unable to move because of its commitment to the Maritime Union. The union has greater loyalty to its union mates and members of the Labor Party than to the interests of Australians. As I said, the government has been trying to sell ANL since 1991 and the expected proceeds have been included in the budget since that year.",75
100,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! It being 3 p.m. the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order lOlA. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. The member for Corangamite will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA,76
101,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"On Monday, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) raised as a matter of privilege certain actions of the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred). As I understand it, earlier in the year the honourable member for Deakin, when speaking in debate, had made certain claims of wrongdoing against a senior public servant and a prominent Melbourne lawyer. It has now been reported by the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) that the Australian Federal Police has advised that certain documents used by the honourable member in connection with the allegations were forgeries. The minister did not suggest that the member for Deakin was responsible for the forgeries. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports argued that the question of whether the honourable member for Deakin has abused the rights of the House knowingly and willingly should be referred to the Committee of Privileges. In the House of Commons, the action of a member found to have deliberately misled the House has been held to be a contempt. Issues of privilege are indeed serious. Two reports of the Committee of Privileges illustrate this point. In 1989 the Committee of Privileges reported on actions of the then honourable member for Bruce in making allegations against another member. It stated: Having regard to the experience of the honourable member for Bruce, the committee finds that the honourable member has offended against the rules of the House. In a report presented last December, the Committee of Privileges commented on actions of the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), stating: Allegations of wrongdoing are often made to members of parliament. Members enjoy very special rights-rights greater than those enjoyed by ordinary citizens. The privilege of freedom of speech is the greatest of these, but its very significance is such, where the reputation or welfare of persons may be an issue, that it should be used judiciously. The report continued: If a member is of the opinion that it is in the public interest to disclose such allegations, he or she should make all reasonable inquiries as to the truth of the allegations. The raising of a matter, in full detail, in the House is only one of the options available to members. The report went on to state: It is for the member to resolve whether or not it is in the public interest to raise a matter in the House, and his or her actions will be judged accordingly. I would suggest to all members that they accept the responsibility that comes with the privilege of this House. Words, once spoken, cannot be unspoken. They can be withdrawn, but the withdrawal is only printed along with the words. We are not mere mouthpieces. In the draft code of conduct tabled in this House, it is suggested that members and senators must exercise due diligence. The code goes on to suggest that members have due regard for the rights and obligations of all Australians. I would commend a consideration of that code to all members. While I acknowledge that some members may take exception to the actions now complained of, on the information available to me there is no evidence to support a conclusion that a prima facie case of contempt has been made out. Accordingly, I am not willing to allow precedence to a motion on this matter.",76
102,Mr ALDRED,PRIVILEGE,"The member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), in relation to the matter raised by him two days ago, said in his comments on that day, 'I do not want to in any way restrict the rights of members.' Yet his very comments on that day were a manifestation of that. In view of your determination now, Mr Speaker, I would ask you to ask the member for Melbourne Ports to withdraw his assertion of the same day that I am a member who abuses the rights and prerogatives of this parliament.",76
103,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"No, I would not do so. I will again refer all members in this place to the statement that I have made. As I said, the issue of privilege is one of the most important issues that members enjoy in this place. How it is used is in their discretion, but I think people should look very carefully at it. NA Wages and Salaries",77
104,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister. Is it not a fact, Deputy Prime Minister, that wages and salaries have fallen under 13 years of Labor government? Is it not also a fact that real average wages have decreased-I repeat, decreased-since 1983, while real home mortgage rates are six times higher in 1995 than in 1983? So I ask the Deputy Prime Minister: when the Prime Minister appeals, as he has today, to workers to consider their pay packets, is he not in fact saying, 'For your family's sake, please don't vote Labor'?",77
105,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is a question from the gentleman who has opposed every wage rise bar two.,77
106,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Bar one.,77
107,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Every wage rise bar one. Oh, no! I stand corrected: the Leader of the Opposition indicates that it is every wage rise bar three over the last 10 years. So it is against that background that you must consider both the motive behind the question and, obviously, the answer that I will give to it. The growth in average weekly ordinary time earnings for full-time adult employees has, in fact, increased by 0.3 per cent over year to May 1995, and the real AWOTE for full-time adult employees has grown by 4.5 per cent since February 1993. So I am not sure exactly what set of figures the Leader of the Opposition was commenting from but, clearly, they were not from those figures related to full-time workers where there have been real increases in real terms over the course of the year to date. Going back over the decade, of course, real household disposable income per capitawhich is just about the only sensible way of measuring what is actually happening to our community in terms of their earning-spending capacity-has increased by 20.9 per cent, and full-time adult average weekly total earnings over that period of time by 7.2 per cent in real terms. So through all sources of income, including that related to wages, since we have been in office, you have seen substantial real increases available to the community. And it is going to be one of the substantial contrasts between us and you as we come down to the poll next year that we stand for a set of mechanisms which ensure stable, continuing growth in incomes for people in this country, as opposed to the devising of various ingenious means of attack upon those in the work force who you have decided are to be your targets-which is just about everybody except those in the various elements of the executive in business. So, as far as the Leader of the Opposition is concerned, he can be assured that the figures that he presented to us were incorrect. I have given those correct figures. He can also be assured that the government will sustain industrial relations policies which keep that in place. And he can be assured that we will allow both our view and his view about how many times he has managed to support wage rises over the last decade to get further and further abroad over the next six months or so-once, in our view, in the last decade; three times, in his view, in the last decade. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport Mr LEO MCLEA Y-My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. Can the the minister outline to the House the implications of the government's changes to the Sydney airport curfew for residents affected by aircraft noise?",77
108,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and can inform him and the House that, following the passage of the Sydney Airport Curfew Bill-a bill initiated, I might say, by the honourable member for Lowe-the curfew at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport will now be significantly strengthened. That bill will allow us to immediately tighten up on the shoulder period and cut the eligible weekly movements from the present 42 down to 35. In addition to that, of course, a regime requiring shoulder operations to be fully justified will now be estabthe lished. If they cannot be fully justified they will have to go. Upon completion of Sydney West airport, all shoulder movements, all curfew freight operations, will be relocated to that new airport. I might say that at Sydney West approaches and departures will be designed to meet strict environmental controls because we are determined to avoid residential areas. But just how soon Sydney West airport can open is now in grave doubt as a result of the opposition leader's stated intention to block our airport leasing strategy. As the Minister for Finance could tell you, Sydney West's scheduled completion of 1999 is predicated on revenue raised under the leasing arrangements for Sydney airport. By delaying the Sydney West project, as inevitably will happen, the opposition will ensure that Sydney has just one-I repeat, one-horrifically congested airport operating at the time of the year 2000 Olympics. The inevitable congestion will see the airlines campaigning for more curfew dispensations and they will be campaigning for stub operations by propeller planes on the eastwest runway, thereby lifting the capacity of the airport from its 80 to 85 to 90 to 95, and providing for IO additional jumbo jets straight down the north-south corridor. And that is only the Sydney scenario. It says absolutely nothing about the implications of the delay for other FAC airports. It says nothing about the implications for Australia's reputation when it comes to major foreign investment, when those foreign investors are told that the whole process is in limbo because the leader of the free enterprise opposition is worried about his seat, worried about the burghf!rs on the Hunters Hill peninsulaMr Bilney-The headland.",77
109,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The great headland, today his only headland-the one that starts at the bridge and runs through Hunters HiII down to Woolwich. That is what this is all about. When we talk about those investment implications, we are not talking about small beer. We are talking about billions of dollars of investments, we are talking about some of biggest companies in the US and the UK, and we are talking about the biggest hedged fund organisation in the world. They are all down here, all putting together consortia, all now being told, 'Don't worry about it; it is all in limbo because of the great headland'because of this low performance in seeking to destroy the budget of this nation for next year to the tune of some $2 billion. That is what you are seeking to do. Of course, we are not just talking about international operators. We are talking about some of Australia's biggest blue chip companies, we are talking about our biggest institutions, and we are talking about funds that manage superannuation on behalf of hundreds of thousands of Australian working men and women. They are all being told that their interests are secondary to the politics of Bennelong. Even in his worse days, even at his very lowest point, the old Russ Hinze could not have used his position for such a naked local electorate purpose as the Leader of the Opposition is doing in his stance this week. Mr Speaker, what is worse, he knows exactly what he is doing. He knows that what he is doing is wrong, and he is doing it simply to cover up the strident support that he gave for the development of the third runway in the first place. He cannot say he did not know about it. You only have to go back to that great quote on the Mike Carlton program back in 1989. Mike Carlton put it to him fair and square when he asked him if people would get less noise if the third runway was built. He turns his back because he hates this stuff. But this is what he said, for all to hear: Many people will get less noise because you will have the north-south pattern. That is what you said, 'that you will have the north-south pattern' . You knew from the start, as you said in 1989 on the Mike Carlton program, that you were advocating this. You said, 'Yes, people will get less noise because they will have the north-south pattern'. You went on to say: I think the case for it on general interest grounds is absolutely overwhelming. That is what you want the people on your headland to forget. That is what this week's performance has been all about, to try and cover up for that strident advocacy. Of course, you are not saying now what you were saying to your constituents then. Not on your nelly! Instead, you are saying that you want to hold this ransom and you will continue to do so unless we ignore the serious safety advice given to us by Air Services Australia, by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, by the Department of Transport, by the safety experts of Qantas, by the safety experts of Ansett, by the managLet ing director of Qantas and by the managing director of Ansett. You are saying, 'No, we have to disregard all that. We have to ignore that safety advice, and we have to put the noise back over the battlers on the east-west axis.' That is what it is all about. This man is running for Prime Minister Australia. This week, brother, you have been acting like a mayoral candidate in a local government contest for Hunters Hill. That what you have been doing. The Leader of Opposition wants to play in the political league, but he has always belonged in the little league. As I said yesterday, through his actions this week he has demonstrated his unfitness to ever govern Australia. Wages and Salaries",78
110,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations, is better known to some people as the burgher of Botany. I would like the minister to give a very straight answer to the following tion. In the context of the industrial relations debate, is your argument that there will be wages explosion under a coalition governelected, ment, or is your argument that wages are going to be cut under a coalition government? The two propositions are, of course, inconsisnot tent. Will you please get your story straight? I ask the minister: which of those two lies you really want the Australian public to believe?",79
111,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Talk about leading with your chin! As far as the battlers of Australia are concerned, they will certainly lose under you. There is no doubt that they will be a lot worse off. Let me tell the House why they will be so much worse off.",79
112,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,79
113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left! The minister has the call. I remind you of government to standing order 55.,79
114,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No wages break-out?,79
115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition has asked his question. Just relax.,79
116,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You could not manage a chook raffle. That is the truth of the matter. us take the case of an award employee. Let us look at how much an award employee stands to lose. What we will see for an award employee about to take a new job is that it will be a case of take the contract or take the sack. If they say they want to stay under your award, what sort of an award system will it be? We have Jobsback and we have your of commitment to an awards system that involves only four miserly minima-a minimum hourly rate of pay, two weeks or 10 days nonis cumulative sick leave, four weeks annual the leave and one year unpaid parental leave. super That is what you have said. However, it is fair to say that the shadow minister for industrial relations has said that he will examine some more minima. That is very good. That will be really reassuring to the electors! That will be a great confidence boost to the workers of Australia, coming in the same week in which you said in your who advocacy of the Tweed Valley fruit pickers case that one of those four-namely, sick leave-should be traded off. So, if you are an quesaward employee, you stand to have your award gutted. That is your stated policy. We a do not know what you will do after you are because we all remember the stated policy of the Kennett government as far as awards are concerned. They said there would be any threat to awards. But, once elected, awards were immediately abolished. They are do long gone. We should look at what is happening in Western Australia at the moment as a result of the antics of Graham Kierath. If you are not under an award, if you are one of the poor individuals in that 20 per cent of the work force who change jobs each year, you will not have the option of an award. You will have a good choice: take the contract-whatever that might be-Dr take the sack. That is terrific. John Howard is on the record as saying that this is a matter that should be resolved in the marketplace. This is the law of the marketplace: not having any protections or any decent no disadvantage test, but a dummied up, phoney no disadvantage test as revealed two weeks ago by the shadow minister for industrial relations. He said he believes in a no disadvantage test but it is not a no disadvantage test against your present circumstance; it is not a no disadvantage test against your award entitlements; it is not a no disadvantage test against the totality of your package. That is what you get if you are in enterprise bargaining under the program outlined by the shadow minister for industrial relations. In other words, it is a complete confidence trick that involves a trapdoor for the conditions and wages of every Australian working man and woman. So, when the honourable member for Bennelong comes to the House today and asks whether people are going to be better off or worse off, in answer let me guarantee that the overwhelming majority of Australian workers will be infinitely worse off. But, at the same time, under the inept approach adopted by the shadow minister for industrial relations, there is bound to be a lack of any of the decent controls that the trade union movement and this government through the accord process have brought to this nation's economy over eight successive accords, down through the years since 1983. It is the accord process which has moderated wage demand and has given us the outstanding growth and the two million jobs that have been created during the life of this government. That would be absent under you. In the worse case scenario, there would be industrial mayhem and break-outs on the edges. But, for the industrially powerless, the kids leaving school, the people changing jobs and anyone going into an enterprise bargain, it would be a case of taking the contract or taking the sack-and they would be infinitely worse off. Thank you for the question. Privatisation  Minister for Finance. Is the minister aware of reports of comments made outside this place that delays in the government's privatisation program would cause investment decisions to be put on hold, employment prospects to diminish and business to continue to suffer? What is the government's response to these reports?",79
117,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They relate to the question of whether or not there ought to be some form of slowdown or related process in the government's sale of its airports threatened so recently by the Leader of the Opposition, in so far as Kingsford Smith is concerned. I was interested to find one such report amongst my files the other day. It comes from 22 June last year. It is from John Moore, the shadow minister for privatisation. On the government's privatisation, it says: Privatisationthis is of the airportsat risk through government delay. Further delays and doubts will make it increasingly difficult for the sale to realise the $2 billion the government is relying on to help it out of its budgetary problems. At the same time the interests of the aviation industry will be jeopardised, investment decisions will be put on hold, employment prospects diminished and business will continue to suffer. So said the spokesperson on privatisation matters about a year ago on the processes that the government was going through to put the sales in place. It is a pity he did not have a chat to the Leader of the Opposition when he started saying things like, 'Investment decisions will be put on hold, the aviation industry will be jeopardised, employment prospects diminished and business will continue to suffer.' One of the delightful things about being in this parliament over the last decade is for the odd time to have the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition spokespersons on privatisation stand up and say, 'Although we could not sell whilst in office the Belconnen Mall, we nevertheless consider ourselves the experts in privatisation. Isn't it a shame that you fell as have been involved in the sale of those things? How much better it would have been for all the world if we had been managing those privatisation processes, no doubt in the same way as we attempted to manage the sale of the Belconnen Mall.' Nothing could more reveal the poverty of your thinking on this, your absolute ineptitude on this, than for you to think for one minute that you could proceed with a sale in this area without selling Kingsford Smith first, the airport that would realise somewhere between 40 and 50 per cent of whatever is going to be the total amount of the sales. If you are not going to privatise a monopoly but privatise different airports around the place under different management, absolutely everybody who is interested in the privatisation process has to bid for the big banana, which happens to be Kingsford Smith. They have to do it. They do not actually have a choice on that. Their capacity, therefore, to bid for all the other airports is nil. Their capacity to realise a decent return on the other airports is nil without proceeding with Kingsford Smith first. Mr Moore-Absolute nonsense.",80
118,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The experts over there are saying that is all nonsense. Go and argue with BT. Go and argue with the airport owners of who are interested in being part of this cess. Go and argue with the funds that are getting into partnership with them. Go and argue with all those people out there you think are totally ignorant in business. Go tell them that if you are not going to privatise a monopoly but have individual ownership around the airports it is a better idea to proceed with the other airports rather than Kingsford Smith first. That is example of your crass opportunism based upon total policy ignorance. If ever there were a policy that was devised by an opposition long in opposition it happens to be this one. It shows the opposition is devoid of any comprehension of the market, devoid of any sensible notion or understanding of aviation policy, to arrive at the conclusion that it It is a product of two things. I do agree with the Minister for Transport when he says, 'This is a policy basically about one of the Liberals' marginal seats, Bennelong.' I agree that that is probably at the back of the mind of the Leader of the Opposition, but I think it is a bit more than that. This is hubris. He is a bit ahead in the polls so he thinks he can do anything. It is this sort of arrogance which has not permitted him so far to put forward any policy matter to the public for debate. He just says, 'Trust me.' But every now and then he likes to get up in this place and declare himself on something. If ever there were anything which showed, I suppose, a degree of political wisdom in you in not putting forward your policies, it is the response when you actually do do something, like come out and say, 'We ought not to privatise Kingsford Smith first; we ought to privatise all the other airlines. We ought to hold that one out' - an utterly stupid piece of policy which is getting you into more and more trouble because it does not have a single supporter anywhere. The other element of this is that it is such absolutely fatuous aviation policy. The opposition-including the Leader of the Opposition, as we have revealed time and againwas a cheerful exponent of the view that unless you had that parallel runway operating you did not have a safe operation. When it went through all the arguments about the lack of safe procedures at Sydney airport, the lack safe procedure referred to the operations on proa cross-wind runway and the north-south runway simultaneously. That is the safety issue you all discussed in 1989. That is why you said we all needed to do a parallel runand way. That was your position then. There was no other safety issue involved at Sydney airport. There was no other operational problem of any substance at Sydney airport. It was that problem-the simultaneous operations on yet another a cross-wind runway. The runway operations were considered insufficiently safe in that regard for us to put a ban on the operation of international carriers, apart from Qantas, in that cross-wind road. That operated until the creation and opening of the parallel runway. There was no has. complaint from anyone at that time for the obvious reason that common sense around the place said that was the only common sense way you could do it. Now that there is a parallel runway, you start to argue that it should be done simultaneously, knowing full well that the only sensible way you could do that-and even that would be unsafe-would be to operate off a stub and not the whole runway. It would be unsafe to operate off a stub. In operating off the stub, all you would do would be to charge another 10 jumbos an hour down the main two runways. That is a complaint for the Minister for Transport. My complaint is about the privatisation process. This is an act of pure vandalism and ignorance. It is vandalism of a sensible privatisation process. It puts absolutely in jeopardy the sale of Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and the other airports. It stone dead the timetable that Dean Brown had in place as far as Adelaide airport was concerned. We were in negotiations with Dean Brown as to how, in certain circumstances, that might be advanced. We were going through that process, but it has been killed. It puts back Badgerys Creek by at least six to 12 months. Badgerys Creek is completely dependent upon the capital being raised, effectively by the sale of that airport, to be able to get that going. If there is solution or relief to the noise levels around Kingsford Smith as far as Sydney siders are concerned, it is a substantial number of operations at Badgerys Creek. This is bad aviation policy, hopeless privatisation policy and stupid opportunism. This is a further demonstration that years in opposition have made you incapable of developing a sensible policy on critical matters that affect national politics. Wages and Salaries",81
119,Mr CHARLES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. In your last answer to a question by the Leader of the Opposition, you indicated that sick leave was an icon benefit of employment which could not under any circumstances be traded for any other benefit. Is it a fact that the Commonwealth submission last Thursday to the full bench of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission was that jury service, bereavement leave, training provisions and public holidays are not minimum conditions and that they can therefore be traded away in enterprise bargaining? Would you please tell this House if your opinion of what is a proper benefit and condition is more important than the opinion of the workers to whose benefit the benefits themselves apply?",82
120,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will allow the Minister for Industrial Relations to answer although the question did ask for an expression of opinion.,82
121,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would be happy to give the honourable member the facts of the matter. The government's position is pretty simple. We believe that non-cash entitlements such as annual leave, sick leave, long service leave, bereavement leave and family leave kills should not be cashed out. That is the government's position. Other entitlements such as overtime can be changed, but they can only be changed with the agreement of the workers. This was the case with the Sheraton agreement, where annualised salaries are paid to employees in lieu of overtime. That is the approach of this government. We believe that the non-cash entitlements I listed should not and must not be cashed out. In instances where the other entitlements, such any ultimate as overtime, penalty rates",82
122,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Public holidays.,82
123,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the honourable member for Mitchell interjects again, I will give him a public holiday.",82
124,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We say that in matters that might be included in annualised salary, for instance, the workers must be compensated so that they are no worse off than in totality against their comprehensive award entitlements. You talk about a no disadvantage test that will apply against four minima; that is, not a weekly rate of pay, not an award rate of pay but a miserly minimum hourly rate of pay, and you will not even say how much it is. You say that the only other things you will commit yourselves to-the shadow minister for industrial relations made this clear-at this stage are 12 months unpaid parental leave, four weeks annual leave and 10 days noncumulative sick leave. The last of those, as I said earlier in the House today, is already in jeopardy. You have said in your support for the Tweed Valley case that you believe it should be able to be cashed out. The fact is Labor's no disadvantage test is against the totality of the circumstances of the worker under the comprehensive award protection. The reason for this is pretty clear. We want to encourage people to go into enterprise bargaining, and we know that sending them there in the certain knowledge that they will not be worse off in total at the end of the experience is the only way to go, the Labor way to go. Let us have a look at the conservative way to go. The model of Jeffrey Kennett, Victoria-boom! Away goes the award-gone! Away goes the Industrial Commissionboom! Incomes, take the contract or take the sack-boom! Incomes, secret agreement making-we cannot even find out how many there are of these. I have asked consistently for 2Y2 years how many there are of these but it is all a secret; none of it can be revealed. Or industrial relations the Graham Kierath way-first wave and second wave. Have a look at the polls in Western Australia at the moment. It is not all the opposition's miscalculation over the Easton affair and it is not all John Howard's conspiracy with Richard Court that has seen the erosion there. Industrial relations can rightly take a good deal of the credit. It is a big albatross hanging around your neck. The fact is we believe fundamentally that the award system should and must be the benchmark for the no disadvantage test, and that is a comprehensive one, not a phoney one, as the shadow minister for industrial relations tried, in a less than honest fashion, to suggest was the equivalent of the Labor no disadvantage test against the totality of the circumstances. In the last week we have already seen the approach of the Leader of the Opposition and his shadow spokesmen graphically illustrated. For them, nothing has changed. You have always hated workers. You have always hated the worse off. You talk about battlers but, as my colleague the Leader of the House, the Deputy Prime Minister, said this afternoon, you have opposed almost every wage increase for the total time you have been in politics. You have been here far too long to change now. The electorate has seen you for far too long to think that you could ever change. It does not matter whether it is IR. It does not matter whether it is a consumption tax. It does not matter whether it is Asian immigration. They know you will never change. You will say something today which will be the exact opposite of what you said a few short years ago. You will change your tune, because you think it is in your interests for your own headland, after years of advocacy about the airport and the need to develop it. But the electorate well knows that you are not really going to change and that you are absolutely and utterly insincere. I thank the member for La Trobe for giving me this opportunity to illustrate the Labor way with a comprehensive safety net award system maintained with all the elements of it: overtime, penalty rates and leave loading. All of these things are in our benchmark award, the comprehensive award, as opposed to the sham of a no disadvantage test against four miserly conditions out of the Jobsback package-the package that you would be certain to implement if ever the Australian electorate were unfortunate to have you on the government benches. Industrial Relations: Western Australia",82
125,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations, and the minister has touched upon industrial relations Western Australian style. The minister would of course be aware that yesterday the Western Australian state government, the Court Liberal-National government, announced that the minimum weekly wage would be increased by $16 and, as a consequence, did not accept the recommendation of the Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission that the weekly minimum wage be increased by $24.30. Can the minister advise what is the government's response to this and whether the government will legislate for a single minimum wage?",83
126,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and for the opportunity it affords me to assure the House that there is no need for the federal government to legislate for a single minimum wage. There is a very good reason for that-that is, workers covered under federal awards have their wages adjusted by an independent tribunal, the tribunal that the honourable member, I and all on the government benches are so proud of. In Western Australia, under the state system, things are very different indeed. Workers on the minimum wage there are subject to the whims of one person. They are subject to the whims of Minister Kierath. He is the one person who decides on minimum wages in Western Australia. We have now seen the performance of Graham Kierath in rejecting the Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission's recommendation for an increase in the minimum wage for the worse off in the Western Australian system-the people on the very minimum. The recommendation solemnly made by the Western Australian IRC was, 'Lift the minimum wage by $24.30 per week.' It is $301.10 at the moment. The IRC said, 'Lift it by $24.30.' What does Graham Kierath do? Does he accept the decision of the independent arbiter under the system which the Leader of the Opposition went to in Western Australia and said he was so proud of, the great success story in industrial relations, less than two short months ago? No. Graham Kierath sends it off and commissions another report. He was not prepared to accept the decision of the independent arbiter-the Western Australian IRe. What does his hired help come back with? What did the people he sent off to do the job on the lowest paid, on the battlers, come back with? The hired help came back and said, 'Let's cut it. Let's take it back to $16 per week. Let's rob those worse off in Western Australia, those workers at the very bottom of the tree, of $8.30 a week.' This is the system you are so proud of. The one guarantee that you get from Mr Kierath is that you will get what he says you will get. That means that if you are a full-time adult worker your yearly wage is $16,489, like it or lump it. That is it. That is all you get. How is it that the Western Australian industrial relations system allows the minister to fix wages? It is plainly outrageous. In the context of a sophisticated Australia, with decent standards of industrial relations, who could countenance such a system? This is not a role for ministers; this is a role for independent tribunals. That is the proper way. That is the decent way. I tell you, it has always been the Labor way. But it is certainly not the opposition's way. The Western Australian IR system has been all about stripping away basic award conditions bit by bit, piece by piece, and dismantling it day after day until workers are on the bare basic minimum. That is what you are about. That is what you have always been about. People have had it illustrated for them so clearly through the antics of Graham Kierath in Western Australia today. Let me take the House to the example of Ryan, a 19-year-old general hand working in a fast food outlet. He signed a Western Australian workplace agreement because he was told, 'Sign here or you don't get the job. It is no job at all.' That is what happened under the Western Australian system. In comparison with the award, he was robbed to the tune of 28 per cent of his entitlements. That 19-year-old gets an hourly rate of $7.16 with no penalties for weekend work. They were ripped away by the conservatives. Under the appropriate award, he was entitled to $10.27. That is $3.11 per hour more. That was ripped away by Graham Kierath, ripped away by the system that you say you are so proud of and that you were over there congratulating him for. I tell you what, I have a cartful of examples like Ryan and between now and the next election we will be bringing them out every day because the people of Australia need to know what they would be faced with under you. Liberal state governments and the opposition do not believe in enterprise bargainingthat is the truth of it-not real enterprise bargaining. For them, it is still individual contracts. That is the agenda. That is what they have always believed in. It is what they did in Victoria. It is what Kierath is moving to in Western Australia. It is what all of Australia would have to put up with if you were ever elected to the government benches. The fact is that the great final safety a federal industrial relations system-the system that has had to accept 400,000 workWhen ers fleeing from the Graham Kieraths and fleeing from the Jeffrey Kennetts-would wiped out because you would close off that avenue; you would close off that safety net. This Western Australian IR system is, as I said, the system that J.W. Howard is so proud of. It is no coincidence that Jobsback's four miserly conditions are so similar to the Western Australian approach with its 10 days noncumulative sick leave, unpaid maternity leave, four weeks annual leave and that lousy minimum hourly rate of pay. I might say that the federal opposition are not even as generthrough ous as Kierath. They do not even put in a weekly wage under their approach; it is an hourly wage-I won't say how much it is. Australians know one thing for sure; that is, under the opposition they will get nothing increasedmore than Western Australian workers are getting today, and that is absolutely nothing at all. Social Justice",84
127,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask the Deputy Prime The Minister the following question justice. Is it a fact that a study released today by the Director of the University of Canberra's National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, Professor Ann Harding, has revealed that about 1.9 million, or nearly per cent of the Australian population, were living in poverty in May 1995? Is it a fact that this study revealed that, despite the infamous promise of the former Prime of Minister that no child would live in poverty by the year 1990, a massive 592,000 Australlast Ian children aged under 14 years were in poverty in May 1995, including one-third sole parent families with three or more chilreform dren? Is it also a fact that, in the same study, Professor Harding cast very serious doubt on the government's repeated claim about the positive impact of so-called social wage benefits upon poverty levels in Australia? ask the Deputy Prime Minister: after nearly 13 years of Labor government why are nearly two million, or more than one in 10, citizens of a country that the Prime Minister yesterday claimed 'has the highest per capita wealth in net of the world' still living in poverty?",85

130,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is an answer for you, sport.

134,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Prime Minister will wait for a moment. The Leader of the Opposition has asked a long question. Deputy Prime Minister is responding and about social he will be heard.,85
135,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Eighty-four per cent in real terms has been the increase across the board in the various social family benefits-a 11 massive improvement in support for them. Even though this has been a period of major reform in our financial institutions, in deregulation of business activity and in introductions enterprise bargaining, one of the things that we can look back on with real pride over the decade-unlike all the other Anglo-Saxon powers and all the other continental European of powers that went through exactly the same process-is that we have not presided over a situation in this country where the rich have got richer and the poor have got poorer. We are unique in the industrialised world in that regard. There has been a massive blowI out in the disparity in the United States, the United Kingdom and New Zealand-not so in Australia. The reason why that has not been the case in Australia is that we have put in place a social safety net which protects the people who are the poorest in our community. There have been some very interesting studies recently on that, about the adequacy of that social safety net in supporting them. 1 refer you to a study that appeared in the Weekend Australian recently which 1 thought was a very good piece of analysis and a very real credit to this government for its performance in putting that social safety net in place. The opposition decided that they would throw out, just as a bit of an idea immediately after the last budget, this view that the government had inadequately considered cuts in public spending, had relied too heavily on revenue raising and that, as far as they were concerned, they would not only pay for any particular election promises they made with cuts in public outlays but also they would take that a point further. This is a community which has the most disciplined public outlays in the industrialised world. To cut into that, you cut into the flesh and bone of the poorest people in our society. Don't stand up here expressing crocodile tears after your own performance as Treasurer. When you were Treasurer, on the Ray Martin show on TV they used to put up little topple toy models of you and invite pensioners to punch them over. People have forgotten that about you when you were in office but that is what they used to do on the Ray Martin show. The pensioners did not come to punch them over because they thought it was a fun thing to do: they had a certain view about you and the treatment of poor and ordinary people in this society and they responded accordingly. We repaired all your damage when we got into office and we put in place an affordable social security scheme and an affordable safety net to protect people in poverty in this country. Mr Costello interjecting",85

137,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,86
138,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw. 1 shouldn't be taking up the Premier of Victoria. There are no prizes for second. The Premier of Victoria is in well ahead of me and 1 agree that 1 should not have used that term. 1 withdraw it. The only contribution you have madeMr Reith-I raise a point of order. On the withdrawal, the minister knows better. When he is required to withdraw he should withdraw without qualification. The smart remarks are not appreciated.",86
139,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think he did, and he withdrew before 1 asked him. Mr BEAZLEYI thought 1 did it with great delicacy and great decency. The only appearance by the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party on anything that in any way relates to the income of our community, to the basic capacity to survive and to the basic capacity to avoid poverty, was when he attacked workers' rights-not, as he likes to convey himself, as the barrister in the Dollar Sweets case but as the boy who carried the books. That is his sole contribution to public policy in the area of poverty in this community. You have no basis and sincerity in your question. This is a government which has been careful and cautious of the needs of the poorest people in our community and we are proud of our record. Income Splitting for Families",86
140,Mr ADAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I address my question to the Minister for Social Security. Can the minister advise the House of any analysis of the effects on Australian families of income splitting for income tax purposes, and how would the impact of such proposals compare with the government's family payments scheme?",86
141,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Lyons for his question because it gives me an opportunity to respond to the specific question that he asked and also to make a few observations about these issues of inequality, poverty and social justice that the opposition suddenly finds itself terribly concerned about. The Leader of the Opposition guffaws at the reference to income splitting. Members would be aware that as recently as December 1993 the Leader of the Opposition was openly espousing income splitting as a way of assisting families. As he has had a total policy vacuum in terms of specific policies on families since then one has to presume that his advocacy of that policy over the past 16 years continues to stand. He first advocated income splitting in 1979. Oddly enough, by strange coincidence, the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling has done some work on this and in a paper presented at a conference yesterday the impact of income splitting on income distribution was carefully analysed. The results basically confirm what we know already-but they enable us to quantify itand that is the adverse and regressive impact income splitting would have on income distribution. According to the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, income splitting would cost $3.9 billion to implement in its unlimited form; it would be highly regressive in its incidence; 95 per cent of the benefits would go to the top 50 per cent of incomes; and 39 per cent of the benefits would go to the top 20 per cent. You cannot do this in a cost free way. Financing such a proposition-if you did it through adjusting marginal tax rates-would leave 1.7 million families better off; 4.2 million families, including singles, worse off; the bottom 70 per cent of income earners would be net losers; and only the top 30 per cent would be better off. Even when you try to limit the benefits to upper income earners, there is no way that the essential regressivity of this proposal can be avoided. It is a hugely expensive proposition. The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling contrasted and compared income splitting as a way of assisting families with the family payments system that this government has introduced and enormously strengthened in recent years. I wish to quote the centre's broad conclusions on this: Two major federal programs already exist to provide assistance to dependent childrenadditional family payment and basic family payment. In section 6 of this paper we examined the impact of extra assistance provided through programs and demonstrated how it can be either tightly or broadly targeted. These programs directed more assistance to families with dependent children, including sole parents, and the highest gains went to those of lower and middle income families in contrast to the outcomes of dependent child only income splitting. Those opposite belong to the party that claims to be concerned about income distribution. Every single policy that the opposition has put forward-where you can actually get to grips with it in some concrete way-is highly regressive in its incidence. Let me make one point in response to the member for Kooyong, that great champion of the oppressed. The other day he made certain claims about the bottom 10 per cent of income earners. This exemplifies the point about the significance of the social wage and social transfers. At the time when we came into office, low income working families received no additional family assistance. We have introduced a highly targeted and efficient system of family assistance so that for each child up to the age of 13 we provide $67.20 per fortnight and for each child in the 13 to 15 age group we provide $94.10 per fortnight. That income supplement is tax free. If you gross it up and convert it into its equivalent in a wage rise, it means that for a family with two children it is equivalent to a $125 per week wage rise. That is the consequence and effect of the government's family payment policies. Those enhancements have, of course, been delivered to sole parents as well as families on benefits and low income working families. They have been across the board. If you look at what has been achieved under this government for those low income families and at the relativity of the income paid to such families-whether you look at it in real terms or against any of the accepted standard poverty lines-you see that the circumstance of all low income families has unambiguously improved, and improved substantially, since the coalition was in power. There is simply no question about that. I have not seen the paper that was referred these to in the previous question but-let me make this point-I have some familiarity with Ann Harding's work. There is a variety of poverty lines in existence, constructed in accordance with different criteria. I believe, from memory, that the poverty line that Professor Harding prefers the minister was asked a question about income splitting and family payments and is now quite blatantly answering a question that was asked previously by another questioner. I ask you to rule him out of order.",86
142,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The minister is in order.,88
143,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I recall, Professor Harding's preferred poverty line is one which is set at 50 per cent of median earnings. Mr Downer interjecting",88
144,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will resume his seat. The member for Mayo constantly sits there and makes accusations against the chair. I will give him the benefit to withdraw now. Mr Downer-I withdraw.,88
145,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you take a poverty line which is set at 50 per cent of median earnings, quite clearly that is a measure of inequality. As I have said, and as has been acknowledged, there has been a trend throughout the developed world for inequalities in earned incomes to increase. Let us be clear that that is what we are talking about. Let us make an international comparison and compare inequality here with inequality in other countries. In particular, let us look inequality in countries where the opposition's preferred policy prescriptions are being carried out. I would like to give the House a bit of information on this. The recent EPAC paper, which has the latest figures, provides a table which looks at OECD countries for 1991. It shows that Australia has one of the least unequal distributions of earnings in the developed world, following the Scandinavian countries. Let us see what that means in tangible terms. It means that the lowest 10 per cent of workers-whom the opposition claims to be concerned about--earn about 70 per cent of the median wage in Australia. Compare that with the situation in the UK, where the corresponding figure is 60 per cent. That is also the case in Japan. In Canada it is 44 per cent and in the United States it is 38 per cent. So those at the bottom 10 per cent, compared to the median, are in a considerably better situation in this country than anywhere else. If you are looking at poverty measureswhich are, in essence, inequality measures because poverty is defined as being below half median incomes-there is no question that this government has improved things substantially and that the situation here is considerably more equitable than in other comparable countries. In particular, it is vastly more equitable, and unambiguously more equitable, than in countries where the opposition's preferred policy prescriptions of labour market deregulation and cuts to the social wage and social expenditures have been implemented. Wages and Salaries",88
146,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. On Meet the Press recently, you said: Blue-collar voters are unquestionably an area where we have some substantial difficulty. I don't think there is any sense in trying to gloss over that. Could the reason for blue-collar dissatisfaction with the government be that since 1983 the lowest paid workers in the community have been receiving less and less, according to EPAC, whilst the highest paid workers have increased their earnings by almost 20 per at cent? In short, are blue-collar workers dissatisfied with Labor because they know that they are substantially worse off under this so called Labor government?",88
147,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, it is because bluecollar workers have carried the brunt of major changes, both as a result of technology and the impact on society of substantially freeing it up. It is a phenomenon that is not unique to Australia. It applies throughout most of the industrialised world. Jobs which used to be in great profusion in most of our factories are now, because of technological change, much fewer in number. As a result, people who once anticipated that they were going to have a job for life and that their skill would be the skill that they would exercise for the entirety of their lives no longer feel that sense of confidence. That is a product of very substantial change in the way in which business is done and in the structure of our economy and the labour market. As I said, it is not unique to this country. A lot of that insecurity is triggered by issues like discussions on privatisation and contracts for work instead of awards. A whole range of these things goes into the views which are developed by blue-collar workers. That is an area that the government always has to have regard to in making a sensible political point about that as well as a decent social point. There is no question at all that an election campaign, when it occurs next year, is going to be an election in very many ways about who offers the greatest sense of security to the ordinary average Australian. One of the odd things about the way in which your policy is developing is that, while you think you are actually appealing to that particular group, every policy prescription that you have is like a dagger aimed straight at them. Be it like on turning the Industries Commission into a productivity council. You may well see your employers securing massively greater wage outcomes or salary outcomes for themselves; you may well see the profit share going up; but we are going to get a productivity council to come straight after you whenever you stand on your scrapers and try to get anything out of that yourselves. You may well think that you have a bit of insecurity around the place and we may make some siren song noises about that insecurity, but we are going to get stuck into you in industrial relations policies to make absolutely certain that whatever insecurity you feel is going to be massively augmented. All this debate from the opposition on what minima they are going to include is all a load of fairy floss; it doesn't matter what you say. I go simply to a quote in the Courier-Mail of Monday on John Howard-and this is what it says: In many areas, Howard believes people already know what the coalition stands for. ""One of the great advantages of my having out an industrial relations programme over such long period of time is that if I win the election, nobody can deny I have a mandate to change industrial relations,""John Howard comes out and says to the media, 'Ignore everything that I might say in the last few months.' He invites the public to look into his deeper meaning, the propositions that he has put forward over the last decade: his endorsement of the industrial relations system in Western Australia; and his invention of Jobsback before the last election. 'That,' says John Howard, the Leader of the Opposition, 'is what I claim a mandate for.' You can bet your bottom dollar that we are going to be arguing this issue amongst bluecollar voters and workers in this country from now until election day. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education",88
148,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Is the minister aware of reports of comments by the Premier of Victoria yesterday that the Commonwealth's financial commitment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education is half that of the Victorian government? In light of the minister's announcement yesterday of the expenditure of $215 million of additional assistance for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education, can the minister advise the House of the accuracy of those reported comments?",89
149,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his questions. The statements by the Premier of Victoria are totally inaccurate. As the member indicates, the announcement that I made yesterday was the response by this government to the report into indigenous education for Aboriginal people by Mandawuy Yunupingu, which was handed to the government at the end of last year and the government's response was made yesterday. It is a commitment of $215 million additional over the course of the next four years, $143 million of that coming from the Commonwealth, the remainder coming from the states, except Victoria. Every other state signed up on this package except Victoria. It is money that will go to capital improvelaid ments for teacher housing in remote areas; a improving pre-school access; it will involve parents more in supporting the education of their children; it will improve access to the boarding allowance for people under the age of 16; and it will see a massive $146 million extra put into strategic initiatives matched dollar for dollar between the Commonwealth and the states. It is not just about money either; it is about identifying measurable outcomes and monitoring achievement against those outcomes so that we can make real improvement. As I said, all states, except Victoria, signed up for that package yesterday. People might say that the problem is not as great in Victoria; in fact, the problem is worse in Victoria. In Victoria, only 22 per cent of Aboriginal kids finish year 12, which is 10 points below the national average in terms of participation. Yesterday this attack by us on the Premier got him out to a doorstop where he said that what I was asserting in terms of Victoria's obligation was rubbish, that they in fact were spending more than $6.65 million and that the Commonwealth was spending only $3 million. Let me say that when the state government of Victoria submits its applications to the Commonwealth it is required to put forward the amount it spends. In June 1994 the documentation we received suggested it would be spending only $3.45 million this year. If in fact they are spending the additional $3 million, maybe it is because they have had to find the money for the botched closing of the Northlands College or maybe it is because they have put a bit of extra money through the Koori open door education program-but it is Commonwealth money that contributes to that program as well. They are double counting the amount. But let us give them the benefit of the doubt and say that there may be $6.65 million there. That certainly was not what we were told in June 1994; it was something like half of it. The Commonwealth contribution for Victoria this year is $18 million-a huge difference, and certainly quite the reverse of what the Premier of Victoria was asserting. When he made this outrageous statement that they were spending twice as much as us, he said, in a throwaway, that I was putting forward deceitful information and that I should take some mouthwash to get rid of the lies. I must say, Mr Speaker, that maybe he was talking about mouthwash yesterday because he was more concerned about the closure of the toiletries counter at the Georges department store than he was about doing something for Aboriginal education. But, against the background of those figures, it is Jeff Kennett who needs the bottle of mouthwash. I might even make sure that he gets a little bottle of it to help him along the way. The simple fact of the matter is that no Commonwealth recurrent services have been cut to Victorian Aboriginal people. In fact, if Victoria reaffirms its commitment, they should get more. The package that we announced yesterday means that they can get more for Victoria, but only if they do what the other states do--that is, contribute. I urge them to do so, and I hope that some of those people on your side of the House who share a concern about Aboriginal education urge him to do so as well. Wages and Salaries",89

This from the party who are committed to ripping the guts out of the award system; this from the party who do not have such things in their award package as overtime rates, penalty rates, leave loadings or any other such thing; this from those who would gut the protections of Australian workers. Let me deal with someone from the first industry that was quoted by the honourable member. Let us look at someone in the building industry and what such a person stands to lose in terms of his or her current entitlements under the policies put forward by you, because it is a big reduction. I have the example of Theo. He is not a builders labourer; he is actually a tradesperson, but he works alongside a builders labourer. His skills are bricklaying and in painting. He works for a building construction company, and he has worked there for two years. Theo happens to work in Sydney.",90

He accrues a rostered day off under the award every four weeks. He is paid his award wage of $425.30 per week. Plus under his award-and we are now getting to the areas that you would take away-he is entitled to his industry allowance of $15.60 per week, his special allowance of $7.25 per weekGovernment members-Gone!",91

160,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the last six months, Theo averaged 10 hours of overtime each week made up of five hours Monday to Friday-that is, one hour per day, which is $91.85 per week-and five hours on Saturday, which is $110.25 in total. That is a pretty typical example in the building industry. So his overtime total is $202.10 per week, bringing his total package with all of his provisions to $678.55 per week. In addition, under the protections of the Labor way, the in award way, he is entitled to annual lea·ve of 28 consecutive days, which is a month or four weeks annual leave. He is entitled to an annual leave loading of 17.5 per cent. That goes onto his four weeks pay, onto his industry allowance, onto his tool allowance, onto his transport allowance and onto his special allowance under the award protections. That is worth to him $333.50 per annum. And, of course, he is also entitled to 10 days paid sick leave per annum. This is what that worker stands to lose under coalition policy. Mr Costello-Lies.",91

The shadow minister, who had some shonky ideas from the United States, was proposing to bring back Simops. He was saying that it was all going to be all right. He wanted to disregard all of that advice and go with the shonk. He was saying, as John Howard has said, that upon obtaining office the first thing he would do",91

That is 20 per cent of his weekly income, made up of $51.15 allowances and $90.20 in overtime. His $333 of annual leave loading would also go, as would all of his other award entitlements. That is what the opposition would do to leaning someone in that industry. Given the hour of the day, I will not go through the comparable examples for all those other classes of workworld ers referred to in the honourable member's question, but, believe you me, I have a page on every one of them.

170,Mr HORNE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the is no Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Is the minister aware of reportbring ed allegations by the Executive Chancellor Bond University that government schools allowing illiterate students to graduate from year 12? How valid are such allegations?",92
171,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"l thank the honourable member for Paterson for his question. I would never want to underestimate the difficulties of maintaining standards of literacy in Australia, because literacy is fundamental to all other There are, however, consistent exaggerations, from people who should know of the problems of literacy in Australia. other My favourite example-until now-was the to way in which the statement in the Crawford that 'as many as 25 per cent of children in some parts of Australia could have reading was twisted into '25 per cent of I all Australian children are illiterate'. We have and heard that from members opposite. We heard it from the member for Goldstein way back when he actually had a policy to sell. It is a that that data from the Crawford report was twisted, when the real point of the member for Forde's report was that not one state kept data on the standards of literacy in their The latest to join in this sport is Professor in Harry Messel, the winner of this year's ANZUS medal. There is no denying Messel's contributions to science. He caused a whole generation of Australians to grow up with a to the left, principally because of the weight of his textbook in their globites. That was back in the 1950s and 1960s when the was, of course, a different place; when Harry's mate Julius Sumner Miller was winning publicity for physics in Australia by demonstrating that you could put eggs into milk bottles by using the pressure of the air. According to the newspapers, Professor and Messel said last week that some students from year 12 could not even read teachers' comments on their reports. The most outrageous Messelism came when the Queensland Teachers Union described as unsubstantiated his claim that illiterate students were graduating from state schools. Mr Reith-I raise a point of order. There question that this is an important subject; no member would deny that. But I do to your attention the fact that it is now of 4.25 p.m. and the minister is turning to his are second printed page. As a measure of past practice, the average time taken for a question and answer in the 1970s was under three minutes, the average time in the 1980s was 3'12 minutes and in recent years it has been five minutes. Quite frankly, we now have on a Wednesday a sort of C grade team. They are giving us excessively long answers, which is quite unreasonable and quite unnecessary. Whilst in this case not irrelevant, the answers are clearly in breach of what has been a long standing practice and precedent in the House on length of answers. I ask you to enforce the long standing practice.",92
172,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member raises a concem that many have expressed about the length of ministers' answers. I did say something about that some time ago. I can only remind them again. The minister has been going for two minutes and 12 seconds. The minister is in order.,93
173,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think rather less than the length that point of order took. Messel's response to the Queensland Teachers Union was simply to say, 'I don't have to substantiate the obvious,' instead of explaining exactly what measure of literacy he uses or how he has compared the literacy standards of children from government schools against those from non-government schools. Although the member for Forde made her comments about the lack of data back in 1992, the states and the territories still do provide data on literacy standards on a national basis. While we are having fruitful and useful discussions with the states and while we have provided funds for a national survey, there are as yet no national data. I am looking forward very soon to presenting a report on literacy teaching from the Australian Language and Literacy Council. I understand that one of the points it will make is that the evidence available on literacy in schools, such as the basic skills test in New South Wales primary schools, shows that standards are high. Perhaps what this episode shows is that Professor Messel has lost none of the tricks of publicity that were among some of his greatest contributions to science in Australia. I am not suggesting that publicising science is a contribution to be sneered at; what I am suggesting is that he is deploying those skills now to distract attention from the difficult situation he finds himself in at Bond University. Logging and Woodchipping",93
174,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. Why was no socio-economic analysis carried out in the preparation of the government's draft deferred forest areas announced this week? Does the minister agree that in the interests of a proper and balanced development of the DFAs the proposal should have been subject to detailed analysis on socio-economic as well as environmental grounds? Will he guarantee that no area will be closed that might have an adverse effect on industry and jobs without a socio-economic study being undertaken and adequate compensation arrangements agreed?,93
175,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"All issues are being thoroughly canvassed with all the stakeholders associated with the forest issues. They are all engaged in the processes of discussion on what areas might be logged and the terms and conditions under which they might be logged. We are hopeful-maybe that is a triumph of hope over experience-that we will be able to get an adequate outcome as far as all stakeholders are concerned at the end of the day. From most states we have had reasonable cooperation-not from my home state but from most states--on it. We will be taking all not those sorts of issues into account when we take our final decisions, but you will have to wait to see what those decisions are as they emerge. Mr Anderson- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. The question was why was no socio-economic analysis carried out in preparation of the process.",93
176,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. I believe the minister has concluded his answer. Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research,93
177,Mr NEWELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs. Can the minister explain why as a producer of agricultural goods Australia will spend $39.6 million this year through our aid program on the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. On the face of it we are helping farmers overseas to compete against our own farmers. Minister, what is the point of that?",93
178,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The work of ACIAR, the Australian Centre for International Agricultuexample, ral Research, is a little known but very effecaged tive part of Australia's aid program. The of its work is to improve the well-being people in developing countries and in Australia through international collaboration in research and related activities directed at development of sustainable agricultural systems and appropriate natural resource management strategies. I agree with the member for Richmond; we have allocated $320,000. $39.6 million to ACIAR this year, but annual benefit of ACIAR's projects has been estimated by independent economic analysis to be 30 times that amount. Mr Tim Fischer-It is for Australians.",94
179,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Much of that benefit goes to Australian farmers-quite right, as the Leader of the National Party interjects. I agree with him. Very much of it, for example, goes to wheat farmers as a result of the work that has been done on developing new wheat varieties. That is just one example. The real benefits of that have the potential to be even greater. It is not an exaggeration to say that the world's most serious problem over the next century will be feeding itself and maintaining that food supply in a sustaincentury. able way forever. Let me give just three examples of the kind of work which ACIAR does to demonstrate the benefit to developing countries, Australia and the world. The first-I know this is of interest to honourable member in his electorate-is the bee mite control project in Papua New Guinea and Irian Jaya. This ACIAR project, in collandowners laboration with the CSIRO Division of Entoto mology and the Papua New Guinea and Irian Jaya authorities, has come up with a strategy for eradicating the Asian bee mite from European honey bees on the whole island of New Guinea. As many people will know, the European operations. honey bee is the most effective producer of honey. But, in Papua New Guinea, the Europlace pean bee mite has destroyed that bee, and it is spreading. Where is it spreading to? Natuout rally, across the Torres Strait. There is a real danger that this mite could get into Australia, as far as the electorate of Richmond, for and devastate our honey and packbee colony export industries. What does aim that mean in real money? It means $160 of million per annum in honey production and $6 million per year in bee exports but, above all that, the devastation of crops which dethe pend on bees for pollination. The annual production of those crops is worth over $1 billion per year to Australia. What is this whole project costing? A mere It is now into the eradication phase. the Its success will preserve the PNG honey industry, make possible the resurrection of the industry in Irian J aya and remove the threat to the Australian industry. It is not a bad example--one of the very few-where the PNG and Irian Jaya authorities have worked together on this important project. There is a second example of small strategically placed expenditure having an enormous effect. Another $300,000 will be granted for the swap of citrus root stocks between Australia and China. Many citrus species are native to China. Under this scheme, 30 Australian lines were introduced into China and 77 were brought into Australia. That is one of the biggest influxes of citrus genetic material in the Western world since early this It will enable Australian and Chinese quick citrus growers to keep ahead of fungus, viruses and other diseases that attack the citrus industry of all countries. A final, and very quick, example is an the ACIAR project involving the University of New South Wales and Vanuatu. It has shown that it is more economically beneficial to to conserve their rainforests than sell them to logging interests. As a result, in May this year the Vanuatu forest authorities signed a lease agreement with local landowners to create Vanuatu's first nature protection reserve. That will protect a rare and valuable stand of Kauri trees from logging I conclude by inviting members in this to make sure that, whenever they are travelling in Australia or overseas, they find from lPy office what ACIAR projects they could see. I know it is an area that has very great bipartisan support. I know that the Leader of the National Party is always interested. His predecessor but three in Doug Anthony has been a very interested participant in ACIAR. Very valuable and interesting work is being done under ACIAR's auspices. It is something of which we should be proud and something from which we and the rest of the world benefit.",94

Of course, who could forget the last election campaign, when the lie was that they would not introduce a GST. But we are now paying more taxes than we would be paying if we had introduced a on GST. Furthermore, the great l-i-e on that occasion was that you would get tax cuts from the Labor Party that were legislated for. As everybody remembers, those tax cuts never materialised. What surprises me this time is that the latest lie is not a lie of the quality that we have had in the past from these people. This really is a pathetic, crude, miserable, unimaginative, base, mean, dull, boring, cretinous, low-level lie, and no-one is going to believe it. The amazing thing is that these people on on the other side actually think that someone out there, except perhaps the truly deluded, is actually going to believe this lie. It contains the incredible arrogance that they could utter such a blatant lie and think they can actually get away with it. It is also a statement of Labor's desperation about the next campaign. As their basic lie about industrial relations is not getting through, today they have resorted to the ultimate lie, and they are being forced to pay for it with a set of advertisements around the country. What it shows is exactly what we predicted: as we go into the next election campaign, the Labor Party have nothing to run on. They have no record that is worth talking about. They have no plan for the future, no vision and no agenda to deal with Australia's problems. Therefore, they are left with only one thing: a scare campaign against the coalition. I thought it would be sensible to briefly look at an advertisement. In fact, they are very hard to find because there is only one of them. The honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) was doing an interview today and he could not actually find it in the paper when someone referred him to it. I spoke with him on a radio program this morning. I hit him with the simple question, 'Barry, if I give you a guarantee now that under the award system you will lo-e no conditions, does that not make your advertisement a lie?' The tone of his voice indicated that even Barry knows it is a lie. Of course it is a lie. We have never seen so many lies fitted on one piece of paper. I counted 14. I should send it around to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). She could tell me how many lies per word there are. Let me just run through the basic lies. It says in the middle of the advertisement: Under John Howard working conditions will be if your employer chooses. There are actually two lies there. The first one is their favourite one, which is that you are going to be worse off and that your conditions are going to be reduced. That is lie No. 1. Lie No. 2 is the part that says 'if your employer chooses'. That is a really nasty little lie. They are saying that, with the changes we make, employers will unilaterally manipulate and exploit people. This is a real scare campaign that would frighten the daylights out of anybody. It is a lie, because our policy is very simple. If you are under an award, you can stay there. Obviously, you cannot lose anything just because your employer chooses. If you are under an award, that is a matter for the umpire. Our second policy position is that if you want to go to an agreement you can agree with your employer. In other words, it is just wrong to say that this would be a choice of your employer. No-one is suggesting a system of unilateralism where one party can dictate to the other. It is a complete nonsense, an absolute and outright lie. Once these guys get into the groove, the lies just flow one after the other. The next lie is 'overtime rates of pay will be optional'. That is just a plain lie. If you are under the award and you have overtime, you keep it. It is as simple as that. If anything else happens it is because you agree and you agreed to go to an agreement. The implication is that agreements are rotten. In fact, their policy is to support people entering into agreements. The minister himself got up today and said, 'If you want to, you can trade away various benefits and get a cash increase instead.' He actually said that it was not a bad idea if you wanted to do it. That is our policy. Your policy is not working. Our policy is to make it work. It is an absolute lie to say that overtime rates of pay will be optional. The next lie, No.4, is 'penalty rates for working nights and weekends will disappear'. It is a complete lie. It is a complete, blatant and absolute lie. We have already given the guarantee: if you are under the award system lost and you like it, you can stay there. It is as simple as that. There is no more to it than that. This is a blatant lie. Blatant lie No. 5 is that holiday leave loadings will be a thing of the past. That is just pathetic. Singo is off his brekkie or something. He has never run a lie as blatant and pathetic as that.",95
185,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No, Keating wrote the ad.",96
186,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Who did write the ad? Opposition members-Laurie.,96
187,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Laurie might have, and I thank members for their interjection. He had his list of scenarios. Theo appeared at question time today. It is interesting that the minister said the ad was prepared by the department, because it was Bill Kelty who was putting it out 10 days ago. Maybe an explanation for this is that it is just a rotten week because bureaucrats are not good at lying. No.6 is that John Howard has endorsed the Western Australian Liberal legislation. He has not. Yes, of course we have said that we think we could have better workplaces so people could have higher pay if we made it easier for people to enter into agreements. We have said that. So what? It is a sensible thing to say. The government even says that about the federal legislation. The implication and the lie in this is that we are going to take Western Australia's policy and make it the coalition's policy. When you think of it, Minister, obviously it is a lie because we are not going to do it. I can tell you now that we are just not going to. They say those words are going to be in some contract but they will not be. It is not in our policy. Let me demonstrate what a silly proposition it is. Under our constitution we have responsibility for certain aspects of industrial relations and the states have responsibility for others. Even if I liked everything they did in Queensland, I could not just transport it to the federal system anyway. It is just a nonsense to say we are going to have Western Australia's policy up here, that we are going to have Victoria's policy up here or that we are going to have the New South Wales policy up here. The fact is we are not going to have any of them holus bolus-none of them. It is just a complete nonsense, a stupid statement to make. It is a silly, pathetic little lie: Furthermore, if you look at the Western Australian legislation, the minister was referring to a minimum rate. We are not having a minimum rate like Western Australia, nothing like it. We have said that, if you go into an agreement, we are going to make sure there are certain minimum conditions. We are going to do that because, let us face it, some employers will do the wrong thing if given half a chance. We are not going to give them half a chance. Of course we are going to have a set of reasonable and fair minima. But the minimum rate of pay is going to be determined by the award hourly rate of pay. So to suggest that we are going to have a minimum wage like the government in Western Australia is just a complete nonsense. Lie No.7-John Howard wants to transport working Australians back 100 years. I tell you what: not only is that a lie but if you went back 100 years do you know who you would meet? You would meet Paul Keating in a Lancashire cotton mill. He would be the union delegate and Jennie George would be his helper. Things would be a hell of a lot worse off under them. Lie No.8-strikes will increase. This is another favourite little lie of the Labor Party. Let us face it: there are fewer strikes today than there were 12 years ago. But that is not the issue. The issue is how we are doing compared to all the people we have to compete with. When you look at the way in which we are doing things-the number of strikes, bans, limitations and everything else we have here-the fact is we are not doing well at all. That is just one of the many things which contribute to the fact that we keep running up these massive debts. Our debt for this country is now $180 billion. So this issue is a complete lie. Lie No.9-inflation will go up. They really are tongue-tied on this one. In one breath they say wages will be cut; in the next breath they say that we are going to have a wages explosion. Back in June and again on 20 September, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said in the House: The first thing, though, the coalition will do is scrap the accord. The next thing that will happen is you will get sporadic wage break-outs. Wage break-outs-shock, horror! Then just one day later he said: This is the policy of the opposition-to cut the wages of working Australians. What a pleasure it was to see poor old confused 'Laurie of lies', the minister, today answer that question. He was asked which one was true. One of them has to be untrue. One of them has to be a lie. He did not have the vaguest idea. Laurie is not so good when he gets off the basic lines. Lie No. 10 was that only interest rates will be available to stop it-that is, inflation. It very interesting when you think about that one. This actually portrays Labor's attitude to economic management. Of course, it is an obvious lie. The truth of the matter is that interest rates under us will always be lower than they are under the Labor Party because we have a properly integrated economic package. The other interesting thing about this is that if there was an inflationary situation-and it is relevant because we do actually have some inflationary pressures under their existing wages system-their immediate mental response is that the only way to fix it is with interest rates. That is how they fixed it when we went into the 1990 recession. They still have not learnt the very basics of good economic management. Lie No. II-jobs will be at risk. I do find this a classic. One of the reasons we want to change the system is that not enough people in this country today have the chance of a job. It is a bit rich for you blokes to be saying that jobs will be at risk under us when you have given Australia the worse unemployment record since the Great Depression. What I find particularly irksome about your policy is that so many young people cannot get a job. I will never forget what Ted Evans, the Secretary to the Treasury, your chief adviser on how to run the economy, said. He said that the level of unemployment in Australia is a matter of choice. The truth is that you people choose to keep a lot of our young people unemployed. It is an absolute lie to say that jobs will be at risk under us. One of the reasons we are prepared to take you on in relation to this issue is that if we had a better system a lot more people would have a job. That brings me to lie No. I2-that John Howard wants to radically change Australia's employment arrangements. We certainly do want to make some important changes to Australia and the way in which it has been run. But the idea of a radical change is really said in this advertisement to try to frighten people. We are actually proposing that if you are under the award system you can stay there, but if you want to go to an agreement is we want to make that easier. You say that our policy is really a radical one, as if that were to frighten people. Actually, our policy is just a common sense policy which says that, when you go to an agreement, we are going to make it easier to do so. If we can tailor agreements to suit the circumstances of our business, that is going to be good for everybody. Minister, your colleagues do not really deny that basic proposition. In fact, there are lots of statements on the public record where you agree with that proposition. But we all know you cannot implement a decent system because ultimately it puts in jeopardy the jobs of people like Bill Kelty and the trade union bosses who want to have a say in running every business. The fact is that that system does not work, which brings me to my penultimate point. The sensitivity on the government's part, and the reason they run these lies, is that the one thing they do not want people to know is that, under the system they have been running and they want in the future, in fact people's real wages have declined. That is the truth. There is no argument about it. These are official statistics. The truth of the matter is people's wages have actually fallen. People who are in the low income bracket have been affected the most. These people opposite claim compassion but their policies have in fact reduced the incomes of the Australian families they claim to represent. It is the ultimate hypocrisy in AustralLn politics. It is one reason why this is such an important issue. They will run all their lies, their silly scare campaign. We have a simple policy-a policy for higher wages. (Time expired)",97
188,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Higgins (Mr Costello) tried to paint himself as the battlers' friend. What we now have is the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) trying to paint himself as the workers' friend. It is a bit rich when the member for Flinders gets up in this House and starts attacking the government for running scare campaigns, because when it comes to scare campaigns his record is second to none. Members only need to go back to the 1988 referendum campaign to see the sort of scare campaign that the member for Flinders ran. It would have made Goebbels blush. It is a bit rich for him to come into this House and start attacking the government in that regard because, frankly, he is the great architect of scare campaigns. To complete the triumvirate, it is not what the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), says that worries me or worries the workers; it is what he is think- household. ing and what he will not say that is the real worry. The history of the election of conservative governments in recent times in this country-that is, in Victoria, Western Australia and that short-lived conservative government in New South Wales-proves that it was not what they were saying in the lead-up to those campaigns that the electorate had to worry about; it was what they actually did once they got in that they had to worry about. The opposition is offering a policy free zone. None of this array of shadow ministers has substance. Nothing is further from the truth than the fact that the honourable member for Flinders is not lacking in substance. is a policy free zone. Mr Barry Jones-Policy anorexia.",98
189,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is policy anorexia, as my friend the honourable member for Lalor says. The interesting thing is that they come into this House with a matter of public importance and even that is a furphy. A cursory examination of the statistics shows that it is a furphy. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) answered this in a question without notice on 22 August 1995. The statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that the full-time adult average weekly earnings actually increased by 7.2 per cent between June 1983 and June 1995. That is the real figure measured by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Even that figure understates the real increase in the welfare of workers. In addition to the increase in real wages, half the work force have superannuation entitlements that they previously did not have. Where did they come from? They came from a Labor government. The superannuation entitlements amount to an additional five per cent to six per cent being payable to workers as of today. That figure will be nine per cent by the year 2002. Another figure shows that real household disposable income per capita has actually increased by around 20 per cent under Labor. Real household disposable income has increased by 41.8 per cent under Labor. When expressed in current dollars, that equates to a real increase of $3,500 per I went and looked at my first speech in this House, which was just over five years ago, because I wanted to see whether anything had changed in relation to the opposition from that time. Nothing has changed. In my first speech, on 11 September 1990, I stated: The Opposition's record on industrial relations is pathetic. That was true then and it is true now. I went on: Its approach to industrial relations belongs in the Dark Ages. Confrontation rather than consultation is its strategy. It has no respect for the working It men and women of Australia and has opposed every initiative designed to benefit those in the workplace. Through the dark years of the Fraser Government our opponents argued that workers' wages should not be indexed to offset the increased cost of living. Time after time at national wage case hearings the Fraser Government submitted that workers should not receive any increases. As inflation continued to soar, real wages kept diminishing. That was their record. What was their record on unemployment? In December 1975 unemployment was 209,000. By the time they lost office in March 1983 it had risen to 625,000. What they left us with was double digit inflation, double digit unemployment and a reduction in real wages. Today an ACTO congress is being held in Melbourne. According to the AAP, the outgoing ACTO President, Martin Ferguson, saidand I think it is worth putting on the record: . .. Opposition Leader John Howard and Industrial Relations spokesman Peter Reith were making a last-ditch attack on the whole system of awards. He said their purpose was clear, stark and deliberate: to drive unions from the workplace and drive wages down. That is the opposition's approach to industrial relations. It goes on: Mr Ferguson said the conservative attack had come at a time when the number of industrial disputes was at an all-time lowthe member for Flinders conceded that in his speechand company profits were at an all-time high. Unions and employers were more cooperative and enterprise bargaining had been embraced. That is what we have achieved in partnership with the union movement in the last 121f2 years. Why is the opposition making this an issue? It is poll driven. Their pollsters tell them that the blue-collar vote is a bit soft for Labor and that the battlers are a little bit worried about the Labor government's performance at the moment. So we have wolves in sheep's clothing running a scare campaign in an attempt to pick up the battlers' vote and blue-collar vote. That is what this is all about. We used to see the member for Higgins everywhere. The member for Mayo (Mr Downer) and the member of Higgins were the dream team. One member hit the fence quickly. It only took 24 hours for him to be exposed to the public. His dream run lasted that long. Where is the member for Higgins now? He is the invisible man. He has gone missing. Why? The research of the pollsters for the Liberal Party shows that the member for Higgins, the battlers' friend, is not going too well in the community so he has taken a bit of a walk. For the member for Flinders to come in here and pretend to be the workers' friend is absolute hypocrisy. What we need from the opposition is a policy then we can have a real debate. There is no policy because it is a policy free zone. The opposition is attempting to slide through to the next election. It will not work because the Australian electorate is more sophisticated than that and the polls are starting to tum around. It is worth summarising what the accord has achieved for the Australian industrial relations scene, because the accord is the shining light that we as a Labor government can hold up not only to the Australian community but to the rest of the world. The conservative way of doing things is the way Jeff Kennett does it, the way Richard Court did it and the way John Fahey-remember him?-the ex-Premier of New South Wales did it. The New South Wales electorate did not forget him because before he was Premier-and bear in mind he was never elected into that position; he was appointed-he was the Minister for Industrial Relations. When it came to election time the workers in New South Wales did not forget him. This is what the accord has achieved for Australia. It has reduced industrial disputes to record low levels. In 1994, the lowest number of industrial disputes for a calendar year since 1940 was recorded. It has given workers and their families a better deal through lower taxes-and let us remember that-Medicare, family assistance measures and increased spending on child care, education and public housing. The accord has given Australian workers access to superannuation for the first time. It has increased household disposable income by 40 per cent since 1983, locked in low inflation and created almost two million new jobs between April 1993 and May 1995. Through the accord there has been a safer and fairer working environment, including better pay for women, and there have been measures to assist with family responsibilities. It has introduced a system of workplace bargaining, which is fair to workers and which allows companies to become internationally competitive. Is it any wonder that John Prescott, one of the captains of industry, is out there praising the achievements of this Labor governmentand that was within the last 48 hours. The accord has also made certain that all Australian workers have access to basic minimum entitlements in relation to minimum wages, parental leave, equal pay for work of equal value-a Labor government initiative-minimum redundancy standards and protection against unfair dismissal. The opposition way is a return to the Dark Ages-survival of the fittest. How would women go under that system? How would the disadvantaged in the community go under that system? How would migrants go under that system? The opposition's industrial relations package is simple. It can be summarised in one phrase: take the contract or take the sack. That is the opposition's industrial relations policy with no alternative and no protection in terms of an award. Their record speaks for itself. You do not have to go back 12V2 years to what the Liberals were saying then; you only have to look at recent history. Before John Howard was Leader of the Opposition he was shadow minister for industrial relations. Who prepared Jobsback? John Howard. His fingerprints are all over it. So it is a bit hypocritical for the opposition to be lining up now as the workers' friend, as the battlers' friend, in attempt to win the blue-collar vote. As I move around the electorate, what is obvious to me-and it is the message that I am getting back-is that the electorate have not embraced John Howard. They do not want confrontation; they do not want division; they do not want bosses standing over the workers and forcing them into pay cuts or the sackand that is the alternative under the opposition. It is hypocritical for the opposition to be coming into this place with the biggest furphy of all when they say that there has been a decline in real wages. All statistics on the social wage and other benefits that have been introduced as a result of the accord need to be taken into consideration. Instead, what the opposition are doing is adding full-time employment and part-time employment and comparing apples with oranges. So we need to nail that lie. The statistics that the opposition are using relate to a high number of part-time workers. (Time expired)",99
190,Mr VAILE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is always interesting to follow the member for Banks (Mr Melham). He was fairly correct in a couple of assertions that he made this afternoon that a lot of what is going on at the moment in this place is poll driven. It is poll driven as far as the Labor Party is concerned because they realise-and Mick Young has told them-that their blue-collar workers at their core base have taken a walk. That is what the truck load and the litany of lies that they have been trotting around this week is all about. They are trying to get those blue-collar workers back into the fold. It is about trying to frighten them back into the fold-not to attract them back with positive talk but to try to frighten them back-because that is the way the Labor Party and the ACTU operate. That is the tribal way they have operated over the years. They scare the living daylights out of people for what they might lose. The matter of public importance this afternoon is about the fact that there has been a decline in real wages of Australian workers under Labor. What has Labor done for Australian workers over the past 12 years and over the past eight accords? They have achieved lower real average weekly incomes. their They have seen the top 10 per cent of the working force getting richer whilst the bottom 10 per cent are getting poorer. The gap has broadened to something like $26,000 a year. Total average weekly earnings have fallen by 0.8 per cent since 1983. Employment conditions have decreased and real wages for women have declined. Today we heard that, in a study that has just been released, 11 per cent of the population is living in poverty and 590,000 children under 14 years of age are living in poverty. That is what has been achieved under Labor. What does Labor try to do? I was really surprised to see an ad in one of the Melbourne newspapers today, signed off by the President of the Australian Labor Party, the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), for whom I have a reasonable amount of respect. I did not think that he would put his name to a litany of lies that were printed in a newspaper that goes across Australia. Over the last couple of weeks, we have seen the Labor Party resorting to these tactics because they are not able to get their message across. People have switched off. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) stands here for two days a week and he spends the rest of his time trotting around Australia trying to get his message across. But, as soon as people turn their radios on and they hear the Prime Minister on there trying to get the message across from the Labor government, they switch their radios off. That is why the Labor Party has got to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars of their members' money in putting paid advertisements in the newspapers in Australia today to try to get the message across. It is a deceitful message. It is probably not Labor Party members' money; it is probably money coming from the unions. We know how closely tied the unions are to the Australian Labor Party. We heard in a debate only a couple of weeks ago in this place the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) refer to the ALP as the 'political wing of the ACTU' and that she is proud to be a member of the political wing of the ACTU. It is an absolute disgrace that, in the workplace in Australia today, working men and women are forced into paying membership dues, but they have no choice where that money ends up. It ends up with the Labor Party when it comes to campaign time in this country. The ACTU and the unions in Australia pour an absolute fortune into the coffers of the ALP to get their mates re-elected. The working men and women in Australia have no say in how their membership dues are spent, whether they support the ALP or not. That in itself is an absolute disgrace. The other disgrace is that which has been perpetrated on the people in Australia by the Labor Party this week. They have got this fixation about opposition type negative campaigning. That is all they are capable of. They have all become Swanites or Smithites. The modem-day campaign, as far as this negative campaigning is concerned, is all about frightening average men and women in Australia with a truck load, a litany, of lies. The ad that appeared in the newspaper this morning was just unbelievable. As I said before, it was incredible to see the signature of the member for Lalor on the bottom of that particular truck load of lies. Let us look at one of the things that were said in that ad: 'John Howard wants to radically change Australia's employment arrangements'. The coalition wants Australians to get higher pay. The way to do this is to achieve higher productivity. That is something the Labor Party has not been able to achieve in 12V2 years in power. They have not been able to achieve higher real wages through higher productivity. Why? Because they are legroped to the ACTU and the Accord. It is interesting that this has been recognised by one of their own-not a Liberal Party or a National Party apologist, but a card-carrying member of the Labor Party. Do you remember Jenny Mikakos-the former ALP candidate for Batman who made comments about Martin Ferguson? Martin Ferguson is the messiah of the left wing of the Labor Party. We have just heard the honourable member for Banks venerating and dribbling over what a great job Martin Ferguson has done. Jenny Mikakos does not agree. She said this of Martin Ferguson-and this quote could well apply to the entire ALP/ACTU movement: During his leadership, real wages and conditions of employment have been loweredunder the leadership of the leader of the ACTU, until today; we presume he is going to sit in this place after the next federal election as the member for Batmanespecially for women, union coverage of the labour force has dropped . . . Is this the record of someone fighting for the ""battlers""? We know in this place that it is not. All those people that used to support the Labor Party know it is not. Those people who have taken a walk know it is not. I am sure Jenny is being paid off somehow by the ALP for dropping out of the preselection race, as was the brother of the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous)-Theo Theophanous. I just hope that wherever she re-emerges within ALP ranks she remains as honest about her colleagues as she has been on this occasion. I will repeat what she said. It deserves to go into Hansard as many times as possible: During his leadership-that is, the leadership of Martin Ferguson, the leader of the ACTUreal wages and conditions of employment have been lowered ... That is what we are debating today-the fact that in Australia real wages have been reduced. That was also evidenced in a report that was mentioned in this place last week. Earlier this year EPAC produced new statistics on earnings at the behest of the Prime Minister. These showed that in 1994 the lowest paid earners earned less in real terms than in 1983. In fact, they earned more in 1983 than in any of the Hawke-Keating years, bar one. Over the same period the earnings of the highest paid workers increased by almost 20 per cent. This is under the rule of a government that is supposed to represent the interests of working Australians. Of the 12 countries compared in the OECD report from which the EPAC statistics were drawn, only three countries experienced a real fall in the wages of the bottom 10 per cent of workers-Australia, Canada and the USA. There it is. Under the leadership of the Labor Party, in close consultation with the ACTU, the wages of workers in Australia in real terms have been reduced. This is why they are running all these Labor lies. We are going to get so much more of it. They are going to have to pay for it. The only way they will get this message across is if they continue to pay for it. If send the Prime Minister out or if they send Dangerman out-the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton)-nobody listens. They are switching off. They are sick of listening to the lies that the Prime Minister has perpetrated on the Australian people over the last 12 years, particularly since the 1993 election. They lie when they say that there has been a 40 per cent increase in household income since 1983 and they repeat the lie even after the Prime Minister has been forced to repudiate that figure. But even then he continues to bandy it about. They lie when they say that we are going to do away with safety net wage increases. They lie when they say that we are going to force everyone onto contracts. They lie when they say the lower paid are better off under the Accord when, in fact, the lower paid are worse off. I finish where I started, and that is by asking what the Labor Party/ACTU has done for Australian workers over the past 12 years and over the past eight accords. They have achieved lower real average weekly incomes. They have seen the top 10 per cent getting richer and the bottom 10 per cent getting poorer. They have seen total average weekly earnings fall by 0.8 per cent. (Time expired)",101
191,Mr MARTYN EVANS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"When I saw the subject of today's matter of public importance in the paper before us in the House this afternoon, I read it with some degree of incredulity. Why should that be the case? For the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) to come into this House and present a proposition which he would expect members of this place, informed as they are not only about the current state of the economy but also about the history of this country, to accept-that it is the Liberal Party of Australia which will come forth at the next election and offer policies that will benefit the incomes of the wage earners of Australiawould cause anyone in this place to approach the question with considerable incredulity. I have been in politics long enough to have seen what has happened in this country in recent years and to know the difference, in government, between the two major political they parties. I was around during the years of the Fraser-Howard governments and I have been around during the years of the Hawke-Keating governments. I have seen the difference in approach between those two governments. I know what the facts of this debate are. Any debate which revolves around statistics, as this debate does, inherently will throw up a number of conflicting areas. The honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), my colleague in this debate, has correctly drawn the attention of the House to the fact that the statistic which the honourable member for Flinders and his colleagues have principally relied on is not the appropriate statistic to use in this context. It is quite clear that average weekly earnings, taken in full-time earnings, have increased by some 7.2 per cent between June 1983 and the current date. That very much puts to rest any kind of argument about real wages under this government. When you look at a whole range of these topics, you have to examine not only that single, very blank and very clear statistic but also the history of the political parties in this debate. I know that when the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) left office as Treasurer, he left this country in quite a state. He left the industrial relations policy tion of total failure. There was a wages explosion in 1981-82 which meant an 18 per cent increase in wages in the 12 months to September of that year. That meant there was a level of wage rises which was completely unsustainable. In real terms, there were big increases in inflation. By the time the Labor Party came into government we had double digit inflation and double digit unemployment. Indeed at that point, when Treasurer Howard left office, we had something like 10 or 11 per cent unemployment and about the same level of inflation. Those statistics are quite horrifying to anyone looking at the working conditions of ordinary Australians and contemplating that we might return to anything like those condiwas tions. Over the last eight years the Accord delivered a remarkable change in the way in which Australians perceive industrial relations and the way in which their working condito tions have been improved. Of course, their household disposable income has risen drarecords matically during that period. Those are the things which matter to ordinary Australians who will be voting in this election. In addition, there have been dramatic falls in the level of industrial disputation. This serious consequences for things like producafternoon, tivity in this country. Contrary to some of arguments which have been put forward afternoon, hourly labour productivity in the 12 years between June 1983 and June 1995 has increased by nearly 25 per cent. Labour productivity per person employed has in which creased by nearly 35 per cent and real unit labour costs have declined by 5.4 per cent because of the substantial increases in producand, tivity-notwithstanding the fact that there have been real increases in wages. The honourable member for Flinders, as he concluded his earlier discursion this afternoon, seemed to imply that issues such as the were going to be. dramatic fall in the industrial disputes statistics-he did concede that they are very signifithat? cant-can be dismissed on the basis that they do not matter because, if you compare Ausa tralia with other countries, you see that we not doing so well. I am very happy to match the record of this government with those of in a condi- many of our OECD partners. The honourable member's argument does not hold up. The citizens of this country will look not so much at what other countries are doing-although those statistics are important-but at what we are doing now in terms of job growth. We are doing at least as well as our OECD neighbours are in terms of inflation and we are doing much better in terms of growth. I think we are second onlyand this is twice in a row-to the United States. Those statistics are very impressive and they are very real, but it is a fallacious argument to say that therefore the policies and the record of the opposition do not matter. People can think back 12 years to what this country like when John Howard was Treasurer. has They will remember those years very clearly if they were in the electorate and certainly if they were in the work force. People will want compare not only the record of this country with its comparable OECD neighbours but the of the two alternative governments which came before them: the government led by the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), with a proven and clear record which can be demonstrated by those figures has that my colleague and I have given this and the very clear and unmistakthe able record of John Howard during his quite this substantial period as Treasurer. That was no one-term government in the Fraser years; it was a long, sustained period of Liberal government. It was a period in they enjoyed substantial support in both chambers of this parliament. They could have achieved any policy change they wanted indeed, many radical policy reforms were adopted during that period. I will say one thing about that period, apart from its obvious failures: at least they were honest in coming out up-front and declaring what their policies Who was the late Liberal leader who did The late John Hewson-late at least in his political career; I am sure he is enjoying productive career in outside employment. In are this place he was a failure, but he was a failure not because he declared his policies but because of those policies. The current Leader of the Opposition was obviously very close to this process. He was sitting back in the wings and observing it very astutely and he realised this classic mistake of oppositions that John Hewson had made: he had declared his policies too soon. There was no way that John Howard was going to make that mistake. In listening to the honourable member for Flinders this afternoon I almost came to believe that there was a Liberal policy in this area out there and declared in full glorious detail. But really, after a few seconds, I shook myself awake and realised that that is far from· the truth. Although the member for Flinders may talk as though there is a detailed Liberal policy on industrial relations and talk of detailed cies as though they really exist, I am afraid that those policies, if they exist at all, only exist in the minds of him and his leader. They are certainly not on the record in this place. They are certainly not on the record in the media and newspapers of this country. The public in this country is still asking where those policies are. I do not want to spend all my time on the negatives of the opposition's current situation. I am sure we will be able to do that in much more detail when those policies are before us. I think it is vital to tum now to the facts of the situation, because there are so many statistics out there that I am sure the public will want to hear just a few more of the accurate ones. Over the last 12 years of this government we have seen real adult full-time wages rise significantly. We have seen inflation fall dramatically. We have seen productivity rise but unit labour costs decline because of that and, therefore, profit levels return to historic highs. We have seen household disposable income rise dramatically. We have seen unprecedented job growth in this country. We have seen GDP growth continue to rise year after year to the point where we now have nearly four years of uninterrupted GDP growth, giving the lie to the five minutes of economic sunshine line. Those things have been very substantial and they have been accompanied by very substantial social wage conditions. That is where the jealousy of the opposition comes in. The opposition has been unable to deliver that Accord with the union movement, as it knows it will be unable to deliver it should it ever be in government. The opposition acknowledges through its jealousy in relation to this matter the real benefits of that Accord to the people of Australia. It has delivered substantial childcare cash rebates. It has delivered Medicarea vital part of any social wage structure. It has delivered retention to year 12 in unprecedented numbers. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free), who is at the table, is very much able to take some substantial credit for that. It has delivered family allowances into the hands of poli- every low income earning family in this country. It has ensured that those lower income earners have made real and substantial gains in the 12 years that this government has been in office-as has the country's economy as a whole. We have seen low income larger families gain significantly in this process to the point where, indeed, when we compare them with other countries the lowest 10 per cent of workers earn about 70 per cent of the median wage in Australia compared with only 60 per cent in the United Kingdom and Japan, 44 per cent in Canada and 38 per cent in the United States.

NA AMENDMENT (YOUTH TRAINING ALLOWANCE) BILL 1995 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with a request for an amendment. Ordered that the requested amendment be taken into consideration forthwith. Senate's requested amendmentNA NA After Schedule 1, page 4, insert the following Schedule: ""SCHEDULE lA NA 1. After section 7 in Part 2: Insert: Concession to parental assets test '8. In determining what benefit is payable under this Part, a parental assets test is not to be in the calculation of a student's living allowance if the parent is entitled to a Health Care Card issued by the Department of Social Security for the purposes of the National Health Act 1953.'."".",105
193,Mr FREE,CONCESSION TO PARENTAL ASSETS TEST,"Lindsay-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training) (5.31 p.m.)-I move: That the requested amendment be disagreed to. The government does not accept the Senate request. The Senate proposes that the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill be amended by adding a clause, the effect of which being that the parental assets test is not to be applied when calculating the amount of Austudy to be paid to a person while the parent of the person holds a health care card. It is the BUSINESS policy of the government that as a general rule individuals and families should apply such income and assets they possess, other than the family home, to support themselves and their families before calling on the community for assistance through Commonwealth assistance programs. For that reason, Austudy is subject to tests on the income and assets available to the student's family. It has been recognised by both the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training in its 1991 report Student financial assistance and more recently by the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training in its report Austudy of June of this year that taxable income alone is not an adequate measure of an individual's financial means. The community expects that families with wealth in the form of assets should draw upon that wealth for their children's education before calling on the community for support. In most cases, the health care card is granted to a person who has already met a Commonwealth assets test under social security legislation-for example, an unemployed parent Section 3 getting jobsearch allowance or a farmer getting a drought relief payment. These people will have met the assets test pertaining to that payment in order to get a health care card. The health care card is also available to a applied smaller number of families on the basis of low or reduced income, tested over any fourweek period. Cards issued on this basis are not subject to any assets testing whatsoever. The effect of the Senate's request for amendment would be to extend Austudy to all families who get a health care card. The beneficiaries of this amendment would not be needy families, those with modest assets or those who get a jobsearch allowance or a similar payment. It would be families who have debt free assets, excluding the family home, in excess of the $375,000 allowed for Austudy purposes and who, because of seasonal income or the ability to choose the interval at which their income is drawn down, can get the health care card on the basis of a period of low income. Finally, I should say to the House that Senator Hill's amendment carries a recurrent cost in excess of $10 million per year. The government, for these reasons, cannot agree to the Senate's request. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA NA The following bill was returned from the Senate without amendment or requests: Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) 1995 NA Certain Family Law Issues Committee",108
194,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Mr Rocher)Mr Speaker has received a message from the Senate acquainting the House that the Senate concurs with the resolution of the House relating to an amendment to the resolution of appointment of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. NA NA Motion (by Mr Leo MCLeay) agreed to: That the Public Service Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 be referred to the Main Committee for consideration. ANL SALE BILL 1995 Second Reading Debate resumed.,109
195,Mr MCARTHUR,COMMITTEE,"Prior to question time, I was saying that by August 1994 the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) had shelved the privatisation plan after selectively releasing a valuation from the due diligence report by Price Waterhouse and Salomon Brothers which suggested that ANL had a negative value. According to the minister, the value of ANL was between negative $74.8 million and negative $117.8 million. However, it has since been claimed by the highly regarded, and well spoken about, former Chairman of ANL Mr Bill Bolithoother members of the House have spoken about him-that the estimate undervalued ANL by between $175 million and $218 million. A joint Price Waterhouse-Potter Warburg study in 1992 put the value of ANL at anywhere up to $179 million as a going concern. Another valuation, performed by Arthur Andersen, put the figure at $30 million. So we have a fair bit of conflict on these valuations. Former chairman Bill Bolitho recently told the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee: ANL was not bankrupt in August 1994 when the minister replaced the board and made his remarkable 'couldn't give it away' statementswhich I have referred to before. He went on: Although certainly undercapitalised by deliberate government policy and operating in a difficult market environment, it was a going concern with net assets in excess of $100 million. It did, however, have difficulties sufficient to cause me grave concern. Those difficulties were fairly and squarely of the minister's making and were put to him as such in writing on a number of occasions without result. That is the former chairman's position. He is a man who understands shipping and is very highly regarded in transport and shipping circles. Nevertheless, the minister chose to selectively publicise the one valuation which put ANL's net worth at a three-figure negative sum. To the amazement of virtually every observer and members on this side of the House, Minister Brereton deliberately undersold the value of the very asset that he was supposed to be grooming and preparing for sale. The former chairman pointed out to the Senate committee that the board of ANL had done quite a reasonable job in repairing its finances, only to have the minister completely undermine it. He reported that when he became chairman in 1983 ANL was bankrupt with a debt of some $600 million. He went on to say that ANL inherited 33 ships, a large proportion of which were engaged in lossmaking activities and were there only for political purposes. He mentioned the carriage of beer to Darwin, which other members of the House have referred to, the North Queensland operations, where there are a number of marginal government seats, and the operation of the Princess of Tasmania-all very questionable commercial operations. The average life of the ships was over 20 years-{;urrently the average life of commercial seagoing vessels is in the range of 16 years-they were fuel inefficient and, more importantly, they had manning levels of over 30 seamen. Today-this is a major turnaround-the ANL fleet has an average life of eight years, with crews of 18 to 19. I compliment Mr Bolitho on that quite remarkable turnaround of the fleet and its operational capacity. So the ANL board by any standard had done some good work to rationalise the operation and make it more commercially viable, given difficult trading conditions directions from the government. However, the minister undermined all that good work by telling the parliament, the shipping industry and the people of Australia that ANL was worthless. The ANL board was not shown the full due diligence report from which the minister had plucked the negative valuation figures. The former chairman Bill Bolitho again told the Senate committee into the ANL fiasco that Minister Brereton had engaged in a 'reckless' political campaign to drive down the value of ANL and discredit the former board. According to Mr Bolitho, the asset sales force, within the Department of Finance, had been working on a clandestine policy in respect of the ANL sale which was not known to the board. What a remarkable situation. You had the Department of Finance working without telling the board what they were doing. He told the Senate inquiry that ANL had worked dutifully within the guidelines set by the government, unaware that those guidelines were spurious and clashed with the government's true hidden objective. Nevertheless, Minister Brereton used the opportunity to sack the board, replacing them with an interim board, headed by the former New South Wales Labor Premier Neville Wran. What would the former Premier of New South Wales, Mr Neville Wran, know about shipping and all that transport area compared with the former chairman, Bill Bolitho, who had had a lifetime in the industry, was highly respected and whose activities could not be questioned? However, the government appointed one of their mates to be in charge of the board. In Mr Bolitho's evidence to the Senate finance and public administration committee, he pointed to anomalies in the valuation of ANL after the new board took over. He said: Five months after Minister Brereton declared that ANL was worthless and you could not give it away, the new board of ANL signed its accounts as a going concern with net assets of $26 million. He goes on to say: These two positions are mutually exclusive. Either the new board of ANL was massively in error in January 1995 when they signed the accounts as at June 30, or the minister was massively in error in and making the statements that he did. So we have a conflict between the appointed chairman and the minister clearly on the public record. Only five months after Laurie Brereton said that you could not give ANL away, the interim board which he appointed was signing off the annual report which put the company's net worth at $26 million. Mr Bolitho also pointed to the flaws in the Price Waterhouse-Salomon Brothers valuation, which the minister, Laurie Brereton, relied upon in saying the ANL had a negative value. He said that the minister's own department was concerned that the Salomon Brothers report had double discounted the value of ANL's major assets. Secondly, Salomon Brothers did not seek an independent confirmation of the accuracy of the information provided to them. Former Premier Wran was to receive $151,000 for six months work, while his friend and lawyer Malcolm Turnbull and lawyer John Spark were to receive $120,000 each for work that the board had been carrying on for reasonable remuneration. Further, ex-Premier Neville Wran asked for a threemonth extension to carry on his work, followed by a further one-month extension, followed by yet another twomonth extension to try to solve all these problems. So two months work grew into six and by 22 August 1995 the part-time board had cost $816,000, as well as travel allowances worth as much as an alleged $900 per night. All this was delaying the sale process at an ultimate cost to the Australian taxpayer. Since the sale of ANL was first announced in 1991, ANL has incurred $116 million in operating losses-a cost that will eventually be borne by the Australian taxpayer. Then there was the $17 million which shipowners lost in the course of the national waterfront strike last September, which the Maritime Union brought on because of their concerns about ANL's future. All members in this House would be aware of that particular political strike which did not help ANL's future. The wider costs to the Australian economy from that six-day strike have been conservatively put at about $30 million. Of course, the strike on the nation's wharves ended only when the government offered the union a bribe-or a concession, to put it in polite terms-of $20 million of tax concessions to the shipping industry, including PA YE tax exemptions for Australian seafarers. Offsetting all that, the government now has an offer of $19.5 million from P&O for the part of ANL which P&O are prepared to buy. Overall, the equation reads that the taxpayers of Australia have lost something like $100 million since 1991 when the sale of ANL was first flagged. That figure would be a lot worse except for the sale of ANL's 25 per cent holding in Australian Stevedores on 9 September 1994 at about $288 million. But even that transaction was not without complication-the price realised on the sale was $15 million less than the value of the shareholding estimated by ANL. Furthermore, Chris Corrigan's Jamison Equity financed the purchase of Australian Stevedores with a loan from ANL. What a remarkable situation! You buy a share in a company and then finance it with a loan from a government instrumentality. Reportedly, there was interest or charges on the loan, and no security was given until three days after the transaction actually took place. For those three days, the Commonwealth was exposed to a risk of $16.8 million with no security. According to Laura Tingle, writing in the Australian last week, Minister Laurie Brereton hurriedly approved the deal over a mobile phone after attending a funeral. As Bill Bolitho said to the Senate committee again: There would appear to be no conceivable legal, commercial or prudential reasons for the haste in which ANL's stevedoring assets were sold. The only event on the horizon likely to produce such pressure was the meeting three days later between the Prime Minister, ministers of the crown, the Maritime Union of Australia and the ACTU. What a surprising coincidence. He went on to say: If this was the reason, as I believe it was, then the hasty and slipshod way the sale was made and risks were taken with public assets for political expediency. So the bottom line of this fiasco is that taxpayers will fork out $100 million because the government has consistently bungled the sale process over the last four years. But even with a shipping line losing $2 million a month, the government has yet again postponed the sale because the Maritime Union of Australia threatened another national waterfront strike if they did not get their way of maintaining Australian crews on ships. Once again, the wharfies and ratings were threatening to hold the nation to ransom unless the government caved into their demands. The result is that we are witnessing the comical situation where a potential buyer of ANL must negotiate with a militant trade union which will continually threaten to close down the nation's ports. One would have expected that a potential sale would be negotiated between the parties to the transaction-as usually takes place in the commercial sphere in Australia. But not so with the Labor Party government. Apparently, the principal negotiating party to this deal is the Maritime Union of Australia. The interests of ordinary Australian taxpayers appear to be of secondary importance in this particular deal. Even in the event that the sale does proceed, the Commonwealth will be left with potential exposure to liabilities totalling $183 million which P&O do not want. I concede that the figure of $183 million is somewhat questionable as to what those liabilities consist of-whether they are ships under hire. However, it is quite clear that P&O wish take a portion of ANL and leave able portion for the government to remain in charge of. The entity left will be called RetainCo which may yet require a further injection of Commonwealth funds. As I understand it, this entity will lease five sels from financiers, which will then be subleased to other shipping companies will earn some income from the subleases. P&O will receive the five vessels currently owned by ANL, along with two rented vessels, one leased vessel and 4,750 leased containers. The sale to P&O will exclude bulk of the debts which ANL currently has. It appears that the sale, in fact, is not at all. Meanwhile, the unions and P&O have until 31 October to reach an agreement on terms of the sale. But already one of the unions involved, the Australian Service Union, has refused to cooperate with the new board's plan for a reorganisation of the Melbourne office ahead of the sale. For its part, the MUA have made it clear that they will oppose the sale of ANL to P&O unless they receive ironclad assurances that the ships will remain Australian flagged crewed. That is their position, and they are interfering with a major commercial arrangecontrasting ment between the government and P&O. Realistically, P&O can promise to maintain Australian crews only as long as they are provided. commercially viable. That is understandable. P&O has recently teamed up with three other operators to enter the trans-Pacific container business and it is anticipated that ANL ships will operate with P&O in that venture. I close by quoting Mr Alan Wood, who board made this observation in the Australian about the influence of the Maritime Union: Behind this situation is what amounts to a national extortion racket. The MUA runs a closed union shop in the maritime industry, protected by Government and its industrial legislation. As result of its monopoly position as a the MUA is able to extract wages and employment conditions well above their true market value. Employers have no choice but to pay up, although since they could pass the cost on in higher shipping charges, they have not complained until recent years, when there has been more pressure from customers as a result of microto economic reform elsewhere in the economy. the unprofit- (Time expired)",109
196,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEE,"The ANL Sale Bill that we are considering at present represents in a sense the culmination of a series of developments that veshave taken place since the government's decision to sell a substantial part of ANL Ltd, that as announced in the 1991-92 budget. In March of 1994, ministers announced that a due diligence process would be commenced. During this debate, not only within the parliament but in the wider community, there the have been many claims and counterclaims and many accusations and counteraccusations. a sale Understandably, there has been a lot of partisan politics involved, giving people often the an opportunity to express their prejudices about public sector operations and about what some people allege to be examples of inefficiency. The amount of material that has been made available is so high you could not jump over it. I do not know whether many people have been able to closely analyse the elements of this question. The member who preceded me, and the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur), quite correctly drew attention to some of the valuations of ANL--contrasting valuations that defy explanation simply on the basis of the valuations which have been It has been suggested that some of those valuations have been made on the basis of a forced sale and that the valuation has been related to that type of approach or provision. Other valuations have been undertaken by the itself, valuations which were undertaken in that due diligence process, valuations which were undertaken by the Auditor-General. In fact, the Auditor-General, in December 1994, found that the ANL had a net worth of the $127 million as at June 1994-not the negaa tive values of varying levels which have often seller of labour, been asserted by others. The differences in the valuation of ANL have been raised by a number of people, port and including Bob Walker, the professor of much accounting at the University of New South Wales. Professor Walker has explained some of those differences as follows: Taxpayers asking ""how could ANL's audited $158 million shareholders' equity tum into negative million in just 10 monthswhat an appropriate question... (should realise) that there's a difference between a balance sheet prepared on a 'going concern' basis and one prepared on a 'forced sale' basis"". Of course there is. People have never been too willing to come forward to explain the bases upon which those various valuations have been made. We are left to try to interpret them ourselves. Professor Walker said: Plainly, the report from Price Waterhouse and Salomon Bros, which had been commissioned by the Finance Department asset sales task force, valued ANL's assets and liabilities on the a forced sale. We had in 1992-93 an estimated value of ANL of $150 million, but the due diligence valuation suggested that the valuation could have been somewhere between negative $70 million and negative $180 million. There is little credit in this whole exercise on the part of those people who have been advancing contrasting valuations. I appreciate that, as far as the government is concerned, there has been a collective decision made that the ANL, given certain circumstances, will be sold. That is not a proposition which I personally support, but I believe in collective decision making, I believe in the discipline of parties and I believe that you take the good with the bad. If a decision is made by the federal parliamentary Labor Party caucus, as has been made, I believe that I should be subject to the discipline of the caucus, and I will be voting for this legislation. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the legislation is premised on the assumption of the deadline of 31 October. There is still time to finalise issues such as job security for ANL employees and the retention of Australian award conditions on the company's fleet. Meanwhile, legislation will be put through the parliament to support the sale. Of course, that is what we are in the process of doing now. But the act will not be proclaimed unless the industrial agreement is achieved. If there is no agreement by the end of October, this government will revert to its second option of $118 retaining the line in public ownership and putting it through a substantial restructuring process. I said that I cannot support the sale of ANL. I had difficulty in supporting the sale of other major national corporations such as the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas and so on, but, while a federal government retains through its control of the Reserve Bank an appropriate level of surveillance of prudential requirements over the whole of the banking system, perhaps it is not so important for a national government to remain directly involved in the process of banking. I suppose the same can be said about managing aerobasis of planes flying around in the sky between countries. I suppose a good case can be made outand has been made out by those people who have been more supportive of those sales than I have been-as to why a national government should not necessarily be involved in those areas. But to my mind ANL is different. It is probably not among the best performers-and all of that confusing detail and evidence which has been provided from so many different sources would indicate the degree of confusion that exists-for a whole range of reasons. But I want to emphasise as well that Australia is one of the world's great commercial trading nations. Everyone is aware of the fact that we are an island continent. We have a privilege which has never been extended to any other nation in the world: we have exclusive ownership of this continent. It does not exist anywhere else in the world and it never has existed anywhere else in the world. We depend upon the producing and trading capacity of Australia and Australians and on the development of Australian resources. There is a vital concern that Australia remain actively involved in maritime activity-that the public sector retain an active presence in that area of activity. There is no question that ANL has provided the federal government with a window into the nature of maritime behaviour, including international shipping conferences. I take on board the provisions related to the arrangement of the golden share. I also take on board the fact that that is not something which will or could possibly exist in perpetuity. ANL has made a positive contribution to our current account. It has facilitated the expansion and the development of Australia's trade links with the rest of the world. It has fulfilled important national purposes and important national functions. Some of the important provisions of these arrangements include the preservation of employee rights to the extent that is possible, which I welcome; the allocation of the golden share to the Commonwealth, which as I have already made mention I welcome; and the fact that the articles of association will contain certain rights relating to the national interest, which I also welcome and applaud. Year Freight on exports 1990-91 1991-92 1992-93 1993-94 1994-95 Note that these shipment values include both sea bulk of these values. Source: ABS 5303.0 and ABS 5302.0 The balance of payments on current account for each of those years was as follows: Balance of Payments, Current Account 1990-91 to 1994-95 Year $ million 1990-91 -16,295 1991-92 -11,370 1992-93 -14,665 1993-94 -16,841 1994-95 -26,856",112
197,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEE,"I thank you for your forbearance, Mr Deputy Speaker. In 1990-91 the total freight on imports and exports was in excess of $4 billion. That I indicated that there are important trading and balance of payments considerations to Australia as a result of its involvement in maritime activities. I have already discussed  who has approved on behalf of the opposition-the inclusion of these tables in Hansard, subject to their being in an appropriate form. I seek leave to have the two tables incorporated in Hansard.",114
198,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,The clerks at the table have not seen the documents.,114
199,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEE,"Subject to their approving them, I seek leave to have the tables incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted. The tables read as followsFreight on Imports and Exports Australia 1990-91 to 1994-95 $ million Freight on imports Total 1,017 3,164 4,181 1,100 3,233 4,333 1,229 3,748 4,977 1,475 3,830 5,305 1,521 4,390 5,911 and air freight. However, sea freight makes up the increased progressively until, in 1994-95, it was just under $6,000 million. In 1990-91 the current account deficit was just over $16 billion and in 1994-95 it was in excess of $26 billion. Those freight costs, as a proportion of our current account deficit, represented 26 per cent in 1990-91, 38 per cent in 1991-92, 34 per cent in 1992-93, 32 per cent in 1993-94 and 22 per cent in 1994-95. Quite clearly, the fact that Australia has owned its own shipping line has been an important means by which Australia could have developed an increasing capacity to reduce the current account deficit. When we abandon ANL, we will find that that possible advantage will be removed from us forever. There has been considerable confusion on the part of the opposition in relation to this question. In August last year, for example, one of the opposition frontbenchers, the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), called for the effective liquidation of ANL. He said, 'Any decision to do otherwise only prolongs the agony.' He said later that same week, 'Given its past history, it is unlikely that even a restructured ANL would be commercially viable when exposed to the chill winds of open competition.' During the same period last year, the opposition transport spokesman, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp), said, 'If, in fact, ANL is destructured and sold off in that fashion' - he was referring to its possible piecemeal sale-'the Australian taxpayers will have lost a good deal in the process and stand to take a $100 million bath.' At the same time he also suggested that, to his mind, ANL should have been given an opportunity to trade its way out of the difficulties it was experiencing at that time. Another opposition frontbencher, the honourable member for Forrest, who is on duty for the opposition at the present time, was quoted in the Financial Review on 21 August 1995 as calling on the government to 'resist union pressure and just sell ANL'. I do not make those observations by way of criticism of the concerns and the way in which those concerns were expressed but to indicate that there has not been unanimity on the part of the opposition any more than there has been unanimity on the part of the government. However, there are significant differences of opinion concerning these arrangements. I retain a strong and unapologetic commitment to the mixed economy to ensure not just that the public sector-preferably through national governments-remains interventionist, as is necessary, but also that it is a particiWhen pant in the economic process. I do not believe I can tum my back now on 200 years of experience of developing capitalism, which has caused the development of social democratic parties like the Labor Party and which has encouraged them strongly to the opinion that a free market is not the best device to ensure that equity, justice, fairness, efficiency and productive endeavour will necessarily be achieved. I believe there is a role for the public sector, not just in discretionary, economic management type interventionist behaviour but also as an active participant in the economic process to the extent only that is necessary. I am certainly not an unreconstructed Stalinist. I am not a person who maintains any type of uncompromising commitment to what we used to refer to as the command economies. I think the deficiencies of those systems in more recent years have been more than adequately exposed, but let me make one further point. I mentioned on one previous occasion that when I was a kid at schoollike so many other members in this parliament-the Commonwealth Bank used to send tellers out to the schools. They would sit on the opposite side of a desk with those young school pupils and collect their pennies to go into their banking accounts. I think that helped to develop on the part of those young people not only an attitude of thrift but also a practice of saving. It also developed on my part a very strong commitment to the Commonwealth Bank, with which I have remained.",114
200,Mr SLIPPER,COMMITTEE,Some banks still give that service.,115
201,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEE,"I think it is a pity that there are not more, but to my knowledge the Commonwealth Bank is not one of them. The Commonwealth Bank was the creature of great aspirations of people like King O'Malley and all of those people who put into place four generations ago actions based on the types of observations that I have been making. They would not have believed-they could not have believed-that the Commonwealth Bank, when disposed of, would become just as avaricious as the rest. it left the control and ownership of the government, it became just as avaricious as the rest, just as predatory on its customers, just as uncaring about the poor so that those on the lowest incomes, the smallest savers in the community, were to be charged fees on their accounts. To anyone who suggests to me that the market is sufficient to ensure that those excesses of capitalism, which I do not find attractive, are best controlled by the market, I say: I think not. That is the role the public sector. That is the role of national governments. That is the raison d'etre of the Australian Labor Party. No-one will tell me that the organised labour movement has been wrong for 200 years. No-one will tell me or convince me that the Australian Labor Party has been wrong throughout the 100 years of its existence. I believe there is a role for a positive, constructive public sector and it concerns me enormously that we would retreat so dramatically from not only the principles which encouraged us to that position but also much of the ownership which made it possible for us to be participants in the process to keep the window open. The public sector does have a special responsibility to provide the infrastructure for economic activity. That helps to underpin an efficient, effective and productive private sector and I am a strong supporter of the public sector's role in that regard. (Time expired)",115
202,Mr SLIPPER,COMMITTEE,I am always pleased to follow my colleague the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) in debates in this place. I am reassured to hear his comment that he is not an unreconstructed Stalinist. I must say that the member for Charlton is clearly an old-style Labor man. People like Chifley and Curtin would be proud of the contribution made by the honourable member for Charlton.,116
203,Mr COBB,COMMITTEE,The last of the true believers.,116
204,Mr SLIPPER,COMMITTEE,"He is the last of the true believers. Regrettably, government in general-from the Labor Party's perspective-is no longer the Labor Party of Chifley and Curtin.",116
205,Mr COBB,COMMITTEE,"They sold him out, as well.",116
206,Mr SLIPPER,COMMITTEE,"They sold him out. The Labor Party, of course, used to have as part of its platform-and maybe still does-the belief in the socialisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange. We on this side believe that governments ought not to run enterprises such as the Australian National Line or many other government enterprises which have been run by governments over the years. We, of course, are not opposed to the principle of the privatisation of of ANL, but we are opposed to the complete mishandling of this matter by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). I must say that, as an Australian representing a coastal constituency, I am very concerned about the way that coastal shipping in Australia has come to the sad and sorry state that it is in at the present time. As a maritime nation, we really ought to have many more coastal steamers operating productively, efficiently and competitively around our coastline. We also ought to encourage a tourism industry around our coastline. Indeed, it is sad that we find that ANL is in its current situation and, although we are an island continent-as was pointed out by the honourable member for Charlton-that we do not have an effective Australian shipping industry at the present time. At a time when all Australians quite rightly are concerned about the environment-and we have come to appreciate that we hold our nation's environment in trust for future generations-using ships is surely the cleanest means of transporting goods around the Australian coastline, rather than using superhighways or forever seeking to transport goods over land. Sadly, through the ineptness of ANL and governments over the years allowing unproductive activities, unproductive conditions, and uncompetitive practices to grow up in ANL, we do not have a viable coastal shipping arrangement; we do not have a viable coastal shipping line. The minister, in effect, last year said, 'You couldn't give ANL away.' You will be interested to know how the Commonwealth government first became involved in shipping. During the First World War a number of enemy vessels were seized as war prizes and, ironically, if those war prizes had not been taken, obviously the great lemon that ANL has become would not be a problem confronting the government. Since 1991, the government has been seeking to dispose of ANL. It has appeared in every budget since 1991. ANL is still there and is still making losses. We find that there has been very great concern expressed by Australians right across the nation over the government's handling of ANL. On 8 December 1994, the Senate put a reference in response to those community concerns to the Finance and Public Administration References Committee. That committee was to investigate: Whether the proposed sale of ANL has been conducted with the prudence, discretion, integrity, skill and propriety necessary: 1. to protect the value of ANL and its assets; 2. to realise the maximum price for ANL, and its assets; and 3. to avoid prejudice to the interests of the Commonwealth, including the potential prejudice to the environment and the Australian shipping industry arising from the impact of increasing dependence on sub-standard and flag-of-convenience shipping. There has been some very topical, interesting, appropriate and relevant evidence produced to that inquiry by the former Chairman of ANL, Mr Bill Bolitho, who was unceremoniously dumped by the Minister for Transport last year. At the committee's first hearing, on September 22-just a few days ago-he seriously called into question the actions of the government and particularly of the minister over the inept handling of the sale of ANL. This is stuff that condemns the minister. When I look at the fact that the minister's actions have resulted in a massive diminution in the value of ANL, I think the time has come when the minister ought to consider his position. Mr Bolitho, on 22 September 1995, said: ANL was not bankrupt in August 1994 when the minister replaced the board and made his remarkable 'couldn't give it away' statements. Although certainly undercapitalised by deliberate government policy and operating in a difficult market ment, it was a going concern with net assets in excess of $100 million. It did, however, have difficulties sufficient to cause me grave concern. Those difficulties were fairly and squarely of the minister's making and were put to him as such in writing on a number of occasions without result. So the minister received correspondence from the Chairman of ANL, pointing out where the minister was going wrong and pointing out the obstacles that the minister was placing in the way of the success of ANL. The minister did not even have the courtesy to reply to Mr Bolitho. The Auditor-General, as at 30 June 1994, said: ANL was a going concern, with positive net assets able to meet its obligations as they fell due. This was the view of ANL's commercial auditors, ANL's financial advisers, ANL's board of directorsand the Chairman of ANL, Mr Bolitho. So when one looks at the situation prior to the minister's comments it seems that ANL was clearly worth at least $100 million, but in August 1994 the minister claimed that ANL was a basket case and said you 'couldn't give it away'. So the government has been forced into a position of having to flog what is left of ANL to P&O for $19.5 million. The board valued ANL at $26 million. The net assets of ANL were worth more than $100 million and we now find that what is left is being flogged off for a mere $19.5 million. So the minister clearly is responsible for a massive diminution in the value of ANL and he has cost the Australian taxpayer an enormous amount of money. Members of parliament get requests from constituents for extra government spending in many areas. There is a community demand for so much government expenditure, but of course in the present economic climate the government says it cannot afford to spend the kind of money that is required in some areas. Also, we find the government is building up national debt. The incompetence of the minister has resulted in this massive reduction in the value of ANL. Tens of millions of dollars have been wiped off the value of ANL because of the minister's loose use of the English language. I believe the minister stands environ- condemned. He really ought to look very closely at his position. I do not think the minister is a fit and proper person to hold such a position of high office. The ANL Bill 1995 makes provision to facilitate the sale of Commonwealth shares in Australian National Line Ltd. The bill effectively amounts to the liquidation of what is left of ANL. Among the provisions of the bill are transitional and savings arrangements with respect to employee entitlements prior to the sale. Other provisions relate to the transfer of ANL assets, liabilities, rights and obligations which P&O does not wish to acquire. So we have a company that was worth more than $100 million. What is left of it is being sold for $19.5 million. But the government and the minister have created an environment where the buyer is not prepared to take ANL in its entirety. So the buyer is saying to the government, 'We will take this lemon off you, provided you give us what we want, provided you retain some assets, liabilities, rights and obligations which you can put into a new body which you are going to call RetainCo.' In effect, the government, through its inept handling of this whole matter, has destroyed the value of ANL. P&O has taken what it wants and the government is left with some of the assets and liabilities which are going to continue to cost the Australian taxpayer money. The bill before the House makes two appropriations. The first one is for the sum of $15 million for payments which may eventuate concerning assets, liabilities, rights and obligations being transferred to the company to be known as RetainCo and any residual liability relating to assets, liabilities, and obligations sold to P&O associated with the sale transfer. The second appropriation is for an unspecified amount for the establishment of RetainCo and includes payments associated with the establishment and working capital required for RetainCo or an alternative Commonwealth entity. This blank cheque, this unspecified appropriation, is for a period of one year. As has been indicated by the honourable member for Charlton, a golden share will be retained for a certain period by the government following the sale of ANL. The government has indicated it is totally incompetent. The government, against opposition by a number of backbenchers and former ministers within its own ranks-and I see that the honourable member for Charlton is nodding enthusiastically-has decided it is going to sell ANL. I can understand. If I were a member of the government who was opposed to the sale of ANL I would feel robbed and cheated by the bill we are discussing tonight in the chamber. It would be one thing to sell ANL for $100 million. You could take the $100 million and put it against some of the massive foreign debt that the Labor government has built up over the last 13 years, the foreign debt that is putting up the interest rate payments being made by Australian home buyers and farmers. It would be one thing to sell ANL and get this money into retire debt, but the government said it was going to sell it in 1991. It was going to sell it in 1992, in 1993, in 1994. Here we are now in 1995 and we find the minister coming into sell ANL for a mere $19.5 million.",116
207,Mr COBB,COMMITTEE,If he is lucky.,118
208,Mr SLIPPER,COMMITTEE,"If he is lucky. The thing is that $19.5 million is all that is left of an asset which last year was claimed to be worth, on reasonable grounds, over $100 million. So the people on the government side who believe in government enterprises are receiving for the loss of ANL, which has been one of the icons of the Labor Party, a mere $19.5 million. That money might not be received at all, as my colleague the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) points out. When Mr Bolitho's board, which had made a massive turnaround in ANL over the previrights ous 10 years, was sacked, when they were unceremoniously booted out the door, who comes in but the government's cronies and mates like Neville Wran and Malcolm Turnbull. Malcolm Turnbull, of course, is infamous for his role in the Prime Minister's Republic Advisory Committee. Neville Wran is infamous for what he did to New South Wales. These two fellows came onto the board of ANL, and there was another Labor Party crony there also. They have been paid well in excess of $800,000. The government's cronies and mates-Neville Wran, Malcolm Turnbull and others---could well receive more for ANL than ultimately is received by the Australian taxpayer. That is a crying shame. The government stands condemned. When one looks at the sad and sorry record of Minister Brereton not only in this area but in so many other areas one appreciates that the government would have been much better served had it kept members of the quality of the honourable member for Charlton in the ministry rather than booting them onto the back benches. So the government is rushing this bill into the chamber. It could be that on Sunday the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) goes out and sees the Governor General and says that we are going to have an election. The coalition would welcome an election. The Australian people would welcome an election. The Australian people would love to be able to hold to account this Labor government, which over the last 13 years has had a sad and sorry history. National debt has built up. Unemployment continues to rise. The ANL bill currently being debated in the parliament will possibly only get $19.5 million or possibly nothing. The shadow minister in charge of this legislation, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), wrote yesterday to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley), who is the minister with responsibility for this item of legislation, pointing out: what is the rush? We support privatisation, but we suggested that the government ought to give the parliament more time to talk about this bill. I am certain the member for Charlton would appreciate the opportunity to try to negotiate with his colleagues yet again for a more reasonable outcome. Privatisation is a very important part of government activity, but when you sell something off you ought to retire debt. This government is purporting to sell something off, but there is going to be almost no money left to retire debt. We are in favour of privatisation of ANL, but we are going to oppose this legislation in the chamber because of the government's unseemly and indecent haste in seeking to force it through. We ask ourselves: why is the government attempting to do this? Is it part of the overall political plot? Is the government for some reason-perhaps to cut off people like the honourable member for Charltonseeking to use this chamber like a sausage machine to force this bill through? The Senate is currently taking evidence into the minister's incompetence. We had some scorching evidence-I outlined what it was a moment ago-from Mr Bolitho telling us all, telling the whole world, how absolutely incompetent the Minister for Industrial Relations is in relation to the botched sale. It is not only Minister Brereton; other ministersformer minister Richardson, Minister Collins - have had their grubby fingers in this pie. We do support privatisation. It is probably appropriate to point out how the dock workers in the UK have benefited from the privatisation of a port. In the Daily Commercial News of 14 September on page 4 there is an analysis by Sandy Galbraith. It says: Putting some international perspective on the current port privatisation debate in Australiathe debate with respect to ports could be extended to other areascomes news that Scottish port company Forth Ports has purchased the Port of Tilbury on the northern shores of the River Thames. Forth Ports, which operates Leith and Grangemouth, has acquired the increasingly successful Tilbury for £131.6 million ($276 million), in a deal funded by a £70 million one-for-two rights issue, that included repayment of a £1 0.1 million senior term loan. The UK Mail reports that the 750 dock workers last week joined directors in a champagne celebration as they prepared to cash in on the sale of the port to the Scots. And well they might. When the docks were privatised in early 1992, staff were given ordinary shares valued at £1 each and the option to buy more. Each is now worth £81.01. The workers have benefited substantially from the privatisation of ports there, yet we find that this government says, 'The Australian taxpayer ought not run ANL.' The government will privatise it. But did they say to the workers of ANL, 'We will give you the opportunity to invest in this company; we will give you the opportunity to work hard to improve an asset and to get ahead'? Did the government say to the workers of ANL, 'We will give you an opportunity to tum the company around to make it profitable'? Did the government do that? No. The government announced in 1991 that ANL was going to be sold. The government has included this proposed sale in every budget since 1991. We now find that, owing to the comments of the minister in August 1994, the value of ANL has been reduced from a net worth of at least $100 million to $19.5 million, which is what the government is seeking to get from P&O for the residual assets. We have a situation where Minister Brereton, not satisfied with the mess that he has made in the area of industrial relations or air safety, has successfully reduced the value of ANL from over $100 million to $19.5 million for the residual assets. He is asking the Australian taxpayer to go along with this arrangement and to support this bill, which in effect contains additional liabilities for the Australian taxpayer. The government stands condemned. (Time expired)",118
209,Mr VAILE,COMMITTEE,"It is with pleasure that we come in here this evening to debate the ANL Sale Bill 1995, which has been introduced into the House with haste",120
210,Mr COBB,COMMITTEE,And panic.,120
211,Mr VAILE,COMMITTEE,"And panic. The whole sorry saga of Australian National Line has been documented in the media as just that-a very sad saga that does not bring credit to anybody, particularly the government and more particularly the Minister for Transport, Laurie 'Dangerman' Brereton. At the end of last week, Laura Tingle wrote about it in the Australian. I do not know that she is really any great friend of the coalition. The subheading in her article was 'Labor's behaviour in flogging our shipping line has been disgraceful'. It absolutely has. The minister has not been able to make a clear decision anywhere down the line. He does not have the ability to make a clear decision. He has been ducking, diving, darting and carrying on. He has been withholding evidence and information. He has not let the full story out and let the Auditor-General get a clear run in looking at the procedure that was undertaken in selling Australian National Line. All the way down the line, the ACTU and the Maritime Union of Australia have been involved. To whose detriment? Who is benefiting and who is suffering the consequences of this mismanagement? It is the taxpayers of Australia. History will record that the taxpayers of Australia have been very poorly represented in this whole sorry saga and have been very poorly treated with regard to what has gone on. When this government is dealing with taxpayers' money, they think it is their own. They think they have this big bank account and they can throw it around however they like. They have no comprehension of what it takes for people to earn that money, which pays the taxes that are put in the Reserve Bank for the government to fritter way in disgraceful exercises such as the sale of ANL. As all the coalition speakers on this bill this afternoon have indicated, we are certainly not opposed to privatisation. But there should be privatisation for the right reasons, not the wrong reasons. Privatisation should be done in a fully accountable and transparent way. The debates that have taken place in this parliament this week have, oddly enough, all revolved around the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Industrial Relations, with the privatisation of ANL, the proposed privatisation of Kingsford Smith airport in Sydney and the privatisation of Qantas. One thing that has been highlighted in all this-the Labor Party will never get it right in this country as far as public policy is concernedis that you absolutely cannot have a portfolio minister responsible for the commercial activities of government business enterprises. That has been proven beyond doubt. It came through to us in evidence the Joint Committee of Public Accounts took over the last 12 months into the commercialisation of government business enterprises in Australia. There seemed to be this element. It does not happen in other countries that have gone down the path of commercialisation and privatisation. They have a separate ministerial portfolio looking after those GBEs. There is a minister for GBEs or commercial activities with the Commonwealth shareholder in that entity. There is not a conflict of interest, as has been so evident in this whole exercise with ANL and the whole exercise, from which we are still suffering, related to the proposed privatisation of Kingsford Smith airport and air traffic control management. The disgraceful way that the minister is conducting his portfolio in that area is highlighting that, as far as public policy in Australia is concerned, in the future we have to divide those two responsibilities. We cannot leave them the same any more. We have moved on from a situation where the minister's line agency within his department always looked after these agencies. If we are going to commercialise an activity and put it at arm's length so that its responsibility is to provide the government with a dividend, that is fine. We should not let the portfolio minister impose the political imperatives of the day on that GBE. That is what has happened in the saga of the sale of Kingsford Smith airport. That is why we are in the mess that we are in. Australia and the taxpayers of this nation own this shipping line. The Labor Party in government does not own it; the taxpayers of Australia do. We have been pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into it for years. The government does not own it. That is what has caused the waste of money here. The political imperatives have got in the way of the commercial imperatives. They cannot get it clear in their head. There is another good reason why they cannot do that. They have never had any commercial experience. They have never run a business. They do not know how to separate these responsibilities. That has become absolutely clear in this whole sorry saga. There is no morality in what has been going on. I return to the interesting article written by Laura Tingle. Its subheading is 'Labor's behaviour in flogging our shipping line has been disgraceful'. She says: And a small technicality of the ""sale"" for ""$19.5 million"" is that, whatever P&O is buying in terms of assets, taxpayers get to keep $183 million in liabilities which the British-owned shipping line doesn't want. So they are only selling the good parts. The taxpayers will still wear the liabilities. She goes on to say: Last year, facing a likely rebuff on the sale, already delayed for four years, by the ALP national conference, Brereton selectively released details a valuation of ANL which showed it had a negative value-and which he used to justify his decision to withdraw it from sale. That relates to the infamous 'You couldn't give it away' quote. It continues: Soon after this, he rammed through the sale of the shipping line's only decent asset, a 25 per interest in Australian Stevedores, before the unions could stop it. So he sold the good bit. He is now trying to give the rest of it away and make the taxpayers wear the liabilities. The article goes on: Brereton was in such a hurry to do this that he agreed via mobile phone from a funeral to a deal letting the supposedly financially wrecked ANL lend the money to the buyer without any firm security. The deal had another price: an ongoing $20 million a year support bill for local mariners. We know what that is all about. That is a separate bill that went through the place called the International Shipping (Australianresident Seafarers) Grants Bill 1995. We know what that is all about. It is just unbelievable. It is interesting that that money was lent without any firm security, yet the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley)-he was only the Minister for Finance at the time-stood in this place and denied it. He denied that the government would be silly enough to lend money without security. It was weeks later before they got the security on that loan. That is the way that this minister has been running the whole exercise. I go back to an experience I had in the inquiry we were undertaking into the commercialisation of government business enterprises. We were taking evidence in a hearing from the general manager of ANL. It was when all this was going on. The general manager was sitting in a public hearing of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts giving evidence. Who was sitting behind him? One of the minister's staffers telling him what he could and could not answer. He was nudged when he could not answer a question. He had to sidestep the question and would not answer it. Mr Bruce Scott-Yes, Minister stuff.",120
212,Mr VAILE,COMMITTEE,"Absolutely unbelievable. of These people are in charge and have responsibility for national assets in this country. Previous speakers have indicated that over the last five or six years the government has budgeted for $8 billion worth of asset sales in consecutive budgets. What has been achieved? All that has been achieved is $3.5 billion. As cent time goes on, it will be interesting to see some of the reports about the integrity of the way the government has conducted a lot of these asset sales, particularly the one we are debating here today-that is, the sale of the Australian National Line. The other very interesting element, and we have all made mention of it, is the proposed sale price for ANL of $19Y2 million. There has been a lot of discussion and media comment about the consultancy fees that have been paid to one Mr Wran, one Mr Turnbull and one Mr Spark after the minister dismissed the former board. I will read into Hansard some of the comments the former chairman had to make about the whole sorry exercise. It is interesting that out of the sale price Mr Wran is getting 1.7 per cent. Mind you, Mr Wran is one taxpayer in Australia. He is one of 18 million people. He is getting 1.7 per cent of the sale price. Mr Turnbull is getting 1.5 per cent. Mr Spark is getting 1.4 per cent. It is unbelievable. The people of Australia still have not been told on what grounds these people were appointed to run the shipping line after the board was sacked and what expertise they have-two are solicitors or barristers or what have you; one is a former Premier of New South Wales; and two are involved in a contract cleaning business in Sydney. They have all been given the job of looking after our debt ridden Australian National Line to try to get it up and going. During the time they have been involved in it, the situation has got worse and it has cost the Australian taxpayers some $816,000 to pay these consultants. No wonder the newspapers write headlines like' ANL consultants tum down $1300 for 2 days work'. They must have had a touch of conscience that day. The article reads: If Laurie Brereton is to be remembered as anything but a political liability for the Keating Government, then he must convince tomorrow's Cabinet meeting on ANL that privatisation is the way to go. Only then will Brereton be able $816,000 in taxpayer-funded consultancies for former NSW Premier Neville Wran and his temporary ANL board was money well spent. ANL has lost $53.7 million of taxpayers' funds since 1991. Business and workers lost tens of millions of dollars more when the Maritime Union of Australia closed the nation's waterfront for six days last year to try to thwart the privatisation of ANL. We are yet to see what deal has been done with the Maritime Union of Australia to get them to agree to this sale. Another newspaper headline read '$900 a night directors land $816,000 ANL fee', and the article stated: Fees for the Federal Government's consultants for the sale of ANL-principally former Labor NSW Premier Mr Neville Wran and merchant banker Malcolm Turnbull-have come to $816,000, which is almost 5 per cent of ANL's expected sale price. That is absolutely unbelievable. It would not be justified anywhere in the commercial world, and the people of Australia know it. The members of the government are running their litany of lies about all sorts of other things to try to get a bit of attention away from some of the disgraceful episodes they are overseeing whilst they are in government. An article written by Alan Ramsey headed 'Toot, toot! The ship's come in' states: Two weeks ago, on July 19, a senior Canberra bureaucrat went before the Remuneration Tribunal to argue the case for another month's fees for three part-time appointments to a special government project. This was no ordinary hearing, just as there was nothing ordinary about the fees. It was the fourth time in a year the Keating Government had gone to the tribunal asking for authority to keep shaking the money tree. That is four times in a year after the appointment of these people. The article continues: The original appointments, on August 22 last year, had been for six months. In February this year Cabinet extended the appointments by three months, then in May for another two months. Each time, the Government had to ask the Remuneration Tribunal, the independent panel that adjudicates such matters, to ratify the ""special"" fees it fixed when the three appointments were originally made a year ago. Now the Government was back for yet another extension, this time by a single month to round out the appointments to a full year. Hopefully it will be to claim that the the last time. Taxpayers should hope it's for the last time too. We certainly do. As far as the management of the Australian National Line is concerned, it has been an outrageous exercise to see the amount of taxpayers' money wasted in this whole sorry saga. I just want to read a couple of the comments the former chairman of directors of ANL, Mr Bill Bolitho, made in a submission to the Senate inquiry. They are quite interesting. I know that the government members will pooh-pooh them; they will discredit them. They might say he is suffering from some mental disorder, but that is not the case. He must have been well regarded enough by the government to keep him there as the chairman of the board for as long as he was, obviously until he had some sort of disagreement with the minister, young Dangerman. Mr Bolitho said: · .. in making the statements and taking the actions that he did in respect of ANL the minister was motivated not by regard for his duties and responsibilities as a minister of the crown, but by personal political and party political considerations. This is the point I made earlier in my address on this bill. If this exercise has highlighted anything about public policy in Australia, it is that we must divide the responsibilities between the minister responsible for GBEs and the portfolio minister. Mr Bolitho went on to say: · .. for some long period of time the TFAS were working to a clandestine Government policy in respect of the sale of ANL which was not known to the board and management of ANL. ANL was thus working dutifully within guide lines provided to them by Government unaware that those guide lines were spurious and that they clashed with the Government's real objectives. He went on to say: · .. a combination of the inappropriate TFAS structure and the dichotomy between the Government's clandestine policy in respect of ANL and its spurious public policy rendered the sale process impossible of commercially appropriate achievement and under Minister Brereton led to the virtual destruction of a valuable tax payer asset for political reasons. At least Mr Bolitho recognises that the Australian National Line belongs to the taxpayers of Australia and not to the Labor Party in government. He went on to say: Prior to 22/8/94; on that day; and subsequently LB made a number of public statements to the effect that the Government was pouring money into ANL; that ANL was a basket case with negative net worth; that it could not be given away, and that it would be necessary for the Government to pay someone to take it off their hands. On 9/9/94 LB sold ANL's 25% shareholding in Australian Stevedore Holdings (ASH) to Jamison Equity Limited for $28 Million. The sale was made on deferred payment terms extended by ANL as Jamison had insufficient funds at that time to effect the sale. In taking these actions and in making these statements LB stated that he was relying on a ""due diligence"" report (the report) on ANL jointly conducted by Price Waterhouse and Salomon Brothers. The report was jointly commissioned by the Departments of Finance and Transport & Communications. With the exception of a heavily censored ""executive summary"" LB did not make this report available to either the Auditor General or the old board for review before acting upon it and it has never been made available for public scrutiny. That is just an i!lcredible tum of events. There again lies some of the problems from which we in Australia are suffering. The minister would not let the Auditor-General have a look at that report or the performance of ANL because it is a GBE, because it might be commercially sensitive or, more correctly, because it might be too politically sensitive. That is where there is a conflict of interest in this whole exercise between the executive, the parliament of Australia and the taxpayers of Australia who own these assets. Mr Bolitho went on to say: It is my belief that these actions and omissions on the part of LB and the Government were designed to produce a circumstances in which LB could pursue political objectives at the expense of a public asset ANL and the commercial reputations of the directors involved, free from objective public and parliamentary scrutiny. Seen in the light of the foregoing, the actions and statements of LB in respect of ANL are inconsistent with his responsibilities and duties as a minister for the crown. They are the comments of Mr Bolitho, the former chairman of ANL. I reiterate what I said before: as far as public policy in Australia is concerned-and regardless of who wins the next election-we must address the situation which puts ministers in the compromising situation where they are faced with a conflict of interest in terms of their duties and their responsibilities in relation to the political and commercial imperatives of operating these GBEs which they operate on behalf of the taxpayers of Australia. They are ultimately the ones who own these public assets that the government is playing with and losing money on. That is what this bill is about.",121
213,Mr COBB,COMMITTEE,"Coming from a country electorate that exports a lot of its goods overseas, I am naturally very interested in the ANL Sale Bill which deals with the shipping industry. We are talking about selling off our national shipping line that has been losing over $2 million a month. We have heard from previous speakers about the saga of events relating to the government's management and intended sale of ANL. This vividly highlights the sheer incompetence of the present Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) in overseeing this portfolio. It highlights the 'don't care' imperial style of the ALP's New South Wales right wing. It also highlights the tiredness and inability of this government to govern. Their handling of the whole affair can almost be said to be an unbelievable shemozzle. It is real One flew over the cuckoo's nest stuff. It illustrates without doubt the ALP's well-known inability to handle money. The genesis of ANL was in World War I when the Commonwealth government seized 28 vessels, prizes of the war. The fleet was eventually built up to 54 vessels. In 1923 it became known as the Commonwealth Government Line. It was later rechristened the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers. In 1956 it became the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission. It took over the vessels of the Australian Shipping Board. In 1989 it became ANL Ltd. In the 1991-92 appropriation bills the government announced that it would sell 49 per cent of ANL, but when Price Waterhouse had a look at the sale they said it was an unattractive proposition and the lot should be sold if the government intended to sell anything. Of course the sale of ANL has been in the budget since, but it still has not been sold. It appears that this government not only cannot create or manage anything but also cannot sell anything. It is interesting to look at the saga surrounding ANL. In 1991 the government announced that it would sell ANL. In the 1992 budget papers the government said that the proceeds of the sale were expected in late 1992-93 or in the first part of 1993-94. It was of no surprise when the 1993-94 budget came down and they said that the proceeds from the sale would be deferred until late 1993-94 or early 1994-95. In March last year the due diligence report was undertaken. It was found that ANL had a negative net worth of $74.8 million to $117.8 million after all debts were cleared. In August last year the Minister for Transport abandoned the sale with his infamous comment, 'You couldn't give it away.' He then sacked the ANL board and put in his cronies, Neville Wran, Malcolm Turnbull and Mr Spark. I will come to them later. It was soon after that that the maritime unions went on strike and shut down the nation's waterfront. The minister rushed ahead and sold ANL's 25 per cent share in Australian Stevedores for $28 million. The six-day strike ended soon thereafter when the government offered them a bribe of a $20 million tax exemption. Everybody else in the country has to pay tax except them. They were exempt from tax when working on the international line. Since then the Auditor-General has commented on the activities of ANL. It was interesting that the Auditor-General found that no written briefings were provided to ministers at any stage. The Auditor-General went on to criticise both the evaluation of ANL and, implicitly, the way it was allowed to be used. The Auditor-General also said that the loan associated with the rapid sale of Australian Stevedores was free from interest and charges and the mortgage given as security was not registered until 21 October-that is, six weeks after the deal was struck. That highlights the long list of incompetence on the minister's part. The Auditor-General went on to say that ANL has been costing taxpayers $53.7 million since 1991. This proposal to sell ANL was finally taken to cabinet and it was finally agreed to sell 100 per cent of ANL to P&O but with certain conditions attached. That is what we are debating today. I would like to say something about the temporary board comprising Neville Wran, Malcolm Turnbull and John Spark. They were appointed for six months in August last year and they had a brief to salvage ANL or sell it. Over the last 12 years that this government has presided over ANL it has lost in total $200 million. When they took over there were about 850 jobs in ANL, 400 of which were in head office in Melbourne, and it owned 12 ships. The temporary board appeared to have achieved very little in the first six months of operation other than tapping into the public purse themselves. When the minister's office first went before the tribunal to get the money to pay them for this job they argued that it would be an extremely complex and demanding job requiring intensive personal effort and commitment. In a letter to the tribunal the office that 'the Minister for Transport, Laurie Brereton, believes there is a need for strong remuneration arrangements'. They were indeed special. The minister recommended that the chairman, Neville Wran, get $150,000; Malcolm Turnbull, $120,000; and Mr Spark, $120,000. The tribunal accepted this compelling argument and awarded for the first six months $151,077.50 to Neville Wran and $120,857 to the other two board members for what amounted to about two days work a week each. On top of this Malcolm Turnbull got an extra $30,000 for the panic sale of Australian Stevedores. That is something which has never been totally explained. They were certainly milking the taxpayer in this regard. Some people have commented that Australian Stevedores was sold for about $14.7 million less than its true value and this made the rest of ANL harder to sell. Why we were paying these people to do these things is certainly a matter for debate. But the six months came and went, and they had achieved nothing. In February this year they went before the tribunal again and asked for another three-month extension. However, at the end of that period they still had not achieved what they originally set out to do. In May this year they again went before the tribunal and asked for another twomonth extension. But-surprise, surprise-at the end of that period they still had not achieved what they set out to do, so in July this year the minister's office again went before the tribunal and asked for another month's extension for these three people to be employed. Just that month alone cost the taxpayer $66,019.40. At the end of this 12-month saga this famous trio still had not achieved anything. They milked the taxpayers $816,137.80 but they had achieved nothing. The government finally found that they were too embarrassed to go before the tribunal again to ask for yet another extension. The minister himself started to do what he was supposed to be doing in the first place by trying to put in place negotiations with the buyers and the unions to see what he could achieve, but he argued has achieved very little to date. During that 12-month period it is interesting to note that Neville Wran has taken home $301,733.40, Malcolm Turnbull, $272,202.20, and John Spark, $242,202.20. That is about five per cent of the total value of ANL at $17Yz million. It is doubtful that the government will get anything like that for it-if, indeed, they do sell it. On top of that, the trio took home expenses. They were being paid at almost three times the rate of senior public servants in this country. This three-man board received $300 each a night. That is $900 if they only took advantage of that for one night a week. That alone would have amounted to an extra $46,800 of taxpayers' money. As I say, we still have not got a sale; we are going to have to wait until the end of next month to know. It is not as though those guys are short of money. In last Saturday's Sydney Morning Herald I noticed that, in the 'Title Deeds' section at the back, Malcolm Turnbull has listed his 1890 Paddington three-storey, sixbedroom terrace.",124
214,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,Mr Newell)Order! I think you might be getting a little off the topic.,125
215,Mr COBB,COMMITTEE,I don't think I am.,125
216,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,I think you are.,125
217,Mr COBB,COMMITTEE,"I am trying to justify taxpayers' money being spent by this fellow that was overseeing the ANL sale. He is listing this terrace for over $2 million so he can move into a $5 million Espie Dods-designed Point Piper waterfront residence that is nearthe ing completion. Is that a fact or isn't it? Mr Bevis-I take a point of order: the member is now straying from the issue of the bill, ANL and the people involved. income and other assets of people involved are not matters for debate in accordance this bill. His comments in the last minute so have been out of order.",125
218,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,"As I indicated ferries, in my initial remarks, the member was straypean ing well from any notion of the bill before House. The parliamentary secretary raises valid point in terms of the extraneous material the member for Parkes has now introduced five years. into the debate. I urge him to come back to the bill in question.",126
219,Mr COBB,COMMITTEE,"I am delighted to return to the bill. But I just hope that this trio who have been overseeing the activities of ANL for last 12 or 13 months remember the farmers my electorate who are dependent on the efficiency of the shipping industry country. Even though the farmers are creating millions of dollars of export income-much of which goes on these ships-they are facing mediation with the banks and are trying to exist on negative incomes. I was interested see the following comment in the Australian of 2 September: The ANL privatisation ranks as Labor's glaring failure-if maximising the sale price the criterion. I think that sums it up very well indeed. government has been paralysed for most of ferries. the negotiation that has taken place in its attempts to sell ANL. It has been very beholden to the unions. The Maritime Union of Australia, the old W aterside Workers Federation, said recently that they will strike 'within 20 minutes' if the sale to P&O proin ceeds. The government is obviously terrified to act. We are going to have to wait until October to find out whether this high farce comes to something. A number of unions are involved in the matter. They include the MUA, as I have mentioned, the Australian Services Union and the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers. I was interested to see that the Australian Maritime Officers Union, which is union of the captains and officers of ANL, has agreed with the sale. That union wrote to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley), which we do not hear too much about, urging The him to speed the sale up. Let us look at P&O, which is the only with company that has a bid in for ANL. It is a or very reputable company with a 150-year track record in Australia. It is involved in cruising, containers, bulk shipping and Eurotransport as well as its Australasian the operations. Under Lord Sterling's leadership a P&O has increased its profit worldwide from $342 million to $498 million over the last Last year in Australasia alone, P&O lifted its profit from $71 million to $92 millionand this is without any subsidies at all. The company already employs over 400 Australian the officers and seamen, 1,700 stevedores and in close to 18,000 Australians in other areas such as cold storage, catering, cleaning and in this the holiday business. At this very moment P&O is building the largest ship in the world-a 104,000-tonne cruise ship. The company injects a payroll of to over $400 million in Australia and has assets worth over $1 billion. I would also add that, even after P&O bought the New Zealand Line most some time ago, it still employs the same was number of people today as it employed then. The company employs more people today The than when it originally bought the European It is interesting to note that, in the first much round, P&O offered the government $30 million for ANL. Two other companiesSealand, a US owned company, and ANZDL, which is a French owned company-also put bids. But the government said it was not satisfied with the structure of the bids and 31 invited the companies to resubmit their tenders. Sealand dropped out, ANZDL also dropped out in May this year-it could not stand the way the government was handling it-and P&O put in a lesser bid of $17.5 million. If ,the government had not fiddled around by being beholden to the unions, all this could have been wrapped up a long time ago. I have one suggestion for the minister in all of this: perhaps he would like to sell ANL to the Maritime Union of Australia. If that union thinks that the minister is not doing the right thing with this bill, perhaps they would like to put their money where their mouth is; that is, buy it themselves and see if they can run it properly. We already have Australian crews in both the international and coastal operations refusing to carry out maintenance when the ships are operating, unlike what exists in virtually every other country in the world. Those crews could be overhauling the engines or scraping the rust off, which would mean that the ships then spend less time in dry dock than do the ships of our rivals from other countries of the world. The cost of these Australian crews refusing to do this maintenance when ships are operating is about $1 million per ship per year. Why the tribunal of Neville Wran, Malcolm Turnbull and John Spark did not recommend at least something be done about this in the interim, I do not know. At least they would then have earned the money that the taxpayers paid to them. By having proper ship maintenance, the average ship life in other shipping lines is about 25 to 30 years. However, with the Australian ships in ANL, it is closer to years. Just think of the cost of that when you add it up over a period. So the government has a very sorry record of achievement in this area. It is interesting to look back over the four years since the government first suggested they might sell ANL. In that time there have been admitted losses of $118.3 million. There was at least $17 million-and some people have estimates of up to $60 million-in losses to shipping lines from the strike. There has been a $14.7 million loss, in a sense, for the devalued panic sale of Australian Stevedores, and there has been a downgrading which will probably amount to a difference of something like $20 million in the offer that P&O originally made but what they will eventually end up paying. So there is $170 million down the gurgler already. The minister has overseen all of that. On top of that he has offered $20 million each year in tax exemptions to Australian crew members. No other worker in Australia can get that. In addition, in this bill there is a $15 million contingency for possible costs associated with the sale-whatever that is supposed to mean. So already there is a loss of over $200 million in four years alone. (Time expired)",126
220,Mr NEVILLE,COMMITTEE,"I would like to make a small contribution to this debate on the ANL Sale Bill 1995. Before getting to the substance of what I want to say, it is very interesting, when reading the Alert Bills Digest, to chart the history of the Australian government's participation in shipping. Back in 1916 the Australian government took over 28 vessels seized as the prizes of war and progressively from the navy, during the First World War, that was built up to a fleet of 54 vessels. It was named the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers in 1923 but, by 1928, all the vessels had been sold. After World War II-would you believewe chartered some of these former vessels back to run Australia's shipping interests. In 1956 the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission was formed. It operated under the registered name of the Australian National 15 Line. Then, in 1974, the operational side of the business came under the Australian Shipping Commission Act. In 1988 it became ANL. In 1989 the Australian Shipping Commission ceased-on 30 June-and on 1 July it became a wholly owned public company of the Commonwealth. Contrary to what some speakers on the government side have said today-rather selectively-that somehow the use of these vessels was a Country Party plot just to look after its interests in north Queensland or to service inefficient routes to north Queensland and Darwin, the Australian owned shipping companies over the years have moved in and out of various commissions and acts. They have been sold, replaced, leased, changed and their forms of administration have varied from outright ownership by the Commonwealth right through to a wholly owned public company with the Commonwealth as the sole shareholder. This so-called icon has never been one continuous thread going through Australian shipping. It is something that has been changed, massaged, to suit the convenience of the day. So to come in here trying to create the myth that somehow it is an icon is quite dishonest. As a National Party member, I resent the idea that somehow this was done over the years to satisfy the Country Party. It was not. In many instances the ANL was kept going not to satisfy the Country Party but to satisfy the unions which were involved in its running. One of the government speakers talked emotively about this nation 'girt by sea' - this maritime nation. If the government really believed that, would it have allowed ANL to get into such an appalling mess? In Queensland at present we have had five meat works close. Those five meat works depend very heavily on export and, in depending on export, one of their chief costs is freight. It ance. seems to me appalling that beef can be sold in America on the hoof 60 per cent dearer than it is in Australia on the hoof. It can be processed, trucked across America-across the American wharves-brought across the Pacific and across our wharves and finally sold in the shops for 40 to 50c a kilo less than the price of Australian beef. The point I am making is that we had an efficient delivery system of our own. Had the government been fair dinkum about this nation 'girt by sea', and had the government been fair dinkum about wanting to enhance Australian exports, it would not have allowed itself to be held to ransom by the union. It would not have allowed the Australian National Line to become an international joke. In August 1994 the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) declared that you couldn't give the government shipping line away-you couldn't give ANL away. In the bill before us today-the ANL Sale Bill 1995-we have seen the ultimate confirmation that the minister was indeed right. We certainly can't give it away. In fact, as Laura Tingle so succinctly put it, we are going to ask someone to take it off our hands. As she said, and it should be etched on the government benches so they never forget it: . .. taxpayers are actually paying $100 million to have what is left of their sad little shipping linenote the words 'sad little shipping line'taken off their hands. The government's action, or rather its inaction, over the sale of ANL is nothing short of disgraceful. It is disgraceful for three reasons. Firstly, the government has put the interests of its union mates ahead of the interests of all Australians, ahead of the interests of this nation. Don't give us this pretty stuff of a nation 'girt by sea' and allow this rort to go on a continuous basis at the hands of the unions. Secondly, for the last four years the government has used this so-called asset sale to artificially cut its budget deficit. Thirdly, the government has taken too long to come to terms with the real problem of this ailing national shipping line and has chosen to sit on its hands. Put simply, the government cannot be trusted on such issues of national importThe government believes the bill provides a way out of the ANL troubles, but we know that the bill before us today simply provides a framework for a sale agreement to occur. There is no guarantee, even at this stage, that a sale will happen. Going by the strike actions of the Maritime Union of Australia last September, one wonders whether such an agreement will ever be possible. As the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) who spoke previously said, it is very interesting that they have threatened that they can call a strike at 20 minutes notice. That puts the government on notice. It puts the government in the position: 'Guys, you step out of line just one iota and we'll crash your shipping line on the eve of an election.' That is a threat the government obviously takes very seriously. Rather than the government sitting down with the potential buyer-P&O-and striking up a deal on behalf of Australian taxpayers, who are the ultimate owners of ANL, it seems the government is more preoccupied with satisfying the Maritime Union. The government has said that it wants a deal struck by 31 October. This bill provides for a deadline of 1 January 1996, or the bill is automatically repealed and we are back to square one. So in essence the bill before us today is simply a short-term solution. If the sale negotiations fail, so does the bill. The real focus of the ANL debate should be back on the government: how it and the minister in particular have failed to resolve this issue. I would like to deal with the board fees because I think they go to the heart of the ethics of this business. The whole business of consultancy and government-appointed directors has become a farce during the term of this government. In the context of this whole saga we find that 22 August 1984 is a significant date. Not only was it the day when Minister Brereton made the infamous statement, 'You couldn't give it away,' but it was also the day that the minister sacked the old part-time nine-member board of ANL and appointed Neville Wran, Malcolm Turnbull and John Spark to either salvage it or sell it. As members will remember from that very emotive speech by the minister, the new board was given six months to come up with the goods. The minister personally pleaded for special remuneration packages for these three so called experts who just happen to be three old mates of the Labor Party. That was just a coincidence, of course. For the six-month period they were handsomely rewarded: Wran as chairman received $151,000 and Turnbull and Spark received $120,000 each. The total was $392,000 for two days' work per week. But, as we know, the new board did not come up with a solution within six months. The board's term was subsequently extended-first to nine months, then to eleven months and then to 12 months. Each time, the government went back to the Remuneration Tribunal asking for more money; each time digging deeper and deeper into taxpayers' pockets. By the end of their 12-month stint the three directors will have cost taxpayers around $816,000 with no result on ANL. If we project forward to 31 October, the government's preferred date, we are looking at 14 months; if we project forward to 31 December, we are looking at 16 months. As previous speakers have said, it will be interesting to know if any additional fees are paid to these people for the tail end of the exercise. One could say that, like the rest of the ANL saga, the government has been content to continue to throw good money after bad, especially when it comes to so-called experts who were paid to fix the problems. The matter of RetainCo is a very interesting sidelight to this issue. The bill makes provision to facilitate the sale of the Commonwealth's shares in the Australian National Line Ltd-ANL. Many would say that this bill has been a long time coming-four years in fact-since the government first announced the proposed sale of ANL. The bill provides the framework within which a sale agreement will hopefully be struck between the government and P&O by 1 January 1996. As I have said, if no agreement is reached by that date we are back to square one-trying to flog off an even more devalued government asset. This bill establishes a corporate entityRetainCo-which will be used as a vehicle to marshall all the assets and liabilities of ANL. If the sale proceeds, RetainCo will hold and manage the residual assets of ANL: in other words, those vessels that P&O does not want. That involves some five vessels. The latest sale price we have heard touted for ANL is a meagre $19.5 million. Ironically, in this bill the government has set aside some $15 million of taxpayers' money to establish RetainCo, together with further unspecified appropriations to keep RetainCo afloat after the proposed sale has been completed. What a farce-to get $19.5 million for your primary asset and then have to put $15 million aside to prop up the entity that has to look after the bits and pieces left at the end! I understand that under the sale agreement P&O could also take some $140 million in operating debt, leaving ANL or RetainCo with a potential debt from its long-term leasing arrangements of $183 million. That mayor may not be realised. As a previous government speaker has said, it could weB be that that debt is liquidated; on the other hand, it might not be liquidated. If it is not, it will make this sorry saga even more embarrassing for the government and will show just how inept this whole operation has been. The bill also provides for the continued guarantee of debts and liabilities of Retaineo in addition to any foreseeable borrowing requirements of Retaineo. Nevertheless, I am ple-se? to see that the government's guarantee IS 10 place. The government believes that the potential debt of $183 million will be paid back through income earned from subleasing arrangements. Interestingly, one company that will be helping the government to pay off this potential debt is Queensland Alumina Ltd which operates from Gladstone in my electorate of Hinkler in central Queensland. QAL subleases two ANL ships-the River Boyne and the River Embley. These specially built ships have been subleased from ANL for 20 years and the leases are due to expire in the year 2003. They are designed to carry 71,000 tonne loads of bauxite from Weipa to Gladstone for the refinery. If the sale proceeds, QAL will be subleasing from Retaineo not ANL. In essence, the sale will have little or no effect on the leasing arrangements, and that is one thing which I am pleased to see. That aside, the government still has to recover this potential debt of $183 million. However, not all the arrangements with the ships may necessarily be as prudential as is the case with QAL. It is probably no coincidence that we are debating this bill today. I am certain that the minister is anxious to complete the debate in the House, given the fact that the Senate in9uiry into the ANL sale debacle began last Fnday. In evidence to the inquiry Mr Bolitho said that ANL was not bankrupt in August 1994 when the minister replaced the board and made the remarkable statement, 'You couldn't give it away.' Mr Bolitho said that ANL was certainly undercapitalised by deliberate government policy in operating in a difficult market environment; it was a going concern with net assets in excess of $100 million. We have to look at the whole scenario and sheet the blame back to where it deservedly belongs. The puppet master in this whole exercise has been Minister Brereton. He is the person who rammed home the only decent sale of ANL assets-the share in Australian Stevedores. He is the person who set up the deal allowing the financially strapped ANL to lend money, would you believe, to the buyer; to say nothing of the $20 million support for local mariners. He is the man who sacked the nine-man board of ANL. He appointed the Wran-Turnbull-Spark triumvirate. He was the person who said, 'You couldn't give it away.' He is the person who stands condemned in the context of this sale.",127
221,Mr TRUSS,COMMITTEE,"Let me add my condemnation of the government for the way in which this particular piece of legislation, the ANL Sale Bill, has come before the House in such a rushed form today. Obviously the government has plenty to hide when it comes to dealing with ANL. The government has plenty of shame behind it in its dealings in this matter over the years. The government is attempting to rush this legislation through without any kind of public scrutiny so that the activities of the government are hidden and not exposed in all of their ugliness. Many of the Labor mates are very prominent in this whole exercise. The Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) and many of his colleagues and friends are certainly up to their ears in the scandal of ANL. Australia's once proud shipping line incurs incredible losses, sees its past achievements in recent times going from one disaster to another, and now faces the ultimate humiliation. The minister says he cannot give ANL away. We now have a strange piece of legislation coming before the parliament which fails to explain t1-te government's proposals, fails to explain what the government has in mind, and certainly deserves the condemnation of the Australian people.

222,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Hospitals",130
223,Mr CHARLES,ADJOURNMENT,"I bring to the attention of the House and the Minister' for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) the very demonstrable need, in the southern part of my electorate of La Trobe and in the south-eastern growth corridor of greater metropolitan Melbourne, for additional hospital facilities and, in particular, public hospital facilities. The south-eastern growth corridor is made up of the city of Casey and the shire of Cardinia. Within those metropolitan areas are the villages of Berwick, Cranbourne and Pakenham. This south-eastern growth corridor is the fastest growing region in Victoria and one of the fastest growing regions in all of Australia. The area is served by three hospitals-the Dandenong public hospital, Berwick Hospital Inc. and the Pakenham hospital. Both Berwick and Pakenham hospitals are former bush nursing hospitals and served for a very long time in the outer areas of Melbourne as bush nursing hospitals. Berwick, in particular, has been highly successful in the last two decades in expanding its facilities, in growing, modernising and remaining a private hospital but truly community based and served by the community. It is the community that owns the hospital, and it operates with the community's doctors for the good of the local community. But it is a private hospital, and all of us in this place recognise the very deleterious effects on our national health system of falling numbers of people registered in private health care. This high growth area has a demand for additional acute beds. In fact, the hospital beds and facilities at the moment are not satisfactory. The growth that we are experiencing is putting even further pressure on the need for additional beds. The city of Casey is growing at the rate of 50 new families a month. The forward planning estimates suggest that by the year 2011 there will be an additional 250,000 living in the south-eastern growth corridor, centred on the beautiful village of Berwick. My electorate, as I have said on many occasions, is really a community of communities. It is made up of small villages and people who band together to form real communities. That is a rarity in society today where our cities are taken over and dominated by regional shopping centres and where a sense of community is unfortunately disappearing. But there is still a real sense of community and community feeling in the village of Berwick. That has been enhanced by the growth that has occurred in tertiary education facilities in our area in the last few years. The Casey College of TAFE is now operating and is going to be added to by a new campus of Monash University. At a public meeting some four years ago, I found that the people in the area really demanded additional education facilities. We had a great need for these facilities and we put them in the middle of the growth corridor in the village of Berwick on a major transport hub-that is, on a major rail line at a railhead and at a freeway exit. The area really has it all. We have the people, the demand, the need, the transport facilities-links in and out-and an excellent private hospital, together with the surgeons and doctors, to service the area. I call on the minister and the state government to give very careful consideration to locating the new and needed public hospital facilities in the south-eastern growth corridor of Melbourne in the beautiful village of Berwick. Sri Lanka",130
224,Mr GRACE,ADJOURNMENT,"With sadness, I draw to the attention of the House the horror of the continuing tragic ethnic war in Sri Lanka. According to Medecins Sans Frontieres, the French based agency which is providing medical assistance to the war victims in Sri Lanka, the latest incident that took place on 22 September 1995 at a school located in the north-eastern coastal town of Nagar Kovil, in the Jaffna Peninsula, saw artillery shelling by the Sri Lankan security forces leaving 100 hundred civilians dead, including at least 34 children. The MSF, for which the Australian government also provided funds recently to support its good work in the war-ravaged areas, has further revealed that 22 amputations were performed at the town's hospital by local and MSF doctors. The irony is that this incident took place within hours of the Sri Lankan government imposing censorship on reporting news of its operations in the Tamil homeland. Only in July this year there was another massacre of civilians in the Jaffna Peninsula as a result of the aerial bombardment of the St Peter and St Paul Catholic Church where, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross, over 100 civilians, including 13 babies, perished on the church premises. Those massacres are a clear contravention of the Geneva convention relating to international armed conflicts. Our government, which is deeply committed to upholding human rights, should publicly condemn such crimes committed against humanity and should be alarmed at the Sri Lankan government's determination to carry out such actions with impunity. Our government should endeavour to persuade both parties in the conflict to end the fighting, to accept international medication and to find a lasting political settlement to the long standing legitimate demands of the Tamil people of Sri Lanka. This is not a case of a member standing up and making propaganda of the Tamil cause. This situation has been verified by the International Committee of the Red Cross. I have heard all the excuses from supporters of the Sri Lankan government about how the Tamils broke the cease-fire which was in place earlier this year. Time will not permit me to go into the reasons as to why that cease-fire was broken. Suffice it to say that at this particular time we are talking about the massacre of innocent women and children. The incident should be condemned. Both parties-and, surely, our country could playa part-should sit once more around the table to see whether this uncalled-for massacre of innocent women and children can be stopped.",131
225,Mr CLEARY,ADJOURNMENT,"What a nice touch it was to see the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou)-the electoral home of Jeff Kennett's egalitarian corporate mates-leading the coalition's outpouring of concern for ordinary workers. Of course, north of the Yarra we really appreciate those Toorak socialites and charity queens who so graciously convene fundraising nights for the poor. But, as the tax experts in this House know, a charity night is much easier on the pocket than a progressive tax regime. Regrettably, one cannot help but think there is a touch of hypocrisy about this alleged concern for ordinary battlers. On 6 December 1994, during a debate on a matter of public importance, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello) was howling like a dog at a bone about the power of the unions in telling us that Bill Kelty controlled the government and that trade unionists merely organised a wages claim when they wanted to improve their financial position. I would have thought that if the member for Higgins truly believed that'battlers were doing it hard he would be supporting their wage claims rather than deriding them or their union. Just to complicate things, members of the coalition are now arguing that under Bill Kelty and Martin Ferguson the wages of trade unionists have declined. So what is the real story? Are trade unionists running the country and dishing out huge wage increases to battlers or are battlers-as I thought the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was claiming-suffering under a Labor government? The answer is pretty simple, and no amount of rubbery statistics from the government front-bench can camouflage the reality. The problem is the coalition does not have one single policy designed to improve the lot of ordinary working people. In the north and north-west of Melbourne unemployment is in excess of 13 per cent. Amongst teenagers it is as high as 65 per cent. This, despite the fact that electorates in the north and north west are or have been represented by a Prime Minister, a deputy prime minister, the Treasurer (Mr Willis), the President of the ALP, an industry minister, and a number of parliaWages mentary secretaries. Recent policy announcements confirm that the government believes all it has to do is retrain the long-term unemployed and the problem of unemployment will disappear. Only this month the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) announced a $2 million program for youth unemployment. Apart from the fact that the press release announcing the $2 million expenditure is full of meaningless marketing cliches such as 'the program is about informing people and developing effective local strategies for responding to young people's ideas', which means absolutely nothing and says nothing about real jobs, it pales into insignificance in the context of the government's decision in the 1995 budget to cut $1.2 billion from labour market programs. So much for labour market programs. You have to wonder about the government's real commitment to the unemployed. On 31 August 1995, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training accused the coalition of advocating work for the dole, yet conveniently ignored the fact that two years earlier the member for Lilley (Mr Swan) in this House said: Organisations such as meals-on-wheels would be one pathway back into employment particularly for the long-term unemployed ... Meals-on-wheels would allow the unemployed to participate something back to the community in which they live. Asking the long-term unemployed to work off the dole in meals-on-wheels is identical to the kind of tory authoritarianism the member for Lilley accuses the coalition of advocating. The reason work for the dole is proposed in one fashion or another by members of both sides of the House is that free market policies are not working. And, as professor Bob Gregory has pointed out ad nauseam, the loss of employment in low income neighbourhoods is the major reason for the growing discrepancy between low and top income earners. Flowers and tears at a women's conference in Beijing are cold comfort for the unemployed women of Coburg and Brunswick who once worked in the textile industry and are now victims of these free market policies. The Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) acknowledged in an interview on Wednesday 19 April: This country, along with the great bulk of developed countries, has experienced an increase in disparities in market incomes. Although he goes on to argue that broadening the social welfare net has significantly offset these disparities, he would be aware that people in the north and north-west of Melbourne want jobs and the independence that jobs provide. Newspaper advertisements designed by John Singleton or one of the mates depicting the horrors of coalition wages policy are no substitute for policies directed at the most profound source of inequality-unemployment. The government must find the money, whether from taxation or the compulsorily acquired superannuation funds, to invest in those regions which are experiencing unnecessarily high unemployment. There are any number of projects-Sydney Road Shop Top development, a conservatorium of community music, the upgrading of the Upfield railway line, a rapid rail link to Melbourne airport, redevelopment of the old Pentridge prison site and the current Essendon airport site, and the refurbishment of some key sporting facilities including facilities for and give women's sport which would enhance the northern suburbs of Melbourne. It is about time the government gave it some serious thought. National Crime Authority",132
226,Mr CLEELAND,ADJOURNMENT,"MCEwen) (7.43 p.m.)Recently, my attention was drawn to a book Galbally for the Defence written by Mr Frank Galbally, a barrister and solicitor from the state of Victoria. In particular, my attention was drawn to a chapter entitled 'The Great NCA Disaster', which relates to the prosecution of Albert Grassby and Guiseppe Sergi on a charge of conspiring to pervert the course of justice in publishing defamatory material and Jennifer Sergi for publishing defamatory matter. At best, the chapter can be said to be a chapter of fact, fiction and just plain misrepresentation. For example, on page 121 it refers to the late 'Donald MCKay'. The spelling of the name Mackay is wrong. On page 122 it says: In 1979 the New South Wales government set up a royal commission, headed by Mr Justice Woodward, to inquire into the disappearance and possible murder of Donald MCKayWrong. In 1977 a royal commission was established but not to inquire into the disappearance and murder of Donald Mackay-and everyone knows what the Woodward royal commission was about. It is then alleged on page 122 that Mr Justice Woodward asserted that Mr Sergi was a principal drug trafficker and was one of the ringleaders responsible for the murder of Donald Mackay. That is false; it was not at all asserted by Mr Justice Woodward. It goes on later to talk about the person who was charged and convicted of Mackay's murder, 'James Bazeley'. The spelling is totally wrong. On page 124 there is a reference to Mr Grassby as the director of the Human Relations Commission. That is wrong. Mr Grassby was never the director of the Human Relations Commission. He was, in fact, a commissioner of community relations. It then goes on to talk about Michael Maher a 'Liberal' member of the New South Wales parliament. All of us who know Michael Maher know full well that he has never been a member of the Liberal Party and was, in fact, a member of this House and is a member of the Australian Labor Party. On the same page it refers to Chris Sumner as the Attorney-General of South Australia. In 1980, Chris Sumner was the leader of the Legislative Council in South Australia. He did not become the Attorney-General of South Australia until 1982. Also on page 124, it states: . . . and that secretly within the walls of the (National Crime Authority) a dastardly plot was being hatchedThis was in 1980. It may surprise Mr Galbally to learn that the National Crime Authority was not established until 1984. It really is a pretty gross misrepresentation. Then we get on to a whole lot of factual matter. We go to page 126, where again we have a reference to this: ... in July 1980 Al Grassby showed the letter to Liberal MP Michael MaherThat is a second reference to a person who has never been a member of the Liberal Party. Then we go to page 127 where there is a quote from a witness who allegedly gave evidence in the prosecution. The book states: 'I am satisfied that this document was not written by the person who wrote the letters to the press,' Dr Laing told the court. Dr Laing never gave evidence in that case and was not a witness. I would have thought that alone was enough to cause anyone grave concern-that a person like Mr Galbally would print and publish a book saying that people gave evidence in a court case when, in fact, they did not. There is another part there which is quite gross and wrong-for example, on page 134 it states:",133
227,The NCA,ADJOURNMENT," according to the magistrate, Mr Williams... had passed from zeal into zealotry. That was not said at all by the magistrate. If I go to the transcript of the judgment, on page 21, in fact the magistrate said the following: Zeal in a good cause is a commendable and indeed praiseworthy thing. I've got no doubt that the National Crime Authority is composed of many zealous men and women. I am concerned though that zealousness when taken to extremes becomes zealotry, the very antithesis of what the person was seeking to achieve. He did not accuse the National Crime Authority of passing from zeal to zealotry in this case. There are so many other examples in this particular chapter that it worries me that the public are now reading a book by a prominent criminal barrister which is full of distortions and untruths. I believe that it reflects badly on NCA the National Crime Authority and it is wrong . (Time expired) Vasta, Mr A.",134
228,Mr KATTER,ADJOURNMENT,"In 1989, Justice Angelo Vasta was stripped of his judgeship in Queensland and stood down as a judge-the first time in Queensland's history and, possibly, in Australia's history, that that had happened. I shall be writing to Mat Foley, the Attorney-General in Queensland, requesting the restoration of ex-justice Angelo Vasta to that position. My reasons for doing this are that he was accused of an acquaintance with Terry Lewis, the disgraced former commissioner of police in Queensland. If that is a basis upon which people should be punished, then a significant proportion of the entire population of Brisbane should be similarly punished. The second thing that he was accused of was providing false information in a defamation case-information so petty as to be unbelievable and extraordinary that it could even be considered in such a case. But, in any event, what we had here was the word of Justice Vasta and his wife against two fairly trendy journalists who were in the car and who obviously wanted to denigrate the man. Whether the story was spurious or not, quite clearly it was a matter of their two words against their two words. People who know Angelo Vasta and his wife-and I must say that I do not know Angelo Vasta; in fact I have never spoken to him in my life-tell me he was not that sort of person. That was the second issue, so petty that it could not be believed that it would even be mentioned by the three justices who recommended his dismissal. The third issue was a very serious onethat he had been involved in a series of sham tax transactions. The appeals tribunal heard this case and overturned it. It was decided that his brother-in-law, Mr Coco, was entirely innocent of the charges that were made against him. In any event, Justice Vasta was once removed in that he simply had shares in the company involved. What has happened here is that the international jurists have decided that a great injustown-said, ice has been done and needs to be turned around. Neil Turner, a member of the state house and a long-serving member of the Criminal Justice Commission in Queensland, has come forward and said that this action must be reversed. Mr Con Sciacca, a minister in the government here in this place, has come forward and said that a terrible injustice has been done and needs to be reversed. Mr Lester, a minister of the Crown for some 15 years in the State of Queensland, has come forward and said that this decision needs to be reversed. At the time the decision was being made, no evidence whatever was provided to any member of the state parliament against Justice Vasta. There was simply no evidence on the record. We were assured that evidence would be forthcoming further down the track. Not only has that evidence not come forward, but what scant issues existed at the time have been reversed by the tribunals and various courts of the land since. Mr Bevis-You were in the parliament; how did you vote?",134
229,Mr KATTER,ADJOURNMENT,"I take the very valid interjection from the honourable member. I voted against Justice Vasta at the time, as did Mr Lester, most certainly, and as did a large number of people who are going to come forward. Mr Bevis-And Neil Turner?",135
230,Mr KATTER,ADJOURNMENT,"It is a serious thing that you say and it needs to be addressed. The reason we did that-and why all the ALP members did it, I am sure-was that we were told that evidence was going to be forthcoming. We had recommendations from eminent justices telling us that we had to sack him. We had all of the important people at the time in the state house telling us that evidence would be forthcoming. As Lyn Powell, Speaker at the time, said to me, 'This person is being sacked because he is Sicilian.' Whether that was an overstatement of the situation or not, I know that a person who worked with Justice Vasta for many years-a close friend of mine though a person who does not share my political views, who has the exact opposite political views to my 'He is a very decent, honest, hard working person and there is no way in the world that he would have been associated with any dishonesty in any way.' What Con Sciacca said was correct: he was not a member of the 'club'. From the first day of his appointment, as with Bob Andrews, Chief Justice in Queensland, he was not a member of the club. (Time expired) Australian Broadcasting Corporation",135
231,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"I am a strong supporter of the ABC as an important national institution in Australia and I believe that the ABC has a responsibility as a national broadcaster to do two things: firstly, to meet its national responsibilities, and, secondly, to pay great heed to local and regional sensitivities so that it maximises both its national product and the regional and local product. It is in that context that I speak tonight on the ABC board decision today to make changes to ABC news and current affairs arrangements. In August 1994 a proposal was put to the board to change ABC news and current affairs to have the effect that local news, produced in each state, would be at 6.30 every evening-6.30 p.m. being the traditional ABC ratings graveyard-that the national news, nationally produced, would be at 7 o'clock, and that there would be a national 7.30 Report at 7.30 p.m. The decisions released today by the ABC board are better than those floated to the board in August of 1994, but in some very important respects are bad, in my view. The decisions made by the ABC board today are worthy of reading into the record. Firstly: There will be a new 7.30 Report. From Monday December 4 there will be a single program reporting on international, national and state issues. 7 state programs will continue until Friday December l. That effectively axes the state-produced 7.30 Reports, and in Western Australia axes the local Perth-produced 7.30 Report. Secondly: The 7 pm news will continue to be produced in all states and the Northern Territory. This is a substantial improvement on the proposal floated to the board in 1994. Thirdly: News will begin introducing news on the hour from midday until 6 pm as soon as possible in 1996. State newsrooms will be encouraged to break into afternoon scheduling where major stories of state or national interest demand coverage. This is a positive development. Fourthly: . .. in 1996 and 1997, ABC news will move towards a 24 hour operation with newsbreaks throughout the day and expanded services at key times. This will include a late evening national news. Again, I think this is a positive development. Fifthly: There will be a new program called ""Australian Correspondent"" ... modelled on ... ""Foreign Correspondent"". The program will report on the people and issues of regional Australia . . . The program is weekly and is intended to go to air in ... March 1996. This is a positive development as well and I understand that, to complement this program, three new regional offices will be established outside the capital cities, which will make a total of eight regional television bureaus, and that regional correspondents will be appointed in each capital city. I understand that in Perth a regional correspondent will be appointed to cover the south-west of Western Australia and that one of the new regional offices will be in Broome. It is also proposed that there be a new weekly state program, to be called 'State Lateline', which I assume will become 'Stateline', to be broadcast at 10.30 p.m. on Friday nights. It is expected that the compere or interviewer is likely to be the state reporter for the 7.30 Report. The program is scheduled to go to air in February 1996. What is the analysis of these changes? It is that local news stays but state and local current affairs dies. For outlying states, The particularly states like Western Australia, this is, in my view, a major blow to the quality and diversity of news and current affairs commentary, and that applies particularly in a one-newspaper state like Western Australia. The ABC board must think that we are complete mugs if it believes the proposed state Lateline, to be shown at 10.30 p.m. on Friday, is any respectable lip-service to statebased current affairs. It is not even a respectable sop. Let us be quite frank about that. Noone is going to watch a 10.30 Lateline show on a Friday night. The ABC might as well not bother. If the ABC board is serious about state Lateline, it should find a different times lot for it. It is essential that when these changes are introduced there be an effective monitoring regime in place to ensure that the nationally produced news and the nationally produced 7.30 Report cover stories from regional Australia, from the outlying states, and that there is a sufficient catering for news for states such as Western Australia. I urge the ABC board not to believe that those of us who watch these things are complete mugs and not to think that a 10.30 show on a Friday night will be watched by anyone. If it is serious about this, it should give it a decent slot. Otherwise, frankly, it should not bother. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 7.59 p.m. NA The following notice was given: Mr Walker to move: That, in accordance with the provisions Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Redevelopment of Wool shed site, Barton, ACT.

249,Dr LAWRENCE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Areas are targeted on the basis of the aged care program's needs based planning model. The planning model has two major components. Total floor Base rental The first is the planning benchmark ratio is currently set at 100 per 1000 people aged 70 and area leased rate per over (broken down as 40 nursing home places: 50 sq.m hostel places: 10 care package places per 1000 $118 people aged 70 and over) and which will be progressively achieved over time. The ratios aim to $46 achieve an equitable distribution of aged care $60 places within each State and Territory and equitable access to services by older Australians. The second component is consideration of the needs of planning regions by Aged Care Advisory Committees on the basis of quantitative and qualitative local data. These committees are of 8-10 members of which only two are departmental officers. The remaining independent members are appointed by me on the basis of their individual knowledge, experience and ability to contribute to the planning of aged care and not as representatives of particular organisations. The Aged Care Advisory Committees consider matters such as existing service provision and client profiles, for example, the numbers of clients in residential services, long stay hospital patients and those receiving HACC services, service utilisation and regional demographics (such as ethnic mix and financial status of the population). The Aged Care Advisory Committees provide recommendations to me about the distribution of places to planning regions. The targeted planning regions are then advertised in local and national newspapers in order to attract applications for funding. (2) The Waverley, Manly, Baulkham Hills, Hornsby, Ku-ring-gai, North Sydney, Warringah and Pittwater areas of NSW were determined to be target areas in the 1995-96 round of funding applications primarily on the basis of comparative need for services in relation to other areas of NSW as demonstrated by current provision ratios. In addition, the Aged Care Advisory Committee considered local matters such as interest in 'establishing services, the likelihood of establishing services quickly, the existence of Approvals-inPrinciple for the establishment of services, areas previously advertised in recent funding rounds and the facilities available in neighbouring States for those areas close to State borders. On this basis, target areas were recommended as follows: (a) Waverley-Applications have been sought for the provision of hostel places for this SLA on the basis of need for services (the current ratio for hostel places is 40.43 places per 1000 people aged over 70). There has been interest in the provision of hostel places in Waverley and feedback from the community and the local Aged Care Assessment Team supported the provision of additional hostel beds in this area. In addition, the adjoining areas of Randwick and Woollahra have very high need for services. (b) Manly-Applications for the provision of hostel places have been sought for this SLA on the basis of need for services (the current hostel ratio is 13.86 places per 1000 people aged 70 and over). In addition, there is strong interest in and commitment to providing hostel places in this area. (c) Baulkham Hills-Applications for the provision of hostel places have been sought for this SLA on the basis of need for services (the current hostel ratio is 32.17 places per 1000 people aged 70 and over). In addition, there is strong interest in and commitment to providing hostel places in this area. (d) and (e) Hornsby/Ku-ring-gai-The Hornsby/Ku-ring-gai area has been targeted for the provision of care package services. While the area is well serviced in terms of hostel places (69:1000 people aged over 70), 768 places are located at the Anglican Retirement Villages complex. This facility has attracted substantial migration from other parts of Sydney which has created pressures on community and other services in caring for the local frail aged. The needs are such that the provision of care package services was considered to be appropriate by the Aged Care Advisory Committee.. (0 North Sydney-Applications for the provision of care package services have been sought for this planning area on the basis of need (there are currently no care packages available in this area). The adjoining SLAs of Lane Cove and Willoughby also have needs for services. As it is very difficult to instigate hostel projects in these areas, due to a shortage of available land, North Sydney has been recommended as a targeted are for the provision of care packages. In addition, strong interest in providing care packages has been demonstrated in this area. (g) and (h) WarringahlPittwater-Applications for the provision of care package services have been sought for this planning area on the basis of need (there are currently no care package services available in this area). This area draws aged veterans from all over NSW and, as such, services a wider population than the immediate local area. In addition, there is a need for appropriate aged care services for the Armenian, German, Italian and Chinese populations that reside in these areas. There is no interest in developing hostel services due to the unavailability of suitable land. However, there is demonstrated interest in the provision of care package services. Telstra: Australian Flag Competition (Question No. 2582) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 24 August 1995: Is it a fact that Telstra, formerly Telecom, announced a competition in its phonecard collectors' bulletin inviting entrants to design a new Australian flag; if so, (a) when was the competition announced, (b) when did he first learn of the competition, (c) who within Telstra was responsible for initiating the competition and (d) is the competition a proper function of a government business enterprise. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. I have been advised by Telstra that the competition was run to coincide with the release of the Australia Day Phonecard and was part of the children's activities pages of the Australian Phonecard Monthly, a bi-monthly newsletter and catalogue for phonecard collectors. (a) I have been advised by Telstra that the competition was announced in the January Edition of the Australian Phonecard Monthly. (b) I first became aware of this competition following a similar Question on Notice asked by Senator Knowles on 20 June 1995 (No. 2224) which was answered on 23 August 1995. (c) I have been advised by Telstra that the competition was initiated by the Phonecard Collector Services area of Te1stra Payphone Services. (d) The theme and purpose of competitions is a matter for Telstra management. However I have been advised by Telstra that following a complaint about the competition to Telstra, the Company subsequently published the following statement in the next edition of the publication: ""Telecom does not support any move to promote the Republic cause nor the promotion of a new Australian national flag"".",188
