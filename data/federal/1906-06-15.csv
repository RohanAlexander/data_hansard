0,NA,Unknown,"member for Bland will not be entertained, because both Houses of this Parliament have already definitely decided where the Federal Capital shall be. Honorable MEMBERS - No , no.",44
1,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"In my qpinion it would be undignified for this Parliament 'o entertain the idea of permitting honourable members to go running around New South Wales to look for another site. wishes of the "" w in , tie, or wrangle"" party in this House should not be acceded to.",44
2,Mr KELLY,Unknown,What about the transcontinental railway ?,44
3,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"If the transcontinental railway cannot stand on its merits, the proposal for its construction should be thrown out of the House. We do not want information to be offered to us for all time, and after having arrived at a selection we should not allow New South Wales to place us in a false position. According to my interpretation of the Constitution, we have a perfect right to decide where the Federal Capital shall be, and we should not permit the people of New - jouth Wales, through their Parliament, to dictate to us in the matter.",44
4,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Would not the honourable member allow them to have some say ?,44
5,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I would allow them to have the say to which they are entitled under the Constitution, and no more. would not allow them to dictate to this Parliament as to the particular quarter of New South, Wales in which the Federal Capital should be placed. I object to the suggestion of the honourable member for Bland, because the Federal Capital Site question has been already settled, and should not be re-ojpened.",44
6,Mr FULLER,Unknown,Illawarra) [3.57] - I full y endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Bland.,44
7,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Would honourable member include Tumut and the Upper Murray among the sites to be inspected ?,44
8,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I should like to do the Minister a good turn, but unfortunately his action has afforded some justification for the remarks of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie with regard to the "" win, tie, or wrangle"" party. He, in conjunction with the Postmaster-General, certainly qualified himself for that designation. I hope that every opportunity will be afforded to honourable members to inspect that portion of New South Wales territory which has recently been set aside by the New South Wales Government, and reported on at considerable expense. The matter to which I wish specially to direct attention is one which relates to the Department of the Minister of Trade and Customs. When the Commerce Act was before us, certain statements were made by the Minister,, which led the butter producers of the ComThe monwealth to believe that their industry would not be interfered with. During the recess a Minister convened a conference in New South Wales, to which representatives of the butter industry in all the States were invited. The result of that conference was anything but satisfactory.",44
9,Sir WILLAM LYNE,Unknown,"On the contrary, it was absolutely satisfactory, and I am now acting upon its report.",44
10,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I contend that it was unsatisfactory. Yesterday the Minister received a large and influential deputation, which was introduced by the honourable member for Moira, and, as far as one can judge from the reports published in the newspapers, the Minister is now inclined to retreat from his former position.",44
11,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"No , I am not.",44
12,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"All that I desire is that the Minister should make a definite statement as to his intentions. The official in New South Wales whom he left to occupy the chair at the conference in Sydney when I he hurried away to the Hume electorate, in consequence of a little speech made by the leader of the Opposition",44
13,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"That is not fair, because that had nothing to do with my movements.",44
14,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The official referred to made a definite statement, but now the Minister appears inclined to recede from the position laid down by his officer. I want to know definitely what are the intentions of the Minister. Does he intend to insist not the upon compulsory grading and branding in connection with alii butter exported from Australia, or has he receded from that position? He said yesterday that he had not made up his mind.",44
15,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"That was on one particular point only, not on the question of grading.",44
16,Mr FULLER,Unknown,I should' like to have definite information on the point regarding which the Minister had not made up his mind.,44
17,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The honourable member will get it when I issue the regulations. Mir. FULLER - It may be necessary to take some action before the regulations are issued.,44
18,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Do not make any threats.,45
19,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I am not making any threat; but regarding the contradictory - statements which have been made as to this matter, I should like to have from the Minister now a definite statement as to whether he proposes to insist on compulsory grading in relation to the export of our butter, or whether he does not.",45
20,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Yes . The honourable member has a definite answer now.  representatives of New South Wales would make up their minds as to how many Capital Sites they want inspected, where they are situated, and which one they favour most. When they have decided amongst themselves the rest of us would like to go and inspect the favoured place.",45
21,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Will the honourable member take the verdict of the majority of the New South Wales members?  honourable member for Wentworth to make that suggestion. If the New South Wales members had their way they would "" boss the show "" altogether. We are here as a kind.of break to that, especially when they trv to arrange amongst themselves as to what shall be done by the Commonwealth. I also wish to direct the attention of the Minister representing the Minister of Defence to a statement made some time ago by the Militarv Commandant of Victoria. During last session the Premier of Victoria gave n ""tea fight"" or a ""bun struggle"" down the Bay. The Military Commandant for this State was invited to attend. Whether he had too much champagne, or whether he was suffering from real pain, I do not know, but he made a remarkable statement on that occasion, to which attention was directed at the time. said that he was a State officer first and a Commonwealth officer afterwards. The Minister at the time promised that an investigation would be made into the Commandant's utterance. I should like to know whether an inquiry has been held, and, if so, whether the Minister will lav a report concerning it upon the table. I mav as well say now that I intend, for my own part, when the Estimates are under consideration, to try to compel-this gentleman to go to the State Government for his salary, in order that he may learn whose servant he is. If we do not get loyalty from officers in high places, I fail to see how we can expect it from the men in the ranks.",45
22,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Gwydir) [ 4 . 3 ] - I wish to say a word or two as to the request made to the Minister of Home Affairs in reference to the Capital Site question. I think that the request was a wise and reasonable one, especially in view of the statement laid before Parliament prior to the conciusion of last session, indicating the whole of the facts of the case with regard to the compact arrived at by the Premiers' Conference. That information and that compact changed the whole position, and induced many honourable members to reconsider the decision arrived at with reference to the site. I recognise in the compact arrived at by the Premiers' Conference, an understanding that is sacred as far as I am concerned, as a representative of the people. It was arrived at by gentlemen holding high positions, ancl should be binding on every man in this House. Feeling that that is the position, I think that the honourable member for Bland has put in his request at an opportune time. In accordance with - the compact to which I refer, the choice of the Capital Site is, in my opinion, limited to an area within 200 miles, and outside 100 miles, of Sydney. _ Now that the selection is limited to that radius, we should at least endeavour to inspect any site that has not hitherto been suggested or inspected in order that we may arrive at the very best possible decision. This is not a question of changing one's opinion. It is a case of giving an opinion upon new premises, upon - new information-informatio n that, I say fearlessly, was not in the possession of honourable members until the dose of last session. The question is one about which, He I suppose, we have heard more from the members of the Opposition, and the press that supports them, than we have heard of any other matter that has been prominent in politics in recent years. Now we are anxious to come to a decision that will be creditable alike to this House and to Australia. We ought to come to that decision with the greatest possible expedition. But we find that some honourable members ,are not, apparently, anxious to arrive at a decision at all. I hope that the Prime Minister and his colleagues will see the wisdom 28 'Adjournment. [REPRESENTATIVES. , 1 of enabling us to inspect the fresh site which has been suggested as an alternative to sites that are now found to be not available to us, so that we may be able to select the best position within the radius mentioned in the compact. If that be done, I feel confiJack. dent that we shall be able to arrive at a successful conclusion before the session closes.",45
23,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney) [4.8] I welcome the suggestion of my honourable friend and leader, the member for Bland, and disagree altogether with those honoraible members who represent other States than New South Wales. I have not to alter my opinion with regard to this question in any respect. I voted for Lyndhurst from the first. I think that Dalgetv is an unsuitrather able place for the Capital. I read in the press the other day that an unfortunate man had been frozen to death in the neighbourhood. I do not wish for my honourable friends in this Parliament any such fate as that. I do not think that Dalgety is a suitable place in anv way. The climate ]<-bad. The New South Wales Parliament represents the New South Wales people, ancl one of the reasons why New South Wales accepted the Federal Constitution was that it provided that the Capital should be within a reasonable distance of Sydney.",46
24,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [4..1.1J - [ should not have risen but for the remarks of the honourable member for Gwydir. which Iiave placed honourable members upon this side of the House in a very false posiit tion, ancl that without any warrant. He that, although we had all along been cating a just settlement of the claimsof New South Wales in regard to the Capital Site, now that the opportunity presented itself of arriving at some such arrangement, we were hanging, back. I wish to say that the Opposition representatives of New South Wales to a man are anxious to see this matter settled in the way it is proBut posed, and we are very glad indeed to find that, even at this late hour, the honormost able member for Gwydir has discovered evinever dence, of which every one has been cogbacking, nisant for years past, which, has enabled him to change his views upon it.",46
25,Mr BAMFO RD,Unknown,"Herbert) [412] had hoped that the matter of the Federal Capital had been settled finally, so far this Parliament was concerned. In regard to the suggestion of the honourable member for Bland, that honourable members might be afforded an opportunity to Adjournment. tain sites, I understand that the site which finds most favour in New South Wales is known as Macalooma. In the vicinity of that site, I understand, it is proposed to construct a dam at a place known as Barren Illustrations have recently appeared in various New South Wales newspapers, showing the appearance which the site will present when rjie dam is completed. I do hope that the Prime Minister will not listen to any proposal that we should visit that site until th-? dam in question has been constructed, so that we may be able to see the place uncier the conditions which will exist after the Avater supplv has been provided.",46
26,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"Bass) [4.13] - I am surprised that any honourable member should desire to go back upon an arrangement which was carried by a majority of this House, without bringing forward his proposal in a constitutional way. The only way in which the decision, of this Parliament in regard to the selection of the Federal Capital site can be nullified is by repealing the Seat of Government Act. The honourable meinber for Gwydir has said that vears ago a compact was entered into that the Federal Capital should be not less than 300 miles from Sydney, ancl not more than 200 miles. I am aware that there was a compact that the Seat of Government should not be less than ioo miles from the New South Wales capital.",46
27,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I base mv statement, that must be not more than 200 miles distant said from Sydney upon the representations of advothe leader of the Opposition.",46
28,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"This Parliament has already chosen a site for the Seat of Government, and it is the duty of the minority upon any question to give way. Had I been included in the minority when Dalgety was selected, I should! never afterwards have raised my voice in opposition to it. I voted with the majority on that occasion, and I still regard Dalgety as the eligible site. In my opinion, we shall reach finality if we aTe continually and filling in the way that is suggested. I do trust that the Ministry will not provide money to enable honourable - I members to engage in any more picnics, under the pretence of visiting fresh sites. as Let us adhere to the selection which we have made. If it is not acceptable to New South Wales, let us continue to sit here until its Parliament chooses to come round inspect certo our way of thinking.",46
29,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [4.15J - In reply to the remarks of the honourable member for Boothby. I shall have pleasure in giving notice on Tuesday next of a motion similar to that which I submitted last year for the selection of a Chairman of Committees. I shall give notice on Tuesday, and move the motion on Wednesday, if that meets the convenience of honourable members.",47
30,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What is the motion?,47
31,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It reads1. That the House do now proceed to the election ot a Uhnirmun of Committees. 2. T in t in the event nf mure than two members being proposed for llir. position, the clruiion shall be by ojien exhaustive ballot, anil ihsti su much uf the standing orders he suspended ns would prevent the House adopting such course. The honourable member for Coolgardie has called attention to certain correspondence relating to the deportation of Kanakas, so far as it has proceeded, with the Government of Queensland. That correspondence is in rather an imperfect state at present, but 1I have 110 objection to laving it upon the table, f have been anticipating the arrival of a letter from the Premier of Queensland in reply to inquiries which I have made, aud am now making, and this will close that part of the correspondence. investigations by the Commission, which is sitting in Queensland, are of interest to us, because they are directed, inter alia, to a determination of the number of Kanakas who have a claim-whethe r legal or otherwiseto remain in the country. that information is forthcoming we shall, by deduction, be enabled to determine the number of Kanakas who will require to be repatriated after this year, and that will assist us in arriving at an estimate of t.he cost of deporting them. also desire to ascertain the amount of the fnr.d which exists in Queensland for that purpose. When we learn that, and not till then, we shall be able to consider the responsibilities of the Queensland Government.",47
32,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Why sliould the cost of the repatriation of llie Kanakas concern us, seeing that we are not called upon to pay it ?",47
33,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,It concerns us to this extent-that it is conceiv able that if the control of the Kanakas had rested entirely witli the Parliament of Queensland it might have fixed a slightly longer period for their deportation. It might have extended the operation of the law for six or twelve months. Butour Act fixes a definite date for their deportation.,47
34,Mr WATSON,Unknown,In Queensland there is no law for compulsory deportation.,47
35,Mr DEAICIN,Unknown,"No ; but the State law provides for regular deportations. The present period is fixed by us, and to that extent we have a related responsibility with the Government of Queensland. It is impossible for us to say whether that amounts to a responsibility of a financial character until we know the facts, which are not yet in our possession. The honourable member for Maranoa has referred to some statements which were made by the Commandant of the Military Forces in Victoria. These have escaped my memory, but I will call the attention of the Minister of Defence to the remarks of the honourable member. The honourable member for Bland has suggested that opportunities might be afforded members of this Parliament to visit some of the new sites suggested for the Seat of Government, the reports upon which were laid before the House this afternoon. The plans of those sites have yet to follow. I merelv wish to point out that this Parliament has already made its choice of a particular site. That circumstance, of course, does not preclude The us from rescinding our decision, and so arriving at another. If any fresh site were chosen, the Scat of Government Act would require to be repealed. But an invitation is implied in the communication from the Premier of New South Wales, in When fonvarding these reports and plans. It might be viewed as pointing to an invitation to honourable members to visit the sites. Its acceptance would rest with them, and certainly it would not be the duty of the Government, or of honourable members who We are still satisfied with D a in t y , to throw obstacles in the way of the acquirement of further information by any who choose fo visit new sites. I hope that when we do reach the final consideration of this matter we shall be able to say that we have extended every courtesy and consideration to the wishes of the Government and representatives of New South Wales. We can lose nothing by that. No honourable member is obliged to alter his opinion, and if such an invitation arrives, I hope the Hous-J will view it favourably. The honourable member for Herbert suggested that the invitation should not be accepted as regards one of the sites until the great reservoir lake is constructed.; but I am afraid that will be long after the House has finally decided upon the site of - the Federal Capital, anil proliaUy entered into poss?ssio:i of it..",47
36,Mr MAHON,Unknown,What about the seed regulations ?,48
37,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I understand that the interpretation put upon the :«gukitions by Mr Hiiltze is different from mat adopted In' the Comptroller of Customs. Mr Holtze may he or.e of the best authorities in AusrralL-i in rtvjnrd to seeds, I prefer to rely on the Comptroller-General of Customs, wh'i has. not only had a very long r - jil'srience of his Department, but has legal training unci sound jtirUimen: to assist him in the interpretation of the actual meaning of these regulations.
