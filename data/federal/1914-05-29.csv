Debate resumed from 28th May (vide dispage 1660), on motion by Mr. JOSEPH he have leave to bring in a Bill for an Act to restore the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902-1909 with reacspect to voting by post.",18
116,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTA RY,"Wide Bay) [11.21] When this motion was last before us, I inquired whether it referred to a general Bill to amend the electoral machinery, or whether it simply dealt with the postal vote; in other words, whether it was a copy of the Bill that was sent to another place last session. The Prime was good enough to reply that the latter was the case; and that being so, my objection to the Bill is that it is useless for any practical purposes of reform. If any evidence were required as to the utility and advantage of the system adopted at the last contest, it is supplied in the fact that a larger percentage of votes were cast than at any election. We have the further fact when the postal vote was last in use, the majority of the electors who availed themselves of it consisted of men-not While I doubt very much whether it is of any great advantage for sick people to vote at all-if they are really point out that, at the last general such people were offered greater facilities at hospitals, and other places, than ever before, and that a fuller return was obtained than even under the old system. There is, however, a tal objection to postal voting. that the votes must be cast some days, and, in many instances, some weeks, before the actual polling day. It is well known that elections very frequently what takes place a few days, or even a day, before the voting; and a large number of postal votes, recorded a week or a fortnight prior, may depend on Government action, or inaction, which are not action or inaction that ultimately mine the verdict. Under the circumstances, while we may get a legal, we do not get a logical, or actual verdict of the people. We all recognise that an election be permitted to sprawl all over the year; such a suggestion is at once as an absurdity. The principle general election is the determination the whole of the electorates on one particular day. Further, postal voting is an actual violation of the secrecy of the ballot, safeguard it as we may. I do not think that any one was more anxious I was to have postal voting, or who advocated the principle, or stood by it so long as I did myself. But I found in my own town of Gympie, as is well known to the honourable member Lilley, the postal votes of two maids in one of the principal hotels were collected by a justice of the peace, that the maids Mr Fisher. did not vote as that justice of the peace desired, and that the postal votes were never delivered, but were subsequently discovered in a lower part of the sewer. Minister The honourable member for Kennedy, who knows Charters Towers well, wil l corroborate me when I say that the mine, managers, and other influential members electoral of the community there, made a houseto-house canvass while the husbands were ' at work, and collected postal votes in the interests of a particular candidate.",18
117,Mr MCDONALD,PARLIAMENTA RY,"And also threatened previous the women. that,",19
118,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTA RY,"Threat s are declared by witnesses to have been made, but for women. my present purposes I shall leave them out of consideration. The fact remainsthat the women were coerced in every sick-I possible way-by the representation that,, election, not their political, but their financial, in terests would suffer if certain candidateswere not returned.",19
119,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTA RY,"My w o r d! How postal-vote the honourable member is slandering Ausfundamen- tralia. It means ' Mr FISHER - The facts are on evidence, and I could support my statement by quoting, not members of my own party, but members of the Queensland turn on State Government, who abolished thepostal vote.",19
120,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTA RY,"Has the Queensland Government not reintroduced the postal vote? deter- Mr FISHER - Yes , in a way; but not in the way now proposed. In any case, it is now a different State Government, and they do not justify the postal cannot vote on grounds which have been suggested, but simply because they think, as recognised they straightforwardly admit, it will be of a of political advantage to themselves. I of am a justice of the peace myself.",19
121,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTA RY,"There is no accounting for the men who are made justices ! than Mr FISHER - That may be, but we who are justices have to do our best to maintain the dignity of the ofiice. Every that possible facility should be afforded the citizens to, first of all, be enrolled, and for then to have their names kept on the r o l l , even in duplication, if that be necessary, to enable them to poll once. No citizen should be permitted to poll more than once under any circumstances; every person who can possibly record his or vote should have ample facilities to do so; i u hospitals and other places means should, as far as practicable, be provided for the patients to exercise the franchise. Voting by post has been abused in the past, and will be abused under any partyorganizers, government system. I am against the Bill that it is now sought to introduce. It has, of course, another purpose in view, but, as to that, I am indifferent. The Government have had their opportunity, if they are prepared to do so, to out the so-called principle they anentitled nounced; but this Bill , for test poses, is valueless, and ought to be thrown out.",19
122,Mr WEBSTER,PARLIAMENTA RY,"Gwydir) [11.30] Having regard to the state of busisecrecy ness here and elsewhere, I do not know whether it is necessary at the present juncture to indulge in any lengthy remarks upon a B i ll of this character. The Prime Minister has shown the weakness of his case in introducing it without ing any apology for his action. duced it as though it were something be ashamed of, or something he could support as he is in the habit of supportsickness ing any measure he brings forward. The tender way in which he handled the redisease. sponsibilities that are upon him shows very clearly the attitude of the Governelectoral ment in their wild endeavour to secure what they call a double dissolution. discussion of the matter of postal voting would be merely reiteration of what has been said time and again in this chamber. The history of the postal vote in the Comcould monwealth and in the States has been given on many occasions and recorded i Hansard. It has undoubtedly been tried and found wanting as a piece of electoral machinery. If only the evidence as to the experience of the various States that have tried the system of postal voting, and the Commonwealth experience of system, could be collected and put into document, the people would stand are astounded that at this time of the day the Government should seek to reintroduce it . A d u l t suffrage is the base upon the Democracy of this country rests-th right of every man or woman to vote, and to exercise that vote by marking ballot-paper in a manner which will give the proper expression to the opinions awaits them. which are influencing him, or her, for the time being; and Australian Democracy her has evolved a system whereby to every man or woman in this country is secured the privilege of being able to exercise that vote secretly. No matter what outside influence may be brought to bear upon the voter by any employer, or by party when the voter enters the polling booth and marks the ballot-paper he can do it secretly and vote according to the way his conscience dictates as being best in the interests of the country - We, as a party, tried the postal vote; we were carry anxious to let every man or woman to vote do so, and therefore we purmade the experiment, but from that experiment we learned what a dangerous weapon the postal vote was; we learned its disabilities and the way in which it undermined the whole principle of the of the ballot, and gave designing and unscrupulous persons the opportunity of exercising their skill in manipulating the votes of the people. Having tried the experiment, we had the offercourage, as a party, to admit that He introwhat we had attempted to do in to the interests of those who were unnot able to get to a polling booth through or distance had broken down, and that the remedy was worse than the We are asked by the Prime M in ister to re-enact a whole section of law. Every honourable member could discuss every detail of the section, A but we do not - I at any rate do notpropose to do so. I would have liked to fight this matter through to the bitter end in order to see whether this Government possibly get to the Governor General with a flimsy measure of this character; n but recognising that the conditions are such that other things are against that being accomplished-whic h I regret very much-and that the party on this side of the chamber to some degree is anxious to let the Governor General decide the fate the of this Parliament, and having also one learned that members in another place equally indifferent with regard to what the Governor General may do, there is no justification for my standing up here-as which I would willingly do to the death-in e order to fight an imposition of this kind, especially seeing that other honourable the members feel that they prefer to go to the shambles, if such be the fate that",20
123,Mr BAMFOUD,PARLIAMENTA RY,We know your fighting capabilities.,21
124,Mr WEBSTER,PARLIAMENTA RY,"All I can say is that the fighting capabilities that should characterize the Labour party are fast becoming a thing of the past. There is nothing I deplore more than the fact that the Government should be able to masquerade as reformers, and carry into the presence of the Governor General measures which have been admitted by the Prime Minister to. be trumpery, and to be simply trifling with the time of the country and the interests of Democracy, with a view to securingwhat? Not a reform. This is no reform. It is a backward step; a step to undermine Democracy and take away the rights and privileges of our fellow beings, who have fought for those rights in days gone by. When I think of those days, when we were fighting for manhood suffrage and for securing a hold on the political machine so that the voice of the mass of the people could be heard in Parliament; when I recall those days, thirty years ago, when we were fighting an unpopular battle for the masses; when the propertied classes, with-plural voting, could multiply votes in every electorate; when I look back on the sacrifices that were made by men who were practically exiled for their efforts to lift the masses of the people and give them the power that their education enabled them to use to the best advantage --whe n I think of all these things, I realise the attitude honourable members should adopt in regard to this Bill. If the Government should be successful in their endeavours, the Labour party take a considerable risk-n o one can deny itthe risk of allowing' the first step to be taken towards pulling down the citadel which our forefathers have built up for the good of humanity. I do not regard the matter from the point of view of a politician, or one who is anxious to return to the Treasury bench, or who seeks for some advantage that may be gained by manoeuvres, political or otherwise. I realise that there is a greater thing ahead, and that it is a nobler aim to maintain and retain that which was handed down to us by our forefathers to guard, care for, protect, and maintain as a precious heritage given to us, not for our own sakes, but for the sake of our children. Yet the party born among the workers, and sprung from the people who have fought to gain political freedom, now propose to allow the Prime Minister to secure the passage of this subtle thing that has had its birth in the brains of the Attorney-General, and which can-I will not say it will - secur e a double dissolution. I say that there is an element of risk in this. No party knowing their business .would even allow a risk to be taken when the rights of the multitude they represent are in danger. Let us assume for a moment that the Governor General will grant a double dissolution. What will be the result? The party behind politicians on the other side will certainly act in the manner they have always adopted, manipulating the rolls and following the tactics they are pursuing day by day with the aid of the money of those who are always oppressing the masses in any country. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That will not save them.",21
125,Mr WEBSTER,PARLIAMENTA RY,"I like the man who says, ""Calvary, O Calvary 1 I believe in Calvary."" That is not going to save us. The only thing that would save the Labour movement would be to fight to the updeath, and no other course is worthy of the man who carries the Labour flag. But I was looking at the possibilities of passing this measure. Assume that the Bill is carried, and that the Governor General may grant a double dissolution. In that case, the advantage will lie with the party in power. They are capable of many things, as we have proved all along the line, and as I have known them to be in the days before Labour came into existence. It is the same old Satan on the Government bench that sat there in the fifties. They know well how to manipulate the electoral machinery and throw dust in the eyes of the people, and practically belie the situation and misrepresent it at every breakfast table in the country, as they did last time by misrepresenting the whole situation and slandering the Labour party, and blaming them for being responsible for the high cost of living, in this way appealing to the pockets of the multitude and gaining a shady majority over the party that would not stoop to such tactics. We have to face the position and see what will happen by what has been done in South Australia and other places. In South Australia, the Liberals, having seen that the Labour movement is solidly entrenched, that the aspirations and hopes of Labour men have, to some degree, been realized, and that the Liberal power ie dying, what did they do? Having gained power by methods which I have just related, they proceeded to undermine the whole electoral system and gerrymander the electorates, reducing the value of votes in the Labour centres, and giving 1,000 people in one electorate as much power as 2,000 in another, and so making it almost impossible for some years to come for Labour to have a hope of succeeding in winning the seats so gerrymandered. That is what lies behind the subtle method that has been so cunningly initiated by the Attorney-General, and I say unhesitatingly that the risk is too great, and that the disabilities that will be placed upon us are something we should not accept. No party is justified in taking a risk in regard to matters intrusted to it as a sacred trust. In the face of the corruption, improper manipulation, and other malpractices that have been experienced in connection with the postal vote, the party that urges its restoration is not friend, but the bitterest enemy, of the people. Ministers say that they want to get the Bill through quickly. I remember the way in which the postal vote was manipulated when it was provided for in a Federal Act. Justices of the Peace were paid by the day to go from door to door persuading persons who had no right to do so to vote by post, misleading them as to the casting of their votes. They were paid, not to obtain postal votes in a legitimate way, or rather not to merely witness the signature of sick persons entitled to and desirous of voting by post, but to deceive the electors, and to ascertain how votes were being cast. It is on record that thousands of votes collected this way by party organizations never saw the ballot-box.",21
126,Dr MALONEY,PARLIAMENTA RY,That was in Queensland?,22
127,Mr WEBSTER,PARLIAMENTA RY,"Yes , and we have evidence that similar practices have obtained in other places where the postal vote system has been in operation. The Liberals desire the opportunity to "" down "" the Labour party by any means possible. They cannot defeat us on our policy, nor attack our principles, nor undermine our platform.",22
128,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTA RY,You have no policy.,22
129,Mr WEBSTER,PARLIAMENTA RY,"The honourable gentleman has no policy for the betterment of the people, but merely a secret, cunning, deep-laid plot to rob the people of the rights and privileges handed down to them by their forefathers. That is the desire of those who are today trying to work political points, aud are neglecting to bring forward measures of legislation which are urgent, and would enable matters of primary importance affecting the homes of the people to be dealt with. But I have never been one to take part in a sham fight, and I shall not do so now. In real warfare, I am prepared to fight to the death for my home and my country. But one cannot fight when there is something holding him back, paralyzing his arm when about to strike an effective blow. Whatever may be the fate of this test Bill, and whatever may be the decision of the Governor General, it shall not be said of me, a Labour man, who has the come through many fights, having had to contest six battles to gain entrance into the parliamentary arena, that I did anything to injure the movement of which I am so proud, and which I value as I would a father or a mother. In days gone by, thirty-four years ago, before Labour took any part in politics, we used to meet in the Trades and Labour Council, moulding what was destined to be the Labour policy of the future. The Labour movement has built itself up by gallant fights, and the sacrifice of time, money, and opportunity by those who supported it. They have been victimized, boycotted, and persecuted to gain the liberties at stake today. I am one of those in who was present at the birth of the movement. I was there at its delivery, watched its growth from boyhood to manhood. I saw it reach its majority, and, at last, assume control of the government of this country, putting up a record during three years' administration of the public affairs that will never be equalled by that of any other political party. To-day I feel that there is a danger that what we have done may be undone, and that the work of many years may be lost; but it shall not be laid at my door that I did anything ""to risk the interests of the movement.",22
130,Mr JH CATTS,PARLIAMENTA RY,"Cook)' TIL55] - I am glad that the motion has been moved, and I hope that the Bill will have a speedy despatch. It is the second of the two test Bills by the rejection of which the Government hope to induce the Governor General to grant a double dissolution. By our action in the Senate last night, we took the Liberals completely by surprise, and if we deal speedily with this Bill, will remain to be seen whether Ministers really want a dissolution. I shall not speak more than a few minutes now, and at the second-reading stage I propose to offer a few remarks with the object of nssisting the speedy passing of the measure. When both Bills have been dealt with, we may, perhaps, adjourn for a week, or whatever time the Governor General may require to consider the position. Then let us have a fight, if there to be one.",23
131,Mr WEST,PARLIAMENTA RY,The Governor General will turn down the request for a double dissolution.',23
132,Mr JH CATTS,PARLIAMENTA RY,"I am sure that he will. Under all the circumstances, the best thing would be to grant a single dissolution. Ministers will not do business, and we cannot do anything. They know that there is an overwhelming majority in favour of dealing with the Tariff; but, although frequently invited to deal with it , - they have done nothing. Many honourable members on their side, and all on this, are pledged to support a social insurthis ance scheme, but the Government have done nothing towards proposing it. A Bankruptcy Bill, an Insurance Bill, the establishment of a Bureau of Agriculture, are all non-party matters with which this Parliament could deal, but which Ministers will not give us on opportunity to consider. Proposals for the alteration of the Constitution, which honourable members opposite have admitted to be necessary, are not presented to us. The only House prepared to do business is the Senate, where members of the Labour party have introduced a Bankruptcy Bill, an Insurance Bill, and a set of Bills proposing alterations of the Constitution. As the Government refuses to do business, let us take it at its word, and put this Bill through quick and lively. There will he no obstruction from me. When the Bill is through, we can see what Ministers are made of.",23

136,Mr JH CATTS,PARLIAMENTA RY,"Thes e trumpery things I would have met with the statement that they were not worth five minutes' consideration, and I would have disposed of them immediately. The alternative was to fight them to the death. By that course I believe we could have humiliated the Government, and if we had been a proper fighting army we could have is blocked the measures going through.",23

139,Mr JH CATTS,PARLIAMENTA RY,"The only thing I am sorry for is that we were not in the same fighting form on this side. I hope Bil l will be speedily dealt with. I would suggest to the Prime Minister that as the Bill will he quickly disposed of here, and will, no doubt, have a happy despatch in another Chamber, he should adjourn the House for a week or a fortnight, or as long as is necessary to enable the Governor General to make up his mind in regard to any request for a double dissolution.",23
140,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PARLIAMENTA RY,"Oh , do not talk about it !",23
141,Mr JH CATTS,PARLIAMENTA RY,"Now we see whether the Government are in earnest or not. As soon as they are up against the thing they said they wanted, they are in a blue funk.

No tion of the electoral law was so abused was the postal vote. The intention of the of the people. postal vote to provide the sick and infirm with a vote was a good one, but in tion it was surrounded by many abuses. I personally am aware of abuses comthat mitted by persons who, in the manipulaing. tion of the postal vote, did things were not to their credit. Those things were done as party tactics, and i sumed that party tactics are not an fence, but, to my mind, those abuses offences that deserved punishment. person who is desirous of electoral purity could, for a moment, support this B i expect that, before many days, an opportunit y will be seized by the Government to delay proceeding with the Bill . I do think that there is an honest desire on not my their part to go on with it since they heard of what happened in another place in regard to the Preference Prohibition ill . For my part, it is generally agreed I am in the happy position of having a safe seat, but a Bill of this kind should will not be viewed by an honourable member with any regard to whether his seat is safe or not. Whether my seat was safe or unmy voice would still be against any measure that permitted of so many abuses as this measure will. Honourable members should be very careful about re-enacting such a system as this. Does any one think that the Fisher Government decided Goto repeal the postal vote for any other reason than that it was abused ? Statements went uncontradicted that the vote any had been used for purposes entirely foreign to the intention of the Act , and it ill becomes honourable members to facilitate the reinstatement of such a system. elecOf course there may be ulterior motives behind the introduction of this measure, to and, so far as they can be judged, they are such that no Government in a National Bill Parliament should lend themselves to. it To put the country to the expense and turmoil of a general election in respect of two such trumpery measures as the so called test Bills is about the last thing rolls, that any Government should try to do. as A general election involves not only great perexpense, but gives rise to much excitement, and seriously disorganizes business. of For the time being, business is almost at are a standstill, and we' are therefore asked to take a very serious step when we are called upon to precipitate a general election in respect of such a proposal as this. secWhen they do go to the country, the Goas vernment will suffer defeat at the hands I am satisfied that the people will speak in no uncertain manoperaner, and it is therefore not because of any fear of going before my constituents I speak as I . have done this mornThe point that I wish to emphasize which is that there are important measures which could be brought down by the Got is asvernment, and with which honourable ofmembers on all sides would be prepared were to deal. There are many important quesNo tions that we are anxious to discuss, and in respect of which we desire to legislate, l l . I but the Government refuse to give us the opportunity to do so.
