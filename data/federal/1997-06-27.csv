0,NA,Unknown,set down for consideration at a later hour this day. Dissent from Ruling,118
1,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Nehl}-The Main Committee has reported an unresolved question on a closure motion. The closure was moved to the motion that the Deputy Speaker's ruling be dissented from. The unresolved question is That the question that the Deputy Speaker's ruling be dissented from be now put'.,118
2,Mr LEO MCLEAY,Unknown,"Watson) (6.20 p.m.}Mr Deputy Speaker, I put to you that that motion is out of order inasmuch as it is not possible, under the practices of this House, to move a motion of dissent when the chair has directed the call. The call is not something that is open to dissent. The call is a matter of discretion by the chair. Therefore, for a member to move that the chair's ruling be dissented from is not in order. In defence of Deputy Speaker Mossfield, who was in the chair at the time, he came into the chair when the quorum had been formed. He was not aware of the altercations that had occurred in the Main Committee prior to the quorum being re-formed. He gave the call in accordance with the advisory list that had been provided to him by the whipsa procedure that has been adopted in this House since the 1950s. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is at the discretion of the chair as to who gets the call. Deputy Speaker Mossfield accepted a motion which was out of order, because I believe he did not want to use a device to protect himself. I think that the House should now recognise that it is not possible to proceed with this motion. I would ask you to rule that it is out of order.",118
3,Mrs SULLIVAN,Unknown,"Moncrieft) (6.22 p.m.}Mr Deputy Speaker, as the mover of that motion, there are a couple of comments I would like to make on the intervention that has just been made. I point out that it was my belief that I was moving a motion of dissent on a ruling that had been given. In fact, I raised a point of order about the order of the call. Deputy Speaker Mossfield made a reply. It was on that reply that I moved my dissent. For the benefit of the House, as I indicated earlier, I was happy to withdraw this without debate, but I feel constrained to make a couple of comments. I actually sat where you are now once, Mr Deputy Speaker, and had a dissent motion moved on me by the memberMr Leo MCLeay- Mr Deputy Speaker, I have asked you to rule on the matter.",118
4,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for Watson, but I was hearing further debate on the issue. I will rule. The honourable member for Moncrieff will resume her seat for the moment. It is my belief that, where a decision is made on which member gets the call, this is a decision under the standing order which says that the occupant of the chair will give the call when two or more members rise at the same time to the person who, in his or her opinion, rose first. Therefore, it is not a ruling. Therefore, there cannot be dissent from the ruling.",118
5,Mrs SULLIVAN,Unknown,"I wish to finish my sentence. There was an occasion when I was in the chair when dissent was moved on a decision that I made. The dissent was moved by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Deputy Speaker, if you have ruled that the dissent motion is out of order, I do not believe there is anything before the chair.",118
6,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"You asked me my opinion on the situation. I was not in the chair at that time. Had I been, I would have ruled that way, but that ruling was not made and there is a dissent motion before the chair. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Deputy Speaker, what I asked you to rule on was whether this dissent motion is properly before the House now. My point was that this dissent motion is out of order. I am asking you to rule that it is out of order in accordance with the precedents that I have put to you that go back as far as Speaker Cameron in 1950 and all the other practices of this House, which have said precisely what you just said, which is that the call is not something that it is open to dissent from. The submission I am putting to you is that the dissent motion which is now before the House is out of order, and I would ask you to rule that way. Mr Reith-I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. It might assist the House if I raise a point of order. My point is that you have given the call to the member for Moncrieff. On that basis, she should be given the opportunity to complete her remarks. If she were given the opportunity to complete her remarks, that would settle the matter. This is now a debate about process. She has already indicated what she intends to do, which we all know removes the matter from before the chair. That would facilitate the expeditious handling of it.",118
7,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"I thank the Leader of the House. I am prepared to hear the member for Moncrieff on indulgence, if she seeks that indulgence.",119
8,Mrs SULLIVAN,Unknown,"On indulgence, if I may, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER Mr Leo MCLeay-But you have ruled that the matter is out of order?",119
9,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Yes. Mr Leo MCLeay-Then I am happy.,119
10,Mrs SULLIVAN,Unknown,"The matter I am trying to put before the House is a precedent that I just bring to your attention. I was in the chair once when a motion of dissent was moved on me by the member for Curtin on a matter which was a matter for the chair's opinion. I understand that motions of dissent on matters of opinion are not normally allowed. That is the procedure. I was in the chair once when there was a very extended debate on such a motion of dissent. I pointed out to the House that I was not obliged to let the motion proceed, but that I allowed it to proceed in order to resolve other matters before the House. That was done with the consent and agreement and quite happy participation of members on both sides of the House. That was an extended debate. The member for Curtin was not the only one who spoke. I just point out that there is that precedent for moving dissent on matters on which dissent is not normally allowed. I take your point that you would not have allowed it, if you will take my point that I did not believe that that was the motion of dissent I was moving. Mr Crean-We can have this discussion outside.",119
11,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order!,119
12,Mrs SULLIVAN,Unknown,I have since read the Hansard. Mr Leo MCLeay-You're stretching the indulgence.,119
13,Mrs SULLIVAN,Unknown,I believed I was moving a motion of dissent on a ruling given by the occupant of the chair on a point of order that I raised. Mr Leo MCLeay-You could have just moved to gag him.,119
14,Mrs SULLIVAN,Unknown,"It was my intention to make this nice and clean and quick and easy for the House. I am sorry if I misunderstood; I thought there was an agreement that, if I was allowed to do that, there was not going to be a debate on this matter. It was my indication, and the indication was transmitted to the member for Watson, who has just seen fit to make a few comments about meMr Leo MCLeay-1 haven't made any comments about you yet.",119
15,Mrs SULLIVAN,Unknown,"Yes, you have. Mr Deputy Speaker, I point out that the motion was moved and seconded. I am happy, in order to expedite matters, to withdraw my moving of the motion.",119
16,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Is leave granted to withdraw the motion? Mr Leo MCLeay-Yes. Motion-by leave-withdrawn. Adjournment of Main Committee,119
17,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Nehl)Order! The Main Committee has reported two unresolved questions to the motion that the Main Committee adjourn. The unresolved questions are that the member for Watson be not further heard and that the question be now put. These unresolved questions were appropriate to proceedings in the Main Committee earlier yesterday. However, the committee subsequently adjourned. Accordingly, there is no point putting the unresolved questions to the House, and I do not propose to do so. Debate (on motion by Mr Miles) adjourned. NA Members and Guests Dining Room:",119
18,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Nehl)Order! Mr Speaker has asked me to read this statement on his behalf. I refer to the question to Mr Speaker by the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) on 4 June concerning apricots served in the Members and Guests Dining Room. The Hyatt has advised that its policy is obtain the best possible product at the best price, with preference for Australian products. This is consistent with the Commonwealth's commitments under the government procurement agreement. Value for money is a prime determinant for evaluating purchases, and the Hyatt has a commitment to Australian products wherever possible. The Hyatt used a dried fruit salad mix supplied by a local supplier which conparties tained some imported fruit. Despite the fact that the local produce is more expensive, Hyatt now provides an all-Australian fruit salad mix. For the information of honourable members, Australian apricots, whilst smaller than imported product, are sweeter and, according to the member for Mallee, much better value for money. I recommend to all members the August. Australian cheese and Australian dried fruit platter at the attractive price of $6.50 a serve. NA",120
19,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS,"I passes also deliver a statement on behalf of the Speaker concerning the proposed amalgamation of the parliamentary departments. Memout bers will be aware that the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House proposed for consideration an amalgamation current five parliamentary departments into a two-department structure based on the chamber departments. The proposal was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing, which presented its report to Senate on 19 June. The committee report recommended a rejection of the two-departthe ment model for amalgamation and stressed the need for preservation of the independence of the Parliamentary Library. It also made a number of recommendations about the need Apricots for cooperation between the parliamentary departments. The Speaker has indicated that during the winter break he will continue discussions with the President of the Senate about the way in which they, in consultation with members and senators, might work toward a rationalisation to of the mechanisms by which services are delivered to the parliament. Members will be consulted on proposed developments. ADJOlJRNMENT Valedictory",120
20,Mr REITH,PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS,"I move: That the House do now adjourn. In moving this motion, the intention of the is that the House will rise at 7 p.m. or earlier, depending on the number of contributhe tions made. I thank all honourable members for their assistance and cooperation in what is always a difficult day in finalising matters before the chamber. We thank the Speaker for the his advice on the culinary delights of the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest). I wish all members a good break; we will see you in National Drug Summit",120
21,Mrs CROSIO,PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS,"The push for a national drug summit keeps growing stronger with each day, and as each day the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) begin to look more and more of touch with public opinion and with the opinions of experts in the field of drug addiction, law enforcement and medicine, who are of the all in favour of a summit. When I asked the Prime Minister in early June whether he would consider convening a national drug summit he said that such a gathering would be 'unnecessary' and 'wasteful of resources'. A few days later the same the answer came back from the minister for health-in fact, almost in the same terms. In following days, as calls for a summit continued to grow, the minister for health was forced to repeat his negative words. The minister's spokesperson said a summit would mean 'zilch' and would be nothing but a 'talkfest'. In his answer to my question in the House, the minister said a summit would be a 'cheap stunt' which would only amount to 'window-dressing'. Strong words but foolish words, I believe, spoken too soon. I would like to read to the House just some of the names of individuals and groups who in the last few weeks have given their support to the idea of holding a national drug summit: the Australian Medical Association; the Royal College of Physicians; the directors of public prosecutions in New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia; the premiers of Western Australia and New South Wales; and members on both sides of this House, including the minister for health's medical and party colleague the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson). I only wish he would put a bit more pressure on the minister instead of talking in the community about it. The list goes on, and with every name that is added to the list, the Prime Minister, the minister for health and their cabinet colleagues begin looking like 'yesterday's men'. The sad thing-that is, apart from the fact that, the longer we prevaricate in making dramatic changes to the national drug strategy, the more people will die on our streetsis that the government's stubborn attitude on a summit is just so unnecessary. It seems the minister for health cannot imagine a summit amounting to anything more than just premiers, chief ministers and possibly their ministers for health and police sitting around a table and having yet another meeting-that is, if the ministers themselves tum up and do not just send their representatives. This is exactly how the national drug strategy is run at the moment, and I do not have to tell members how ineffective this method has proven to be. This is not what I or anybody else has in mind when a drug summit is mentioned. I am talking about a summit where the politicians are joined by experts in drug addiction and abuse, law enforcement and judicial authorities, spokespeople from health and welfare agencies, religious groups, family members of addicts-even reformed addicts themselves. I would like to see a summit where the politicians cannot just put off making their decisions until next year's meeting. I want a summit where the politicians are confronted by the wretched stories of heroin abuse and about the heroin on our streets and how it is destroying ordinary, happy Australian families. I want the politicians for a change to come face to face with the stark evidence of the failings of the national drug strategy. Above all, I envisage a drug summit where the Prime Minister uses his position, his authority, to press the gathering into putting forward some definite proposals for changethe same way he pressed those who attended the guns buy-back summit in the wake of the Port Arthur tragedy. As the editorial in the Age newspaper said on 21 June: Perhaps, when Dr Wooldridge hears talk about a drug summit, his instinctive reaction is that it would be just another meeting. But a summit need not be an empty talkfest. The example of 1986 provides a caution against expecting that there are simple solutions to a many-layered problem-it does not prove that a summit might not be still the best means of educating and galvanising public opinion so that (a new direction) becomes a matter of urgency for policy makers ... Or as Richard Court, the Premier of Western Australia, said on the Witness program on 24 June: I think just as the Prime Minister became involved in the firearms debate and it was driven as a national issue, I believe that the time has come when the drug issue must also be driven at a national level. This is not a stunt. It is not a mickey mouse sideshow we are after. We are after the minister for health and the Prime Minister of this country giving at least serious consideration to the idea of holding a national drug summit. The minister serves nobody, least of all himself, by quickly dismissing the idea of a drug summit as a 'cheap stunt' when some of the most conservative organisations and politicians, including members of his own political party, think it is the right direction in which to head. Nobody wants another talkfest. The police do not, the health authorities do not, those working with drug addicts on our streets every day certainly do not and the families who have lost loved ones to heroin abuse who are watching them suffer do not. And many of the addicts themselves do not want to go on in the way we have been. The only people who do not want action are the drug larly, barons and the pushers on the streets. have had inquiry after inquiry on drugs, drug abuse and drug reform. The time has now come for action. A drug summit does not mean inaction. A drug summit, if handled correctly, can mean real change. I urge the Prime Minister, his minister for health and his cabinet colleagues to give consideration to this. I might also say that when the member for Bradfield went walking through the areas of my electorate the other day with the President of the AMA it was finally brought attention how dramatic and drastic this lack of attention is. I am glad that he went there. Maybe now when I come into this House and talk about what is factually happening on streets people will start to listen. People dying, and action needs to be taken. (Time expired) Australian Fruit",120
22,Mr FORREST,PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS," Mr cing Deputy Speaker Nehl, through you, I would like to take the opportunity before the journment of the House in this session to thank the Speaker for the response to the matter regarding dried fruit. I remarks about what a delightful platter it can make, taking advantage of the wonderful dried fruit products of our nation. Mr Deputy Speaker, I even forgive you for not respondgo ing to that whilst I had here yesterday school students from Sunraysia, which is very the central focus of the dried vine fruit indusindustry try in our country. My electorate shares this wonderful dried fruit industry with the memregard. ber for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), the member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) and the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks). I would like the House to take note of the incredible pressure that is being placed upon the dried fruit industry and citrus growers. We have made a very significant ask of these two industries, in the move towards freer trade, to accept dramatically lower tariffs. They have or responded marvellously and accordingly. They have made adjustments in order to compete. I think it is only fitting that the House provides them with every assistance and, particuto use the catering facilities in this place We to boast their wonderful products. I am very pleased with the response from the Hyatt. I hope they continue to note my interest in the way that horticultural products are used. I have made a great thing about the use of fresh fruit, especially oranges. I am always alert to ensure that there is no orange juice in this place that is made from reconstituted concentrate. The only way to guarantee that it is genuinely Australian orange juice is to drink it fresh, otherwise there is no guarantee that it is not reconstituted concentrate to his imported from Brazil. The Hyatt are conscious of my views on that matter. They are so conscious of them the that-and I would like to congratulate them are on this-they had on the menu last week and this week soup that is a combination of carrot and citrus. I highly recommend that honourable members take the opportunity to enjoy that soup before the House completes its activities tonight. I thank the Hyatt for advanthe cause of Australian horticulturalists and using Australian products in this place so adthat when visitors come-be they from New Zealand, or Europe or delegations from all around the world-we can show them genuine reiterate your Australian products. You have to go to a lot of trouble up there to buy French wine. So why do you have to to so much trouble to buy Australian apricots? It is interesting that the member for much Wakefield has most of the dried apricot in his electorate. It is very interesting that he and I share common interests in that Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like you to pass on my thanks to the Speaker for responding to my very reasonable request. I wish all members the best in the winter break. I hope that, when you go back to your electorates to lay bricks, you will find it an enjoyable experience. I thank very much so many members here who have extended their generous cooperation to me. B1acktown Business Enterprise Centre",122
23,Mr MOSSFIELD,PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS,"I rise in this adjournment debate to draw to the attention of this House the absolutely marvellous support scheme being conducted for small business by the Blacktown Business Enterprise Centre. This centre has been in operation in Blacktown for only two years. I will shortly refer to its successes. The centre is part of Business Enterprise Centres New South Wales Ltd, which is responsible for the cohesive and constructive program of representations to government and the overall marketing of the BEC network. The New South Wales scheme has been in operation for 12 years. I recently received a copy of the New South Wales BEC annual report. I propose to quote extensively from the manager's report, as the figures highlight that the successes are quite outstanding. The BEC network in New South Wales and the ACT has assisted 9,754 existing businesses to develop or to resolve problems by providing professional advice, guidance and support; has provided professional advice and support to 5,020 new business start-up ventures; was involved in the creation of 4,240 new jobs; has dissuaded 1,216 people from entering a small business venture because of the likelihood of failure; and has provided telephone and/or face-to-face client service in 27,950 initial contacts and 13,778 repeat client contacts. Along with these facts, I note that the manager of the Blacktown BEC, Christine Gough, states that it was conservatively estimated that the investment value of the small to medium sized businesses assisted by the BEC network in New South Wales and the ACT was at least $108 million-a remarkable figure, indeed. I now tum to the success of the Blacktown BEe. Up until June 1996 this BEC assisted 291 'intending' and 'new start' clients and assisted 102 existing businesses to develop and/or resolve difficulties, which resulted in 73 jobs being created. Also, 393 businesses were assisted in the Blacktown local government area. I was impressed to read that in January 1997 there were a total of 145 client contacts, compared with 39 in January 1996. Obviously this increase is based on the greater awareness within the small business community of the availability of this service and the very healthy respect for its professionalism and expertise. The BEC has an excellent group of directors and I outline these as follows: Paul Matthews, chairman and managing partner in a local firm of solicitors; Bev Norton, until recently the CEO of the chamber of commerce; Greg MCDonald, owner of Greater West Insurance Brokers; John Simmons, general sales manager with western radio station One-FM; Michael Foley, a partner in a firm of chartered accountants; John Camp, regional training marketing consultant at the Blacktown chamber of commerce; and Jim Taggart, a very talented and professional individual who brings great expertise to the board. The Blacktown BEC has also recently conducted a free small business seminar to clients assisted by Business Training and Management Pty Ltd. This was simply the first of many seminars that the BEC are planning over the next 12 months, and it proved very popular. I am delighted that, in such a short time, the Blacktown BEC has been able to show such dramatic results and take its place with great pride amongst the other BECs around New South Wales and the ACT. Clearly, the BEC is going to become a real force to be reckoned with and will add greatly to the enhancement of the prestige of this very valuable service being conducted for the benefit of small business. The inaugural national BEC network conference was held in Canberra last month. I am advised that the conference was very successful. One of the outcomes was a desire to create a more formal approach to the national body and to strengthen the relationships within the BEC network. I congratulate the conference on its work, as the BEC network is the catalyst that is creating new jobs and protecting existing jobs. I commend the work of this organisation this parliament and look forward to even greater success of the National Business Enterprise Centre. Main Committee",123
24,Ms WORTH,PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS,"I just wish to very briefly comment at this time, because in many respects the report from Main Committee which we heard about a make his pointlittle earlier this evening, while being technically accurate, did not in any way reflect what actually occurred in the Main Committee yesterday. Mr Billson-An absolute disgrace.",124
25,Ms WORTH,PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS,"It was an absolute disgrace, as my colleague interjects. We heard this afternoon, as we all farewelled Lyn Barlin-I take this opportunity to wish him well-about the importance of standards, the reasons for doing things properly, and his part up the Main Committee. I state for those who do not understand clearly that the business be debated in the Main Committee is to a non-controversial nature. The business decided by the government with the cooperquickly ation of the opposition. Yesterday, everything having been decided, the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) I arrived in the Main Committee. He mentioned the word altercation before when he was ber. debating the motion involving the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan). He was the one who caused the altercation, and he was architect of the chaos which occurred. The Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill was being debated; speakers from the government were waiting to speak. The member for Moncrieff, in the chair, very properly, despite the fact that he was not listed but because it was the tum of the opposition to speak, gave be followed. the call to the member for Watson",124
26,Mr SLIPPER,PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS,"He used to be a Speaker of this chamber, didn'the?",124
27,Ms WORTH,PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS,"He used to be a Speakerlike to ensure that that legislation would be journed to allow the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) to pull a little stunt, ing through all the reports that were there be taken note of, to come to the small busirecord ness report, despite the fact it was on the to agenda to be debated at a later time. The reason for this became immediately apparent. There was a small business delegation from Newcastle, and one or two from other parts of Australia fortunately there as well, just sitting behind the rope, which is the public gallery in the Main Committee. So the determined was the member for Newcastle to Mr Billson-To show off.",124
28,Ms WORTH,PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS,"And to show off, as my colleague interjects-that in fact those in that public gallery became involved with the debate, interjecting on the member for Moncrieff, certainly in a manner that was most inappropriately disorderly. I have had a delegate from South Australia contact one of those delegates from Newcastle and I have received a phone call of apology today for the in setting behaviour that occurred. It was not just the interjecting, either. When to the quorum was removed, which it seemed be of was the only way for the government to is restore any order, the member for Newcastle crossed the chamber and encircled me, with his delegates from Newcastle, to further debate the matter, despite the fact that had taken no part in the debate at all and was at that stage technically out of the chamI thought this was quite shameful, decidedly inappropriate and unparliamentary. I think that raising the matter tonight clarifies that. I would like to think in the future that if the Main Committee is going to function as it is meant to, and as I hope it will, the opposition might like to consider appropriate parliamentary procedures and the way they should Main Committee",124
29,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would also to ask you to convey to Mr Barlin my adappreciation of his years of service and his contribution. I will refer to the matter raised jumpby the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) but, to before I do, I want to clarify and put on the an incident that happened earlier in the House, when I chastised the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) for his noninvolvement in the fair trading inquiry and he made some remarks about me. For the benefit of the House, I will just point out that, of the 41 meetings of the House's Committee on Industry, Science and Technology in this current parliament that we have held since it was formed, the member for Paterson attended three of the first four and has attended five since then. There was a period between 12 September last year and 27 February this year when he did not attend at all. He did not attend any of the report considerations on the fair trading report and, to my recollection, probably only one of the hearings. The comment I made about him was in fact very accurate and very disappointing, because he had led people to believe he would be very active in that inquiry. I think we all understand the burdens of office. We are all aware of our responsibilities and how difficult it is in terms of our workloads, but we also make decisions and choices about that. Regarding the matter in the Main Committee, I think it is important to place on record very clearly what happened with this fair trading report. We were told, when we first tabled it on 26 May, our time in the chamber would be 15 minutes each. Most of the committee wanted to speak. Most of those who had been involved, including government members, missed out on speaking on it: the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), the member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro) and others. The member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) I think also wanted to speak. We were optimistic that we would deal with it in the Main Committee in the first week. Then it was going to be the second week, then it was going to be the next week, then it was going to be last week, then it was going to be last Wednesday, and then it was going to be Thursday. When we got Thursday's business paper of the Main Committee, it was scheduled all right-at the bottom of the page. And not one government member was listed. Not one government member was listed to speak, yet they had all wanted to speak on it before. The member for Petrie was in the chamber the day it was tabled, and missed out because in fact your speech intruded into our time-no offence to you, Mr Speaker. When the government did schedule it, it made sure it would not get dealt with. We wanted to speak to that report. I can understand government members not wanting it discussed because they were concerned about their minister. We gave an undertaking that we would not talk about the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser), and that should have been enough. I suggest the innuendo to the remarks of the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) are more offensive than anything anybody else has done because those people who came down came down for a function somewhere else. They simply met here by coincidence. I was not aware they were coming. They were not aware that we were even speaking. What the member for Adelaide did not say was that I had started my speech much earlier. It was interrupted by the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) walking out of the chamber and collapsing the quorum. In other words, the government collapsed the quorum when I was simply talking about the report. After a quarter of an hour to 20 minutes of no quorum, the government then resumed the quorum and let me continue my speech, which was simply about the report. At the end of that, as you are aware, the then Deputy Speaker, looking at the business paper, gave the next person on the list, the member for Scullin, the call. We then had the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) spend 20 minutes on a dissent motion which was an absolute filibuster. These people have simply walked in-an absolute coincidence-and discovered that issues they had come down to hear somewhere else were actually being discussed. They could not believe their luck of that being on. They expected to hear both sides of the chamber discuss it because they had been told by me and everybody else that this report was bipartisan-and it has been. They assumed there would be government members speaking as well. They wanted to hear the report being discussed because we were all in agreement on it. They walked into a fiasco because the government did not want the report discussed. The fact is that you can try to protect the minister. He is unprotectable. He has been dead for a fortnight. One single incident-the fact that he actually told his brother to write to Nick Greiner-proves that. You cannot protect him, so do not destroy a good report. That is what you are doing. What you have told small businesses in this sitting is that you will not discuss it, you will not debate it and you have gagged it. Townsville: Zinc Refinery",124
30,Mr LINDSAY,PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS,"I would like to report to the House that the first contract was finalised this week for the construction on Sun Metals' Stuart zinc refinery in Townsville. The zinc refinery is the largest Korean investment outside Korea in the world. Golding Contractors, a Gladstone company, has secured the $15 million plus earthworks contract, signalling the imminent commencement of work on the multimillion dollar project. According to Sun Metals corporate construction manager, John Dodson, construction work on the $530 million zinc refinery will start next month, involving a peak work force of about 130 people. Sixty to 70 per cent of the staff are expected to be drawn from within the Townsville area both during construction and in the refinery's operational life. The commencement of construction work will be a major boost to the local and regional Townsville economy. According to a report in this Monday's Townsville Bulletin, Chief Executive Officer of Townsville Enterprise Ltd, Mr Richard Power, said that a study conducted by the Centre for Applied Economic Research and Analysis showed the annual regional benefits during the refinery's initial operating days will include a $467 million increase in gross regional output, a $192 million increase in value added products, an annual injection of $84.5 million into local pay packets and the creation in North Queensland of about 1,670 direct and indirect jobs.  commercial development arising from the project would create further opportunities for local business. The twin cities of Townsville and Thuringowa are at the beginning of what will be a long period of considerable growth and economic development. Unemployment in the region, taking in Townsville, fell a massive 3.5 per cent over the last month according to data released last week by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The unemployment rate in the north-west statistical region now stands at just 6.3 per cent-the lowest rate of regional unemployment in 18 months and the lowest result for the month of May since 1990. This compares with a regional unemployment rate of 11.9 per cent at the time of the last election. I just repeat that: at the last election there was 11.9 per cent unemployment; right now we have 6.3 per cent unemployment. Only last month the Townsville ALP President and former federal member said the Howard government had failed the region because unemployment in our area was running at 9.8 per cent-2.1 per cent lower than at the time of the last election. The unemployment rate has now fallen a further 3.5 points to 6.3 per cent and is now 5.6 per cent lower than at the time of the last election. If that is a failure on my pa11, I guess I have to plead guilty. . The ABS regional figures foIlow the release of Department of Social Security figures for May showing the number of unemployed recipients in the Townsville and Aitkenvale area falling by 381. The number of people claiming unemployment benefits locally has fallen 878 since February this year. It is a great result for the Townsville region. Regional unemployment figures are very volatile and subject to strong seasonal influences. Therefore, I certainly should be careful not to place too much emphasis on one month's figures. Nonetheless, the current downward trend is very positive and I welcome it. It is clear, however, that this trend needs to be maintained over the following months before we start to see the level of local unemployment back down around what I believe are acceptable levels. The prospect of this trend continuing is good. Besides the imminent start of construction work on the zinc refinery, construction work on the Woolcock Street upgrade has started. That will create about 100 jobs between now and its completion. Townsville's Department of Social Security Teleservice Centre will be taking on 50 new staff between now and the end of September, meaning more jobs and wage earners in the city heart. The government also continues to invest heavily in the Australian Defence Force in Townsville. In the next 12 months, these investments will increase troop numbers in the city, creating and sustaining a wealth of subcontracting opportunities for local businesses and inject millions of dollars into the Townsville and Thuringowa economies. Townsville is a city and a region that is on the move. No amount of opposition spokespeople flying in and out of Townsville spreading their doom and gloom can dispel the fact that at the time of the last election regional unemployment rate was 11.9 per cent and now, I am proud to say, it is 6.3 per cent. In the remaining few seconds that I have, I am pleased to be the last speaker of-are these the srping sittings or the autumn sittings? Mr Martin Ferguson-You wouldn't know. You were asleep here all the time. But I will see you in Townsville next month!",126

House adjourned at 7 p.m. until Monday, 25 August 1997, at 12.30 p.m., in accordance with the resolution agreed to this sitting. NA The following papers were deemed to have been presented on 26 June 1997: Public Service Act-Parliamentary Presiding Officers' Determination 1997 No.1. the Telecommunications Act 1991-Telecommunications (Customer Service Guarantee) Direction 1997 No. 1. Telstra Corporation Act-Telstra carrier chargesPrice control arrangements, notification and disallowance-Determination 1995 (Amendment No. 1 of 1997). The following answers to questions were circulated: SkillShare Projects: Melbourne East (Question No. 459) Mr Jenkins asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 25 June 1996: For each SkillS hare project conducted in the Minister's Department's Melbourne East Area, what was the (a) total funding provided, (b) total number of commencements, (c) unit cost and (d) total number of outcomes by category (i) in 1990, (ii) in 1991, (iii) in 1992, (iv) in 1993, (v) in 1994, (vi) between January and June 1995 and (vii) between 1 July 1995 and 25 June 1996. Dr Kemp The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a), (b), (c) and (d): In August 1996 the Department restructured its Area boundaries. The Area previously known as Melbourne East has been subsumed into a larger Area called Melbourne North West.

The attached tables set out for each SkillS hare project in the Area: total grant funding, number of actual participant commencements and gross unit costs (that is, the grant cost per actual participant commencement) for the requested periods. There are separate tables for the Post Program Monitoring survey outcomes for each SkillS hare project in the Area for the requested periods. Unit cost comparisons between funding periods and projects must be treated cautiously as the funding arrangements varied in each of the periods in question. Prior to January 1995 SkillShare projects were funded on a calendar year basis under arrangements whereby these projects could receive core grants and a mixture of targeted services funds. From 1992 to 1994 projects could obtain additional funding to upgrade premises. While not linked directly to job seeker commencements this funding is included in the attached tables thereby distorting unit cost for the periods in which the one-off funds were granted. From January 1995 a streamlined funding approach was introduced. Funding was negotiated with sponsors primarily on a cost per commencement basis.

Dr Kemp--The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, including all portfolio agencies, paid the following amounts: Territory Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) Islands Goint funding) Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) Islands Goint funding) Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) Islands Goint funding) Christmas Island Christmas Island Christmas Island Christmas Island Christmas Island Christmas Island Christmas Island Christmas Island Cocos (Keeling) Island Cocos (Keeling) Island Cocos (Keeling) Island Cocos (Keeling) Island Cocos (Keeling) Island Norfolk Island Norfolk Island Norfolk Island Commonwealth Property: Vacancies (Question No. 1461) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 5 March 1997: (1) How many properties managed by his Department were, or had been, vacant or partially vacant on 1 March 1997 for a period in excess of 3 months. (2) For each property identified in part (1), (a) where is it located, (b) what is its area, (c) when was it last occupied and (d) what is the estimated rent forgone. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The following table identifies vacancies within the Commonwealth portfolio in the terms of the request. It should be noted that the vacancy factor Sum Expended Purpose $12,223 Apprentices off-the-job trainingtravel and accommodation costs $65,200 Core funding of the Indian Ocean Group Training Association $4,378 Language and skills assessments and preparation of resumes $47,747 New Work Opportunities Program $36,000 Plant Operator training course $21,831 Croupier training $27,000 Information technology training course $34,895 CES Agent Fees $50,761 Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) $109,724 Austudy $310,546 National Training Wage $502 New Work Opportunities Program $27,381 To conduct English language and literacy training activities under the Workplace English Language and Literacy (WELL) Program $16,343 Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) $74,528 Austudy $3,620 Jobstart Subsidies $146,096 Austudy $21,751 JobTrain $5,492 Mobility Assistance Scheme of 7% compares favourably with private sector indicators of 12%. It is very difficult to estimate rent forgone due to variances in demand and supply, particularly in regional areas. The Commonwealth's private sector property managers, Jones Lang Wooton and P&O are contracted to lease vacant space as a priority, pending the sale of many of these buildings during the next three years (as was announced by the Government in the recent Budget context). Note: King William Tower in Adelaide has been substantially vacant for some years and is for sale with vacant possession. The Administrative Building in Canberra is vacant with the move of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the new RG Casey Building. The building is vacant pending refurbishment.

Department of Defence: Hire Car (Question No. 1536) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 19 March 1997: (1) Which hire car companies have been used by the Minister's Department in the period since 30 April 1996. (2) What sums had been paid to the companies referred to in part (1) up until 28 February 1997. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The hire car companies that have been used by the Department of Defence in the period since 30 April 1996 are: Acacia Luxury Transport Pty Ltd Airport Express Blue Ribbon Chauffeurs Canberra Limousines CITI Car, Mascot NSW Chris's Cabs & Limousines Dallaroom Pty Ltd (Hughes Hire Cars) Equity Transport Gisborne Taxi Service (including Hire Cars) Hughes Chauffeured Limousines John Klonis Mandeville Nominees Mark Anthony Chauffeured Limos (Qld) Queanbeyan Hire Cars Rave Chauffeur Drive Royale Limousines Security Transport Services (Australia) Pty Ltd Southern Cross Chauffeured Transport Pty (Vic) West Limousine Western Limousines (Qld) (2) The sums paid to the companies referred in part (1) are: Acacia Luxury Transport Pty Ltd-$4,736.1O Airport Express-$21,943.00 Blue Ribbon Chauffeurs-$415.00 Canberra Limousines-$3, 147.00 CITI Car, Mascot NSW-$490.00 Chris's Cabs & Limousines-$2,373.00 House have been excluded from NSW stock as Dallaroom Pty Ltd (Hughes Hire Cars)Companies $645.00 Equity Transport-$1,097.50 Hughes Chauffeured Limousines-$60,638.60 Mandeville Nominees-$24,321.00 Mark Anthony Chauffeured Limos (Qld)$400.00 Queanbeyan Hire Cars-$7,222.00 Rave Chauffeur Drive-$4,590.00 Royale Limousines-$800.00 Security Transport Services (Australia) Pty Ltd-$94,718.52 Southern Cross Chauffeured Transport Pty Ltd (Vic)-$3,742.00 West Limousine-$40,720.00 Western Limousines (Qld)-$730.00 Sub-Total-$272,728.72 DSTO Sub-Total *-$84,714.97 Total-$357,443.69 * The DSTO Sub-Total includes payments to Gisborne Taxi Service, Hughes Chauffeured Limousines and John Klonis. Second Sydney Airport: Rust PPK (Question No. 1558) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 20 March 1997: (1) Does Rust PPK have a pecuniary interest in Pacific Waste, a major property holder at Badgerys Creek; if so, was the Government aware of this interest prior to the appointment of Rust PPK to conduct the EIS for Sydney's second airport; if so, what are the details. (2) Was it publicly revealed that Rust PPK has Ltd a pecuniary association with a corporation whose value will be influenced by the site selection process for the second airport; if so, what action has he taken on this matter. Mr Sharp---The answer to the honourable to member's question is as follows: (1) Rust PPK and Pacific Waste Management have global corporate linkages but operate in Australia as separate commercial entities. They share no management personnel and no directors. Rust PPK is a wholly owned subsidiary of WMX Technologies Inc, a public company listed in the United States. Pacific Waste Management is a wholly owned subsidiary of Waste Management International BY of the Netherlands which is owned by Waste Managements International (WMI) pic, a UK listed company. WMX Technolog':::s Inc owns 80 percent of WMI pic. The Government was not aware of this interest prior to the appointment of Rust PPK to undertake the EIS. Rust PPK was selected by the Department of Transport and Regional Development following a open and competitive tender process. As part of the selection process the Department sought, and received, assurances from Rust PPK that it did not have any conflicts of interest in undertaking the EIS consultancy. (2) Rust PPK has discussed its association with Pacific Waste Management openly at meetings with community groups. The relationship has also been reported in the local media. I have no reason to believe that the relationship between Rust PPK and Pacific Waste in any way compromises the integrity of the EIS process. Heavy Vehicles: Anti-lock Braking (Question No. 1635) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: Will anti-lock braking systems be mandatory on new or existing heavy vehicles; if so, when and with what associated conditions will the requirement be introduced. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Design Rules have required AntiLock Braking systems on all new heavy prime movers designed for use in B-Doubles since 1 July 1991. Furthermore, Ministerial Council have recently agreed to legislate an in-service requirement which mandates Anti-Lock Brakes (ABS) on: all prime movers manufactured from 1 January 1990 which tow B-Double trailers; and all new and existing prime movers first used for towing B-Double trailers from 1 January 1994; and all new and existing road tank trailer combinations if at least one trailer in the vehicle combination is carrying dangerous goods in bulk. Amendments to the Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicle Standards) Regulations 1995 reflecting the above change are currently being finalised. Over the past few years, an analysis has been undertaken by the National Road Transport Commission (NRTC) on the use of ABS in other heavy vehicle applications in two stages. Stage 1 of the study was released in November 1994 followed by the more detailed Stage 2 in August 1996. The Stage 2 report, which was widely distributed for public comment in August 1996, indicated that mandating ABS may be justifiable on: three axle semi-trailers (except in road trains); . road train prime movers; and . B-double trailers, but not on other heavy vehicles. The public comment received was reviewed by the NRTC. The response to the report demonstrated that there is a considerable divergence of views over both the costs and benefits of fitting AntiLock Braking systems on heavy vehicles. There was also concern about the high prices vehicle manufacturers currently charge for fitting ABS as an option. In view of the uncertainty surrounding the net benefit of ABS from this study, there is no plan to recommend ABS be mandated on additional categories of heavy vehicles. The NRTC's approach was that, based on the current costs, the decision to install ABS should be evaluated by transport operators on a commercial basis. The NRTC's recommendation will be sent to the Ministerial Council for Road Transport for voting. Essendon Airport: Port Phillip Region Airport and Airspace Study (Question No. 1667) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: (1) Did the Port Phillip Region Airport and Airspace Study recommend that the Airport Management Advisory Committee meet to discuss changes to the number of aircraft movements at Essendon Airport. (2) Is he able to say how many times the Airport Management Advisory Committee has met since 1995. (3) How many aircraft movements have occurred in (a) 1995 and (b)1996 and what proportion of hose movements consisted of ""touch and go"" movements. (4) Do restrictions exist regarding ""touch and go"" movements at Essendon Airport; if so (a) what are they, (b) have breaches occurred and (c) what penalties are applied against aircraft operators in breach of conditions. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Port Phillip Region Airport and Airspace Study did not specifically recommend that the airport management advisory committee meet to discuss any changes to the number of aircraft movements at Essendon Airport, but the Study did make the following recommendations with regard to aircraft movements at the airport: Recommendation (14) of the Study states that the ""maximum all up weight of aircraft using the airport on an unrestricted basis be limited to 25,000 kg. The number of movements of aircraft with a maximum take-off weight exceeding 25,000 kg be determined in consultation with the Essendon Airport Consultative Committee. Operation of aircraft with take-off weight in excess of 40,000 kg not be permitted other than in exceptional circumstances. "" Recommendation (15) of the Study states that ""any proposed changes to the above arrangements at Essendon Airport be considered by the Essendon Airport Consultative Committee in the first instance, except that in the case of medical or other emergencies dispensation may be given by the Airport Manager for operations on a case by case basis."" (2) The Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) has advised the Airport Advisory Committee has not formally met since 1995. When the councils of Essendon and Keilor, which represented the local rate payers on the consultative committees, were amalgamated into the City of Moonee Valley, the Councillors were replaced by appointed Commissioners. The amalgamation of the relevant councils removed the need to consult with multiple local councils in a formal committee. Essendon Airport management wrote to the newly appointed Chief Commissioner in February 1995 extending an invitation to himself, fellow commissioners and officers to visit Essendon and continue the line of communication and consultation that was in place with the previous councils. As a result of this invitation the Commissioners and officer level staff visited the Airport, which included a presentation and tour, in March 1995. Since that time the FAC advises that it has held a series of meetings with both commissioners and officers of Moonee Valley to discuss Airport related issues. Additionally, both before and after the amalgamation process the FAC advises that it has continued to consult with representatives of the State Government with regard to activities on the Airport. While the Committee has not met on set occasions, the FAC considers that the co-operative arrangement established has enabled the discussion of issues. This has allowed the consultative forum between the representatives of the rate payers of both Moonee Valley, State interests and local airport management to continue. However, now that there are elected Councillors, the FAC has agreed to re-establish the committee formally, and has invited other nearby local councils to attend. (3) In 1995 there were 59,373 aircraft movements, while in 1996 there were 64,458 aircraft movements. A ""touch and go"" is defined as a manoeuvre whereby an aircraft lands and takes off again without coming to a stop. Separate statistics are not kept on the number of ""touch and go"" operations at Essendon. However Airservices estimates that there are on average about 10 ""touch and go's"" per week including circuit operations and aircraft transiting Essendon from another airport. (4) No restrictions are placed on ""touch and go"" operations at Essendon. However training flights that may involve ""touch and go"" are subject to a number of requirements including: Aircraft must riot be above 5700kg maximum weight and must be propeller driven. Low level circuits must not be below the published circling minima for Instrument Flights. Circuits by twin engineered aircraft are restricted to operations between 7.00 a.m. and 10.00 p.m. only. Circuits by singled engined aircraft are limited to daylight hours and operations must be for pilot endorsement or aircraft test flights only. Airservices has advised that they are not aware of any breaches of the conditions above. Essendon is a controlled aerodrome, and certain requirements have been set out under the Essendon entry in the Enroute Supplement Australia (ERSA) relating to the conduct of ""training flights"" at that aerodrome. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CAS A) advises that any contravention of requirements made under Civil Aviation Regulation (CAR) 99A, may constitute an offence for which the pilot in command of the aircraft involved may, if convicted, be subject to a fine of up to 50 penalty units ($5000). None of the requirements specified in ERSA specifically refer to ""touch and go"" operations at Essendon Airport. It should be noted that the pilot in command of an aircraft will not, in every case, necessarily be the operator of the aircraft. Under CAR 92, CASA may give directions to the safety of air navigation in respect of a particular aerodrome. CASA advises that valid direction under CAR 92 could include requirements substantially the same as those set out in the ERSA, relating to ""training flight"" at Essendon Airport. Any person, including the operator of an aircraft, who contravenes a direction given under CAR 92 may, if convicted of that offence, be subject to a fine of up to 25 penalty units ($2,500). However, it is important to note that nothing in those ""conditions"" deals explicitly with the conduct of ""touch and go"" operations. Under CAR 100, Air Traffic Control at Essendon Airport could give a specific direction to a particular aircraft relating to the conduct of, among other things, ""touch and go"" operations. Contravention of such a direction may constitute an offence, for which the pilot in command may, if convicted, be subject to a fine of 50 penalty units ($5000). Risograph Printers: Maintenance (Question No. 1674)  trative Services, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: (1) Which company has the maintenance contract for the Risograph printers in the electorate offices of Members and Senators. (2) Is the contract similar to other service contracts negotiated by his Department. (3) Has the company performed to his satisfaction. (4) Is the company required to meet performance criteria, including to respond to a call within a certain time frame; if so, (a) what are the criteria and (b) how does his Department monitor performance. (5) What is the rate of compliance with performance criteria of the company and does it compare favourably with other companies with whom his Department has service contracts. (6) Are there penalties for failure to perform; if so, what are they; if not, why not. (7) Does his Department have a mechanism for recording performance which can be used when the contract is renegotiated; if not, how can performance be assessed. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Maintenance of Risograph printers is provided by companies that also provide maintenance for photocopy equipment. Maintenance of Risograph printers is not provided under contract but on a fee for service basis. The companies concerned in the capital cities are as follows: Sydney-Danka (Tower) Melbourne-Danka Datakey Brisbane-Danka (Tower) Adelaide-Copyworld ABM Perth-CDM Business Machines (3) There has been only one occasion reported of unsatisfactory service-this involved a slow response time in Sydney. (4) Although there is no contract, companies providing services are expected to meet standard performance criteria; i.e., timeliness of response and adequacy of maintenance and repair work. Feedback is provided by staff in individual offices and is monitored by the Department. (5) Generally the maintenance service provided for Risographs has compared favourably with that provided under service contracts for other equipContractors ment. (6) Continued failure to meet reasonable performance criteria would result in arranging service by another company. (7) Yes. Second Sydney Airport, Holsworthy: Employment (Question No. 1681) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: (1) Has an assessment been made regarding the number of persons who will be employed at a second Sydney airport being constructed at Holsworthy; if so, what. (2) Has an assessment been made regarding the number of persons who will no longer be employed at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport as a result of a second Sydney airport constructed at Holsworthy; if so, what. (3) Have arrangements been proposed in regard to preference being given to those lost positions referred to in part (2) as transfer positions to Sydney's second airport at Holsworthy. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) An assessment is being made of the employment impact of a second Sydney airport at either Badgerys Creek or Holsworthy as part of the draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). (2) The draft EIS will forecast the direct and indirect future employment impact of the second Sydney airport and the existing Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and will combine these forecasts to estimate the total impact of the two airport system on employment in the Sydney region. (3) The Government will not be taking any decisions on such arrangements until the location and role of the second Sydney airport has been finalised. Austudy: Means Test (Question No. 1701) Mr Andren asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: (1) How is the Austudy Actual Means Test ""benchmark"" (a) calculated, (b) equated to the equivalent PA YE income earning family and (c) explained to applicants. (2) What has been the average (a) processing time for form 10 and form 28 review of Austudy decisions and (b) waiting period on the Actual Means Test hotline, during (i) January, (ii) February, (iii) March, (iv) April and (v) May 1997. (3) What sum will be saved by (a) increasing the age of independence from 22 to 25 years of age and (b) tightening the Austudy Actual Means Test in 1996-97. (4) What sum is administering the Austudy Actual Means Test expected to cost in 1996-97. (5) Is it a fact that there is a difference between a debt and income; if so, why is expenditure financed through a loan treated the same way as expenditure financed by earned income for the purpose of the Austudy Actual Means Test. (6) How many students who have been denied Austudy under the (a) independent rate and (b) Austudy Actual Means Test have (i) withdrawn from their studies and (ii) applied for unemployment benefits. (7) How many students have been granted Austudy in 1997 because of a marriage which occurred after the Government announced changes to the independent rate of Austudy. (8) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the Commonwealth Ombudsman's receipt of 755 complaints in relation to Austudy between 1 January 1997 and 30 April 1997, compared to 446 complaints during the same period in 1996; if so, is the Minister able to say what is the cause of the increase. (9) What steps is the Minister taking to (a) improve the level of service provided to Austudy clients and (b) ensure that students are encouraged to remain in study. (10) What methods will be used to substantiate the validity of the expenditure figures provided by applicants on their Actual Means Test forms. (11) Has the tightening of the Actual Means Test succeeded in achieving its objective of catching abusers of the system while ensuring that genuine applicants are not denied assistance; if so, what statistics can the Minister provide to substantiate the achievement. Dr Kemp--The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 1 (a) Under the Actual Means Test (AMT), a student's rate of entitlement is assessed on the basis of a family's or independent student's and/or his or her partner's combined expenditure and savings in the year of study. The actual means of a family or independent student are then compared with a cutoff point known as the 'benchmark'. The level of the benchmark depends on the individual circumstances of each applicant and their family, such as whether the student must live away from home to access education and/or the number of dependents in the family. If the actual means of an AMT family or independent student is below the benchmark applicable to the applicant's circumstances and the applicant meets all other Austudy eligibility requirements, the applicant will be eligible to receive an Austudy allowance. 1 (b) In order to use actual means in the entitlement calculation it is necessary to convert it into a ""taxable income equivalent"" or what is known as the ""Equivalent Family Income"" (EFI). This is because actual means is equivalent only to the after-tax income of a PA YE family or independent student. The Department calculates the EFI of a family's or independent student's actual means by adjusting for Family Payment and adding back tax. The EFI determines the entitlement amount of an AMT client in the same way that the ""Adjusted Family Income"" determines the entitlement of a non-AMT client. The formula for calculating the after-tax income of a parent, partner or independent student is contained under Regulation 12M of the Austudy Regulations. 1 (c) The Department supplies information products about Austudy and the Actual Means Test nationally to Austudy applicants. The Actual Means Test Hotline [1800 649-879] also provides help to applicants who require additional assistance on any aspect of the Actual Means Test, including guidance in understanding the benchmark. Applicants may also request an explanation of the Department's calculations by writing to the Department. 2 (a) No information is held by.the Department on the average processing period for reviews. Review requests which are currently being received will be commenced within 3-4 weeks. 2 (b) The average waiting period for the Actual Means Test Hotline in 1997 was: (i) January, 24 minutes; (ii) February,S minutes and 20 seconds; (ii) March, 11 seconds; (iv) April, 6 seconds; and (v) May, 6 seconds. If a caller is still waiting after 6 seconds, the caller is provided with the option of obtaining information from a series of pre-recorded messages. 3 (a) In 1996-97, total savings from the 1996 Budget Measure ""Raise the Age of Independence for Austudy"" were estimated to be $28.3 million (this was the half year effect of this measure which did not come into operation until 1 January 1997). The Government subsequently reviewed this decision and decided that all students would gain independent status at age 25 if they did not qualify earlier on other grounds. It is estimated that this amendment will reduce the savings accrued from that Budget measure by about $4.5 million to $23.8 million in 1996-97. 3 (b) Total savings in 1996-97 from the 1996 Budget Measure ""Tighten the Austudy Actual Means Test"" are estimated to be $27.65 million. (4) There are two components to the running costs of the Austudy AMT: the administration of the AMT from National Office which includes salaries for assessor, Hotline and support staff, computer and telephone equipment, production of AMT information products and property operating expenses. Total running costs for these are approximately $3.2 million in 1996-97; and running costs for the administration of the AMT outside of National Office are subsumed within overall running costs of the Student Assistance Centre network, including the Austudy income and assets tests. It is therefore not possible to provide separate data on running costs of the AMT in the network. Running costs for 1996-97 of the Student Assistance Centre network total $55.7 million. It should be noted that this figure includes the one-off cost of voluntary redundancies in 1996-97. (5) Under the AMT, all expenditure and savings except those related to the main business activity of the family are included in a family's actual means. The inclusion of estimates for both savings and expenditure for the year of study for an AMT family makes it possible for Austudy eligibility to be assessed on a similar basis as far as possible as that of a Pay As You Earn family. Personal loans are treated in two ways for the purposes of the AMT: (i) the outlay or purchase price funded by loans for the principal family home, other real estate expenditure and motor vehicles is not required to be reported as estimated expenditure in the year of applying for Austudy, although repayments of principal and interest in the year of study for these items are to be included as expenditure; and (ii) the outlay or purchase priced funded by loans for all other items is included as estimated expenditure, whilst the repayments of principal and interest for these items are not required to be reported as expenditure. (6) The Department does not maintain data on students who are ineligible for Austudy, who subsequently withdraw from a course or who apply for unemployment benefits. (7) The Department does not have the information to answer this question. However, the number of beneficiaries aged between 22 and 25 years in receipt of the Austudy Independent Rate due to marriage was 2,341 as at 30 April 1997, representing an increase of 12 or 0.5 per cent from 2,329 in the corresponding period in 1996. (8) The Department is aware of the increase in complaints received by the Commonwealth Ombudsman from January to April 1997 compared to the same period in 1996. No determinations have yet been made by the Ombudsman as a result of these complaints. 9 (a) From 1 July 1997, the delivery of student assistance will become the responsibility of Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency. The Agency will have a clear focus on the delivery of better and more efficient Commonwealth services to customers, and will be considering ways in which service to all of its customers can be improved. Several initiatives have already commenced in anticipation of the transfer of student assistance to the Agency. These include: a significant expansion in the number of outlets from which information about student assistance schemes may be obtained; an examination of the scope for developing improved telephone services; and the identification of opportunities for streamlined administrative arrangements which are presented through bringing together the delivery of the major Commonwealth income support programs under a single Agency umbrella. While clients will notice immediate improvement in some areas of service, significant enhancements to the full range of Austudy services are expected in the longer term. 9 (b) The Government is committed to ensuring that students have access to an efficient student assistance delivery service, under which their applications for assistance are dealt with fairly and quickly and those who are eligible receive their entitlement with the minimum delay possible. (10) The Minister announced in February this year that there would be an enhanced compliance strategy for the Actual Means Test. In response to this announcement a comprehensive compliance plan has been developed within the Department. The AMT Compliance Section commenced operation with 12 staff in May 1997. Staff have been recruited with a wide range of professional expertise and experience including: accounting, fraud control, information systems, program knowledge and management skills. An AMT Compliance Working Group has been established to oversee the further development and implementation of the strategy. The detailed elements of the compliance strategy must remain confidential, for obvious reasons. It is, however, designed to specifically target clients who may have misrepresented their circumstances in order to obtain a level of Austudy benefit to which they may not be entitled. The Department also provides a review mechanism for applicants who wish to contest an initial assessment decision. Aust Equities Int.

Equities The all ordinaries index returns were: (2) The domestic portfolio outperformed in 92-93 and 93-94. The international portfolio outperformed in 92-93 and 94-95. Member for Oxley: Protection Services (Question No. 1727) Mrs Crosio asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 15 May 1997: (1) What sum has the Commonwealth spent on having members of the Australian Federal Police (AFP), or other Commonwealth security services, accompany the Member for Oxley and provide for her personal protection since 2 March 1996. (2) Is a member of the AFP, or any other Commonwealth security service, permanently detached to provide protection for the Member for Oxley. (3) How many members of the AFP, or any other Commonwealth security service, were detached to provide protection for the Member for Oxley during her recent public speaking tours of (a) Western Australia and (b) Tasmania, and what was the cost of providing this protection. (4) What sum has the Commonwealth spent on having members of the AFP, or other Commonwealth security services, accompany the Prime Minister and provide for his personal protection since 2 March 1996. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: 1-3. Security agencies and police services closely monitor threats and security incidents directed against members of parliament, and implement prudent security measures as appropriate. A number of threats and incidents have been directed against the Member for Oxley, and certain security measures have been implemented as a result. In line with long established practice, I do not propose to provide details of specific security measures. 4. Again, in line with long established practice, I do not propose to provide details of specific security arrangements for the Prime Minister. 92-93 93-94 94-95 95-96 9.6% 19.7% 4.7% 12.6% 26.8% 1.1% 10.3% 4.6% 92-93 93-94 94-95 95-96 9.1% 15.7% 5.0% ]3.4% Brisbane Freedom Wall: Replacement Plaques (Question No. 1748) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 26 May 1997: (1) What is the contract price for replacement of plaques at the Brisbane Freedom Wall. (2) Was the contract put out to tender; if not, why not. (3) Which individuals or organisations provided advice that Arrow Foundry should be selected. (4) Was advice provided on the appropriate technology or company for the work. (5) What aspects of the cast metal process of Arrow Foundry were deemed superior to the rolled plate process of locally owned, Queensland based firms. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: 1. The contract price for the production and supply of replacement plaques and associated fittings at the National Australia Remembers Freedom Wall is $838,537. 2. The decision to proceed to contract without a tender process was based on the following considerations: the assessed difficulty in obtaining offers that would comply with the demanding specifications of this very specialised work; the public demand for a remedy to the situation as early as possible; the paucity of suppliers believed to be able to meet the qualification requirements for this work; the special nature of the supplies; the Office of Australian War Graves' knowledge and experience of the bronze commemorative industry and those companies associated with that industry; and the need to secure a high assurance of success in delivering the high quality durable outcome necessary to remedy the prevailing unsatisfactory situation at the Freedom Wall. 3. The Office of Australian War Graves provided the advice on which the decision was taken to engage Arrow Bronze to supply these products. 4. Advice was provided through the course of an evaluation of the existing brass plaques mounted on the Freedom Wall, and assessment of all available options. In determining the optimum solution my Department considered the strong public demand for a durable high quality product, that would more than compensate for deficiencies and dissatisfaction associated with the original plaques. The Office of Australian War Graves recommended that engraved bronze provided the best available solution. On the basis of its extensive experience of the bronze commemorative industry, the Office of Australian War Graves concluded that Arrow Bronze was the company most able to deliver the service required. 5. Professional advice available to the Office of Australian War Graves suggested strongly that cast bronze, commonly used in commemorative plaques throughout the world, exhibits properties of durability and resistance to tarnishing, superior to any other bronze product applicable to that purpose. Oyster Leases: Georges River (Question No. 1774) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister representing the Minister for Resources and Energy, upon notice, on 29 May 1997: (1) Is the Minister able to say what effect pollution of the Georges River in Sydney has had on the oyster industry in New South Wales. (2) How may oyster leases have been closed on the river and what has been the effective loss to the economy as a result of their closure. (3) What has been the loss to Australia's export market of the closure of the oyster leases on the Georges River. Mr Anderson-The Minister for Resources and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Pollution of the Georges River has had a devastating effect on the local oyster industry. This effect has manifested itself in two ways. Firstly, the negative public perception of the quality of NSW oysters has impacted on sales of oysters generally in the state, regardless of source. Sales of oysters from South Australia and Tasmania have thus also been affected. No quantitative data is available in regard to lost sales. Secondly, the Georges River industry infrastructure has in the past been a major market for immature oysters from other estuaries. The loss of this market is worth around $1.5 million per annum. (2) Approximately 70 ha of leased area, or 45 leases, representing 12 oyster farming businesses have been affected by the pollution and removed from production. This area, had it still been in production, would have represented approximately $3.5 million worth of production value to the industry. (3) Nil. All oysters from the Georges River were sold on the domestic market. I would like to emphasise that this issue, and the regulation and monitoring of oyster growing in NSW generally, is the responsibility of the NSW state government. ANSTO, Nuclear Facility Lucas Heights: Incident (Question No. 1796) Mr Martyn Evans asked the Minister for Science and Technology, upon notice, on 4 June 1997: (1) Did an incident occur at the ANSTO nuclear facility at Lucas Heights on 28 May 1997; if so, at what time (a) did it occur, (b)was it discovered, (c) was the response team notified and (d) did the response team arrive at the site. (2) What material was being moved when the incident occurred and what material was leaked from the vessel into the environment. (3) What was the highest level of radiation detected in the area of the incident. (4) Did (a) persons walk along or (b) cars drive through the area after incident; if so, were shoes or tyres tested for radioactivity; if so, what was the result; if not, why not. (5) Was the area closed immediately; if not, why not. (6) Is residual radioactivity present on the site of the incident. (7) Was the local council notified of the incident; if so, (a) when and (b) was the notification made in accordance with the agreed procedures; if not, why not. (8) Was the movement of the material in accordance with all approved safety procedures. (9) Will the procedures be reviewed as a result of the incident. Mr MCGauran-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) and (b) ANSTO undertook a routine transfer of spent fuel elements between two spent fuel facililties at Lucas Heights over the period 28 May. Early on 28 May, monitoring by an ANSTO safety officer, who was providing routine safety cover for the activity, determined that a small quantity of water, slightly contaminated with radioactivity, had dripped onto internal ANSTO roadways. (c) and (d) The operation was stopped immediately, other ANSTO safety officers were called, and they arrived within minutes. (2) The materials were as described above. The contamination was promptly removed. It did not spread into the environment. (3) The highest activity measured directly on the roadway was 600 Becqurels per cm 2, which is comparable with the activity of the mantle on common camping gas lanterns. (4) (a) and (b) Shoes and vehicle tyres of people who had used the roads after the incident were checked, as were workers in the area. These checks showed no contamination as the droplets had dried and had been firmly adsorbed by the road surface. (5) After verification that the contamination could not be taken up by shoes or car tyres, the assessment was made that there was no radiological 27hazard involved and hence no radiation safety reason to close the roads. The roads concerned were closed for several hours, however, to protect the inspecting staff from traffic while the roads were inspected and all spots of contamination identified and removed. (6) No. The contamination was completely removed. (7) (a) Yes, on 30 May, once all the details were known. (b) The agreement with the Sutherland Shire Council is that ANSTO will notify it promptly of any incident which requires to be notified to relevant State authorities or which might cause public concern. The basis for such notification is whether any incident has the potential for off-site consequences. This incident involved no radiological impact and, hence, no possibility for public health impact. Accordingly, there was no requirement under the agreement for ANSTO to advise the Council of the incident. ANSTO did so as a matter of courtesy. (8) ANSTO is reviewing the causes of the incident to determine this. (9) Yes, this is in progess.",127
